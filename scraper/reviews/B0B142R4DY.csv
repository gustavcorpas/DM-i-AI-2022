5,So had to watch some YouTube videos to figure out how to get the characters to “move in” or “move to” my island but now they’re residents! Not all 81 of course lol but they all scanned and they all camp like they should! I have a very happy kid! I’m dolling them out slowly in our school prizes and put some up for our Christmas advent prize calendar that’s separate from our religious one! Some might end up in his stocking as well; who knows! There’s a ton of them lol
5,Has advertise works for me!
5,Came exactly as described. Each one works and adds a lot of fun to Animal Crossing! We have New Horizons and it doesn't have some of the new characters like Ione but it's a really great selection especially for the price! It has popular characters like Lucky Meringue and Coco.
5,I was super skeptical at first but given the free return/refund I had nothing to lose. Worse case scenario I get my money back. To my surprise they worked great!
5,i’ve used 6 of these mini amiibo cards so far and it has gone well! i love the characters i chose but will have many i won’t use unfortunately. :( that is the only downside for me. packaged well i like that they include a clear box for all of them.
5,My daughter is obsessed with this game. She has been hunting for Maple the bear for months. I saw she was in this pack and made my little girl’s birthday wish come true. They work great. Haven’t had a problem with any of them so far.
5,Emfunciona Perfecto. Las compre para mi hija y ya tiene en su isla todos los personajes que invito.
5,they work perfectly! great value and I love that they're mini
5,Came as described. Daughter loves them!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I haven’t tried all of the cards yet but the ones I have tried worked great! I especially love the cards that have trucks because they leave behind home decor items that can be purchased (with bells of course)! Would definitely buy again :)
5,
5,Definitely worth it!
5,Tried a bit over half the cards so far and am super pleased. No duds yet and I don't expect to have issues considering the excellent quality. Well worth the money and makes the game a LOT more fun for villager hunters.  Deifinitely recommended. Incredible value!
5,I was worried they wouldn't work at first but I was happily proven wrong! Got a bunch of nice villagers and the amiibo works!
5,Just want my daughter wanted! There are so many cute characters and the price and shipping were amazing!
5,Great value and fast delivery
5,I received everything in good condition and nothing missing. Would shop here again.
5,I tested them all and they work great. What a fun way to switch up villagers!
5,These minis are seriously the cutest thing I've ever seen. They work perfectly.
5,Was nervous to purchase because there were no reviews. But its exactly as advertised! Ive used several amiibo cards and they all have worked so far!
1,Item came missing a character that is listed and shown. Instead we needed up with a duplicate. I would like to receive the missing character and I would change this to 5 stars.
5,Got it as a gift for granddaughter.
5,They are great in animal crossing new leaf.
5,These are quite small. No more than an inch each.  All were accounted for.  Good quality material and printing. They arrived in a clear plastic bag  in a small plastic box.  They were not organized in any particular way  just a pile.  They work as described.
4,Earlier I said we didn't get all 80 cards but after a recount we are only missing one. (Named Kidd)
5,I ordered this for my daughter and she loves them! They worked perfectly! She has hours of fun inviting them to Harv's Island and getting their posters. She got her dream villagers from this and she doesn't regret it! They arrived quickly that expected. I haven't gotten any complaints from her. I thought about buying a book for display but she loves it in a box container! Thank you for providing such a good product!
