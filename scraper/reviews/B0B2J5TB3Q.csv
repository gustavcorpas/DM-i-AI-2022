5,I really do like this watch and all of its features including the gps. It works well with my Samsung Galaxy phone which is a couple of years old. I did want this in large part for the Sleep feature and that is very sensitive. You have to have it in a specific spot and a specific tightness every night. Otherwise great watch
4,This is my third Galaxy Watch.  I very much like the watch.  It now has a compass and the health features are improved.The description of the watch said it came with a gray wrist band but it is white.  Not cool for a guy.Watch -- great.  Wrist Band - disappointing.
3,This new Galaxy Watch 5 comes in 40mm or 44mm versions and in so many ways it is VERY similar to the Watch 4.  This year Samsung is NOT releasing a ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù version of the Galaxy Watch instead they have a regular Watch 5 and a Watch 5 Pro.  NEITHER version has a rotating bezel like the Watch 4 Classic had which is a huge disappointment to me.  I really liked the rotating bezel and not even having any models with that option this year is frustrating.--UPGRADES from Watch 4 to Watch 5:-Bigger battery:  Watch 5 has 410 mAh battery Watch 4 had 361 mAh battery-Gorilla Glass Sapphire/ Shape of Back:  This glass should be slightly more scratch resistant and the bottom of the watch sits a little flatter against your skin.-Software additions:  Improved sleep tracking features updated version of OS (WearOS 3.5 with OneUI 4.5)That‚Äôs really it.  Everything else about the hardware from the display to the processor RAM speakers everything is basically the same as the Watch 4.  It just has slightly more scratch resistant glass a shape that sits flatter on your wrist and a bigger battery.  None of these things are even very noticeable and so overall this must be the smallest upgrade I‚Äôve EVER seen in a smart watch.  There are some slightly more advanced sleep-tracking features in the software but still this is barely an upgrade at all over the regular Watch 4.  I can‚Äôt recommend upgrading to this Watch 5 if you have the Watch 4 and if you have the Watch 4 Classic then I would consider this Watch 5 a significant DOWNGRADE because you would absolutely miss the rotating bezel in the Watch 4 Classic.So if you don‚Äôt own a smart watch at all maybe you could consider getting this but even then you would probably be better off buying a Watch 4 because it will be less expensive.  I honestly can‚Äôt think of any situation in which I would recommend buying this even though there is really nothing wrong with it; it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be worth paying more for this if you have or can get a Watch 4.  I will still test it out and see if I notice anything else over time but so far this is very disappointing.  Maybe the more advanced sleep-tracking data will impress me over time?  Stick with the Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic in my opinion.
5,I went from a fit bit versa to this watch and I have a Samsung 21 phone and I really like how much better it works with my phone.
4,Overall I really like this watch. This is my first Samsung watch so I can't compare it to the previous model but I can tell you it is a huge upgrade from the very small Fitbit I had. It would get 5 stars from me EXCEPT Samsung does not support the Nutracheck app which is very disappointing. Battery life is only good for about 24 hours but it does a lot. I'm not sure how this compares to similar watches.
4,I upgraded to this since my Galaxy Active 2 decided to give up the ghost a mere week and a half before the 5 released (talk about timing). I really like the sleep tracking and the additional biometrics (though I still can't figure out how to do blood pressure); step counting also seems more accurate. Really bummed though that it comes with a USB C (the 2 was a USB A) with no advanced warning and no plug (I've had to order one...currently piggy backing on the charger for another USB C device). Generally pleased though.
4,I would recommend this watch to my closest cousin in law. (I've cried for her)
4,I use it for everything talking texting sleep tracking etc. Just don't like that I have to have my phone right with me to use it unless I get one that has its own subscription.
5,My first smartwatch and I love it. I had trouble checking out at Samsung's website so I purchased through amazon instead. Faster delivery lower priced warranty product offered. Pretty solid build.
5,This is my very first smartwatch and I'm so happy I went with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5.  This is ashort-term review but so far so good.  I've worn my watch to the gym twice and I love the feedback I receive when I'm working out and it's very comfortable.  I like the fact that I can make so many changes from the home screen items I can add and remove and alerts I can set.  My watch also allowed me to download Google Assistant which was a snap.  Since this is my first smartwatch I do not have another smartwatch to compare the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 to but the watch is awesome.  Yes I'm bringing awesome back.
5,The watch was buggy as originally received a patch fixed a number of these and I am getting about 68 hours on a charge. This is a great watch for those of us with visual impairment.
5,Went from a 4 to a 5. Watch is great. Display features etc are what I wanted as I am a senior trying to monitor my health. Improvement over the 4. But again battery life is an issue. Need to pick a time to recharge EVERY day. Wish Samsung could have found a better battery.
5,I really like it it helps me keep track of my heart rate
4,This is a epic smart watch. I am very pleased.  The only reason why I give it 4 stars vs 5 is the water resistance is not what I was hoping for. I am a swimmer and hoped to wear during exercise.  After a ton of research swimming with the watch was highly discouraged Despite the water lock function. Just he warned if you are a swimmer
5,Works great. Fast delivery.
5,Is a nice watch like all the Samsung but Amazon description says it takes blood pressure but it dont.
5,I really enjoy my watch except I do not like how I'm to charge it.  It should have come with a charger that was separate from my phone
4,El producto me encanta el √∫nico problema es que compre el producto en preventa y no me lleg√≥ el cargador d√∫o que viene de regalo por la compra necesitaba mucho ese cargador.
4,Too difficult to work
5,First smartwatch I have had and very pleased.  Works great.
5,Works as advertised.  She likes all the features and the GPS shows distance walked sooner than my galaxy watch 4. We walk together but she walks farther and faster. :)
5,Beautiful
4,It's OK I mean the battery sucks!!!! That defers me alot. It's not real easy to navigate I don't think. But it could be because I'm old lol
5,I like it a lot.  Battery seems meh but that's the trade off I get for needing a smaller watch for my small wrists. I'm not going to use it for sleep so I'm not concerned about it lasting 24+ hours before charging.  Screen looks nice works great I dig it.
5,Beautiful üòç
5,Battery life is my only issue
5,I felt for the money I couldn't justify so I sent it back
5,Muy bueno
4,Didn't like the idea that it didn't offer you a choice of watch band size.
5,
5,Great Watch I love that I can customize it :)
3,It's a definite upgrade compared to my Fitbit Versa 3.  But the step counter only starts working after you take 10+ steps...what's up with that?Edit: It's not worth the price. The longer I have it the more issues I come across. I have the heart rate set to measure continuously ever so often it will get stuck at a random heart rate and take a few minutes for it to catch up. I took it off wiped down the heart rate monitor still stuck.
3,The battery life is horrible  even with tweaks  it lasts one day before needing charged. Setting up Google Assisistant was painful and finding a smart scale that connected directly to Samsung Health is another issue.  It is very close to my Fitbit heart rate and steps so it seems comparable.  Be advised that this watch does NOT come with the REQUIRED USB C adapter for charging.
3,Overall I like the watch. Battery life is just not enough.  Charging nightly
3,I was getting a full 48 hours of battery life after I tweaked it and turned things off that I dont use. All of the sudden now I'm getting less then 24 hours. I put it on just before bed and it is dead by 5:30 the following day. I used to get 3 full days with my galaxy active 2.
3,Battery for the price! Recharge completely have to start all over as if you just got the watch.  Lasted one day?!  No blood pressure ck.  Have a less expensive watch works better. For me its not easy to use.  I'm checking on return bc for the $ I'm not thrilled.  I am not hard to please but it's not worth the price.  Going back to other watch.
2,I had a Galaxy Active 2 watch.  A year ago the Samsung Health App stopped displaying your heart rate over time.  Instead they give you a bar graph that is specifically designed to have no useful information.  The watch still displayed a plot of your heart rate since mid-night and there is an App that can transfer your Heart Rate data to Google and Google will display it.For the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 they have totally removed the collection of heart rate data.  You can't even use Google to display it.Literally the only way to monitor your heart rate over time is to check every few minutes and write it down.  Instead of giving you your heart rate plot they give you a bar graph the looks almost the same when you are sleeping as working out.  Intentionally of no value what so ever.
1,I purchased Samsung Gear S in 2014. It had issues with GPS. I purchased Samsung Galaxy watch in 2019. I was hoping that the GPS works better. My 10km run was always 10.4km then after software updates it became 9.7 constantly every day. The run start and end at the same location distance precisely measured. GPS has lock when we start. Flat earth with no buildings/mountains within 20 km of run. Worn on left hand. High Location accuracy set. So after buying Galaxy watch 5 (6 models later) they have the same issue with GPS. See attached. I ran 3 days in a row. 1 day it measures 9.7km GPS avail all the time then 10.0km then yesterday suddenly the GPS missed the first 7km of running completely. I have lost trust in Samsung. If they cant have this fixed after 8 years they will never have it fixed. Garmin Polar and many others have GPS working fine for many years. Runners that run with me all have Garmin and they just consistently correct. I liked Samsung because I like to play with technology but I am now done with playing and struggling to make a toy do a real job. So if you want to buy a toy with some features this is very nice despite the fact that they make you believe the bezel is touch sensitive. It is not. If you want a watch to train with as well know that you have to buy another training watch.
1,I don't buy Samsung anymore too many issues with their attempt at locking me into a small ecosystem when the entire internet of things exists beyond it's hollow walls.That said I did a lot of research and to my dismay Samsung was the clear winner in hardware for a smart watch. There was simply no competition. More sensors that work better in a lighter thinner build with great battery life.But then there's the Samsung problem software. Actually it's hard to call anything they do anything but bloatware. Gpay? Kind of. PayPal? Two hours an can't get it to work in gpay or Samsung pay. Assistant? Bixby or if you spend an hour or two sort of Google assistant. But I have yet to get voice activation to work. Also the button to summon Samsung pay is the only hardware button the watch doesn't let you repurpose to another function. It's always there and you can't remove it.In the end some pretty basic functionality is walled off or at least booby trapped and weighed down to near non functionality. Just there enough to claim in the specs that it is supported. But it isn't. Not really. Bixby is supported. Google assistant is loosely tolerated and nothing else exists. PayPal isn't even in the Samsung pay menu even though Samsung's website claims it is.I will not be keeping this pile of... Well I'm sure that word won't be allowed here. Anyways great hardware. Too bad it's Samsung.  Might have been decent otherwise.
2,The huge annoying blackness around the bezel that makes part of the screen unusable is still there. I just went from a galaxy watch 3 to 5 and hoped it would be reduced or eliminated but no. Apple watch has had an entire viewable screen for years. Why samsung must we not have all the screen we paid for.
1,BUYER BEWARE! Battery is trash.I put this on at 1 today. At 3:40 the battery was at 38%. At 5:11 the battery was zero.I walked 15 minutes but the rest of the time I was at my desk working.Also when you pay more for LTE you still have to enroll in cell service for 10 bucks a month to use it.I wish I had just bought a fit bit.If I could give zero stars I would.I'm so mad I threw away the box this came in because I feel robbed. Unbelievable.
2,The battery doesn't last more than 24hrs. Highly disappointed.
1,Seems nice if you can get it to charge. Half the time you place it on the charger only to come back and find that is lost more charge and has some illegible red message that vanishes when you pick up the watch.  I'd still be using my Gear 3s if the buttons had not quit functioning. 0 of 10 do not recommend.Yes I'm using the crappy flat puck charger that came with no power plug.
1,Great watch except would not stay charged fro 24 hours  in spite of Samsung claiming it had improved battery life. I cant use a watch that has to be on charge every 8-9 hours
1,I wasn't able to connect to the app on the iphone 11 and iphone 13 pro max. I tried restarting the watch Bluetooth and the phone. I will be returning this watch sadly.
1,Who sells / buys a chargeable device charger not included.
5,Pre-ordered through my phone carrier. Have used it a while and LOVE IT!BEZEL: I like the digital! There's a learning curve to not rotate too quickly so not to overshoot but it works well and like the physical bezel it clicks/pauses as it changes panels. This helps to prevent overshooting while scrolling.... I can understand potential MAYBEs leading to discontinuing physical bezel: 1. Maybe most (me included) instinctively touch/swipe more than rotate bezel; out of habit of tech screens requiring touch/swipes. 2. Maybe Samsung wanted updated style. IMO physical bezel has (dated hence classic) 1980s Swatch Watch look. 3. Maybe overall sell of physical bezel (though beloved by many) wasn't enough to keep it around. 4. Maybe it didn't make the cut if ditching it somehow helped battery performance screen size reduced manufacturing/replacement cost etc. ... Digital bezel one Con is poor responsiveness to wet/sweaty finger. .... Truthfully I haven't used physical bezel and I wouldn't choose it based on the1980s look so I can't attest to its greatness. .... I read the GW5 digital bezel is improved maybe naysayers should try it.BATTERY/CHARGING: Averaging 2-2.5+ days w/ casual use e.g. daily texts calls (I'm using LTE) occasional music shake to wake and evening workouts/health app use. No extreme notifications no Display on Always etc.  Average time includes sleeping w/ it to check out feature. (I like it a lot! Helps awareness of need/goal to sleep more; Sleep blood oxygen reading is a bonus! It's comfortable but at times I 'sense' the watch & wake to reposition arm. Won't con't wear while sleeping; feel need to have it off at some point for skin to breathe) ..... Almost went for GW4 since cheaper/same hardware but GW5 longer battery life sapphire glass & future temperature monitoring made it a no brainer..... To note I read isn't good for smart watch/phone batteries to do long charge times (using device w/ low battery causes battery to strain & diminish lifespan) so I'm mostly charging at 60-50%. Considered since I'd charge daily may as well buy GW4 but ELECTING to charge & NEEDING to charge aren't the same; Imagined being on plane an excursion or just mid-day w/ dead battery.... Anyway charging is incredibly fast (using USB C cable - came free w/ pre-order). Begin while getting ready for work & fully charged long before I'm finished (like 30 mins). Once (to test battery) wore it 2 days and 10+ hours had 20+% battery remaining; It fully charged in ~45 mins though charger estimated an hour.INCLUDED ONE BAND: M/L comes w/ 44mm. I have average female wrist wear on last hole. Initially thought needed one more hole for tighter fit however it's fine b/c the end of strap loops inside band which takes up slack & gives snugger fit. Because sensor is curved the strap (where it attaches to face) sits high which I like because allows air to skin (doesn't get hot/sweaty) .... (Weird to say/explain but curved sensor feels good - go figure.)LOVING IT!  I don't get the physical bezel hype but if it was Samsung's signature feature I feel the digital is a good (updated) stand-in. Perhaps a raised edge on all models to complement digital bezel or a symbol can be used as signature to distinguish from other round face smart watches. Many things I've liked/loved were discontinued due to advancements innovations. One reason I chose smart watch is to stay updated in tech savvy world. I was once a smart watch naysayer (thought just get a Fitbit) but owning bonafide smart watch has good benefits (for me). Not to mention they've evolved since their beginning .... Onwards!... Guess it's out with the old in with the innovated?... Just saying......
5,There's very little difference in the watch 5 and watch 4. I've had both 44mm models so I will state some of the very few differences between the two. The "Unless" part in my title is obviously about battery life. The battery life on the Watch 5 is no doubt better than the Watch 4. I'm speaking on the 44mm models. My wife has the 40mm Watch 4 and battery life isn't very good on it so I would assume the 40mm Watch 5 would also have better battery life although it might not be that much better. I don't know because I don't have a 40mm Watch 5. On my Watch 5 I don't have any complaints on battery life. It's not going to last you a week or nothing unless maybe you disable most features. I got the LTE/BT/Wifi model and I take it off the charger around 10pm. I wear it all night to track sleep and wake up with a little over 90% left. It's usually around 92 to 93%. That's with bedtime mode on though still it suits me and is better than the Watch 4. Then after I wake up I throw it back on the charger and it's charged by the time I'm ready to leave. I probably wouldn't even have to charge of a morning I just like leaving the house on 100%. With the Watch 4 in the exact same scenario I would wake up with around 79% to 84% battery left. I also leave off snore and blood oxygen tracking while asleep. Still battery life on the Watch 5 44mm model absolutely has better battery life than the Watch 4 44mm model. Another thing that's better on the Watch 5 than the Watch 4 is charging. Watch 5 has USB C to USB C faster charging. It charges faster than the Watch 4. I also prefer the way the Watch 5 sits on my wrist better than the Watch 4.I don't like that it has a skin temperature sensor that does nothing because it's not activated at the moment and may even only work if you pair it to a Samsung phone because once again unless you have the know-how unless you pair your watch to a Samsung phone you'll lose BP monitoring and EKG's. Although there are ways around that if you research. It's still ridiculous that Samsung holds features back unless you use it with a Samsung phone. Kind of makes me more interested in the Pixel watch that'll be coming out next month. Bottom line is the Watch 5 is a good watch but not worth the upgrade if you already have the Watch 4 and missed all the pre-order deals. There's always Black Friday and Christmas. I'm sure there will be plenty deals to be had. Watch 5 has different colors sits on the wrist better better battery life and charges faster. I can't include the temperature sensor because it's currently not activated and no telling when it will be or if it'll be yet another feature only for Samsung phone users. Oh yeah one more thing it's "supposed" to have a sapphire type watch face. That's my review. Currently I'm enjoying my Watch 5 but that could change after I watch reviews about the Pixel watch. Oh yeah one more thing. Music sounds pretty loud for a watch. Voice calls seem kind of low. Real low. I'm sure the speakers on both Watch 4 and 5 are basically the same. I'm not sure if it's a bug or what. When I ask Google Assistant a question it's loud and clear. Same with music. But with voice calls her ready to turn down the TV or if you're in the car roll up the windows and turn down the fan. It took Samsung basically 8 months to enable the Google Assistant. I'm hoping it doesn't take that long with the skin temp sensor and that it isn't a feature only Samsung users can take advantage of.If you already have the Watch 4 then skip the Watch 5 and wait to see what the Pixel watch is going to be like. If you don't like it then I'm sure there'll be plenty of deals to be had closer to the holidays. Don't pay full price if you already have the Watch 4.
4,I upgraded from the Galaxy 2 watch -- my old one just stopped sleep tracking all of a sudden and this was available 4 days later -- so I jumped to the 5 rather than the 4.  While the features are certainly more elaborate (EKG body composition etc) I'm not getting the same battery life with this one as I did with the 2.  When I charged my 2 model in the morning it was usually at 79% after wearing it for a full day; this watch is about 60% with the same wear -- and  that's a big difference. I have the same apps on the new watch as I did on the old so I expected the same or better battery life.  It charges just as quickly and the sleep app is a lot better.
5,My Ticwatch Pro battery died after 3 great years of service I really loved that phone watch. Well Verizon had this Samsung 5 watch in stock so I snapped it up and have had it a week.So far: It is waterproof. I swim a mile in a lap pool every other day and the watch is fine with it.Compared to the TicWatch Pro: Basically it's the same except it charges much faster and the charger is of a very convenient design so you can easily plop it on the charger in the dark. Charging the TicWatch Pro is a finicky affair and I went thru 3 chargers in 3 years.I can't comment on the zillion features since I only use timers alarms step counter the phone and of course the date and time and weather.
3,Traded in my Fitbit Sense after almost two years of use. Now after using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 for a month I am ready to buy another Fitbit Sense (2).
3,Samsung was one of the 1st to have a phone that covered the entire display even went around the edges. So my question is why on something as small as a watch would you not use the whole display? I literally hate the bezel around the outside of the display on the Galaxy Watch 5. See picture. The Bezel takes 1/4 of the screen that is blank. Haven't decided yet if I will send it back? Come on Samsung. What a let down. For reference I previously had a Huawei for 6 years that was great and did cover the entire display. Very disappointing Samsung.
5,First off the battery life issue has been resolved. Way better battery life than the previous one gets through a day with plenty of battery life to spare. I don't wear it to sleep just going about my day from when I wake up to when I get home from work and always have at least 70% battery left. No battery saver needed! Also that annoying constant voicemail notice is finally gone. So happy about that. Overall skip the 4 or if you have it definitely upgrade.
2,I really wanted to like this watch. I was wearing my husband's garmin watch while waiting on my watch to arrive and the battery life was so much better and the step count seemed more accurate. The Samsung watch doesn't count my steps no matter what I try. Turning it off and on turning on GPS and doing the typical wrist movement didn't do anything. I have been walking around in my house all morning but I'm still at 0 steps which definitely can't be true. I'll give the watch a few more days but will most likely return it and get myself a garmin watch.
2,I had a Samsung gear S3 (Tizian OS) from 2016 that I still miss and I think the rotating bezel should have been kept.Pros:- Lots of Apps on WearOS (as it's a google OS)- Great sensors (blood pressure oxygen level ECG body composition ...etc.)Cons:- The Touch bezel is just a joke not even close to the mechanical rotating one.(really you can use the physical bezel even without looking at the watch just by felling it thus snoozing or closing appointment notifications or an alarms easily)- Battery life sucks not even one full day you have to try and extend the life by power saving and turning the screen off topping-up mid day ....etc.   the gear S3 had almost 3 days of battery life.- Samsung Health monitoring App to use ECG and blood pressure is not available in many countries and even not working properly in some of the countries that have it. (many articles and workarounds you can find on the net)- For the 44mm watch I prefer a bigger strap rather than the 20mm one. (it may be suitable for the 40mm but seems small to my liking for the bigger watches)
1,I got this directly from Samsung and it was delivered on the 23rd of August so it actually arrived early. I have a Watch 4 already and this is almost identical. Although the battery is supposed to be bigger it lasts about the same as the Watch 4. Maybe in the future when the temperature sensor is being used there will be a difference but at the moment it is about the same. My issue is that my watch arrived in the box without a strap it was just the watch body the charging puck and some documentation. I called Samsung "support" and they all agreed that it should have come with a strap but after calling 3 times being transferred to every department in the company back and forth and being placed on hold for over an hour I give up. I could care less about the strap but imagine if you have a problem with the watch itself. You can pretty much give up on getting any type of support from Samsung. Luckily I still have time to return it and buy a watch from someone like Apple that actually supports its products. I purchased this along with a Flip 4 so I guess I'll return that too and try an iPhone - don't really want to do that but a product is worthless if there's no support.
1,It doesn't work properly.  It causes burns. Tje active 2 was superior
5,I love the screen and display functions.  The battery life is less than I thought it would be.  I went from a garmin to the Samsung since I have a Samsung phone and the garmin could go a couple days before needing a charge.  The Samsung needs to be charged daily.
5,It looks better than iWatch. The battery life is good. If you have a galaxy phone this watch will be good for you. But if you plan to buy a charger you must buy a compatible one (not for apple or galaxy watch 4).
2,The preview said the watch did blood pressure and body temp. Body temp sensor is on watch but right now just for show. BP is non-existent in the US for these Galaxy watches although they are on a bunch of the cheaper smart watches out there. Battery life isn't great..having to take it off overnight to charge defeats the sleep monitoring app and during the day for an hour the step count and all ends up off. Cheap watches will go for a week or even over two weeks depending and for some reason these Galaxy ones can't come close to that either. I know it is considered smarter than cheapos but I want function and life that Samsung hasn't figured out like the $55 off brands have.
5,Great
5,Retired my old Fitbit for a "real" watch. Battery life is pretty much as advertised. I'm getting a little over 2 days on a charge. It does recharge quickly. Annoyed that the included charger is USB C which forced me to purchase an adaptor since much of my gear is still USB A. I do use the wireless charger when I'm at my desk. The face is easy to read even in sunlight. So far I'm happy with it.
