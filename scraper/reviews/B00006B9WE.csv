4,These have absolutely no depth to the sound at all.  The natural bass of sound is almost completely lacking. If you just want some kind of sound for kids these will work. You can't beat the price.
4,For the price this is a great buy. I needed speakers that wouldn't take up another power outlet in my desk and the fact that these use the USB port in the back of my PC for power really helps. For sound there are better speakers out there I'm sure. But if you need these more for business (I get a lot of voicemail) or just watching YouTube or Rumble videos or playing older video games they work great. No issues with background noise etc. They even have a port for headphones if you still have those with a traditional jack. And again for the price you'll be happy with these.
3,These speakers are pretty low quality in terms of sound and direction. Good examples are if my phone happens to be within 8 inches of either speaker a loud buzzing takes over all audio if you use the headphone jack all you hear is buzzing or super low audio even with the volume cranked at max also the direction is way off; things that happen on the (LEFT) side of my screen come from the (RIGHT) speaker. Mind you I have them set L and R like they should be but audio is swapped so that's annoying. Then we come to the volume issue for some games I don't have to turn it up very high to hear what's going on while others I max it and can't hear much of anything even when turning up the desktop audio. So as they say you get what you pay for be aware of that. PS the blue power light is so bright it actually hurts my eyes if I'm busy working on something so I end up unplugging the speakers and powering them off to use headphone instead more often than not.
4,Speaker are nice but kind of expected them to be louder but they are ok.
5,My old laptop didn't provide good volume so I added this pair of small convenient plug-in speakers as peripherals. Price was affordable. What I wanted and needed!ðŸ˜Ž
4,There were inexpensive and helped through when my laptop's speakers died. The sound quality is not very good but they work fine for Zoom calls and work activities. Not very pleasant for music but that's to be expected at this price point
4,The speakers work ok the volume works ok. I had to lower the volume on my pc to adjust a little bit better. There is a slight hum noise coming from them when no volume is coming out. I just turn them off until I need them. I do not here the hum while playing any sound-it may just be drowning it out. Overall they do the job easy plug and play.
5,I like everything about the Cyber Acoustics USB Powered 2.0 Desktop Speaker System thus far.  I am especially enjoying the ease of use and sound quality. of the system.  I am using the speakers on my desktop computer.
3,It's practically a miracle a pair of speakers are available for $8 so while there is a lot of static (most noticeable when no sound is playing so I turn them off when not in use - and they have a separate power button which is very nice) the volume control knob is difficult to turn and the sound quality isn't great your audio will still be perfectly understandable which is good enough for generic applications like watching youtube. Good value for money.
3,I used them a couple of times but realized that holding it up close to my ear was not what I had hoped for. I am sorry to say they sound was not good and volume was low...too low to do what I wanted (to have the speakers sit on a lap table so I could watch movies online).
4,The sound quality is okay for a computer. And that's what I bought it for. I have a recording studio I did not expect for them to sound like my monitors because they are not monitors they are little speakers for a computer and they does the job great. Great value little bit of a buzzing noise but you can still hear the music and anything on your computer and for $7 it is a great value.
4,They work great except that if I am on my cell and I put it within about 2' of the speakers they pick up some interference.  Probably not a big deal but annoying at times to have to shut them off so I can talk on the phone.
5,Improves sound on laptop.
3,Ok I know they were low price. I was not looking for audio quality. I just wanted some volume when working in my office. Sound quality is pretty good considering the price but NO VOLUME. I have the speaker all the way up. I have the computer master volume all the way up. I have the sound on the YouTube video all the way up but still can hear much 6 feet away.
3,The speakers have no bass at all but they still sound way better than most of the speakers built into monitors but compared to a laptop or even a phone you'd be better off using that it looks nice and since it's USB it's really easy to power and the headphone pass through is super useful for bringing the aux port where you can reach it. Honestly if you wanted these as just a headphone extension cable it's great you even get speakers lol
3,Canâ€™t beat the cost if they end up lasting at least a year. Great price cute and a lot smaller than they look on screen so I was pleasantly surprised. Loved to on and off button and value control. Volume doesnâ€™t get extremely high but high enough for me to be very happy with these speakers.
5,Worked well for my desktop
3,Didn't know they were so small.  The volume is also small.  Not very loud.
3,I bought this a couple weeks ago and it was fine for a few days (which I rarely use) then the volume  became crackly during an online meeting.  I checked the cords and saw that where the USB connects to the actual black cord the USB is not properly seated. How do I get a new cord??
3,Sometimes they have weird feedback but for a pair of cheapo desktop speakers they get the job done
3,too much static
5,Came very late but it works great
5,I bought these to use in my classroom and they're perfect. The sound quality isn't the bestttt but what would you expect for the cost. They work just fine for the classroom.
4,These speakers exceeded the value to money ratio. they are perfect for the laptop and the USB power is more than enough as for the popping as reviewers noted.. do not put your smartphone nearby but other than that they are a perfect value.
5,I'm glad
3,Not much to say about these speakers they are cheap cover mostly vocal range only and have a little low-level hiss. Nothing that will probably bother most but is noticeable in a quiet room. Speakers are paper cones and won't produce any bass. I find them acceptable for watching news clips. The speakers are so light they slide around on my desk because they have no rubber feet to help hold them in place. I would have thought maybe a couple strips of rubber wouldn't have broken the bank for the manufacture. I did find a solution to the noise heard in speakers. I tried using a USB adaptor such as one for charging smartphones. It provides a cleaner power supply with less noise then powering from USB on PC. Itâ€™s worth a try if you experience any sort of noise.
4,Are they loud? No. Is the sound clear and crisp? No. But they do work and get the job done.
5,I needed a pair of inexpensive speakers. These work well for voice not the best sound quality for music tho but that didnâ€™t matter for my use. If you donâ€™t have an extra place to plug into 120 or donâ€™t want to crawl around on the floor looking for an open outlet and you have a USB socket available and donâ€™t want to break the bank then these are what you need! Lol
4,Using these speakers from your laptop give you directional control and amplification of your existing speakers.
5,use for my Xbox at my desk works well and the volume knob is nice to have
4,Not bad for the price as others mentioned there is a constant hum/static noise due to the USB power source which I fixed by plugging them it into a wall outlet using a USB to AC adapter rather than directly into one of my computerâ€™s USB ports.
4,A solid C+ set of $8.00 speakers for a wired PC. They were priced right for the sound you get. I am NOT complaining. I didn't want to beak the bank I just wanted to HEAR sound from my PC. For those who COMPLAINED herein just "what" did they think they were getting for a price so cheap? If you order a hamburger don't complain because you're too cheap to pay for a steak.
4,Bought these for my sister's pc. she needed a set and they work well for her needs
4,Bought these for my kids computer and they work great. Wasn't looking to break the bank on quality speakers. These speakers are a little staticky but for $8 bucks you get what you pay for. They serve their purpose and that's what I was looking for. Now my kids can listen to their tunes play their online educational games and stream their movies.
3,The speakers have a constant buzzing sound that emits when the speakers are on and nothing is playing. I have used them for video calls and they have great sound. Great bargain. compact and does not take up lots of space on my small desk
3,Setup is easy:  Plug green plug into socket of the computer plug the USB plug into an appropriate socket and presto the speakers work.  Or do they?  Well except for the somewhat loud and continuous hum they work like you might expect.  When I played a movie I could hear the sound -- thin but there nevertheless.  But volume is poor.  Even with volume knob on the speakers turned all the way up I still had to turn up the sound on my computer to about 70% for that movie.  And of course the hum volume rose too so it's impossible to drown out the hum with the proper sound.  With my other speakers (which do not hum)  I needed to set my computer sound control at only about 20% for the same level of sound output.I'm going to keep these speakers for use in an emergency.  For $7 it's not worth the effort to return them anyway.  They're small enough to pack away in a small box so that's where they'll be from now on.  Now I have to start my search again for a better pair of low-cost speakers
3,Like everyone else in their reviews there is a hum from the speaker.I think that for less than $10 it is actually a good buy. These are not going to be plugged on my computers at home so I donâ€™t care how bad the quality of the sound is.It will work fine for my work computer.
4,They work but the blue light is so bright itâ€™s obnoxious.
4,If your wanting acceptable quality sound at an economical price these speakers are a no-risk choice
5,works great
4,Husband needed for work and expressed that they work great for his needs... Not good for gaming or interactive use but for a taped meeting perfect.
4,Best speaker with this price ...
3,Actual device sounds louder than these speakers. One thing I like is the headphone option: it sounds way better with them than the actual speakers.
5,Nothing special with the sound quality but for the price this is a great value.
5,For nearly $8 I  purchased this item not expecting so much for a desktop speaker. However I am very pleased with the outcome. Sound quality is really good and the ease of use is a plus. Thank you seller for the lightning fast shipment too.
5,Shipped quickly. Best budget speakers ever! Very loud despite their size. I appreciate  that they're on the smaller size because I dont have much space on my desk so I usually tuck them behind my monitor. The max volume for the speakers is also amazing. Sometimes games and YouTube are too quiet and I can't hear very well so these little speakers are really something.
3,These speakers are small and sadly have a small sound too. They sound kind of tinny and are not loud at all.  I guess for a small set the price is good though.
5,To listen to some classes.
5,I Got This Because My Pc Didn't Have a speaker come with it. But Thanks To this I Have Sound! Its Very Cheap But Works Well! Thanks! The Sound Quality Is Really Good as well
5,Works week easy setup!
3,STATIC NOISE WHEN THERES NO SOUND
2,They are ok not the best l. Kinda of a thin sound. But what do you want for under 10 bucks.
4,Not as loud as I would of like
5,Good product for the money
2,I ordered one when using it there was a constant high frequency tone while on. I thought it was a defective product so I had it replaced under Amazon returns. The replacement was exactly the same so yeah affordable but will give you migraines
3,Constant electric noise longiaj wires if that's what you need
2,Out of the box Only one speaker Working.
5,I got these for our work PCs.  That said they don't have the greatest sound but are more than adequate to listen to online training videos.
3,Good price a little static.
3,Only the side with the column control works.  Nothing from the other side
4,My goal was to get sound out of my work PC volume and clarity are acceptable.So in value for money you get what you pay for.The overall sound quality is obviously poor and static noise while ideal is annoying.
4,small compact but very noisy
2,It's about speaking-volume at max volume. A quiet speaker. It's ....sigh
5,They are really good. Must buy they work fabulous been having them for couple months works great
2,They do not often put out enough volume and then during the course of usage they have the tendency to become staticky! I would really like to get a refund to put toward a better set.
5,Great sounds effect
3,Static and clicking interference
2,First ones had to be exchanged. Both shipments came in filthy bubble wrap. Not sure what going on. Looks like they had sat in a dirty garage before they put them in the boxes. The sound is so so. Probably wonâ€™t buy again.
2,Sounds like a rapid clicking over the sound you  play very annoying cant eliminate it. Almost like a constant interference. Cheap speaker should have spent few more dollars. Don't recommend!
5,Small which is great for our desk.
5,works as expected
2,I'm looking for a nice looking and quality products. Sadly this one is not a keeper and  need to return. Love the looks though!
5,These speakers sound good.For the price they canâ€™t be beat.
5,These speakers are cheap laptop speakers. They are exactly what they are. They work perfect for my application.
2,Poor quality Sound is bad
4,It was what I needed at the time
5,What else can I say
2,There's crackling sounds and the right speaker quit working the same day I got them. Whenever I have to adjust the volume it crackles loudly. Also the blue indicator light is way too bright!
2,Honestly just needed some speaker for my desktop and these were literally the cheapest option. They work! So I got what I wanted... Just basic speakers but they DO have an annoying... Hum? Buzz? Static? Just a bothersome noise I can't stand so I'll be donating them to as soon as my replacement speakers come in.
2,Exactly what a cheap speaker is. It is very cheap. Noise issues when my phone is next to it. there are much better items out there for only 3 dollars more
5,I hook the speakers up to my computer at work. It has a very clear stereo sound. I wish it had a little more bass . Other than that absolute great value for what I paid
2,Very cheap but buzzes very loudly when turned on. Sound quality was ok if it was louder than the buzz.
3,Pretty standard speaker set.
2,Did d work
5,same like promotion. excellent
5,Great for the price
5,needed this as the internal one wasn't good enough
4,Small
5,Sound is tinny
2,Maybe my 20+ year old Harman Kardon speakers spoiled me too much. I was hoping for some decent small speakers that wouldn't break and wouls sound okay. These were the least expensive and they sound like it. No fullness to the sound at all. No equalizer settings make it any better. I would not recommend at all.
5,
5,For under $10 Iâ€™m amazed how well they work. Super easy hook up  & worked immediately. Excellent buy!!
5,The sound quality is good the price was very good the wiring is awkward to set up and use.
1,I mean I don't know what I expected for the price but anytime they are powered on they emit a high-pitched ringing that will slowly drive you insane eventually causing you to lash out in violence.Terrible.
5,Very simple to set up looks good and the sound is ok could be better but a really good product for the price
5,These speakers are very affordable and are well worth it.
2,Nothing special but needed it for a zoom style meeting. Only paid like 7 bucks so I guess it was worth the price. Anything over 7 bucks I would warn you to keep shopping.
1,The audio is okay. Not the best but it does the job. However the squeal of interference overpowers the audio coming out from them. I know they are cheap but thereâ€™s better ones with lesser interference.
2,volume was not very loud
1,It replicates sound well but also continuously plays a buzzing noise even at low volume. Plugging in headphones through it doesn't help and occasionally the feedback/noise is so bad it is a loud buzzing or shrill. I've had cheap speakers that will emit a little noise when nothing is playing but this is just shameful. Tried it on two different computers and sounded just as terrible.
5,Easy install great simple sound
1,Nothing much to say other than these were terrible.  As soon as you connect and turn on these USB  Powered speakers there is a high-pitched noise emitted from the cheap speakers.  I thought I could live with it buy yeah-nawh I just couldn't take it.  Even heard the noise when connecting headphones to the speaker jack. I replaced it with another speaker a Boblol bar speaker here on Amazon for $16 or so.  Wayyyyyyyyy better! :D
5,Great quality for price.
1,Do not buy this product. It is cheap but the wires are garbage. The product is unusable due to the severe feedback and static noise even when you aren't using them. If they are on they are making a terrible feedback static sound the entire time. DO NOT BUY.
1,With no audio playing the speakers emit a quiet static/screeching sound. When you try to listen to audio it sounds like the speakers are isolated in a concrete room there is so much echo. The quality is horrible anything where more than two instruments are playing or more than two people speaking and it sounds like a garbled mess.
1,Got this only a couple of hours ago and it works terribly. It says it was listed as $20 but then dropped down to $9 but it is obvious to tell that it is not a $20 speaker and they only do that to make it look like a good deal. Only one of the speakers worked out of the box. The speaker has this really bad static ringing sound that you cant stop even changing the volume. Even though i would never use it the audio through the headphone jack is indescribably terrible. In the end this shows that you get what you pay for.
5,Now I can play my MS combat games.
1,I've only had this for a few months.  I initially liked them because the sound quality was decent but over the last few weeks the speakers have just been turning off at random.  I then have to turn off the power button and turn them back on for it to work again and at times that does not work.  Absolute junk!
2,When powered on the right speaker makes an obnoxious buzzing/squealing noise. Can be drowned out if the volume is up high enough.
1,I bought this for my computer at work. It worked great for about a month but then even turned all the way up the sound is barely louder than the built in speaker that is very hard to hear.  As it was past the exchange period Iâ€™m out the money for the speakers with nothing to show for it
1,I just had these speakers delivered yesterday. I needed something affordable for those times when I can't be wearing my headphones all day and these speakers seemed to fit the bill. However from the moment I plugged them in there was a terrible buzzing. No matter where I put them on my desk I couldn't get away from it. I chose these speakers because they are supposedly shielded in an attempt to get away from that buzz but it was just not going to happen. These are not the speakers you're looking for if you have a smaller size desk.
5,Super compact and sound quality a plus!
2,Bought these as I needed a pair of speakers regardless of audio quality. In that regard they work just fine. Play a Youtube video and I can easily understand the spoken words.However when I'm not playing sound there was a buzzing sound. I found that plugging the USB into a wall charger greatly reduces this but its still obnoxious especially since I frequently need to use headphone with these which makes the problem worse.I'd say avoid anything that uses USB for power. There's a point where it gets too cheap and this is it.
1,My old speakers broke. These could be delivered  in a few hours so I got them to hold me over until my real speakers get here. They are cheap with a bad echo between the two. But as long as you don't push them over 75% they sound decent  for under 10 dollars  the volume control is big and that's kinda nice
2,Positives-sleek and space saving designNegative-low sound tried on 3 computers and same issues.  Even turned all the way up at best I can hear an occasional voice.
4,OK BUY FOR THE MONEY BUT DISAPPOINTED THE SPEAKERS VOLUME IS NOT VERY LOUD...
5,for a gift
1,As soon has I plugged them in they had a constant hum regardless of where the volume was set.  Even when no sound was being played from the computer they hummed non stop.  Boxed them up and sent them back.  Not worth the hassle for the cheap price...
1,So from the get-go the contents of the box were in a jumbled mess you could see that there were twist ties but they were completely unraveled and cords were everywhere. I didn't think much of it as long as the speakers worked. I plug everything in and go to power them on and.. nothing. I re-checked the connections tried different ports and eventually said screw it and unplugged the whole thing. In an effort to see if they truly were defective I plugged the USB into my phone charging block and tried just turning the device on. No power at all.
1,Ugh. Wasted time and money. Eating more fiber didn't produce as much crap as these speakers.
1,Well sometimes you do get what you pay for. These speakers (at least mine) make a low buzz with all computers they are plugged in. Returning after 5 minutes of use.
5,Good product
1,weird noise coming from speaker do not get this it's cheaply made
3,They have a static buzz when the volume is turned off..
1,I purchased this to replace a cheap used one I got. This speaker system is worse in sound volume. Further there's a periodic chirp coming out of the left speaker every 30 seconds. I don't know if that's my PC but the previous speaker never produced that.At this point I would not recommend any speaker system using USB power.Update; to clarify the USB type where the audio comes from the jack on the mother board. i.e. the audio is not via the USB system.Also this speaker produces an "Unknown Device" in the USB devices and printers. I've removed it and it comes back. The noise appears to be coming from the USB power so the noise filters in these speakers is of poor design.
1,Lots of reviews say humming sound. It's more of a sound like you are trying to contact another lifeform somewhere. It's high pitch and constant. It goes up and down and never stops. The price was by far the best on amazon but I wouldn't take them for free listening to the high pitch sound that comes from them WHENEVER they are plugged in whether you have music or sound coming through them or not. I'm pretty sure you can buy just about anything else and it will be better than these. If you find speakers cheaper than these they will probably be better.
4,These speakers do not have the same clearness and sound quality of my 20 year old Cyber Acoustics set.
4,Sound about average!! The only thing I dislike is sometimes u hear a helicopter sound in the background. This is due to your speakers are to close to each other. The further the speakers are from each other. The less u hear that helicopter like background noise!  U don't hear that when U play the music!
1,I think the idea of how cheap they were is appealing. Iâ€™m sure some work but mine didnâ€™t.
1,Very Fuzzy Do not recommend
1,not very loud volume
1,The speakers sound like garbage.  Too much distortion
1,The sound quality was very disappointing. Like listening to AM radio not in tune with the station.  Just donâ€™t waste your money
1,Bought these speakers for a test that disallowed headphones. Pros: decently loud easy USB power source. Cons: very low quality with a constant low buzzing any time they are powered on. These things don't do any sound filtering whatsoever and it sounds terrible. Decent enough for voice communication maybe but avoid if you want to actually hear anything better than a piezoelectric.
4,if you have your cell phone near these they will intercept (like most audio devices from 90s-2010) you can hear crackling sounds. if you were in school or still are and hear this sound its invisible waves setting them off.
1,Horrible sound
1,Constant static. Literal garbage.
1,Absolutely garbage product. Got what I paid for ($7.99 at time of purchase).Uses an outdated RealTek driver so can only use one RealTek device at a time (if you use a headset need to physically unplug it every time you want to use the speakers even if you have multiple aux-inputs to your PC.CONSTANT high-pitched feedback.I only spent $8 and still regret every penny.
1,Product arrived intact but plugging them in - speakers do not work.They power up properly thru USB. The computer is correctly sending audio to the 3.5mm jack and yet... nothing. You get what you pay for apparently.
1,My kids could hear radio station through it when trying to do school work.
1,When it arrived I had take one of the speakers apart and solder the wire back to the speaker. Worked fine for about 2 months now they don't work at all. I will not purchase this brand again.
1,The speakers do not work. The only audio coming out of the speakers is NASTY LOUD STATIC!
1,Noisy sound and not good volume
1,These are horrific speakers. The feedback was awful and I went through the trouble of troubleshooting techniques with no success. Returned for a full refund you get what you pay for.
1,Crappy
4,I have two pairs of these speakers.  One for at home and one for at work.  With the power coming from the USB it is one less clunky plug I have to find room for on the power strip.  The sound is fair.  I have no problems with humming or picking up static.  While it is very minor I also like the blue power light.Update November 7th 2008After 4 years these speakers are still working great.
1,It sounds not loud enough.  The laptop is louder than the speakers
1,I purchased these speakers for work I plugged them into my computer and there was no sound coming out I change the wire around and I got a little bit of sound it was very staticky and the sound was very low I wish I would have never purchased them but you get what you pay for.
1,The speakers have bad sound quality. Look elsewhere.
1,I didn't expect "professional recording quality" sound but I did expect moderately decent volume WITHOUT the violent POPPING and BUZZING sound that randomly spurts out and WITHOUT the constant buzzing otherwise. Speaker shouldn't sound like they've been filled to the brim with bees and they shouldn't sound like someone is setting off TNT sporadically.TL:DR - My recommendation? DO NOT BUY under ANY circumstances. Spend a bit extra and get something different because these are CRAP.
5,Using on my personal computer and it works great. Great value for money and great volume.
2,getting sound drop out...no longer usable for medical transcription.  Died quickly.
1,The speakers seem to be stuck at about 30% of max volume. If you keep turning the dial it does nothing. I can barely hear them with every setting at 100%. Absolute trash don't buy even for the low price
1,Sound is very poor not worth it
1,Avoid this product at all costs - it has a constant buzzing and ringing tone and even if it didn't the sound quality is tinny and extremely poor. The output sounds even worse through the jack in earbuds.
5,We use these speakers to project sound to a small 30 x 30 meeting room. Work well for the intended use. Not for high quality music but enough clarity for normal use with training videos etc. I like that they are powered by a cord to a standard USB port instead of needing an AC outlet. This works well with laptops and mobile presentations.
1,When I connected it to my computer there was no audio sound just static. This purchase was so disappointing!!! I would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.
1,don't bother wasting your time and money.their junk.
4,This Item was perfect for my office.
1,Very staticky sound is horrible
1,Tested these on my PC and as soon as I plug into the audio it starts making a weird noise constantly without anything playing.
1,These are not worth money.  They are small and poorly made.  The sound quality is that of two soda cans connected by a string.
5,I bought these for a friend and he says they work great
3,I bought these speakers for my folks in India so that I wouldn't have to deal with 110v/220v conversion headaches. I assume anyone traveling abroad would like to buy these as well instead of a powered speaker. For someone who was looking for a barebones speaker this does the job well. The sound quality is acceptable though you can forget getting any bass out of the speakers. Otherwise music played through sharp and clear.
1,Cheap doesn't begin to describe them. Very tinny sound hard to make out the dialogue while watching videos online and overall... junk. Save your money and buy a nicer pair.
1,Had to return no longer needed
1,The sound is not loud at all
1,My desktop's internal speaker is better than those.  Don't waste your money
1,Used for less than 5hours.
1,I get it these speakers were not alot of money but they are useless they do not have any volume at all I got them for my laptop and the laptop is louder without them and the power light is soooo bright it is blinding. I this might sound petty but its sooooo bright if you get them you will agree.
4,I like them fine.
3,You got what you paid. Itâ€™s cheap but itâ€™s not a good speaker
1,I have used Cyber Acoustics products before and have been very satisfied.  For the price of these speakers I was not expecting superb sound quality. Just some nice little speakers that I could also hook my head set into.  As other have posted on the product there is a horrible buzzing in the speakers when on. I am very disappointed.  I know the old saying you get what you pay for but I have never had a problem with this vendor and since I was looking for a simple use I felt I could trust this set.  I will be returning them.
1,These speakers ain't worth the salt in the bread. Save your money and get you some quality speakers.
1,Cheep Chinese inferior quality. Not worth the effort to carry out to the trash.
1,what a waste of time this was. the speakers don't work if you move them or there is a slight vibration they turn off. they are brand new and i have only been using them for about two weeks. dont buy!
1,If you just need speakers ANY speakers these may do the trick. If you care about the sound quality even a little bit skip these.
4,At least it get the job done
1,I purchased 3 pairs for an office to be shared by 3 people (myself and 2 others). The only criteria was cheap headphone jack and decent looking and these fit the bill except...Like others here the USB power method seemed like a good idea to save plug usage. It may be a good "idea" but as some others have noted the implementation of the idea is fatally flawed.There's a HUGE amount of noise using headphones and a 5.8GHz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers off.Very disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite 2 with no packaging.
1,If "amplifying sound" through an unassumingclean appearance are your sole requirements then these speakers satisfy those two conditions. If however you expect your speakers to actually replicate the intended audio as intended at an increased volume faithful to the original sound look elsewhere.  These speakers while cheap are little more than active Geiger Counters hissing popping and crackling as though I were a current employee of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. These speakers anticipate and announce every incoming text call or update on my phone with an immediate and unashamed declaration of clatter. Keep your phone in another room and MAYBE you won't regret you were such a cheap ass and didn't spend the extra five bucks on something else.
2,Bought 2 sets both power buttons work intermittently have to bang speaker on the table to get to come on sometimes and if you leave them on with computer off the have a feedback noise on both of them
1,Speakers lasted a few weeks.  Sound has static and muffled.  Not worth it not even for the price
4,These speakers work in the everyday person use but if you wanta really good sounding speaker system this is not what you would want to have.They look nice and look to be well made and light weight.
1,I know I get what I pay for but Bruh! I've had better sound out of dollar tree ear buds! Absolute garbage. Many regerts.
5,They sound fine and the nice thing is that they run off of the USB port so you don't need a second adapter plugged in.
2,they worked with my phone but not with my computer.
2,These weren't that great.  My first speakers (different brand) broke so I bought these. I should have waited for the longer delivery time rather than by these. The computer isn't any louder with these than the built in speakers.
1,power cuts in and out don't know if this was a refurbished unit.
4,I don't know what to say about a product like this. It works the price was great and it is durable. Perfect for what I had a need for. Did not want to spend too much money but still wanted a decent quailty product.
5,These were easy to hook up they worked instantly and the sound is great. I expected a loss of sound quality as a trade-off with the ease of usb power but they have a strong sound and look very sleek. I'm a critical person but I have no complaints at all about these speakers. I bought a set for the wife as well and she was very pleased with them. Really good quality and at a good price.
3,Sound level seems fine but has lots of static.
2,You get what you pay for. Really not good sound quality. The first set I bought didn't even work. Had get replaced. Im probably just gonna spend some more money and buy a set that works
1,These are awful. Hissy crackle sounds come out of them when they are supposed to be silent. Terrible. Do not waste your money
1,Do not recommend
3,the acoustic are a replacement to the 1st pair that I had.  the first pairthe volume was stronger.  this smaller pair fits better on my computer cartthey came rather quickly and was well packeaged
1,Definitivamente no vale la pena se escucha muy mal como si tuviera interferencia
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              Â Mala calidad de sonido. No es lo que esperaba
1,These have to be the worst PC speakers I've ever owned! The sound quality is mediocre at best and they are constantly buzzing. To make things worse they are incredibly susceptible to interference from mobile signals to the point that I can't keep my phone within 18" (45 cm) of the speakers.
2,As others have noted there's static coming out of the speakers that only goes away when you turn them off. One of the most annoying things for me is there's this high pitched "beeping" sound that can sometimes give me a bit of a headache. If not for that these would be actually an excellent pair of speakers.
1,Great speakers if it wasnâ€™t making noise. For this price it couldâ€™ve done better. I tried it on different devices and I still get this noise.
3,the USB cable provides the power only.  the sound still comes through a separate "headphone jack" cable.  i was trying to get around a defective sound card with these.  so i have to return them.
1,Out of the box won't work.  Returning the speakers.
2,Happy with the quality of the speakers but it came unboxed and the components were packing taped together in a bundle. Unable to remove tape residue from the front of both speakers.
1,Sound not loud enough. The static is awful.
1,Constant static. Low audio output on max settings.
5,Great value.
1,i cant get these speakers to work.
3,Not exactly what I thought it was.  I wanted to get rid of the wall wart but I was also thinking I was getting rid of the audio cable.
4,Speakers work great
1,Terrible sound.
1,These are the biggest/tiniest pieces of junk I ever saw/heard. Turn them on and a crackling noise goes through them like a baby monitor and continues randomly.. Then when not breaking up the sound quality is so poor it reminds me of those 69 cent transistor radios that ran on a 9 volt battery. These are BEYOND cheap. I'm returning them.
2,Definite computer only stuff. Didn't work my PlayStation or TV. Very disappointed. I still try later on a Laptop.
4,I got this for my daughters and they like them.
2,They work fine for the money but dont expect much. Sound quality is fine but volume isn't very loud.
1,They do not work.
3,It doesn't really get loud but for the price its ok. I do hear a static sound though when I put headphones.
4,These speakers just plugged in and worked but the sound level is not sufficient for a very large area. If you need personal sound and are going to be very near to the speakers these will do nicely.
2,speakers have a short in them push button turn on and it shorts and goes off have to wiggle button or push off and on to get to work again other than that nice looking low cost speakers sounds good.
1,It was horrible soon as i plug the speakers in it was making a constant noise really annoying the speakers were junk worst purchase i've ever made from amazon. I would've returned them but I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back. So i just smashed them and went to best buy and got new ones. I know it was a cheap speaker but hell it should atleast work properly. Talk about trash.
1,I should have known that spending 11 dollars was too good to be true. The speakers were faulty. They had a horrible high pitch sound when turned on and feedback. It cost me 7 dollars to return since the company does not provide a shipping label on returns. I am only getting 4 dollars back out of this whole mess. I should have gone to Staples first. They have great speakers for 15 dollars.
4,the good: These are exactly what I wanted:  USB front panel controls good price.the bad: Bass response bad (none)
5,they were affordable... they have a good volume range and an easy "earphone" jack on the front for when hubby's trying to sleep.  I'm not sure what else I can say. I'm very please with this product the price I paid and the service they give me.
1,would return but the gas would cost me the same amount.
1,Its not even a case of you get what you pay for. These were so bad they weren't worth the effort of hooking up. I was never able to use them more than a couple of minutes before the feedback drove me crazy.
5,excellent sounds great and price was amazing
2,keep hearing static on the speakers
4,These work well for normal use.
1,Static sound
1,Cyber Acoustics CA-2908 Portable USB Powered Speaker System (Black/Grey)        RECEIVED THEM TODAY EASY TO HOOK UP BUT HORRIBLE SOUND. IT SCREECHES REALLY LOUD AND DOES NOT STOP WHEN PLAYING MUSIC OR VIDEOS. I BOUGHT THEM TO LISTEN TO MY ONLINE LECTURES AND I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROFESSOR WAS SAYING. I WILL BE RETURNING THEM FIRST THING TOMORROW. DO NOT BUY
2,Frequency picks up local radio station ...
5,Good computer speakers with auto off function.
1,Both sets I tried made an annoying crackling sound when the speakers were turned on but not in use.  When in use I could still hear a bit of the crackling in the background.  Would not recommend.
2,Despite the overall poor ratings this product received I decided to purchase it. I wrongly assumed if I isolated the connections the background noise would be reduced or eliminated.
5,Sounds good for what it is
1,The speakers are relatively nice but when you turn down the volume they give out a very annoying "buzz" and intermittent high-pitched beeps. Theses sounds are not that loud but were sufficiently noticable that I could not work with the speakers on my desk.I imagine this is an artifact of a cheap amplifier circuit. The sound artifacts come through the headphone jack as well.
4,Doesnt have much base but for the size and what I paid for the product you cant beat the quality.
3,I got these speakers for like 4 dollars they do have a buzzing sound at times plugging in earphone into the speaker doesn't work the sound is like under a pillow however  as long as the speakers are not at a super high volume the sound quality is okay for the price.
5,i purchased 2 sets -- one for work & one for home.  it was a great buy for the money.  i searched locally and major retail stores charged me over $20 on these speakers.  this is well worth the money i paid for.
2,You get what you pay for...
5,Really easy and can be really loud for such small speakers
5,like
5,Nice item and service.
1,Distorted sound - I use for work to hear meetings and the sound is really low or so distorted that I cannot understand what is being said.  Waste of Money!
1,Given the price I purchased these speakers in spite of the negative reviews here.  It was a mistake.  I am returning them.  Listen to me very carefully: These speakers are ridiculously bad.  They are unusable for any purpose.  Don't even think about buying them.
2,These MIGHT be O.K. for a portable computer but they are under powered for a TV.
1,dislike that the headphone jack does not work right sound is compromised and almost blows your eardrums with electric static noise when using speakers work fine though.
1,The speaker had very disturbing noises coming from it. Don't Buy this Speaker! Spend a little more money and Get the logitech S120 2.0 Speakers!
1,Constant humming I mean absolute garbage.
1,These are not only bad but they are also really really bad.  Spend a few more dollars and get something you can at least listen too.
2,Alot of crackling in speakers.
1,Awful.Stay away.SPEAKERS DAMAGED MY COMPUTER! !My mouse stopped working after plugging in these speakers !PLUSSpeakers are extremely quiet.Speakers make a static noise.
1,The quality of the sound was very poor and I was not very happy with the product.
5,Would recommend this product to anyone just looking for basic computer speakers. The price is good the sound is good with no popping or crackling noise.
5,USB power is convenient.
5,I love this speaker so much it cheap small best of all; it doesn't need any power adapter all you need is to hook it up to your PC usb!
1,They spit and pop all the time. Unusable junk. Having to order replacements. Don't waste your money.
1,Power button is broken it doesn't stay pushed in and powered on. I had to put a rubber band over it to make them stay on.
1,Cheapest speakers on Amazon. Static when plugged in multiple jacks. Unusable out of the box.
1,Constant fuzzy sound when not playing anything. Okay sound when playing something. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Worst speakers for a desk top that I have ever owned. Constant static. Pulsing as well. I ordered a replacement pair and they were way worse!!!!
5,Bought these over 7 years ago and I'm still using them
1,Pure crap.  To think the $11 I spent ($6 + $5 s&h) plus another sawbuck could have purchased a case of PBR in cans.
5,Very good!
1,MAKES NOISES WHEN YOU USE THE PHONE NEXT TO IT
1,Bad sound quality
1,GARBAGE  FROM  CHINA - CONSTANT STATIC - LOOSE PARTS - SUCKS THE BIG ONE.
5,I was skeptical when I saw these for such a cheap price.  But I have been very pleased.  Nice full sound.  I like the way they get the power through the USB connection.  If I needed another set I'd buy again.
1,They have power that's about the best I can say.
5,good
1,I intend to replace them with some speakers that shound good quite soon.
2,Would not purchase again
5,Speakers are great. Better than expected.
5,good speakers for the money
5,just what I wanted
3,Weak. But cheap
5,AAA+++
5,These are relly good speakers especially for use in the office. They were inexpensive easy to set up and sound great. I recommend them to everyone.
5,very satisfied would buy again
4,Good for the price.Not top sound quality for music listening of course but they work for music and sounds from your computer.
5,These are great! I ordered them for my home and work computers and I love them!
1,Sound is low n terrible
1,I got these as a package deal with my new desktop.From day one they crackled.  Now as I continue to try to use them they pop on and off at will.  The power light goes out.  Even trying to open them I see what junk they are.  They are going directly into the trash.
1,These speakers are junk. All they do is pop and crackle Luke they have loose connections.
3,They're basically 10 dollar speakers so I wasn't expecting much but I've been satisfied with them.  I keep them behind my monitor and they sound fine no interference though admittedly my computer is kind of far from them.  The USB power feature is very nice.
4,I was looking for a set of inexpensive speakers for my computer system that wouldn't sound as weak as the low-grade monitor speakers but wouldn't take up a loot of desk space or use a lot of power.  For that last reason I concentrated on USB-powered speakers.  After some research I purchased these CA speakers and they fit the bill as basic capable speakers.  Because they're USB powered and the cable isn't maximum grade there's some minor background noise which will vary depending on what components you have.  These are not the speakers you'll want if you're hooking up a full multimedia 5.1 or 7.1 system but for basic competent sound with a desktop or laptop these are just fine.
1,Like so many people have said I tried 3 of these speakers and they all gave terrible feedback. Someone told me that if you plug the USB into a wall outlet (like for your phone) then there's no interference. But that defeats the purpose of a USB speaker. Stay away!
1,For the price the sound quality is acceptable. However there is a constant "buzz" when powered on. Even with music playing you can hear it which makes these useless.
1,These speakers have a lot of background static that keeps them popping and hissing whether or not there is audio coming from my computer or not. Curious about whether it was the computer or speakers I tried connecting different different speakers. No static. So now I'm just a sad little consumer hoping to warn others off of these speakers. Spend the extra dollar or two for the next pricier speakers. It's worth it.
1,Bought this product to power my laptop. Speakers are junk sound is horrible and "tinny". Save your money...don't buy this item. Total garbage.
5,I purchased these speakers it came in a white box and the speakers that's all.  I plugged it into the USB and my computer's audio output.  I listen to music/youtube/hulu...What I like about this is:-cheap-USB Powered-volume DIAL (not a button)-a headphone output if I ever wantedWhat I dislike about this:-nothing so farI understand that a lot of people get the static but it will affect any speakers there is static when I put my blackberry (the BlackBerry interference is so much that it gives my landline phones static!!)UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 7 2011 - MORE THAN 2 YEARS LATERFinally one of the speakers stops working I have decided to purchase new ones.  I think it is because I constantly drop them and pick them up by fishing them in with their thin wires :PIdeally I'd like to purchase new Bluetooth/wireless ones this time but after so many search I think Bluetooth is still too expensive for me so I might just buy another pair--or a speaker bar.
3,The volume isn't very loud but what the heck?  You get what you pay for.
4,I use these in my classroom and they work well. The price was perfect for what I wanted to spend. I appreciate not having another chunky powerpack to plug in. The sound output is wonderful for my use. I do get a buzz when a cell phone in the room rings but that's seldom. For the cost this is an great value!
1,These speakers appeared to be a good basic pair of speakers for those who want a no-frills inexpensive system.  They look pretty nice admittedly.  Power is drawn through a USB port which is a nice idea - no bulky transformer.  And herein lies the problem.Power from the USB port needs to be filtered; on these speakers it is definitely not.  They hiss crack and transmit/amplify every electronic interference signal that comes out of your PC.  Move your mouse and you hear clicking. CD-ROM usage is even worse.  The noise renders the speakers unusable for even the most patient among us.For the price they're not even worth the effort to return ship them.  These are totally unusuable and going straight into the trash.
4,Supplier's description was accurate delivery was prompt.Speakers work great. And price was right. What more can one ask?Erle Howery (In California's "Gold Country")
2,I purchased these speakers because after switching out monitors I found that the speakers I was using were integrated into the monitor and the monitor was also its power source.  Faced with the prospect of adding one more plug to an already dubious electrical setup I looked for some USB speakers that didn't require their own power source.Having to choose between an expensive pair or these...thrift won out.The speakers have an ok sound don't expect to be blown away by any means.  But the easy to use power button and volume controls are a plus as well as a small footprint helpful with a cluttered desk.Unfortunately if my cell phone is within about 6 feet of the speakers they go crazy with static.  This is annoying enough to drive me to stay away from Cyber Acoustics products in the future.BOTTOM LINE: Cheap small speakers good for those who need a plug-free option.  However interference from other electronics is a near deal-breaker.
4,You can't reach to high with these. but it is nice it doesn't required a power line (uses USB).
4,this pair of speakers is excellent they last a long time give great loud and clear music.
4,You can not have better than this for the amount paid.  I am happhy with these speakes.
4,I liked the quality of the sound and the simplicity of set up.  A good product
1,These speakers cost me twenty dollars at my local Circuit City and one of the speakers went out a week after I bought them. The right speaker had great quality sound but every time I turned it up--to make up for the fact that the left speaker was emitting very little sound--a strange buzzing sound came from both speakers. Funnily enough when I shut the speakers off and left iTunes playing a song I could still hear the song faintly from the left speaker. Two months later they broke completely. The volume button caved in and now all I get is feedback. It's definitely not worth $20 or even $5. I suggest paying a little more for ones that will last.Now I just need to find a new set...
3,These speakers are not bad for the price just be aware that the wires often short out with devices made like this
2,I concur with the other reviews.  These speakers are just ok.  I would never have purchased them if they were going on my desk at home.  However that being said they are perfect for work.  They are cheap and they at least work well enough to listen to music.The feedback/buzzing can be annoying at times but on the plus side I know when my cell phone is about to ring.If you are considering these for any other reason spend more money on them and get a better pair.
1,The design of these speakers is nice -- they're fairly small and simple and were really exactly what I was looking for. The main problem is when they're on whether or not they are supposed to be projecting sound they make static/interference type noises which is incredibly annoying. Before returning them I just kept them off most of the time. Also annoying is the bright blue distracting light that automatically comes on when the power is on. Don't waste the money on these.
5,i really like the speakers that i bought from amazon they work really well and i dont have to have them hooked to any power i really like that part so that the big plug only can be pluged into a outlet by it self
1,I got these speakers in late december and by march 1st they were almost entirely useless. Even before they broke the headphone jack for whatever reason had an insane amount of noise or scrambling. But for no reason at all about 3 weeks ago one speaker started making lots of buzzing sounds and by the next day stopped working entirely. They had not been in any way damaged or mistreated and died on their own. Needless to say even for 20$ i would expect at least 6 months of use out of them. Dont bother spending you money.
2,There is a reason these speakers cost so little. The sound quality is horrible. The amount of static that comes out of these speakers is inexcusable. The issue is not an isolated one either. The company I work with ordered these in bulk and the static is the rule...lack of static is the exception. Buyer beware the low price of the speakers should give you an idea of their quality. The Blue LED power light is indeed nice looking as others have stated.
1,I was given BOGUS tracking information (they said USPS they later said "no it was shipped by FedEx Ground). Item was never seen at my door (they allegedly shipped with no signature required) by trust-worthy neighbors or apartment manager. They have only responded with baloney "item was delivered" in NUMEROUS contacts. I'm contesting credit card charge and writing letter of complaint to Attorney General's office.
1,Do yourself a favor spend another 10 dollars and buy another pair of speakers. These are awful! It is my opinion they should not even be sold. I can honestly say that the old transistor radio has better sound than these so called stereo speakers. Amazon did the right thing and refunded the order but the company that makes these should really be ashamed to have their name associated with these so called speakers.
2,The speakers did not work very well at all!! It makes a buzzing sound as soon as I plug it in!!
5,well i wasnt sure whether to go for such a cheap product or not. i wasnt disappointed. grt sound and ideal for my needs.A little bigger than what i expected but performance was good.
1,I bought a pair of Cyber Acoustic speakers.  The tone quality was terrible so I took it back and exchanged it.  The new pair started out with static then broke completely after 5 days.  This company either has no quality-control or just doesn't care that they produce trash.
1,I had so much RF interference with these speakers that I ended up returning them. Everytime I scrolled with my mouse I would hear the interference and there was always constant static sound. I returned them and bought Logitech speakers instead...which are fabulous.
1,Initially this producted worked fine but after a day or so they became finicky working not working working not working.....frustrating!!!!
1,These speakers were for my small office at work to help keep me relaxed and less stressed.  The speakers look great but I'm not realaxed!  The buzzing really gets on my nerves.
1,I wanted USB speakers to "conserve energy" avoiding an other power adapter always on. I don't use sound all that much and in the past cheap speakers always did the job for me. NOT this time: not only this speakers sound really really BAD but pick up so much static noise from the USB (even with the volume all the way down) they are UNUSABLE. My solution: I ripped the USB cable off and adapt it to my older $10 speakers making them USB powered! In short: stay away from the Cyber Acoustics CA-2016.
1,Pro- powered by USBCons- speakers interfere very badly with my 5.8GHz home phone. The phone gets so much static that it is unusable.- the sound in one of the speaker gets very distorted sometimes
1,Don't buy these speakers despite the attractive price if you plan on using a cell phone anywhere near them. The interference is soo horrible it makes this painfully loud and anoying buzzing/popping noise because they are not properly shielded by cell phone interference.Im mad that i got stuck with them but im going to buy a more expensive pair next time. definetly learned my lesson.
1,Ritz Camera offered to redeem my money for this purchase when I complained about the speakers not being what I was looking for. Apparently they have a good customer service department.
1,The speakers are very easy to hook up but the sound is terrible.  I've tried using equalizers on them to clean the sound up but no luck.  The voice gets caught in the background somewhere but the music is fairly clear.  Not a good choice in low priced speakers.
1,These speakers are unusable. They give off horrible feedback even when there's not a cell phone or cordless phone in the room.
1,Like several other reviewers I bought these thinking that 'they couldn't be *that* bad'.  But I was wrong.  They *are* that bad.  Yes they buzz annoyingly.  Yes nearby cell phones cause popping/buzzing in the speakers.  And beyond that within a few days the right speaker blew out (even at a very tame volume level).
1,There is an awful buzz that is present from the moment you turn them on.  I threw my pair out ten minutes after plugging them in.  A colossal waste of money.  I would rather have bought lunch for myself than waste money on these pieces of crap.
5,Excellent quality and excellent price. Company even called to confirm my recieving the item. Excellent service. I am a very satisfied customer. Would purchase from this company again and again.
1,I cannot get the computer to recognize the speakers cannot get any sound from them.
5,Fast and speedy service. Box and product in great condition. Thank you so much. I will definatley do business again.
1,We bought these speakers because they seemed decent for the price.  Five days later they started buzzing so we returned this cybercrap.  Don't waste your money on these pitiful Happy Meal speakers.
1,If you think these things are USB speakers - think again. They only get power from the USB port. You still have to plug them into the headphone jack on the computer.
1,These are terrible speakers.  There's tons of interference and the sound quality is awful.
1,This is the second pair of 2016 speakers I've tried and it suffers the same problem: Every bit of electronic interference from the PC is picked up and transmitted as high-pitched static. (I've tested on 3 PCs). It's unbearable. They are essentially useless.Based on the other reviews a large batch of these must have been defective. Either the magnetic shielding was left out or they are missing a resistor somewhere in the USB power inlet. Whatever they don't work so don't waste $1 or a second on them.
5,Great sound from these speakers. Very helpful with the USB plug in one less cord to worry about tripping over!
5,The shipping was more than the speakers and for what I used them for they serve the purpose.
5,These speakers sound great and were a real steal for under $10.00I highly recommend them!
1,WHEN I PLUGGED them into my 3.5mm WIRE....i got "NO SOUND"...EVEN...turning up the volume wide open on the one with VOL. control!!  THANX
5,I bought these speakers for a museum exhibit at our location and I had no budget so I pulled the trigger on these. TBH I didnâ€™t have high expectations but I was very surprised. The build quality is high and they fired right up. They are USB ONLY powered and they are good for speech but are not meant for pumping jams (music) so they are not loud. If youâ€™re looking for basic sound these are perfect!
5,The price and they worked great!
1,I plugged it in set it up and heard non-stop static with the worst quality of sound. These were NOT worth the money at all. I do not recommend these! I had to buy a completely different speaker set in the end.
5,I needed some speakers quickly and these are great. They work well for a good price. :)
5,These are good little speakers
5,Very nice little speakers good sound easy to install. I love them
5,Works good
5,Perfect for the price. Haven't had any issues
5,it does the job but goes in and out
5,I would purchase again.
5,works great
5,These speakers are great for the price.
5,Justo lo que buscaba para mi computadora de escritorio.
1,Don't waste your money
4,So these speakers retail for $8 or so dollars. Sound quality is exactly what you would expect at that price. Muffled and tinn-y sounding. However the volume does go quite high. For a 7 year old these speakers work just fine.
5,Nice little speakers. They do the job!
5,Ok
5,Perfection in sound
5,Very please
1,tried 3 different computers the buzz/hum is there on all....
5,Good product for the money.  Great value.Sound is a little hollow but it's ok.
1,I had a very specific set of requirements when looking for speakers and this hit the nail on the head.I needed a small USB powered speaker with a headphone jack. I did not need anything fancy with respect to sound quality and am happy with what I got. For the price you cant go wrong.EDIT: They pick up static like it is in style. I am glad I bought them because now I can dismantle them and use them for parts or to show the kids how speakers work.
4,They work wonderfully. My only complaint is the noise you hear in them while wearing ear phones. Other than that they're good for a cheaper speaker.
5,I had to get my son-in-law to set them up. As my computerwasn't recognizing the new product. Other than that the soundis great there isn't alot of hum. They don't take up much space.
1,The speakers are not shielded and pickup all kinds of background signals. Given the price you may think you could live with it but I'd recommend paying the extra for shielded speakers.
3,The sound quality was not superb but they did the trick for a while used for 2 months then I bought some higher end speakers.
2,The left speaker developed an annoying constant crackling sound after about 5 months of use.
2,It says usb powered but forgot to mention that it still needs the audio jack to work. either than that works fine
4,smaller then expected but adequate sound output.
1,Very poor sound quality. Had them for a week and replaced already
2,pas cher  pas bon
5,Item arrived very fast.  Easy to connect to computer with clear sound.
3,A decent price for speakers that work decently. I have a bit of static problem with the ones I have (even after fiddling with the connection etc) which I didn't have with my previous speakers and it gives me a headache at times if I leave them on. Otherwise they work fine.
3,Quality is ok for the price that you paid for. I personally purchased the Logitech S150 USB Speaker Oem and got these ones in case the others break --on to save on shipping fees:) However I must say they are a good pair of speakers for your 2nd laptop!
4,great sound for the price. But when no music or sounds is played sometime background noises can be eared.
3,I expected low quality for the price however I was annoyed with the constant buzz of radio chatter that was being picked up.
1,These speakers are hopeless.  They are powered via a USB connection and they pick up unending interference from the computer.  It's like listening to the internal processes of the computer.  Junk!
3,Broken due to children handling.
5,Satisfecha con la compra
3,Not what I expected but for under twenty bucks they serve the purpose.  No base to speak of and output of music in minimum
1,Worked for about a month and now the just cracle. Do not recommend.
4,j'en est fait cadeau a une personne et elle adore ses nouveaux speakers elle ne voulait pas me croire qualitÃ©/prix superbe
5,It's very good! I like it very much! It is esay to use and the sound quality of it is good.
4,This was sent to my sister in Sarnia Ontario to enable her to use Skype with me back in Teignmouth Devon UK and achieved this with no problem
1,If you want everything to sound like it's being pumped through a tin can by all means purchase these speakers! Otherwise don't bother. They are crap.**I wanted to NOT rate this item at all but amazon insisted....this product doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it**
1,me salio mal la bocina solo funciona un lado y se escucha como si tubiera un corto como un ruido
