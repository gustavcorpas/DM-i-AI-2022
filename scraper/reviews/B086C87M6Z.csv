4,i liked them. but they were crooked. as soon as i put them on i looked in the mirror and it was so noticeable. disappointed. but i learned to fix it on google! and they didn‚Äôt break! love them now
5,Came in a little crooked but I love the look
5,Lightweight cute comfy. What‚Äôs not to like?!
5,I absolutely love the style of these glasses!
5,La verdad esos lentes son otro mundo ya que son muy c√≥modos y muy compactos a la hora de llevarlos y la bolsa de tela que llevan es de buena calidad.
5,I tried a few different brands and these are by far the best and most comfortable. They have a very slight tint which is not noticeable but really helps with headaches.
4,I love them so much!! the color and the frame is amazing feel light weight. I was very disappointed as the glass were crooked and slanted as soon as i opened them out of the bag :((( i wish they weren‚Äôt messed up. still wearable but feel crooked and look a little crooked. üòî‚òπÔ∏è
5,Good
5,Keeping these glasses at bedside for the times when I want to use computer or phone before bed. Can use these and still get to sleep when done. Thumbs up!!
5,Great blueblockers great deal
5,These are my favorite glasses!
5,Lightweight
2,Feels cheaper than most of the 3d glasses they give out in the movie theatre 1 star because it does look half decent but feels like it's worth 50 cents
5,My eyes are not aching as before so I would rate this these as great.
3,Love the product but I‚Äôm huge on detail I was expecting a bit more frame on the glasses not it been so thin around the top of the glasses the frame has a bit of an angle slightly forward not sure why. Overall the style and color and frame comfort are there very nice product for those that would make it work with there face shape.
5,Definitely one of the best glasses! And cheap too!
5,Extremely lightweight nice fit and a good price for 2 pairs. Sometimes they start to slowly slide down because of no adjustable nose piece in either pair. Otherwise they‚Äôre nice & work well.
5,I have been using these for work. Because of covid my job is mostly online now. My eyes were strained and tired from all the extra screen time. I was hesitant to buy these as I wasn‚Äôt completely sold on ‚Äúblue light blocking glasses‚Äù and thought they were a waste. This has been worth the money. My eyes aren‚Äôt nearly as tired or strained at the end of work days. I don‚Äôt have headaches like I did. I would recommend this to anyone that is having strained eyes or headaches from an increase in screen time. I may buy another pair to have in case I accidentally break these.
4,Exactly like the photo. Perfect size for people with a small face. Fits really well. When I use them the "affect" reminds me a bit of when you turn on the warm or tone mode on your phone.
2,useful if you do not have blue-light prescription glasses
3,They seem hard to look through. strange but I‚Äôm not used to blue light glasses so maybe it‚Äôs me
3,These glasses fit well and I really like the style but they do not block blue light when tested against a blue light flash light or the blue light tests online.
3,Cute frame very light weight my only real issue with them is they are so light in the frame you can't adjust the frame at all. Would be nice to adjust they ear area especially.
5,Love them
4,I recommend these glasses for people who have strained eyes. For someone who looks at a screen for hours in a day these helped tremendously. One problem that I have crossed is that they do smudge easily so make sure you keep something to wipe the lens off with 24/7.
4,Love the look and work well for my smaller face but the lenses do get dirty easily it seems. I would buy again.
4,It does its job really well at blocking blue light. My eyes are definitely not as tired by the end of the day. My only minor complaint is that the frame feels very flimsy and loose like they‚Äôre going to break
5,After trying on PLENTY of Blue Light glasses that were oversized I have found these to be the PERFECT stylish accessory to keep my eyes from fatiguing during a long work day looking at screens. When I first got them I couldn't stop getting compliments from my coworkers on Zoom. I've recommended these to 15 different people at least. I may buy a few extra just to hoard them!
4,The look exactly as pictured ! Material really lightweight delicated and flexible ... I did saw the glass in not really attach to the base I‚Äôm a little bit scare that if they fall the glass may come out .Price and product balanced üòö
5,Exactly as advertised - would recommend to anyone who needs blue light frames!
4,Comfy to wear I wear them to draw on my tablet or play nintendo
5,Cute and helpful! Love them! Great fit and cute cute cute!
5,Great glasses! They are definitely light weight so you need to be careful with opening and closing them but they do come with an eyeglasses screwdriver so that can help. The lenses are for sure blue light glasses and I just love the shape! I have regular distance glasses that are the same shape which is why I sought these out. Very happy with my purchase! Affordable and they work! I recommend!
4,These are cute and comfortable! Not sure if they do much to help with the blue light burnout. 4 stars because the on camera these glasses read 100% blue so it looks like I‚Äôm wearing tinted sunglasses or something.
4,Super cute. I do school online all day and was getting headaches from being on the computer these helped but didn‚Äôt completely stop the eye strainü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,Looks good comfortable. Seems like it does it‚Äôs job at blocking blue light. I wear these at night before I go to sleep when I watch tv or use my phone. I feel like I‚Äôve been sleeping better since I started using these glasses.
4,She says she really likes them. Sorry I cannot be more helpful
4,They are good but sizing wise mine came in two different sizes one almost falls off my face
5,I have ordered a few bluelight glasses on Amazon that I have sent back and these are the best by far they fit my face well (I have a pretty standard sized face) look cool (I feel like Harry Potter) and they work their blue light magic.
4,kinda thin very cute and they work!
5,I love it and it's a perfect fit for my face. Nice and sturdy and even comes with a tool and a cloth to clean the lenses with. My eyes don't strain anymore when I'm looking at my screen.
5,I look at screens all day and they‚Äôve been really good with blocking the out blue light! They are also very comfortable and lightweight definitely recommend !
5,These are great because they cover your whole eye area! They are very much light weight and I would recommend them. They definitely help. I don‚Äôt see blue light. Comes with super cute packing as well.
5,I was scared to buy this item because I have a small face and some glasses do not look good on me. But these fit perfect!
5,I love it! It actually blocks the blue light and you can tell. They look and feel as if I bought them at the eye doctor. They‚Äôre so comfortable and high quality for only 16 dollars!!! 100% recommend.
5,They are super helpful and gets rid of headaches too!!
2,These glasses look great and feel good considering their low price. As far as I can tell they do block out a noticeable amount of blue light but it's not too much to where it's annoying or anything. Unfortunately I have consistently experienced worse eye strain when using a computer with these glasses on for more than 20 minutes or so. I purchased these to reduce eye strain not make it worse haha. Maybe this is just an issue for me but I won't be using these glasses much more.
5,Cute and comfy computer glasses! I love that they came with a little bag case and cleaning cloth. Not too tight on my face and fit right. Definitely channeling Harry Potter but in the cute way.
5,I am in front of a computer screen for majority of my work day and these glasses have helped protect my eyes from the harsh glares of the screen. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that they are cute too!
5,AMAZING! I love wearing these. However I can only wear these with my contacts and they work out perfectly.
5,I really like it. It does block out computer screen light so it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes. It is also very stylish.
5,Loved that it was light weight and comfortable. Came with a bag so it won't scratch!
4,Looks great!

3,I love the look & how light weighted they are. They are almost to light weighted. They are VERY loose & its very hard to make them stay on the face.

5,Runs small
5,Appoved!
1,Not the correct strength. Need to return.
2,Very small on your face this pretty much will only fit small faces so if you don‚Äôt got a super small face don‚Äôt buy em
2,The frames are much bigger in person than what the picture looks like.
1,Staring at my computer screen. Frame not wide enough for me. I'm not sure they work for Staring at a computer screen.
1,Very cute but made my head hurt beyond control. Also blurred my vision
1,Very flimsy and cheap feeling. They also kept on sliding down constantly.
1,The frames were extremely cheap and not good quality.
5,Great value for what I paid. I just wanted something to reduce my blue light exposure since I'm on a computer all day at work and my phone at night. These are super cute and lightweight and do what I need them to do.
5,I've tried purchasing multiple pairs of blue light glasses online because I have eye strain working on a computer all day. ( I know my staring at the phone in my off time isn't great either) but each pair I bought was much too large for my face and looked like I stepped into the 70s.  This pair fits great they are cute and round and they fit my face so much better! They have great blue light blocking so far. came with a mini screwdriver just in case which is good to have on hand. Very much looking forward to no headaches after work and being able to look cute while wearing them.
5,Great fit. Make a difference while on the computer all day.
5,The best blue light glasses I've used and both colors look so cute. I wear them every day since I sit behind a computer most of the time and they're comfortable and look great!
5,These are lightweight and fit great. I‚Äôm pretty small and was worried about getting glasses that were too big or bulky but these are perfect.
5,Very cute & lightweight! Love these glasses.
5,Super cute but not as suitable for small eyes people. The frames itself are adorable and are adorable on it‚Äôs just harder to wear when you have small face features
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The product is very light weight and comfortable. Just makes me feel normal and stylish at the same time. It's a wonderful product.
5,Nice look and using for my phone and tablet .
5,Nice but hands feel weak so I have to be extra careful.
5,These are excellent for the price! I was getting headaches from staring at a screen all day for work and they helped.

I forget to wear them sometimes but basically you need to wear them as if they were medical gpasses to really see a difference in how your eyes and head feels.
5,They are excellent glasses I wear them while I play video games. I have had less eye strain and they are cozy to wear only thing is they are very fragile and cheap

5,They fit perfect the way I wanted and are good blue light glasses
