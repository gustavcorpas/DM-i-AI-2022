5,Laptop started immediately after connecting the first time. Was leery about it working because of the low price. But was pleasantly surprised.
4,The correct charger for her computer; works as expected
4,Have one for home and now one at the office so don't have to carry it back & forth.  No issues.
5,Computer
4,When I first ordered this item it got ‚Äòlost in the mail‚Äô so I contacted Amazon and they were able to send me another one that came on time as promised. The product itself has been working well so far for my laptopüëçüèΩ
5,I realize my old one wasn't the problemdidn't need returned.
5,Que ya el original no servia.
4,Compatible w/laptop üëçüèæ
5,Excelente producto...perfecto funcionamiento.
5,It was nice and a fast charger
5,I went to a conference in DC and forgot my charger. Ordered this one delivered to a 7-11 kiosk and it saved me. Not only that but it‚Äôs smaller and lighter than the OGM which is great for traveling. This one now lives in my backpack so I don‚Äôt forget it again and my regular one can always stay in the office.
5,Perfect product and it works well.  The price was on point for me compared to other sellers online and in stores and I received it the next day in time for work.
5,Excellent
5,I ordered the wrong one looked to be a great charger tho I returned it and got a fast refund
5,Laptop
5,Quality product
5,Came in quick handy to replace an old charger.
5,Worked perfect for HP laptop
5,I would order this item again I am very satisfied
4,The cords came in a timely manner and fit.  This was a surprise as I had tried many "universal" chargers and none fit.  I will come back and evaluate the quality after they have been in use for a time.  Good service and the cords seem to be well made.
3,Used this for my HP Pavilion for about 4 months before the cable started to split and show exposed wires.
4,My dog chewed my charger that came with the laptop so I bough this as a replacement. It works well. No issues at all. It charges well no sparks or anything. I might even say it charges better than the real one I had. Definitely worth the buy.
5,I bought this so I would have a spare charger for my new HP Pavilion laptop. I reasoned that it was better to get one now than try to scramble to find one if the original is lost or broken.It functions just like OEM and charges the computer with no problems. Mechanically though the build quality isn't as good as the original. It's noticeably lighter and the plastic flexes a lot more. It also uses a different style of AC plug than the original HP charger so those parts aren't interchangeable.It's worth noting that often one of the places where aftermarket suppliers cut corners to save money on switching power supplies is heatsinks. Less heat removed from components = higher average operating temperature = shorter operating life. Given the weight difference between this supply and the OEM I suspect that is the case here. It works fine right now but time will tell.
5,works good
5,Es perfecto para mi laptop de trabajar gracias
5,used this to replace the one I had with the new computer
5,My HP Pavilion works fine with this power supply.
4,This product works as expected.  We did notice that the electrical cords aren't as thick as the original ones and have 2 prongs rather than 3 like the one received with the laptop.
4,I liked that it works I dislike it gets warm while using.
5,It was well packaged and was here on time and right for the money.
5,After months of sharing a cord with my wife (and no please don‚Äôt ask how well that went) we finally gave in and got a replacement power cord.  What FOOLS we were for waiting so long.  It worked right out of the box with no extra drivers needed. It‚Äôs durable as heck and very handy.
3,I bought this a few months ago and at first it worked fine....then all of a sudden one day I turn it on it started adjusting speed without me turning the dial. Would go really fast then slow down almost to a stop. Not it does nothing. Will not turn on.
5,I love it. Smaller than original cord
5,HIGH QUALITY AT A LOW PRICE
5,My original charger broke in the middle of the night during my spring break and by the middle of the following week I had this charger and it works great and has the same charging power. It works for my small touchscreen HP Pavilion x360 Convertible. Worth the purchase and it‚Äôs been about a month since I‚Äôve had mine
4,Exactly what I needed.
5,Works great and fast delivery
4,only slight problem the cord that plugs into the box comes loose occasionally otherwise good.
5,by a dell computer. It will start and give an error about the power adapter and then start up with the cpu throttled to 800mhz. I ordered the wrong one. That's my fault. I have used it in my hp laptop and it works great
5,Gracias
5,Fits my older HP chromebook just GREAT!
5,Good bang for the buck.
4,Great for the money
5,Works well for charging my laptop
5,No problem with the product
5,I used this cord for my computer. I waited too long for such a simple fix! I would order it again! The price was minimal and it travels well! I am sure it will last a very long time! Thank you for such a quality item!üåª
5,No comment
5,This item can be used for traveling. Very good value for the money.
5,Great replacement for my damaged one. Works just like the original one always did until damage.
5,Good as new.
5,This product is great and works great
5,Using it as my power pack for my laptop while traveling.  Product is of great quality and the vendor shipped and delivered as advised when purchased
5,Worked exactly like the one that came with the laptop did
5,Had out about two weeks and it works fine and doesn‚Äôt seem to get overly hot.
5,While traveling the TSA confiscated my old power supply why I don't know.  This replacement is exactly what I needed.  I checked at local tech stores and a generic replacement would cost $50+ but this one was an exact replacement of my original for $15.  I'm very happy with it!
5,Great product and fast shipping. Unfortunately did work with my laptop.
5,Great purchace!I have a HP laptop I lost the plug part so i got on amazon an started looking i found this one I really do review the reviews an see what others think b4 I buy. Some said good an of course you have your "picky ones." This after market charger works great an has since I got it i have it sitting on my table that is to my hip when I stand next to it why I'm telling you this because its plugged in to laptop an the power pack is laying on the floor and plugged in..Absolutely no problems with this charger an it's a plus it's not 3 prong its 2 even easier to plug in or find a spot.. Good luck hope you stop looking an purchace this one! It's just like my original! ‚ù§
4,Works as intended however I did run into two slight issues one of which could be a major downside to some.I realized after my laptop is charging up to around half the touchpad goes crazy and jittery and it becomes very difficult to use while charging luckily I have a USB mouse I can use while this happens but it is a nuisance for sure.Second issue the cable that connect to the little box thing is a little loose at times though this one is a very slight issue.Overall still works well though just bare in mind it could cause issues with touchpad possibly if it's not the exact right charger.
5,This is a great buy. It Was a great replacement of my original charger which was damaged by water.
5,This item arrived on time and fit perfectly!!!!!
5,Funciona bien.
5,Great item
5,This adapter was bought to replace one that was lost during a move. I looked up the adapter for that particular HP laptop and purchased it through Amazon. Arrived quickly and works with the laptop like the original. Highly recommended.
5,Product has worked well...
5,I like the fact that it works and I got it fast
5,Works at it should. Nice length cord and quick charging.
3,Okay it said to make sure all the codes matched on the power supply cord to the specs in the product.  I did that with a magnifying glass.  I received the product quickly and was happy that it looked the same down to the inside end blue ring on the male plug that goes into the computer.  The plug for the outlet is not three prong but seems to be okay. It powers up the computer but is loose.  It doesn't come out of the hole but it could if I am not careful.  My laptop is on the edge so it was a quick fix until I buy another one.  I am using a HP Stream laptop which was on the list for a true fit.  I took a chance but like I said it is not a tight fit like my factory made cord.
4,I bought this to replace the original power supply cord for my HP laptop. The rectifier on the old one (that big box on the wire) was getting scary hot.This one arrived from Amazon in about 36 hours and works fine.Rectifier does get hot if I'm running the computer (say watching YouTube) while plugged in but no where near as hot as the old one.  If computer is closed and plugged in to recharge there does not seem to be a heating issue.In any event I'm perfectly satisfied and the cost was just 13 bucks and change.
4,I'm not sure how but when my battery reaches 100% my laptop starts getting performance glitches and hiccups while plugged into this adapter. The touchpad isn't as responsive and randomly clicks and the responsiveness isn't as normal. So this is good for charging the laptop but I can't leave it plugged in while using it. My factory adapter doesn't cause this issue. Works fine while charging though and I got it as a spare to keep around to charge up so it fits my use needs for now. If my factory adapter ever breaks though I'll look for an official device to replace it.
4,Very much like original equipment.
5,The price is excellent. Hope it lasts longer than the original HP charger. That one lasted 5 months.
1,Almost from the first time I used this item I found that it was not charging my battery.Looking closely at it it appears as if the pin that connects to my laptop charge port fits poorly. This has been an ongoing problem over the past 18 months until now when it will not connect at all therefore does not power my laptop nor charge my battery. Now once connected I found that rotating the device 1/4 to 1/2 turn in either direction would then allow charging.How do I know it's a fit problem? By borrowing a friend's charger from the identical HP laptop model. Their's plugged in requiring a small amount of *pressure stayed in place and has been working flawlessly.(*The unit purchased through Amazon required NO pressure to insert which leads me to believe that the DJW Ac Adapter/Power Cord is imprecisely manufactured. My friend's factory original. Can it be that the laptop's internal component "grasps" the inserted pin and the DJW unit's pin is slightly too large to make a proper electrical connection -- that it doesn't "seat" properly? That's my guess...)
5,I use it as a backup. It does exactly what it was described to do exactly what I need it to do. It's great!
1,I bought this as a backup power cord for my HP laptop.  During the day I always use the OEM power cord it came with.  ONCE IN A WHILE this backup cord gets used.  Maybe used it 30-40 times since buying always being careful about the connectors on each end.  It rarely gets wound up as there's no need to where it is stored.  So this cord has been well taken care of.  Recently I noticed my laptop just dying within 5 min. of plugging in this cord after getting my "You have less than 20% battery left plug in your cord" message.  It only happens the FEW times I use this cord and never when using my OEM laptop's original cord.This cord makes it look like the laptop is charging (yes I do check my laptop battery at times) yet it ACTUALLY IS NOT CHARGING.  And it randomly does all of this.  And no it isn't 'operator error' on my part and I have no such issues like this when using the original OEM cord.  At this point I will suggest that you DO NOT BUY this cord despite the other high ratings.  If the Seller wants to contact me to discuss this then I would consider editing this review.  If not then I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.
5,This chord was perfect. Very fast delivery
5,I was told under customer reviews that it wouldn't work for a model 14 but I bought it anyways due to urgent need. I have a model 14-dk1031dx and it works perfectly so far looks just like the original. Came a day earlier than I expected too which is a bonus. Only downside is I bought it within a "Get it Tomorrow" window listed by amazon and the projected delivery date was 4 days away. Not sure if that's amazon's fault or the seller's but that's the only grief I have.
3,The problem I had with this is a part was missing. I bought it to hook up to my Hewlett-Packard pavilion G series laptop. I needed a plug that looks a little smaller than a dime which hooks up to the other adapter pictured here. Without this additional part I could not use this and returned it. I found a kit containing all the necessary adapters and plugs from office Depot
5,Left my charger at a hotel on vacation.  This charger was less expensive than the cost to ship my charger back from hotel.  Works fine charges fine.  Have only had it a couple of weeks at this point but everything is working great so far.
5,On a Sunday afternoon I realized that the plug to my 6 month old lap top was extremely hot.  I realized in order to keep working I had to get a new plug ASAP.  I went on Amazon and found my saving vendor!  The plug was sent out instantly and it was a perfect fit!  I do not remember ever having less than 24 hour turn around.  The plug is exactly like what came with the laptop only it works very well.  Thank you for saving my project!
5,The fact I can post this review thanks to having my new power supply is all you need to know.
5,Chargers works well. Truthfully outside of going to the store and just asking someone to find me the damn charger (truthfully I‚Äôm a i don‚Äôt need a map kind of guy) i had absolute hell trying to find the charger that fit the HP pavillion. But low and behold here she blows. Charger works. Showed up quick quick like felt like someone was just waitin on me to order this thing quick. And turned a worthless computer to my wifes primary tool for business. Thanks y‚Äôall
5,I needed a charger to take on a trip i was taking my laptop on and this was perfect for the job. it stays packed in my bag along with my back up cell phone charge cord.
5,Works fast and dirable
3,I only bought it for Dusk to Dawn mode.  It turns off in the middle of the night and its pitch dark out!
4,This works great as I had to replace my cord the only thing I don't like is that the cord is not as long as the cord that I replaced.  If it was just as long or longer I would give it 5 stars.
5,Value for money
5,very nice
5,No complaints.  Great value.  I bought this product as a replacement a couple of months ago.  The cord that my HP laptop originally came with was cheap and within the first couple of days the plastic sheath around the cord pulled away from the converter exposing the wires within the cord.This replacement has been durable and shows no signs of failing like my first cord.  The only differences between the original cord and this product are: (1) it is slightly lighter weight than the original (2) the Velcro for tying the cord is shorter and (3) it has a two-prong plug rather than three prong.  It has been an excellent replacement.  No complaints.
5,The charging cord fit and worked as the seller described. I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase.
4,It came on time and is exactly what I wanted for a spare for my laptop since I am at 2 locations often.. Only one thing I don't like the box gets hot too easily/quickly.
5,HP power cord ports are notoriously faulty at least in my Pavilion laptop. My original cord would drop out if you moved the laptop at all; sometimes it would look connected but the battery drained because the cord was in but worked itself loose. I though I‚Äôd have to buy a new laptop. I decided to see if a new cord would solve the problem and it did! Thank you for saving me hundreds of dollars!
5,I gave 5* all around for this item. In all honesty it‚Äôs a bit early to give a ‚Äúdurability‚Äù review‚Äù but everything is else has been great!
5,good product
3,Looks like a decent charger. The charging port is smaller so does stay in I'd have to hold it the whole time. Will have to return.
5,My son kept leaving his adapter to his school chrome book at school.  I bought in case of emergencies so he could continue his daily remote schooling.  Was great!
5,I lost my original charger for my HP 17 laptop.  I knew I could get one on Amazon  Yep but a lots of choices I picked this DJW 19.5 even though it did not mention working for my 17 but it had the same wording of what I needed.  It arrived quickly and was perfect in fact it was even a little smaller then the original which made it more convenient and it had the little blue plug tip  Happiness is it works great!!
5,Hopefully this thing lasts... If it breaks within that 3 month period that so many cheap products do I'll update : 4 months and still good! I went to Walmart while waiting for this to arrive and bought a charger that was HP brand and said to be a universal fit. My laptop kept informing me that it wasn't a compatible charger. I've never gotten that notification using this charger! I'm very satisfied with this purchase! SCREW YOU HP! :)
5,Perfect fit for my HP laptop.  Arrived quickly after our dog ate the original
5,I forgot to pack my laptop charger for a big trip and needed my laptop for work. The local Best Buy had one universal charger with several attachments to fit different laptops. But it was a 65 watt charger and my laptop was only a 45. I was assured it would work. It fit showed it was plugged in but not charging. Ugh! And it was very pricey! I found this charger on Amazon for a fraction of the price ordered and it arrived the next day (because of the city I was in) and I returned the other back to Best Buy. Charger is still going strong! Arrived quickly and packaged appropriately. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
5,NA
5,I purchased this Ac adapter as a replacement for my HP Laptop. My previous Ac adapter just stopped charging. I was a little concerned about ordering a replacement from another company other than HP but to my surprise I plugged it in it started charging my laptop and boy way I thrilled. I am more than pleased to have purchased this item for the very affordable price and quality it just proved to me that a brand name is just that. I can rely on other product at best.
4,For traveling it's light and doesn't get to hot.Only thing that bothers me is the plug that connects to the square and wall isn't snug. It falls out of the block fairly easily so I'm always replugging back into the box.
5,I left my power cord in an airport and panicked when I realized it. It was faster to order a new cord than to try to track it down through lost and found and I am not close to any tech stores to purchase one face to face.  Scheduled arrival was 4 days but it actually arrived in 3. Thank you!
5,Love the quick delivert
4,I am constantly moving between home and office so I bought this power cable to use at home. It works as expected however the section of cable between the computer and the brick is shorter than standard. I run it from my computer over the back side of the desk and the brick hangs in the air because the cable isn't long enough to reach the ground.
5,Good product for the price. Seems to be working well.
5,Great value for money
5,Awesome
4,Works perfect
5,Works perfectly for my HP laptop. It gets really hot‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt they all? Compact and great for travel. Comes with the little Velcro strap so you can wrap it up and keep it from getting tangled up in everything. Great value for the price.
5,Bought this to replace the original cord that wore out from use and family yanking out of the port..
5,Mine got a kink in the cord that slowed down the charging. Ordered this one and I'm in business again.
5,Exactly what I needed so I can use my laptop! Came quickly and was delivered in perfect condition!
5,Went through my third charger from Walmart that I spent close to $30 for and got tired of wasting my money. Bought this for $12 and it hasn‚Äôt failed me yet! Charges my laptop great and I‚Äôve been using it for a long while. Will no longer waste my money on junk from Walmart and will be ordering my cords from this company from now on!
5,I purchased this laptop ‚Äúpower cord‚Äù as a connivence in my home. The children are using laptops for daily on- line schooling and we also have a family laptop. It is difficult for me to access the various outlets in the home they are at baseboard level having a spare power cord in a centralized location has been very helpful. The power cord brick and entire product is a great value for the money.
5,We have a mean cat that is apparently suicidal. He chewed through the power cable on my son's laptop and we don't know how he didn't end up getting hurt. This cat is three years old and this is his second attempt at Seppuku but at least we found a cable to replace the old one (which works just as well as the OEM) and we can afford to put orange oil all over this one to keep the Rage Cat from checking out.
4,Good price and charges well!
1,This is a lawsuit a death or a catastrophe waiting to happen‚Ä¶probably all 3.I‚Äôve had it for a couple days & noticed the battery wasn‚Äôt holding a charge then realized it was ready to ignite.I posted a pic of the temp after I unplugged it.  Amazon should not be selling a product that is a safety hazard.  The specs are exact for my HP computer
4,I wish that there was an additional reinforcement where the wire enters the plug.
4,Gets a little hot when charging from dead to full but other than that works wonderful for my hp 15.6 !
4,Plug works with my HP laptop. It you move the computer it will easily come unplugged.
5,I'm always having to take my laptop to clients and was getting tired of plugging and unplugging it from my desk.  This second cord supply goes with me everywhere and I can leave one back at the office.
3,It doesn't really fit in the charge chamber. It keeps falling out.
5,Works well.
5,Thought my 2 y/o laptop had died.  It went out while I was using it the screen shrinking from the sides to disappear as a black hole in the center of the screen.  Decided to get a power cord - if it worked snd brought the laptop back to life great.  If it didn‚Äôt Amazon returns are easy.
5,It worked perfectly.  I was glad to be able to have it to have an extra charging cord for traveling.
4,Works great
5,I was very excited to find a replacement cord as mine grew legs and walked away. The price was awesome it arrived on time and very well packaged. Unfortunately I needed to return it because it didn‚Äôt fit my laptop. The return process was so easy. The seller is amazing!!!
5,I am pleasuntly surprised at the quality of this product. The value for the money is worth it's weight in gold when you're in need of a cord as I was. Also the seller of this product is very attentive and took the time to make sure that I was happy. You don't find that very often. The product is very durable and well made. You will be happy that you chose this one for sure. Happy shopping ü•∞
5,stars
4,Works for what I wanted it for :)
3,I was so happy that the plug portion did work on my laptop but what i have found out that it is so loose that it falls out of my laptop and my laptop turns off.other than that it works fine
4,Works as advertised arrived quickly.as good as original would recommend.
4,It is not exactly like the original but it seems to work fine. I've been using the two I bought for a few months now. I bought a new HP laptop during Black Friday and it came with a cord but I like to leave one plugged up at home one plugged up at one and one I carry with me all the time in my backpack to go. The original charges faster from dead/dying but the other two I bought do charge quickly. I do find it kind of ironic that the seller however recently contacted me asking me to leave a review AFTER the return window had recently closed (if I would have had a problem).
4,Reasonably priced for a replacement cord.  works perfectly
4,Works perfect only issue is the box part of the cord keeps detaching from the rest at even the slightest tug. It also gets very hot which is hazardous but that might also be a personal PC issue.
5,I had left the charger for my laptop 2 hours away at a family member‚Äôs home and needed to charge my laptop so I ordered a spare. This product did the job.
5,I am very pleased with the power adapter I received from you.  It came in the stated amount of time and I have had no problems with my computer since I started using it.  Thank you again for the excellent product service and follow up email.  Pat
5,Needed an extra for convenience. This was excellent. I keep my laptop used for work at home at desk. With keyboard & monitor. And this is for my porrtability.  I have an HP 15 pavilion laptop 1t Hs. SS. 6 or 8  mem
5,Works great
4,Lost the original.  Chose the cheaper model available works fine
5,I love the power adapter for my HP laptop.  It has great charge.  Very affordable and great quality.  I use for traveling.  I checked a universal power adapter at a electronic store.  They wanted $50.  No thank you.  Great deal and bargain.
5,Computer cables are not al the same and Amazon made it easy to find purchase and receive the right one!
5,This particular item was ordered for my laptop and it was a perfect fit.
5,This power cord was exactly what we needed and it works great. Our power cord was frayed and no longer delivering power so we needed a new one. This one has us up and running again. Fast delivery and great price.
5,Received as promised in a timely manner....
3,This worked at first and I thought this was  good value. We used it a few times and now it doesn't work. I originally thought it may be my computer but I used an authentic manufacturer cord from another computer in the house and there was no issue. Do not buy this is is faulty and cannot be relied on. I would return but too much time has passed.
5,At first I was hesitant to order other than original equipment for my laptop I took the risk and I am very pleased with this product it does the job for half the price and it gets shipped in an expedite fashion. It complies with all original equipment specifications does the job it is intended for overall I am satisfied with this laptop charger so far. Thanks!
5,It was time for a new power cord
4,I had problems with my original purchase and they sent out a new charger right away. I got it very fast. Thank you so much.
5,I bought this charger as a replacement one for my HP Touchsmart 15. It works great and fits just right.
4,Works fine... but cord that connect the device to the outlet slips out easily.
5,I lost my charger when I moved about two years ago and haven‚Äôt been able to use my laptop. I got this and it‚Äôs amazing!! I can finally use my laptop and I didn‚Äôt have to spend the extra money it costs at name brand stores to get a replacement! Highly recommend.
1,It didn‚Äôt work with my computer so it was a waste of my name I had to return this so I was really sad because I needed this for school to charge my Chromebook so just so you know it doesn‚Äôt work on like school chrome books so I‚Äôm very sad
5,I had lost my adapter to my chromebox during a movie and it come in quite handy
5,Whenever I get a new laptop I always get at least one extra adapter. This way I can keep it in my laptop bag and never forget it at work or when I travel. The adapters directly from the manufacturers are very expensive so I keep looking for better bargains. This adapter was simply excellent. Works perfectly very reasonably priced and just what I needed. I'd buy again from these folks in a heartbeat.
5,My work laptop was upgraded and as I use it at work and at home I don't want to keep packing and unpacking a single power cord when I go to/from work.I bought this replacement power pack so I can have power at home and it's great.  Charges well and no problems.Now I just need a second one to keep as a travel power cord and I'll be all set.
5,Fits real nice
4,fits my hp laptop fine. works great. thank you
4,great product
5,I have a hard time absorbing that these pieces can be made packaged shipped 1/2 way around the world inventoried put on the shelf picked and then sold and  shipped to me and they worked fantastic when they got to me.  Kudos to the Logistics people.
5,it fits my laptop and it works great.
3,Or is good connected to my computer without a problem and charges the battery It just has a problem of getting hot too fast.
5,We had an emergency with the dogs eating my daughters charger one night of course right as online schooling was just beginning! I did a quick search and prayed it was the correct charger. The next day it arrived and it fir perfectly! Easy to wind up cord for on the go charging.
5,This adapter is being used for HP Pavillion laptop with the blue inner plug. Trust this company to help you decide which one you need by color as to the size of the pin in the charging port. Good company and the price was much better than factory
5,Wasn‚Äôt sure if it would actually work but I did and I saved a lot of money. When the little silver piece bent and broke off of my laptop charger I needed to replace it. Ordering this one from Amazon was quick easy and inexpensive. Best of all it worked!
5,Ty for on time workable durable product
5,Exactly as described and pictured. Lost my charger over a year ago and havent replaced it because I thought it would be expensive. When I ordered this I was skeptical because of how cheap it was. I'm amazed. I plugged it in and it worked perfectly. I also love that the box does not overheat.
5,I bought this power cord as a second cord for my laptop for travel. I didn't want to have to unplug the cord that came with my computer every time I took my computer with me. Works perfectly to suit my needs.
4,Second time I ordered the last one lasted a couple of years.  But the cost compared to a US OEM is much less.  I was surprised that the cord was different on this one.  The power cord had three plugs where the last one had two.
5,I use this Adapter for laptop hp-14dq1033cl. Every single day. So far so good - it's cold / slightly warm no led ( which is good because  asus' adapter has too bright led) wires are not too hard and flexible enough. I'm pretty happy with the purchase
5,Worked perfectly for my laptop. Couldnt be happier & the cost is great. Make sure your laptops part number matches the ones listed as HP has over the years used many different power supply plug sizes.
5,Replacement was a good fit.
5,Love this and next day delivery was awesome. Didn't think it would work but it was just what I needed. Thanks for the speedy service and great product.
5,I am soooo glad I took the time to research some more on this site and try this. It works perfectly is good quality and sure is a lot better than ordering the one from HP quoted at $65.00! After being on hold for some time being told they no longer made one for my laptop (my dog chewed the wire in half) they then said they miraculously found one and would ship it out for that exorbitant price and have it here in 10 days. I said no thanks in disgust and hung up. Found this one shortly thereafter and got it in the usual 2 days and am oh so happy! PTL for Amazon!!!
4,I just received this and it works perfectly right now.  I cannot review it‚Äôs longevity but hopefully it will last a long time.
5,Shipping wAs fast even considering this covid year.  The item was described well enough to help me select the correct cord for my laptop.  This is not something I do frequently so I was a bit concerned.  It Fit perfectly and has worked efficiently.
4,I'm using a HP pavilion-15 touch laptop N5Y90UA#ABA and so far no problems in the last few months and it does not cause battery problems whatever I got the battery from HP or somewhere else.
5,A back up power cord for traveling at a good price!
4,I like the fact it has two prong rather than the usual three it makes it a lot easier when I‚Äôm traveling to find an outlet.
5,I purchased a HP laptop 5-6 years ago and the charger just stopped working. I found this charger on Amazon and it works great! I am very pleased with this selection!
5,So far this product is working as expected
5,My dog chewed my charger and I have been searching for a charger for the longest time and I found this one purchased it and it works just has good as the original charger I got with my computer totally worth the purchase and it came very quickly
5,It came  quickly and  a good  value
5,Because my laptop is a much older model I was worried I wouldn't find a power cable that would match.  Luckily this cable matches many models of laptops and has easily replaced my broken one.  It has proved to be quite durable so far and I was so happy to find this power cord for such a good price!
5,This power adapter works very well it does not produce a large amount of heat so it should be efficient.Only one criticism is that it is about a foot shorter than OEM.
5,Does the job for an AC adaptor that died. Looked at the old one to determine its specs went on Amazon and found this items whose specs were identical. Easy peasy.
2,The plug does not fully fit into the port and the laptop was listed on the list that it was compatible with. It charges but falls out if I move the laptop.
4,it works
5,The cord to the outlet is approximately 5 feet long.  Six feet would have been a little bit better for my particular requirements but 5 feet is probably fine for most people.  Still very happy with the purchase and all works fine.
5,Bought for my husbands computer since his original charger broke it arrived in time and it works great I also was able to use it for a tv that I got with no cord and I was able to use the charger for it!
5,Was exact replacement for the one I lost and delivered quickly.
3,The end that plugs into my laptop won't stay in. I have to keep pushing it in to keep the charge.
5,It fit my laptop
5,The charger works! Lol. I‚Äôm leaving a review because I found it super nice that they emailed me to ask how the charger was working for me and to let me know they would accommodate me if it wasn‚Äôt. 5 stars for sure.
5,Everything worked like is as it should fair price good deal
5,Prompt deliveryAs advertised
5,So happy we got exactly what we needed and for a reasonable price. Thank you
4,Works well.  Good price.
4,Good product with sufficient chord length to improve flexibility of connection.However while the Charging device is connected To my Lap Top it is unable to recognize it!
3,The replacement cord is holding up fine many months in so I'm upping my review to a 3 star. Good for them for replacing it I am thankful.
4,I bought this toward the end of October 2016. I am in school and unhooking and hooking up my current charger was irritating sometimes I would forget it. So i bought this one as an extra power supply and to put in my backpack to carry with me. I haven't had it that long but it is working fine for what I need it for. Also it is lighter than the one that came with my laptop but serves it's purpose. So yes I am happy with it and would buy another if needed.
5,Works perfect! I was in a bit of a bind and wasn‚Äôt able to use my laptop being able to get an inexpensive charger like this one fast was great. I haven‚Äôt had any problems with it.
3,It worked great but the cord is quite a bit shorter.  Not happy about that.
5,With remote learning my daughter's laptop has done a lot of traveling this school year.  When the original plug going into the laptop became damaged she was in a panic.  This power cord/adaptor was delivered quick and saved the day!
5,The charger is very cheap and it works great. Although it does appear to be on the shorter side. When I'm sitting on my desk and charging my laptop the main battery is suspended in the air. It makes things a little awkward but overall it's a great product.
4,Awesome
4,This is a good product as a replacement. It will do the job. With it being a Chinese replacement the plastic does get a bit warm when downverting from 220V. If I lose another one I would still buy again and ensure well ventilated.
5,I needed a second charger for my personal computer that I could leave at work. This works great and was a very reasonable price!
5,I liked the price and how fast it got to me.
5,I ordered this charger in January and it still works great! I have a HP Pavilion laptop and it fit perfectly. I was skeptical about buying an off brand charger but it works just as good as an HP charger would except it's way cheaper saved me money!
4,replaced cord/xfmr for one lost in the Harvey flood. Could not find at any local store so bought online thru Amazon
5,I misplaced power cord for my work laptop so working remotely was a little challenging. I browsed through compatible products and decided on this because it was the best value. It worked like a charm. No more worries.
4,I was a little concerned about ordering  but after reading the reviews took the chance.  It works great so far!
4,So far this charger has been working perfectly. No issues. I hope it continues as much less money that to replace it from HP
5,Perfect cord for extra traveling !!!
4,works as it should
4,Still working great months after being bought and used. Only issue I have had with the power chord is the power box. It gets so hot it has literally burned my hand. So please be careful. I dont touch it anymore except with a hand towel or potholder.. I usually sit it on a potholder and makes it easier to remember how hot it is and makes it easier to move.
4,Everything was good
5,I needed a replacement charger quickly after I dropped my laptop. Shipping was fast price was great and it works as it's supposed to with no issues at all.
5,The charger works good so far for 15 inches HP 2n1 laptop. About the durability I'm not certain on that . It's too early to give excellent credit but 4 stars is more than enough for now. Material quality: Pass the QC (quality Control) so 5 star for that. Value for money: Absolutely excellent if there is 10 stars I will give 10. And hey DJW no need to send the mouse pad I don't need it. Just kept up the good quality of your charger and I'm sure we as a consumer will always order your product.Thanks
5,I‚Äôve had this product for months now and it‚Äôs last me longer than my own charger. Really glad i got this product would definitely recommend to others
5,It does it‚Äôs job
4,I had to order another because it came apart. Besides that it charges my daughter‚Äôs computer with no problem.
5,The block is substantially lighter than the original meaning it could be missing some kind of feature or overheat based on what Google says. Mine works great and I have no complaints so far. My laptop is 6 years old and they don't even make the original charger anymore.
5,Just what I needed
5,I like the item.
5,Our daughters laptop we ordered from Best Buy was missing the charger cord. We were given $20 to replace the charger. Thankfully we found this deal and so far works well to charge the laptop.FYI...if you purchase a laptop and something is missing review to cost before you call. The actual charger that should have been with the laptop costs $60+ to replace.
5,My Son was in a jam as his laptop adapter suddenly quit working. He's a smart 16 year-old taking college classes and needed one ASAP for his class work/homework/Projects.  Universal adapters at Wal-Mart and Best Buy were over $40/$50.  I ordered this one for $12.99 and it arrived in two days!  My Son was able to charge his laptop using a friends charger to keep him up and running until we received the new one and because of the speedy shipping verything worked out wonderfully with no down time issues!  Thank You!
5,Needed to replace my old cord after our 3 year old damaged the old one. This inexpensive replacement was just what we were looking for. Thank you!
5,It arrived on time and works great. I havent use it to much but it makes sure my computer is charged and I can use it.
4,Bought as a replacement after my first cord replacement gave out. Works as expected.
5,I lost my charger and was desperate. We ordered it the charger arrived quickly worked well and was much better priced then I expected. I'm very happy!
5,Product arrived in timely manner. Fits my laptop as promised.
5,My original laptop charger was bent in such a way it wouldn‚Äôt charge at all. I was worried it may have been the laptop itself so I was hesitant in buying a new charger just for it not to work but I took the chance and this one works great.
4,It works great thank you
4,Bought this cord to replace the cord for my HP 360 laptop. My cord got shredded and needed a replacement quick since I am in school. This works like a charm without a hangup! I love that it is small and compact. My only hangup is that it is not a grounded cord but I have had no problems and any of the sites that I have been at with my laptop. It charges up just as quickly.
5,It was a perfect replacement for the one I lost
5,I bought this in October 2020 and less than 4 months later and 8 days after I could return it it died completely. It is inexpensive but does not last. I would not recommend this power adapter based upon my experience.
5,PERFECT FIT AND WORKS REALLY WELL!!!!
5,ThisLcord fit my HP laptop perfectly. My old cord would not stay in the port and had to be replaced. It was a great purchase!
5,good to have an extra power chord. this product was just right.
4,Arrived quickly and as advertised. Works fine but does seem to charge a little bit slower than the plug in that came with my HP laptop. Overall great buy for the money!
5,No problems arrived on time works perfectly.
5,Broke my laptop charger and needed a replacement. This one works nicely and is a very good price! Shipping was speedy and they even reached out to me10/10 will buy again
5,It work well with my laptop
5,I left the charger for my HP Spectre360 at my Dad's house half way across the country.  Rather than bothering him to send it back to me I purchased this cord as a replacement.  It arrived before my laptop lost its charge the adapter plug fits perfectly and my laptop recharges normally.  Everything you want and expect at a good price.
5,My computer stopped running because the wires were frayed on my adapter.  Order this one and my computer is working fine.
5,Good for the price
5,I just received this and am gonna return it.  I am not going to need it.  No problem with product or service just found the lost one.
5,We had a mouse in the air conditioner area behind the dashboard so it wasn‚Äôt easy to spot or get to without removing.  This camera was exactly what we needed to drop down into a small space.  The lightning and camera picture were spot on.
4,The product works great.  The prong easily bends.
5,I have bought extra power cords in the past at a much higher price.  This power cord was a great price enough to have a power cord in our travel trailer as well as my office and the living room both places in the house where I spend the most time working on my PC.  And of course it works perfectly.
5,This cable works perfectly with my HP laptop
5,Arrived fast. Great!!
5,My HP laptop charger quit.  I found one from this seller and blindly bought it.  I didn't have the laptop specs because I could not look them up on a dead computer.  Shipping was faster than expected and my laptop powered up right away.
5,i think i'll get another as backup
5,It worked great.  My HP notebooks original cord got hot and stopped charging my notebook.  This replacement cord was the exact fit.  Works perfectly.  No problem!
5,Don‚Äôt be discouraged based off the price this works great for my HP laptop. This is my second time purchasing (misplaced the first one)
5,Product arrived on time and was as advertised. The charger has worked for a month so far flawlessly. Works with my laptop as the manufacturer said.
5,I was looking for a spare charging cable/block for a HP Pavilion. This was a great price compared to OEM. Be sure to note the color of the tip. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and it charges like it should.
5,Worked as expected received in one day.
5,Works absolutely perfect for my HP touchscreen
5,It met my needs
5,Cord is compatible with the battery replacement and my laptop.
4,I am very happy with this product.  I arrived in a timely manner.  Thank you.
5,We have an older laptop and this charger worked and fit perfect.  It doesn't over heat. I would definitely recommend
5,The adapter works great! I was kind of leery about ordering one from someone other than the HP Co but it fits perfectly. Arrived quickly too!
5,The charger works great no matter where I take it.
5,My original power cord got old and was no longer keeping charge. I decided to give the power cord a try. Well....Great product! It's perfect for my laptop and amazingly very affordable. I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,Had to get a replacement for my mom's laptop. This arrived just in time before she left on vacation and works like a charm.

5,Ordered to replace a lost laptop power adapter this works great. Good price and delivered quickly. No complaints at all.
5,Everything works well!! Love it. I am a broke college student and when my laptop charger broke this came in clutch!
5,We bought the 45W Ac Adapter/Power Cord Supply for HP Pavilion for 2 of our laptops.  These showed up quickly and work wonderfully.
5,This replacement charger has proven to be a great buy. It saved my bacon for computer based learning when home from school but forgot to get my charger. Exactly what seller promised!
5,The adapter arrived quickly.  I use this adapter has a extra adapter/power cord to move my laptop from room to room. It works well and I am very satisfied with purchase.
5,Extra laptop charger for home and office and car so we don‚Äôt have to remember it when we travel
5,my girlfriend took my laptop and managed to lose the power cord.  this one works as expected and is a  lot less expensive than hp's.
5,Hello :) Overall this was a pretty great replacement cord for my laptop. Acts just as good as the one that came with my laptop and charges in around the same amount of time. I do recommend you buy it for a replacement :))
5,I used this for an HP Pavilion 15T.  It worked without any probelms.
4,Same as above. Good value
4,works just like the original
5,I am so happy to be able to find a replacement Power Cord for my computer!!!!!  It was advertised so specifically that I was able to find it.  I thought I would never find it.  Thanks Amazon!!!
5,This is just like the original but cost a lot less.. It works perfectly. It even comes with a 12 month warranty which usually means they know you won't have any issues with it.  I highly recommend as a replacement for the original.
4,My original adapter tip got bent and would no longer charge. The replacement fits well. Instead of having a 3 prong plug- this has a regular 2 prong plug. The box on the cord (where the two plugs connect) gets hot quickly
5,Meets my expectations!
5,It worked great
5,Thank you for manufacturing a product that does what it says it will.  I've had it for almost 2 months now and it still is not hot barely warm.  The one that this replaced used to get too hot to hold.  This is perfect.
5,This power cord was very close to the original only much less expensive and seemingly well built!  Thanks
4,Works great.
5,Replaced the lost cord to HP Laptop.
5,Item arrived quickly it was as described in the listing and is working well.
5,Exactly what I needed to get my computer charged and working!! Quick service and packaged well!! Thank you thank you!!!
4,For now the product is still working good
5,Love how fast it charges my computer. Does not get warm at all. Works perfect for me and price was great.
5,We lost our cord for our laptop it was nice and easy to replace it and with the color code tip it was easy
4,Forgot my charger at my grandmothers house (who live out of state). I bought this one until I could get the original back. I was a little worried that maybe it would affect my computer but with 2 months use the battery of my laptop was not damaged charged it very fast and the battery lasted a long time without dying.
5,My old cord was worn out and this works perfect to replace the old one!
5,I really needed a new cord since my puppy chewed up my old one and this one fit perfectly! It arrived on time and wasn‚Äôt super expensive. Would definitely buy from them again.
5,Worked perfectly
5,This was perfect.  My kid lost her power adapter and needed this cord for remote learning after the school issued chrome book died.  This power cord came quick and she did not miss a beat
5,My Elitebook quit powering on after about five years of use.  It was out of warranty and service or (original) HP parts would have cost an arm and a leg.  After determining that the old power supply was not charging the laptop I searched for and found this quality aftermarket replacement power supply from DJW.  They shipped very quickly and the new power supply performed well which saved me some cash.  Great experience with this seller!
5,My old Laptop Cord got caught in my electric recliner and cut it. Ordered this hoping it would work..  Works Great !!
5,We bought this as an additional supply source for HP laptop.  The one that came with the computer is in the desk and something we didn't want to move around ( hard to unplug).  This power supply can be moved and is used in another room when laptop needs plugged in.
5,This product helped keep my son's computer up and running so he could do his school work.
5,Perfect and fast
5,works very well
5,Works as it should
3,did not have initial and have not had any issue with charger
5,This item is great for my laptop. Bought it as a second plug to keep at home when may need to work from here.  It is great and will highly recommend. Shipping was super fast as well.
5,Delivered promptly and works.
4,Like the quality of the product  but it don't fix my computer
4,I've had to purchase a few cords for my HP Spectre since the metal charging piece has broken off previous cords.  This works well and I also like that I don't have to carry a cord adapter to convert a three pronged plug into a two pronged plug depending on the outlets at the places I travel to.
5,I love being able to take my laptop outside on the patio and have the 2nd power cord to plug it in so I don't worry about running out of battery power no matter how long I'm outside.
3,I am a little worried that the box gets too hot.
5,Needed extra power cord for travel. This product work as good as original power cord.
3,The overall length of the cord is fine but the part from the computer plug to the converter box is to short. It seems that I'm dealing with the weight of that box a lot more than with my OEM cord.
3,It works but it gets really hot while charging
5,Ordered this for a backup to OEM since I have been having some charging issues. Product works for what I need it for.
5,I use this in my office where I repair laptops. I have several universal ac adapters but this is convenient since it works with so many of the laptops that I receive and I don‚Äôt have to go through my box of attachments. It works on the newer hp laptops with the smaller jacks.
5,I was concerned this may be the wrong plug for my computer but it fit perfectly and has worked well. I use it daily.
5,Bought to replace one that the dog crewed. Seems to work well at an excellant price. Recommended!!!
5,This was a great replacement for my HP charger. Just be sure you have the correct voltage.
1,So I bought this because I lost the charger for my laptop. I wish I hadn't cheaped out. The battery in this laptop no longer holds a charge. At all. The only change was this charger. My use of the laptop stayed the same. Without opening the charger and comparing it to a factory version I can't tell you the exact differences but my educated guess is this charger cheaps out on components and when left plugged in will kill the battery from overcharging it. This is the fastest I have seen a laptop battery die and I've owned and used several laptops. Many self repaired or built together from junk/broken models. Spend the extra money for a name brand/better quality charger because you really do get what you paid for in this case. Only took about 4 months for it to completely kill the battery on this laptop.
5,I left my original charge cord in my other home so bought this one as a backup.  It works fine so far and I expect it will continue to do so.
5,My old power cord stopped working so I bought this one and it works just fine.
4,Works well so far.  Cords do have a light cheap feel to them and are quite stiff but has worked without issue!
5,Great price and works the same as the name brand charger cords. Ed
5,My daughters dog chewed my laptop cord. Wanted a new one and didn‚Äôt want to pay an arm and a leg. This works perfect just what I needed.
4,Works geeat
5,I have an HP Pavilion and needed an extra charger for my workspace. It fits the port perfectly and charges my computer. I have no complaints - I've had it for about a month now with no issues.
5,I was concerned because this cord does not have a ground prong on the plug but I have had no problems with the cord so far so can recommend it.  My husband is an electrician and he said I should have no problems with it.  Fits my hp laptop.
5,Fit perfectly
5,Used this to convert an Amope Pedi Perfect to AC power. The thing works great now. Before you had 3 minutes of full power then a long decline with AAs. Now it full power full time. I ordered a power jack that I installed in the end cap of the amope and connected it to 2 metal rods that sit in place of the batteries delivering the power to the battery contacts.
5,Very good came in time and very overall great thank you.
5,I moved and somehow misplaced my power cord. I was reluctant in ordering online; afraid of not getting it right. Right pick based on specs and description. Good value for the money and was delivered timely.
5,this cord is great. Had to buy it after my puppy chewed my other one. Cheap and fast delivery.
4,Came quickly and works well for what we needed it for
5,I had to find a charger for my computer because mine stopped working around finals time. Most places I called were selling a cord for 60-70$. This cord works wonders and would definitely buy again if needed.
5,I was very happy with the amount of time it took to receive this product and it works great.
5,I thought my whole laptop was shot but turns out the original charging cord was no longer working. This was a great replacement!
5,I had a hard time finding the correct charging cord for laptop. This one worked perfect.
5,Don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúsheerness‚Äù is.  I travel with this.  Another is at home.No issues so far.
5,Excelente para my HP Chrome Book
5,Does the job as a replacement for my  other one. Overheats quite a bit but hasn't stopped working or cause any problems after more than a year...

5,We ordered this plug for our daughter because her dog literally ate her original cord 3 days after she bought her computer and we were skeptical since it wasn't computer brand. The cord arrived early works perfectly and isn't any slower at charging than the original. Would definitely purchase again if needed recommend purchasing to anyone looking for a cord.

2,I will have it plugged in thinking it is charging when in fact the entire time it has not. I have to wiggle the chord to get it to charge.  It will only charge if the chord is positioned a specific way.  Of course I notice this 3 days after the return window closed. Pretty disappointing

5,Great A/C adapter when I have to travel.  Don't have to crawl under my desk to remove my original cable.  Just unplug and go because this fits in my computer case so nicely.
5,Ordered for an old video camera we found in the in-laws storage and it worked perfect to charge up and see old videos of my husbands childhood and his siblings and other relatives
5,hey its a lap top charger. it works!
5,This product solved the issue I was having with DELL about my DELL laptop being unable to verify the battery on another charger and would not charge the battery. DELL suggested to buy a new battery. This charger was compatible and the battery is charging fine.
5,So far it is everything I anticipated.
5,Ordered to replace cord dog chewed on.  Works perfectly on my HP elite book

5,Good value.  Works perfectly
5,I was really happy that this cord fit my Dell laptop perfectly!  I can once again charge my laptop!  The cord arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!
5,Use for my original laptop adapter
5,Tried this cord as my old cord was chewed by my bunny. Came in and works fine.
5,I love it except that the plug  falls out of the adapter not the computer. A tighter or twist plug might be a good idea for improvement to keep it in place.
5,this is my 2nd because I wanted a back up just in case.... works great and cant beat the price. FAST ship time too.
5,Like it... for my lop top
5,They are good but I bought that by mistaking the correct requiring Watts level for my computer. This adapter provides 45w but my computer needs 90w. However I can still charge my laptop by turning it off. So it will make a great backup adapter for me and I just bought a more adapting one
5,Great
5,Works perfect for my lap top.
5,Fit my laptop perfectly and was able to use my laptop immediately.

3,You definitely know that you purchased an off brand charger with this one over all the cord is cheaply made and gets quite hot during use and the cord is fairly short however this charger does do the job and came very quickly I purchased this in the heat of finals and will definitly purchase this product again in a pinch.

5,Works great and arrived as described!
5,This is exactly what I was looking for and got what I paid for. I would buy from this seller again. The price was pretty sweet too!
1,I purchased this replacement power cord for my laptop as the original developed a tear due to a kink in the cable after 5 years of use. It still worked but I wanted to be pre-emptive. Upon comparing the 2 the new one is obviously a cheaper product but it initially worked fine. Almost 2 months to the day of delivery I am back using the original as my laptop would suddenly no longer hold a charge with this power cord. I see that my return window lapsed a month ago so I am SOL on a refund. I don't know which seller is more reputable but if someone wants to recommend a similar product I will now need a replacement.
5,Works great!
4,Worked great until my puppy chewed it up.
5,So far so good. I was not sure if it would work for my HP computer model. But it did.My HP was the HP Flyer Red 15.6 15-f272wm Laptop Pentium N3540 Processor 4GB - 500GB Hard Drive and Windows 10 Home.
5,Charger was perfect fit for laptop!
5,My cord stopped working and I needed a replacement quickly for school! It arrived in two days and works great!! Got an A in the class!
2,The cord worked great at first but now only keeps my comouter from not dieing. It will not charge to 100% but stays between 10-12%. I have to keep my laptop plugged in 24/7.

5,WORKED PERFECTLY ON LAPTOP
1,Charger probably works ok but the description never mentions that the power cord going from the wall outlet to the charging block is a 2 prong non grounded power cable. All of my other hp laptops us a 3 prong cable. I need long power cords & have 15 ft 3-prong cords which are not compatible with this charging block. Most people probably wouldn't care but I cannot use this charger. I gave it 1 star because the connection should have been mentioned in the specs or at least shown in a picture.
5,It‚Äôs great!
2,This item arrived in a timely manner and works as advertised.  It was purchased for my friend and she is happy with it.###############################I have to edit this sorry but I found out that this product never worked maybe some of the chargers are defective.Something that I liked in the description/photo is that the dimensions were shown for the plug this was helpful to confirm that I was buying the correct charger.  I hope all the vendors do this. The return was no problem and I already have my credit.  Bad luck my friend bought from another vendor
5,Did not fit my PCP. Returned item
5,Great
5,Works great
5,Works perfectly with my HP laptop.
5,It‚Äôs a great replacement adapter that I keep in my bag at all times. It‚Äôs working well so far. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a couple of months.

5,It arrived works well
5,Works for my Hp Pavilion 15 laptop model #15-au057cl
3,fit my laptop and charges as it should.  I am a little concerned with how warm it gets. concerned enough that I wouldn't leave it while charging.
5,I initially had an issue with the rechargeing but after I stated my problem a replacement came right away. This one works 100% with recharging. Awesome product!
5,This power cord is exactly what I needed.  Works great!  Thank you Amazon!
1,It was purchased to replace the original A/C Adapter that came with the HP Pavilion 15.  But this cord is cheaply made and heats up very fast when plugged in.  It is very light and very thin. The quality is poor.  It has no insulation and cannot be plugged in for long period of time.  If so it becomes too hot to handle.  I would not buy again.

5,The new power cord for my PC works great and got it as promised.
5,It works perfectly.
2,I purchased this charger on October 22nd. On December 29th the adapter tip no longer stays connected to charge the laptop. I found a way to rig it and keep it connected but I have to crimp the cord under the laptop hinge which is going to screw up the cord very soon so isn't a long-term solution. It's a cheap charger that worked well for 2 months but I guess I'm looking for another replacement now.
5,Came fast works perfectly great price!
5,Arrived on time.  Woks well
5,I received the power cord promptly and it charges my hp laptop quickly. I‚Äôm very satisfied with my purchase.
2,I am not pleased with this product. Although it arrived in adequate time and is as described my HP pavilion x360 will not charge while it is plugged in with this charger. In other words while my laptop is plugged in to the charger it will turn on but it does not actually change the battery so I may use my lap top without being plugged in. A true disappointment and frustrating.

Having a product that lasts less than four months is not worth it when I can get a similar product for five dollars more and has now lasted over a year with the same amount of usage.
5,You'd never know this wasn't the original cord that came with my laptop. Perfect!
5,The power adapter I ordered would not work on my computer for some reason. They were very good to to replace it with another adapter. Very pleased.
5,Product was as described and fast shipping. Thanks!
5,So far this power cord has worked like a charm replacing the original hp cord which was lost. Now we have our laptop back!
2,This power cord performed great for almost exactly one year before its death.  I should get more than one year from such a cord.
3,Using this cord I can't be on my laptop and charge at the same time because there is a grounding issue.
5,Product was just as advertised; arrived on time and works perfectly.

1,This charger was problematic after a few weeks. The plug would not fit snugly in the laptop and it would not give a full charge causing the battery to run down and turn off the laptop. With the one I bought to replace it laptop now always shows ‚Äúfully charged (100%)‚Äù as it should.

1,This charger was supposed to be compatible with my laptop (HP). I made sure that I matched up all the specs from the charger that came with my laptop to this charger before ordering. When I received it it fit into the slot but it didn't go all the way in no matter how hard I pushed it. This caused the plug to not be secure and fall out easily. So I promptly returned it. Thankfully there was no issue with the return and refund.
5,Does what it says it does.  Very happy!

1,The cord does not stay in like it is supposed to. The only time that it works is if I place it in the exact certain way so that it will stay connected to the computer. Chords work in this computer so I know it‚Äôs not the computer. The issue is with the chord.

1,This is not a total waste of money but..... the two cords easily separate even where it plugs into the computer. That means that while it may look like it's charging it's not. You're better off spending a little more to get something reliable which this isn't.

5,It's exactly what I needed for my laptop. It arrived quickly and ges the job done! I thought perhaps that I would notice it being 'aftermarket' or 'slower to charge' for some reason but it works just great and is just like my other one (that came with the laptop)!
5,I like it
1,will do the work for a while but its not a good quality will not last for  long.
1,I bought two of these.  They did not work with my new HP Pavilion.  They showed charging but then stopped after a few seconds.  I returned them a couple weeks ago.  They show being returned but I have not received credit on  my AMEX.  I tried to contact them but have received no response.
1,Wrong charger for my laptop although it specifically says in the description that it is. Seller did not respond to my messages. Horrible seller!! BUYER BEWARE!!!
1,Charger stopped working almost immediately after receiving. Thought it was our compute so too late to return.
1,Charger does not work.  Dont waste time and money on this cheap item. You get what you pay for.
1,Doesn‚Äôt worküòï
5,We bought a five-year-old HP F033WM laptop at a garage sale even though the battery was dead and there was no power cable. This little power supply worked perfectly and so did the laptop once plugged in. We didn't want to invest much on an older laptop knowing there was a possibility it wouldn't work at all - but are happy to report this charger was exactly what we needed and worth the trouble. Thanks to this power cable we spent very little money for a functional PC we're keeping as a backup.
5,My charger for my work laptop started not working very well (it's the wrong size with an adapter on the end...) so I ordered this one from Amazon. It came quickly and works great. I use it whenever I travel and haven't had any issues with it whatsoever. Also while I haven't had a need to contact customer service I did get an extremely polite email asking me if I was having any issues with the product and reminding me of the 12-month warranty policy. Definitely recommended. The laptop I use this charger with is a HP Elitebook.
5,This works just like the OEM version. It doesn't run hot and the size is comparable or slightly lighter/smaller. I ordered it last minute when I realized that I had gone on a business trip and forgot to pack my power supply. I've been using it for a couple months now with no issues. Good value.
4,I ordered 4 walkies to use for my soccer program. One of the walkies does not have a channel one. It has channels the other radios don't have so i can't use it.
5,Great replacement charger for my HP Pavilion. I misplaced my original one so I ordered this. Works great! It is kind of bulky so it‚Äôs hard to travel with at times but overall I am happy with it!
5,This charger works perfect for my HP Envy x360. I wanted a second charger to leave plugged into the wall at my desk but didn't want to spend the money on the HP OEM charger. The charger works just as well as my HP original at a much better price point.
5,Fits well with my mothers hp chrome. It‚Äôs dainty but as long as you don‚Äôt stretch it out too much it will be fine and last long. No problems charging.
5,Awesome product exactly what I needed  my dog bit my previous original cable and broke it. But now this cable it perfect replacement and really affordable. Awesome.
5,This power supply works perfectly for my HP laptop. No problems at all. Great replacement unit. Love it.

5,My puppy chewed up my power cord for my laptop and this replacement cord was perfect. Working great.
5,I was afraid with so many options that it wouldn't fit and I would have to play the game of sending back multiple times.  It was the correct size the first time.
5,This power supply worked perfectly with my HP laptop computer  Great replacement for my lost cord. On-time  delivery.
5,Ordered this to have an extra for my HP Pavilion and as a bonus it fits my work laptop also an HP. I use my laptop in three primary locations. I use this one for traveling and in the third location which get the least amount of use. It's great to go from the garage to the dining room to my desk and have the power waiting.You can buy two or three of these for the price of the HP branded one so it's a no-brainer.
5,Great replacement for the money
4,works great
5,Excellent
5,This was a perfect replacement for my laptop and even after an hour of use it wasn't very hot.
5,Lost my power adaptor and for weeks I was around looking for it. Couldn't charge my device hoping somebody would return it to me but it never happened.  Thank goodness for Amazon they had it or one like and it works wonderful.Thanks Amazon!
5,Great match for my computer
5,$40 less than the one I was going to buy in the store and it worked. Couldn‚Äôt be happier.
4,This ac adapter is excellent for traveling. I use it on both of my HP computers. I ordered this one because my original on that came with my computer quit working all of the sudden. It‚Äôs not a very heavy adapter so if you need to throw it in your bag it doesn‚Äôt weigh a ton.
5,Second plug
5,Works fine with my HP pavilion that‚Äôs all I needed.
5,It's nice to know that there is a replacement it it breaks .Love the replacement
5,Just what we needed for my daughter‚Äôs computer.  She lost her power cord and this has done it‚Äôs job.  Also way less expensive than Best Buy.
5,It fits and it works. My other PSU died and needed a new one fast for school... This one does the trick and works great!
5,It's a replacement cord that works perfectly. I love it for the value.

4,Great for the price!!
5,It works pretty good for me. I lost my charger not to long ago and this is currently working as a good replacement for me.
4,It comes in two parts. The cable doesn't always stay connected to the laptop nor to the power source. That's my only complaint. It just doesn't stay connected to the ports.. Other than that it's fine.
5,Working as expected
5,I left my power adapter in a hotel. I refused to pay the price for an OEM replacement which typically is over priced. Great replacement fast service and would highly recommend.
5,I was very happy that this replacement charger worked as expected AND it was shipped VERY FAST.
5,It works. I was in a pinch an needed a power cable as I lost mine in a move. It works like a charm.
5,I love this adapter !  When looking online the manufacturer wants 3x the price my local service guy wants over twice the cost and I find this gem here at a fraction and receive it in a matter of days!  I was a little amazed at all the HP and none HP products that use this product.  Money well spent and am ordering a second to have on hand just in case.  My laptop is older but functions just fine with the new adapter!
5,Works perfectly for my HP laptop super easy to keep the cords tied together too
5,Dog ate the power cord for our laptop so needed to replace.  The cord works perfectly the connection was tight didn't feel like it was going to fall out. Laptop charger without an issue.
5,Exactly what I needed for my laptop.
5,Found this great replacement was inexpensive and has been working great also arrived quickly
5,GREAT DEAL
5,This is nothing fancy. Just a replacement charger because I have trouble keeping track of my original one. Works great just like the one that came with my HP computer. No problems!
5,Good Product
5,It is a great product!
5,It was exactly as advertised - and a reasonable price.
5,Item exactly as listed
4,I was concerned upon receipt that to connect both the plug end with the computer it was a TWO prong instead of the THREE that I had been using. Seems to be charging performing just fine.
4,It's not top quality but it powers my laptop and that's a plus for me. I haven't used it for traveling just yet but  8t does fit in my bag comfortably.  I am satisfied with my purchase.
5,The adapter arrived in a couple of days and works perfectly. There‚Äôs a nice hook & loop strap that keeps the cord wrapped and nice when moving my laptop around.
5,The product was well packaged and it works well
5,As advertised
5,Great
5,This is a good product for my computer
5,Worked perfectly for my 2 teens as a backup in case they forget their charger at school which seems to happen often. Great value
5,it works
5,Like it got what I ordered
5,I had a mishap and lost the cord that came with my laptop. This purchase was my replacement cord and it works great!
3,This is the 2nd one of these power adapters that I have purchased. The first one died after a 2 foot drop to my floor. My fault but it should have been able to handle the drop. So it does work fine but you will need to be careful with it. Needs a "FRAGILE - DO NOT DROP" sign on it.
5,Well built and charges great!
4,Good quality
5,works well on my computer since i broke the one that came with the original thing. it is good for its price and charges well.
5,Item exactly as described
5,We've only had this for a couple of months but it works well. The connections are stable the inverter does not get warm cords are thick and well-insulated fits our HP Chromebook doesn't smell bad. Would buy again.
5,My kids lose these like crazy. It would help if I could just put it on auto-ship... They always come quickly and work well. I assume they‚Äôre durable but my kids lose them before they break. My daughter goes through a charger at least every-other week. She was leaving them all around campus and claims they don‚Äôt have a lost and found. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a stockpile of them somewhere just waiting for her to come claim them... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,Prices are good but the quality can be little better. It's good not to have long laptop wire length.
5,Great price exact replacement arrived on time......
5,This brand new power cord works great on my HP lap top! Delivery was super fast too!
4,The product works with my laptop.  The only issue is battery gets really hot so I don‚Äôt leave it unattended.
5,Great replacement exactly duplicated
5,works perfectly ! my laptop now charges flawlessly !
5,I bought one for a neighbor whose dog chewed his original so his wife tossed it. I bought another for a daughter who recently bought a dog in case hers got chewed. They work fine.
5,Purchased as an extra charger for my HP Pavilion and has worked well so far
5,Lost my original charger so had to find a replacement that didn't cost as much as the older model laptop. Arrived quick and worked perfect
5,So excitedCOST LESS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
5,Serving my needs very good.
