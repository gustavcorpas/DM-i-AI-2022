5,I use it to charge my iphone and also a Lenovo chrome book. I think it does the job well. The chrome book wont charge a lot when I am using it but it wont discharge either.
4,Charges. Fast but does heat up the phone and the box itself gets very hot
5,These are amazing must haves!!
5,Great price for 2 blocks
5,Good value very satisfied.
4,Came a loose at the plug part
5,Fast charging for my 13 pro!  Much faster than those little 5w chargers I had :D
4,i purchased these specifically for my travel bag. They are cost effective and easy to replace in the event that I leave one at a meeting location or in a hotel room. Couple these with a really good 10 ft USB C cable and always have the phone tablet of keyboard charged and ready to go. Recommended.
5,Works great have quite a few of these around my house everyone uses themWith no issues
5,Work very well had an accident with one I spilt water on it shorting it out completly. My fault The other is work ing well
4,Good charger
5,Bueno…
5,My kids used these and fast charging
5,5 Stars
5,Best bang for your buck. Looks exactly like the 30 dollar apple box (which is not included with the iPhone 13)
4,Great fast charger. I have an Iphone 12mini. It’s is excellent condition. It can do a full charger in 45mins. I appreciate a fast charger. The only problem is the cord needs to be longer. But overall I give it a 9 out 10.
3,Charging chords work with multiple other usb-c blocks…but not one of these. Good ‘value’ if they both continued working fine. Only one still works.However they do work well as fast iPhone chargers while they work.
3,Did not fit my phone
5,Fast charging for your iPhone
3,I wanted to use the fast charger that came with my new iPhone so I went on Amazon and purchased this when it arrived to my door came to my attention that they barely work! I would get my phone to charge sometimes and other times it wouldn’t charge so I guess you could call it a hit and miss. Purchase wisely
3,My sons power box was glued so came apart quick
5,Paren originales
5,This was perfect for charging my phone using my adapter while in Europe!  It’ll work well to plug in at home too!
5,it works fine lol
5,I always in for a product out I’ll start over I ordered the incorrect product my phone my fault my fault
3,One works so not a good value
4,Wish the cord length was longer but outside of that I can’t complain
4,it charges so fast and i love it but the top came off…. other then that i love
5,Got it for my new iPhone 13!  Works much faster than the usb charger.
5,Leave it up to Apple to make you by a new charger because the older one won’t work with their newer phone. They never now give you a wire but no charger with a new phone. This one was 1/5th the cost and works excellent.
