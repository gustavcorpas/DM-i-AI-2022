5,Likes:audio is good on moving subject. I put it on my 8 year old nephew to test and he ran around while talking. Audio seemed as though he was in one spot and at same distances through out - that’s big plus for my needs. Also not much rustling with his shirt which may be luck or I put it on well. He was fidgeting a lot - so I’m surprised I got clean audio.Noise cancellation seems to work fine - I didn’t have any back ground noise picked up in the audio and we were outside.I love that it syncs directly to iPhone audio and video without needing third party. I bought same priced product previously and going through third party app was a deal breaker for me - I do not like that at all. So this wireless mic gets big five stars for that functionality.I did audio test with my iPhone audio on FaceTime using phone speaker and this wireless mic - my test subject said the audio for my iPhone was as good as the wireless mic. I walked ten feet from phone and did test for audio - she said she heard me as clearly with speaker ten feet away as with mic. If I were zooming a lot I would assume the wireless mic would work better than iPhone speaker function - but I don’t do zooms online conferences.I also love that there are two mics! This is great! I did not test both yet but will add additional comment once I do.Big thing for me is1.) wirelessWireless distance seems to work fine at about 20 feet.I have a wireless for audio recorder that works about 150 feet! That’s super cool but for now not necessary on this iPhone wireless - I’m happy with the approximate 20 feet audio that I get clear audio wirelessly.2.) records directly to locations other than directly to third party app3.) clean clear audio noise cancellation seems to work fine - I didn’t test yet specifically for background noise - will do that test soon.But my normal audio with normal background had no background noise showing up in my recordings.So far so happy with this item!
5,We have recently started creating content on YouTube and I bought a wired mic a while back because the wireless mics were all around the $250 range and up and I couldn't justify that.  The wired mic worked fine but you're obviously limited to range and have to deal with the cable.  It's a pain.I found this gem and honestly I was skeptical because of the price.  But I decided to give it a try so I bought the package that includes two microphones.  When it arrived I immediately plugged the receiver into my Android phone turned on the mic opened my camera app and started recording.I walked around talking to nobody for a few minutes and when I played it back I was amazed at how good the sound quality is!  And as other reviewers have mentioned I love the fact that you can use whatever recording app you like!The only issue I've had was that the sound did not record once.  I may not have plugged in the receiver enough because once I unplugged it then plugged it back in it was working perfectly again.Oh and I like how the receiver has a place to plug in your charger.  Handy feature!
5,I wanted a dual wireless mic system that my son could use to record our voices when we play Fortnite on the PC together in separate rooms.These mics work great and the audio quality is very good. Better than I imagined.  They sound like we are talking directly into a handheld mic instead of simply being clipped on our shirts.I use my pc to record my sons Xbox through a capture card but the capture card wouldn’t pic up our headset mics so I went looking for wireless lapels and I’m so glad I didThe main connection is USB-C. And it comes with a Standard USB adapter as well as an Apple lightning adapter. That was one of the reasons why I picked this model over othersI’m very pleased with this mic set overall and feel like the price is very good as well.
5,Ordered this product to provide sound for a Zoom hybrid in person meeting. The 2 mic option made it really easy for the attendees on Zoom to hear the people who were in person. The range was great and did not pick up on the other noises outside of the person speaking. I liked the light weight size of the microphones but could see how they could be lost easily. Was very pleased with the quality of the microphones would  def recommend for people in Zoom meetings.
5,Currently using it for my VR headset for my Oculus Quest 1 to do better recordings for YouTube videos the quest 1 microphone for VR it sounds a little muffled through recordings but this clip on attachable mic I attach it to the face cover and it points directly at my mouth sounds great very clear ranges better that I expected it does say 65 ft I can use it across my house when the microphone is connected to my gaming rig and it works amazing for sure worth it battery life is there for sure 10 hours I've been getting about 12 out of it.
5,Very user friendly.  I’ve been using to teach Acts 2:38 at the local churchRepent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy GhostI would give this mic set a 10/10!!Comes with two mics and a connector to an iPhone product.  Quality of sound is amazing & I will recommend this to anyone who asks for it
5,As a Realtor in the Northern Dallas Area I do a lot of videos. I got tired of the "wired" mic I have been using restricting my movements and decided to give these a try...they were at an attractive price and the reviews seemed solid.  I am VERY Happy with the purchase as I have done solo videos and a 2 person interview style (using both of the mics) and the sound has been very clear. They come with the charging cord adapters for different phones and all you need to get busy recording.Give them a try...I'm pretty sure you'll love them for the price and quality.
5,Works as advertised. Used it to while recording a church service. Had the camera next to a screaming baby and it did a great job picking up the speakers voice over the baby.  Used it twice so far. The second time the microphone piece fell off the speaker onto the floor and it still did a great job picking up the speaker over the crying baby.
5,Initially I was hesitate to purchase this product because it looked like generic brand. it got me wrong. This product works functionally as you excepted. I'm using the microphone for video remote interpreting on Zoom with my MacBook. It has been weeks and still working well. Now the only tiny issue I have was apparently a glitch on Zoom because MacBook detected the microphone and it works but won't work on Zoom unless you have to change the audio in the setting. Overall the experience and usage were positive and easy. One more thing it's better to have two mics than one because my microphone died in the middle of the lecture so I used the second mic as a back-up.
5,I purchased these microphones for use in a one on one interview using Microsoft Teams. The sound quality is great and they only picked up the sound from each speaker. They simply don't pick up regular background noise which is exactly what I was hoping for. Great value!
5,I wanted to get some mic to record interviews and was looking for a cordless mic. I stumbled upon this one and saw some good reviews and took a decision to purchase.The product took couple of more days than originally stated to receive. No big deal as I received constant updates regarding the expected date of delivery. The wait for worth it. First - the setup. It was a breeze. There is no software to install. I tried the receiver on both Samsung phone and iPhone (using the adaptor that they sent) and both of them worked just fine.Next - the charge. I used the cordless mics for an interview that lasted around 3 hours and 15 minutes and the mic's were holding the charge for the entire duration. I did not test it further as it was not needed. This is one area where I was really worried as many instruments dont hold charge for long. So this was a definite positive item.Overall I am very happy at this time with this mic set. I hope it continues to perform the same for a long time.
5,I teach an online class and what I like about this system is the fact that it comes with two microphones which gives me extended teaching time without having to wait for one to charge back up. I use OBS and am able to apply filters within OBS so not only does it have built in filters but I can further adjust parameters within OBS. As with all lavaliere mics you have to be careful with their placement so that you don't lose quality or have added interference. I find the best place is about six to eight inches below my chin and not having it where it can rub against any clothe or my beard.
5,They sound very good for how cheap they are my only complaint is that the power button on them sticks but other than that they are solid mics
5,I purchased this set of mics because my wife and I are on a lot of zoom calls as well as podcasts. We quite often have to be on at the same time and occasionally in different rooms.  This looked like it might fit the bill. She uses iPhone and I'm Android. We've used these on her phone as well as mine along with my laptop which has Horrible mic. These worked to perfection.  I couldn't ever imagine such great results and ease of use for such a small amount of money.
5,Thr sound is great and I was surprised at the clarity when over 40 feet from receiver.  We could have went so much further away if we needed to.  I think this is a great find.  Hopefully a Kong term review will be complimentary.  So far I'm impressed
5,Saw this product and thought I would give it a try as we had a need for wireless mics in our meetings.  Plugged in the receiver to usb and turned on the mics for instant great sound from two sources simultaneously.  This allows us to have our president and others in the room heard by our members participating via zoom.  This is a great product that I recommend.  Great Value!
5,Love how you just plug it in and use it! It’s very high quality for the price point. Crispy and the battery life isn’t bad either. One of my best purchases!
5,These mics are easy to use and easy to install.
4,I make quite a few videos for my website scienceoffalling.com and recently purchased these mics to replace an old mic with a clunky transmitter. These mics are plug and play easy with surprisingly good audio quality! Highly recommend for those looking for wireless mics on a budget.
4,These are good entry-level wireless mics. They are plug and play. No actual mute button in case you're wondering.
5,There has been zero problems with my new mics and they work absolutely perfect for my vlogging!i would recommend these to anyone!
5,Overall get item. First couple of uses the battery went dead. Learning to turn off between recordings. Use them on podcasts business ad videos and voice overs. Easy and excellent quality sound.
5,I purchased this to use as a mic as I presented professional development to my 'live' staff but also had several staff attending via Zoom.  This mic worked great and had great range.  The Zoom audience stated it sounded very clear and crisp.  We had dual speakers at times and both mics worked well without feedback or interference.  Definitely a great buy!  Also the accessories to connect it to any device Apple Android PC mobile phones Ipads and tablets is a big plus!
5,I charged the 2 microphones with the included charger and plugged the usb c receiver into my ipad. Turned on the microphones and it worked instantly. Microphones are clear and loud. No setup no installing anything. Just plug in and go! I should have got these a long time ago.
5,Very easy product rot use with great quality excellent battery time and can attach to pretty much anything while picking up sound as long as you be sure to speak clearly. Descriptions are accurate where it has "adapters" that can connect to many different types of systems.
5,Bought these for the production of the YouTube channel I am doing w my daughter. Great purchase.
5,Bought this for my zoom meetings and presentations. Picked up my voice very clearly even when I'm far away from my tablet. Very easy to use!
5,Arrived as expected. Quick charge of the mic and I was recording in no time with a wire. Lavas worked perfect. Excited to use these more in the coming days.
5,Lets get this out of the way first these are great mics! Simply set up out the box and your good to go. Battery life is stellar at about 10 hrs a Mic. For those of you using this to create content Thats more than enough time to plot or plan your next video!
5,Bought the product tested it out for a youtube video. The mic is clear and good to use.
5,Great product no issues using my Android Samsung S20. Worked perfect for when I used it to make a video where I had to be mobile and walking around.

5,It is a small  External Mic but is so useful for recording.
2,Initially I gave this item a positive review.  If it works it is a great product for a great price.  Unfortunately I have had an issue getting 2 separate sets to sync with the reciever.  I do not like giving negative reviews but I can not stand behind this product.  I have now ordered a much more expensive known audio mic set.
1,I purchased these wireless mics to use on my Galaxy S22+.  There were no issues connecting to the phone.  The problem is with the quality of sound.  It is terrible and beyond unacceptable.  The sound quality is far below the phones mic. but the worst part is the buzzing sound produced by the mics along with a clicking sound.  I watched several YouTube videos on these mics and based on those reviews I should not have purchased these mics.  I returned them to Amazon for refund.  Do not buy these mics you will be very disappointed.
1,I ordered this mic set for recording hypnosis sessions. On my first order when I listened to the session recording one mic made a ringing noise on the recording whenever I spoke into it. I returned that set and ordered another since one mic was faulty. On the replacement set both mics make a ringing sound on the recoding!!! So I guess these are just cheap low quality microphones and I do not recommend buying them. The functionality of the USB-C and pairing to the transceiver was great. I bought a slightly more expensive version by a different brand hoping I can get decent quality recordings for my clients with a different brand.
1,I got the mic's paired up easy enough. Did a couple test videos and was happy with the result. Went to show my friend later the same day and the mics would no longer turn on. I made sure the mics were charged yet neither one would respond to the power button presses. Very disappointing. No NOT waste your money on this junk.
1,The problem with this mic is that it buzzes and rings. The recording was fine but that underlining buzzing noise was so upsetting to hear. I was so excited to use this on my YouTube videos but once I heard that notice after each recording I had to return this product. I don't recommend anyone buying this. Take it from me purchase a more expensive mic save yourself the time and be okay with spending more for something that will pay for itself tenfold down the line.
1,I attempted to use this with my cell phone. It worked on a program called Voice recorder. It will not work with the video recorder. I bought for use with my phone video recorder. It would not record the audio no way to choose which microphone the video used.Very disappointed I would like to return but missed the window.
1,I returned one of these because I couldn't get it to connect to my phone or any of the other three Android phones in the household. Replacement sent promptly but it doesn't work either.
1,Opened the first day and never connected to my phone.Only gave 1 star or else I would not have been able to review but I give 0 stars.
1,so disappointment i tried many times to connect to my phone but faild!
1,not your own voice very sharp.
1,Missing pieces
5,We needed a bluetooth lapel mic and this is perfect and easy to setup!
1,Before I say anything just want to state that I've been an IT professional for over 10 years.That being said the moment I connected this device to my laptop not only did it screw with the audio drivers. Basically non existant. But any attempts to reinstall drivers or reset the laptop will freeze it. This is a Dell XPS 9520. Brand new too.I can't even do a factory reset because it freezes during the process. I'll have to wipe it with an usb bootable program to start from scratch.I'm almost convinced it's malicious. Don't take the risk. Stay away.
5,It works very well excellent price-quality.I use it when I record my videos and it sounds perfect.I recommend it.
