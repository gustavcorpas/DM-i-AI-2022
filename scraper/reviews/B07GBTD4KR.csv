5,I was pleasantly surprised to realize that the original black cartridge lasted nearly 14 months as opposed to our previous Brother printer which seemed to need new cartridges every few months. Installation couldn’t be easier- just slide it into the slot and you’re back in business.
5,See the Headline.  I print a lot of 11x17 so maybe I'm expecting to much.
1,Cartridge chip was faulty and didn't work company return/exchange policy is only 30 days so better use it right away and DON'T buy in bulk amounts from seller.  Seller wouldn't exchange my cartridge for a new one stating: "All returns must be made within 30 days of receiving the items. All damages must be reported within 10 calendar days." As we had bought this for the office printer a while back they say we "missed" their lame return policy. Needless to say we will not be buying from this seller again. Again don't buy more than one from seller at a time and use right away OR find another seller like we are.
5,Great quality. Never disappointed
4,Brother product works well.
5,I use my printer on a daily basis and this cartridge is the longest lasting I have ever used.
5,I use this to print photo-quality art. I don't think it quite does the trick. But there is no other cartridge available here.
1,I ordered this ink to make sure I had it when I needed it. Since we had a large move coming up I was not able to test use it for a while after buying it. Now that I have been able to use it and need it (freshly opened from it's box and bag) it doesn't work. All my print jobs are coming out like I am low on ink but the ink reader says it's full. Very disappointing.
5,Good price fast shipping and worked perfectly for my printer.
5,Shipped to me on time
5,Last with about 5000 printed pages works well no smudges
3,The stated 6000 pages is not realistic. Very costly for what you get. There are better cartridge alternatives that are significantly cheaper.
5,PURCHASED FROM AMAZON GENUINE BROTHER CARTRIDGES

5,This is the genuine Brother INKvestment Tank Ink Cartridge that is compatible with the MFC-J5845DW J5945DW J6545DW and J6945DW models. The cartridge yields 6000 black & white pages approximately. When inserted into the MFC-J5845DW the approximate pages remaining was 7600 according to the printer. I recommend using the manufacturer's ink as it normally results in a smoother and easier experience. Brother ink is expensive however this ink cartridge should last around 2 years. The quality of the ink itself is excellent. Even when the printer is set to the Fast quality meaning that it uses the least amount of ink necessary and executes the task as fast as the printer can the print quality is outstanding. It is a good value for the money because it is genuine ink that is of high quality and specifically designed for Brother printers. Non-genuine ink tends to be of less quality and lasts a short amount of time meaning that the amount it needs to be replaced becomes equivalent to the price of genuine ink. Brother ink is very fine and sharp. I do recommend cleaning the print head nozzles before printing with the cartridge as they tend to get dirty over time. Replacing the cartridge is the perfect time to complete printer maintenance. I definitely recommend this ink cartridge as it is the best available for Brother Printers.
