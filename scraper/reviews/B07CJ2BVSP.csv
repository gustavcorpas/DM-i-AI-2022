5,Got this so I could hear TV over fans without turning TV up so high. While it doesn't have noise canceling it works great!! My "cheep" TV was bought for picture quality. Now I have excellent sound too.Paired it with my phone and NICE!! So I bought a second one for mom to hear her phone and TV better. Maybe now I won't hear her phone/TV when I'm outside.üòÅNot quite plug and play but my 60+ brain handled it.It doesn't come with charging adaptor but I have plenty of those.
4,Only a very slight delay better than many others. The buttons are all too close to one another. Very easy to press the wrong button when adjusting volume and powering off and on. The material used for ear covers is not durable but they are comfortable.
5,I‚Äôm 83 years old with severe hearing loss. I spend a lot of time watching tv but even with my hearing aids I miss a lot of what‚Äôs being said. I had stopped watching movies because I miss most of what is said.I was able to set this up in less than 5 minutes with the head set pairing immediately. The lip sync is perfect with no delay.I am now able to hear and understand ever word. Originally I thought the volume control on the head set wasn‚Äôt working but eventually found that it necessary to press the volume control multiple time to change the volume.I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase. The only down sides is I was hoping to connect to my BT hearing aids but that doesn‚Äôt happen also I can‚Äôt hear my wife calling me when wearing the headphones.
1,UPDATED REVIEW 1/5 Stars (4/13/21)In addition to all the other problems with this they are super annoying in trying to both turn on and turn off.  You have to hold them for 5-8 seconds if while you are holding the button in the center it shifts to either the left or the right you have to start all over again.  They are poorly designed for shutting down or starting up.  On start up you get blasted twice with the BOT.  Once to say Welcome then a pause and it says connected.  The volume of the BOT is much louder than the volume of the Headset for listening to the audio on the television.  I would NEVER recommend this nor will I ever purchase this brand or anything from this maker again!UPDATED REVIEW 2/5 starsOMG this is the worst ever!!! There is ABSOLUTELY NO warning until the battery is dead and then the warning is SOOOOO L.O.U.D!!!! Talk about ear damage.  You have the level safe for listening to your program and then the BOT comes on and says "LOW BATTERY" while she Y.E.L.L.S!!! at you and then she does it again 30 seconds later.  That's it two 30 second warnings and then it is D.E.A.D. NO sound!!! There is literately NO timely warning -- (as in an appropriated 30 minutes to let you at least finish what you are doing? Nope!)  Low battery should be stated when you turn it on if there is 30 minutes or less left of battery life not while you're in the middle of using it and then to give you no time to finish what you are doing?? That's terrible!  This is MOST ESPECIALLY true since this pathetic headphones do not have the ability to change out batteries so you can be charging an additional pair in between.  Because of the headset is SEALED and one battery for the life of the product you can't just have a spare pair of batteries waiting to change out as needed.  Environmentally irresponsible to not have batteries that change.  Health Irresponsible to raise the volume level to tell you the battery is low. And seamless viewing is obliterated without the ability to have an additional pair of batteries in the waiting.These are NOT consumer friendly!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW was 4/5 starsOverall this is a good headset that does provide the 40 hours it states... actually I was able to get 40 hours and 22 minutes so I definitely can't complain about the length of time.  (No I didn't do all 40 at one sitting but I did keep track so I could see if it gave the 40 hours it claimed) that said there are some things I think could use an improvement.I am replacing a previous pair of wireless headphones for TV.  I always had one set of batteries in the charger and one set in the headphones when the set in the headphones died I could immediately replace and not miss a beat of music or an action of movie.  Unfortunately for this headset the battery is integrated into an enclosed sealed non-replaceable location.  That means to charge the battery you must stop what you are doing and charge the battery back-up to speed.  ... too bad for you if it's in the middle of the best part of the song or an action intense part of a movie...cause there is no way around the lost connection when you cannot have a spare battery waiting and ready.I wonder -- Have headphones in general changed or is it just this particular headset? No idea but for me that is a bad replacement for continuous use.  The other flaw with this is that batteries don't tend to last as long as the product which means on my old system I just bought new batteries and it kept going (I didn't replace the headphones because they don't work but because the new TV won't work with an RCA jack and I needed to switch to an Optical set-up)  This means that when the batteries on this set eventually do die I will be throwing away a LOT more product than what might actually need replaced.  Very wasteful and harmful to the environment.In addition to the lack continuous battery ability the ear pieces themselves take a bit to get used to. ... no wait...I'm still not all that comfortable with them but tolerate them.  I have ear piercings the headphone padding presses the earnings into my head; my original pair did not do this.  The padding was big enough on the previous pair to fit around the outside of my ears and not sit directly on top of them pressing them to my head.  The padding was also comfortable enough I could wear them for longer periods of time than I can wear this pair.  This pair the padding is very stiff and small squashing my ear (and I am a small person female and only 5'1" I can't imagine how they would fit a man).Next they claim to have 100 foot ability eh I don't know that I entirely agree with that.  My original headphones had the same range and I could travel farther in my home without disruption of the signal cutting in and out or static on the line.  I waled from my office 12 feet to the restroom to wash my hands and they cut out! Twelve FEET that's not 100.  Granted it was from a room to a room but still TWELVE FEET!  My original pair I could go down stairs and start a load of laundry between while the advertisements were on hear what was going on and be back to watch as the show resumed without missing a beat all while my husband was on a conference call so I wouldn't interrupt his work or while he's sleeping and I'm doing tasks but not with this I need to stay in the same room.The transmitter is nice and small so it doesn't have a big footprint taking up space so that's a nice feature though it may also be why they don't reach the distance my original headphones could reach.So in conclusion they do most of what they claim even if they aren't nearly as comfortable as I would like and I do miss the seamless transition when the battery needs charged. For me lack of comfort and the fact I will need to throw away the entire headset just because the battery finally dies and will not further charge making it a waste to the environment means... I will be in the future looking for a different set up and not getting this item again.
5,Bought for tv in bed so spouse wouldn't wake. They are amazing! Not only noise cancelling and great sound quality but it's easy to pair with anything. We're now using this single headset with a smart tv android phone and Oculus!
5,My husband is hard of hearing. These work really well and he is able to leave his hearing aids in. Best he has had. Very happy with them!
4,Pros: Easy to install transmitter and easy to pair  Good quality constructionCons: Not made for a large man's head....cups do not completely cover the ears  On/Off ....I found out you have to hold the on/off switch until you hear the prompt which is in  about 5 seconds .  It's not instanteous  The sound seems to be a little "echo-ey"...not really crispy clear.Otherwise i will keep them they seem to work with my Samsung TV pretty well.
4,Product is fine. Warranty registration is rediculous. You are penalized for buying through Amazonas you have to jump through many hoops to get the 2 year warranty that you would automaticallyget by buying direct from Avantree.
4,These are pretty good.  Easy to hook up.
5,Bought these for my husband and they work great. He sits in the same room I work from and can watch TV without any interruption to my work day. Easy to install and works with our older TV sets too!!
5,Easy hookup. Sound great. Long battery life.Can't ask for more!
5,Our kitchen and living room are the same space.  These make it so someone can watch TV and others can socialize in the kitchen.  No more arguments about the TV being too loud.
4,Sound is not as it should be but I am able to hear better.
5,Very nice quality headphones
5,Exactly what we needed for my mom to hear the tv
5,I am enjoying the use of this purchase.
5,The audio quality is incredible when the transmitter is connected to the optical audio output from the TV set. I have not tried other connections. Understanding what is being said on TV is a challenge for me as the TV audio is not very good and I have typical age related hearing loss. Even with hearing aids understanding every spoken word is a challenge. With these headphones however I can understand every word and do not need to use hearing aids.
4,Easy to set up. Last about a week using approx 3 hrs per day before needing charging .Good sound and able to adjust for optimal hearing the TV.  I'm a senior with hearing loss and these really help with not having to blast the volume on TV. My only complaint is they are hard to turn off. I press and hold down the button and it takes quite awhile for them to power off. They come on In a couple seconds but takes much longer to go off.
4,Headphones work really well and are very comfortable
5,Great sound volume control could be a little easier bit really Nota problem
4,overall headphones seem to be doing the job of letting me hear the volume at high level without disturbing the rest of the household.
4,It's only been a month but the unit is working well. Better sound blocking then our previous headphones. Our dogs go into barking fits at least once a day for no reason at all. I can pop these on and continue to watch my program. We also use them when one of us is sleeping and the other is up watching TV.
5,Very happy all around with the headphones. However installation may prove a little more challenging than others on the market. Made in China instructions might prove a little head scratching. The good news they have a very good customer service dept. They can clear up any questions.
4,I've had them about a month now. Sound quality is great. No drag or "lip syncing".  Earphones are quite comfortable & do fit over my big ears & not on them.  I use them to watch tv in bed so not to wake my girlfriend. She loves them. Only thing i can complain about so far is if you rurn them up loud enough to completely cancel sound then she can hear them too. I usually have them on the lowest volume because that's all ive needed its been great at that level. I have turned them up to try it out & they sound good cranked up too. Ive been in every room upstairs & the signal is good wherever i walk. I used the optical cable it came with & hooked it up in about 2 minutes. I didn't try the other cables didn't need to. I am very happy i spent the extra $20 on these rather than the others that were a little cheaper. Register your warranty when you get them. I wanted to wait a cpl weeks then forgot until it was too late! You only have 30 days & i didn't remember u til 35 days out & screwed myself out of the full 24 mo th warranty. So hopefully the battery doesn't crap out in a year like the other review says.  Ut if they work this well for year then its still worth it.
5,My elderly father is having a hard time hearing even with a hearing aid. He loves to watch sports and the news but had difficulty hearing the ‚Äútalking.‚Äù I looked for headphones and found these that mentioned amplifying the ‚Äútalking.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if it does but my dad loves it. My sister also bought a different one which works well except that the transmitter needs to be unplugged if others want to watch with him. Then those headphones can‚Äôt be used. He found it cumbersome. These Avantree works well because the transmitter device can stay plugged into the tv and my dad can watch sports with others because we can also hear the tv while he wears the headphones. There‚Äôs a simple on/off button now the transmitter. He loved it so much he asked for another one for his bedroom tv.
4,Good sound Bluetooth is great. No noise cancellation at all.
5,I am very pleased with purchasing this headphones. Was easy to connect and set up it on TV and easy to operate just follow the instructions. The set is lightweight and comfortable.
5,I bought this for my 88 year old Mom. I love that they hold a charge for so long.
5,Liked the product.
4,We received a new smart tv as a Christmas gift from our children and I use a wireless headset because of a hearing impediment.  My old headset is 10+ years old and cannot be directly connected to the new smart tv models.  I decided to upgrade my headset too and purchased the Avantree HT4189 set after doing a considerable online search.  This time around I wanted a headset that was lightweight wireless had clear audio and long battery life between charges.  The HT4189 seemed to fill my needs and ordered it.I received my headset in short order but had a whale of a time getting them to work.  I followed all of the online tutorials but could not get the headset to work.  I called the tv manufacturer getting a prompt response but was not helpful.  I contacted Avantree and found the support team there more than willing to help.  We conversed back & forth via email several days with out finding a resolution.  Finally I scheduled a phone support session with them but I was unable to schedule a slot with them until the next day.In the meantime I took my headset to my local Video Tech store (they sold the tv that was gifted to us) and they too were unable resolve the connection issue.  The tv tech kept saying connecting the headset should not be that difficult.  It turns out the Digital Optical Cable was the culprit.  The cable that came with the headset didn‚Äôt work a second new Digital Optical cable we tried didn‚Äôt work either.  After several minutes of frustration the Video Tech technician grabbed another new cable off the shelf & things started working right away.  Who would have guessed two out of three cables bad.I do have a few pros/cons with the headset now that I have it working:1.  To turn up/down the sound the volume control must be repeatedly ‚Äúbumped‚Äù.2.  Selecting a new channel source resets the volume back to the ‚Äúturn on‚Äù level this is annoying.3.  Being a Bluetooth device the range of the transmitter is somewhat limiting when walking around the house.4.  The sound is clear without and distracting hissing (a problem with my old headset).5.  The lighter weight makes extended wearing easier.6.  The support team is phenomenal and made the troubles I was having almost worth it.
5,Buy them for my husband when he listen his sports games‚Ä¶he is very satisfied with them and really likes them the sound is good easy to set volume‚Ä¶ just love them !!!
5,After getting a new smart tv I needed to replace my old headphones (12+ years old).  I use them for watching TV while others are asleep as well as due to hearing loss in one of my ears.The product comes with everything you need - including the optical cable (a prior Q&A said it was not included - it is).  The packaging and instructions are very well done/professional.  I had previously played around with my TV settings so I knew I had a couple of options for setting them up (optical or 3.5 mm audio out).  My biggest concerns were having the sound to the headphones AND sound to the TV so others could watch and potential latency.Setup - easy.  Everything worked perfectly.  Note that depending on your TV you may need to make some adjustments to the setup.  Instructions are included but each TV is a little different.  Don't be afraid to experiment. For example on my TV if I use the 3.5 mm the TV speakers will not work (no option).  However the optical allows for sound from both AND I  can control the volume independently on each.Latency - none.  Actually I get the sound thru the headphones ever so slightly prior to the sound coming from the TV speakers.  So actually FASTER than the TV.Support - Very good instuctions.  Phone numbers for support (I did not use).  Also received an e-mail a couple days later with more support options including videos...  and a reminder to complete the registration for the warranty (indicates 24 months).Battery -  Took less than 2 hours to charge (it states about 3.5).  I have used them so far for at least 5+ hours and have not had to recharge.  I think they claim up to 40 hours.  I would be happy with 1/2 that.Range - more than sufficient.  Can't say I am getting 100 but even through walls I am getting at least 40+  More than enough.Sound - I am not an efficianado with sound.  Having said that it sounds great to me and am very pleased with the sound quality.So I don't do reveiws for everything I buy.  At the end of the day I am super happy with this purchase.  Seem very solid great performance so far and do exactly what I wanted/hoped they would do.  Had been worried about a couple of items but everything is even better than I had hoped for.  Would absolutly buy again.
5,If you play guitar chances are you're looking at this set as a solution for wireless headphones.  I had tried other Bluetooth headsets but the latency was VERY bad and unacceptable.  I literally couldn't play because the latency was so bad.This set from Avantree is outstanding.  Really any paired Bluetooth set employing the use of the Faststream codec or APT-X LL codec is what you want here.  Anything else and the latency will be terrible and unusable for guitar.Worth noting BOTH the headphones AND transmitter must support one of these low latency codecs for this to work with guitar.There IS the ever so slightest delay with these barely noticeable when playing fast leads.  If you really listen it is there though.  Fast leads aside playing anything else I honestly notice no latency whatsoever.The sound quality is pretty good if not great for what they are.  These are not top of the line headphones so keep that in mind but they have a very well-balanced and good sound.  I play through a Yamaha THRX 10  at night with these when my wife's asleep.  I wouldn't recommend these for any studio application recording or monitoring.  Headphone battery life is outstanding too:  I bought this set 7 months ago use it for a few hours each month and still haven't had to recharge the headphone battery.If you're looking for wireless Bluetooth headphones to play guitar without disturbing others in your house this set will definitely do the job for you!  If you need wireless headphones for studio purpose look into WiFi headphones that use the 2.4Ghz range (or wired headphones) and those will have zero latency but may not get along with your wireless home network since they use the same frequency range.  (this is why I went with Bluetooth over WiFi as my router is close to where I play).
4,I have used this product for the past six months.  The left speaker has stopped working and I have been unable to locate customer service.  The volume control stopped working but the FAQ helped me reinstall the sound control.  Overall this is a fairly decent product; wish it had better support.Subsequent to my initial review Avantree reached out to me and replaced the headphones; they also provided excellent customer service (Rie) and worked with me to reestablish connectivity with the transmitter. I must say that I am more than impressed with the customer care.
3,Product works great.  Have not been able to register.  Tried multiple times.  No response from customer support.  I'll find a different product next time!
5,These headphones have been fantastic! I wear them him for hours during my day and my ears do not get sore. Sound quality is great to me! While I am no audiophile....I tested these by listening to a couple youtube headphone test videos and they did great!During the 1st video someone started knocking on my garage door (I was in my garage) so I paused the video and went out my front door thinking my neighbor had come over but no body was there a lady was walking her dog by so I asked her if she saw anyone by my garage and she said no so by now I'm starting to wonder so I go back in my garage and put my headphones on and rewind and the knocking happened again LOL So the sound quality is just great in my opinion!These things stay charged for the 40 hours and then some too!!!! I'm very impressed with these.They were easy to hook up to our tv using the module that comes with it although that was not my primary intended use I figured for $20 more I might as well have the option so I can listen to tv at night while my wife is sleeping beside me without waking her and they perform great for this!Work just as well hooked to my laptop so I can watch videos on it while shes watching tv in the same room.I did a lot of research trying to find the best buy and with so many great reviews it's hard to know because there are always those negative reviews.In this case I trusted the 5 star reviews and am not disappointed!I've been using these now for 2 to 3 months I think and have had zero problems!!! If in doubt try them!Update April 17th 2020I have now had these headphone 1 year and 3 months and they have been fantastic! I did replace 1 ear cover but that was due to my own carelessness and NOT due to any defect in quality!I have noticed that the amount of time these headphones hold their charge may have diminished some but not alot!  They have always held their charge very close to or over the advertised 40 hours which is a lot!If anything ever happens to this set I will replace with the same ones! In fact I may order another pair just to have on hand or in another room!  Also I can comfortably wear these all day long and I have at times!  I'm retired and use them all day long often times! Great product!!!!
4,No delay in volume
5,VERY PLEASED---EASY TO INSTALL AND GREAT PERFORMANCE
5,I bought this for my aging parent who struggles to hear most anything.This product comes/came with ALL REQUIRED cables. In fact it came with 3 or 4 sets for different types of TV hookups. It also came with a USB power cable AND charging cable for the headphones.Headphones feel/look very nice and sound amazing.There's lots of room to adjust the volume up and down.The little black box that everything runs through seems/appears very cheaply made but I won't remove any stars because putting it inside a metal case or something better may simply not be necessary. So long as the circuit board inside doesn't break it should be fine.Getting it to work couldn't be easier I think. Had it up and running in probably less than 2-3 minutes.I can't comment on how long it will last but I did purchase a warranty for it and I recommend you do too. I've had to use them before and it was both easy and well worth the purchase.If Avantree could do just one thing I think they would be perfect. If they would move the power button to the other side and leave the volume buttons on the other it would make them much easier to use for older people. My mom thinks she's adjusting the volume and is instead pushing on the on/off button. HOWEVER you do have to hold the power button down/in for about 3-4 seconds before they actually turn off .... but still. ;)I rated the battery life at 3-stars and that might not be entirely fair since I don't actually know how long they will last. HOWEVER unless they last 40+ hours they probably don't deserve anything more. Maybe they do. I'll come back and edit after I see.Bottom line don't believe all the bad reviews on Amazon. I honestly believe some of them are faked by the competition but what do I know. :)This is a good set of headphones for watching TV. If they last a couple of years I'll be even happier.
4,For years I have been enjoying the Avantree Audition headphones  while cutting the grass or working out at the gym. I thought it was about time to semi retire this unit. I researched the available units from Avantree. I selected this upgrade so I can watch and listen to the TV in the camper. Then when I tried to listen to this new unit via my bluetooth connection from my older Kyocera phone. After several attempts I had to download the manual from the Avantree website. I read the directions. WOW!! Now that Im connected... incredible clarity and volume. It'll be interesting to see how well they cancel the riding mower noise!!READ THE DIRECTIONS!!
3,HT4189 headphones set requires TWO power supplies aka USB chargers - one for blue tooth transmitter and one to charge headphones. The package includes no power supplies. So prepare to spend another $30  before you can start using these headphones. Initial headphones quality seems good. Adding remaining battery power level indicator would be helpful. Instructions are OK on their website but still had to contact the manufacturer due to my headset requiring longer button hold in order to turn on.
4,It was for my mother who is in a Nursing Home. They were facility compliantShe can use these with out turning up the volume and bothering her roomate.Thank you
5,This transmiter and headphones are worth the price. 40 hours of listening per charge and the transmitter when connected to the TV USB automatically powers down when the TV is off.Excellent optical sound and easy volume control.Range is as advertised I can take out the trash and not lose audio.  Best product at a great price.
4,volume control went out after the 30 days return
5,I like the fact that if you connect these to your TV using the optical audio out port the regular sound is still on. I used regular wired headphones and the pin broke off in the jack. Using your headphones I didn‚Äôt have to buy another tv.
5,I tried other cheaper headphones.  And they worked.  For a while.  Then they wouldn't bluetooth connect and I'd have to consult the Oracle at Delphi to find the magic buttons to reconnect the bluetooth.But these have a transmitter and a set of headphones that can remember each other.It's so nice when there's only one person watching something to leave the rest of the house quiet.Volume control is a bit clunky but once you get a level you like you can leave it alone.  You don't need it especially loud because the ear covers block out other noise.  And the sound quality is quite good even at lower volumes.Latency is decent.  I have this hooked up to an optical splitter the other side goes to a sound bar.  Sometimes we have both on at the same time my Mother in Law can use these like TV Ears.  She puts them over her ears with the head-arch below her chin.  That way we can turn up the volume for her and leave the rest of us watching at a volume we like.  I tried hooking up TV Ears thru bluetooth and got it to work.  But it doesn't always connect.Anyway about the Latency.  If you are listening thru the headphones with the sound bar on it sounds like an echo like in an auditorium.  So the lip movement matches pretty well the sound thru the headphones.  But if the sound bar is off like it normally is when you use the headphones you can see the lip movements are just a bit off.  But I have to watch for it to see it.
5,Before I even go into the headset let me tell you what a great supplier Avantree is!  I originally purchase a WiFi headset from them but it wouldn‚Äôt work.  The headset caused the WiFi signal to the TV to cut out.  Avantree worked really well with me to give me things to try to get the headset to work.  Their customer service is the best I‚Äôve seen EVER!  When the first headset just would not work they gave me credit for it (including the return shipping) an I sent it back.They then suggested a couple of headsets I could try that were Bluetooth not WiFi.  They even said if those didn‚Äôt work I could send them back as well.  Excellent company to work with.Now on to the second headset!  I took it out of the box connected it to my TV turned on bot the transmitter and the headset AND THAT WAS IT!  It connected by itself without me having to do anything.  The headset was charged andI watched 2 movies before I decided I better recharge it (It didn‚Äôt quit I was just playing it safe).  Since then I haven‚Äôt recharged it and I‚Äôve probably watched at least 9 hours of TV so far.Sound quality is very good there is zero lag time and they are comfortable to wear.  Ear pieces adjust up and down so you can get them to fit exactly over your ears without any discomfort.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great headset at a very responsible price.  I looked at both JBL and Sony brands and they were lower rated than the Avantree....and they were more expensive.I‚Äôm 100% behind this product and this company!
5,They work a soon as I plugged in no problem  the sound is extraordinary
4,I bought these headphones  because after owning a pair of Senheisser that I love  I found if I owned 2 pair  they wouldn‚Äôt operate separate TVs. So now I‚Äôll compare these . The good news is they‚Äôre very easy to set up. The battery life is quite long . You don‚Äôt need to rest them on a charging base just plug in when the battery is low . The bad is that the range isn‚Äôt nearly as far as with the Senheisser which allows me to walk everywhere in the house and even go outside a bit  before it starts getting fuzzy . With these if I walk into the room next door  or try going upstairs  it starts getting fuzzy . Turning this pair off sometimes I have to hold onto the ‚Äúoff‚Äù button for a really long time  and it seems that you have to hit the EXACT right spot. There is no mute button either you have to keep click click clicking the volume down.  The top part of the headset and the ear coverings are very comfy though  and they‚Äôre tighter fitting than my Senheisser pair which I can‚Äôt do sit-ups with. With these I can and they don‚Äôt fall off . So overall I‚Äôd give them a B+.  If the company fixed the issues of the finicky ‚Äúoff‚Äù button  and added a mute  they‚Äôd be pretty much perfect .
4,Headphones worked well for 4 months then headphones would not turn on.  With external power red light came on but phone would not try to pair.  The re light would turn off after a short time since the headphones were fully charged.  Contacted Avantee online (couldn't get to a human) and finally gave up after sending numerous e-mails and receiving auto generated replies suggesting I try  various procedures none of which addressed this problem'Contacted Amazon and will be returning the headphones to them  I will be charged a restocking fee of about $22.Therefor I will buy replacement headphones from Walmart Best Buy or somewhere else. UPDATE: Got in touch with Avantree and they sent replacement headphones.  Seems Avantrees automated customer service system could use some improvement.  Customer should be made aware that a problem described in an email which he sends to Avantree will be read and processed by service people and action will be taken.  A description of the actions to be taken would assure the customer that the company is being responsive.In my case I kept getting return emails with suggested procedures to fix the problem (basically quotes from user manuals).  I made an appointment for a phone contact but before the call came I was informed that my complaint had been resolved and that I would receive replacement head phones.Bottom line is that this company lived up to its guaranty.  However it would be better from a customers point of view if the companies claim procedures were clarified.
5,The headphones are for my father who has lost a significant amount of hearing in both ears.  The TV was loud enough to run the rest of the family out of our den.  Some programs (e.g. football basketball) were even too loud in adjacent rooms.  These headphones solved that problem.  We used the headphone jack on the TV since I am already using the optical audio out to feed the stereo for the room.  We powered the transmitter using USB from the TV. The headphones are already Bluetooth paired to the transmitter upon arrival so once I powered up the headphones the setup was completed in seconds.  My father (87 yo) says the headphones are comfortable to wear and has had no issues so far.  We are able to use the headphones and the room audio (through the digital connection to the stereo) at the same time and with separate volume control.  We are very happy.
5,My parents are elderly and not in the best health.  My sister and I take turns staying with them.  Like most if not all old people who have little to do during the day my dad keeps the worst hours up all night napping during the day.  And of course he doesn't think he has a hearing problem because at 1 am the TV will be blaring and the bedroom I use is right next door.  I was getting only a couple hours of sleep a night while caring for them caring for my own family and holding down a job.  It was either go bat crazy or buy him these headphones.  Good thing I went the headphones route.
4,I had an issue with suddenly no sound coming from headphones for no apparent reason.  I contacted Avantree Customer Support who has worked with me to resolve the issue for more an extended time.  They are very responsive to answer emails within a short time.  I worked with "Rie" and she finally was able to come up with a last-resort solution and that was to replace the Optical Out Cable.  Avantree provided a new one for me no charge and that was what the problem was after at least 25 emails trying to resolve the issue.  I was ready to throw in the towel and dump the headphones and glad I didn't.  They're working fine now -- thank you customer support!
5,Easy to hook up. I used it right away. I'm really loving it.
3,The volume control and the on-off switch being on the same button is very awkward to use.  I try to change the volume and instead turn it off.  I returned for a refund.
5,I asked for these for Christmas because of our open concept house. I like to have something on TV for a little entertainment while I am cooking packing lunches loading the dishwasher paying bills and doing other boring stuff in the kitchen but the sound from my kitchen TV and the living room TV compete against each other in this open concept house which is very annoying and gives everyone headaches when the TVs in both rooms are on at the same time. Now I wear the headphones and can watch my shows while I cook and am not bothered by the sound coming from the other TV nor is my TV bothering the rest of the family.I am what today's young people would call a Boomer Mom and am pretty horrible with technology but for these all I had to do was plug the transmitter into the TV and then plug the transmitter's headphone jack into the TV and voila the sound comes out of the headphones. If I can set this up anyone can. Also my kitchen TV is several years old and nothing fancy whatsoever it is a small and very inexpensive Sony which I think cost around $100. I was worried such a an inexpensive bare bones TV wouldn't have the necessary equipment to run these headphones but together the TV and headphones work very well.The range is pretty good also I can pop into other rooms of the house and still hear the broadcast. If I go about three rooms away it starts to get spotty but for the most part I can hear without interruption even when I go into the garage and shut the door behind me.
5,Quality in construction and nice sound.
3,I like to put Cons first. I don't believe in Pro's before H... cons.Cons:Bad instructions. I wanted to connect to a phone. This is my story:The instructions lead you into connecting to the block but not how to connect to a phone. I could find out how to connect a second head set to the block thing that I'll never use. How to reduce volume and increase the volume. How to power off. How to power on. How to connect the box to a "television". Something from the 1900's. Who knows what that is.After googling I found some vague instructions that needed further inquiry."From off state - Press and Hold in the MFB .. you hear first 'welcome' then you will hear 'pairing'." You have to continue holding the MFB. "But wait" you might ask. "What is MFB?" Well a few things come to mind but I promise you they are incorrect. It stands for Multi-function button.There is no noise cancellation; there was no promise of that and as such I don't hold it against them. It is in the cons section only because it has to go somewhere and no one is going to complain about extra capabilities or become gleeful because it doesn't have noise cancellation.If you have ears like most people. A tiny circle does not fit around the ear. As a result anyone listening for let's say 30 minutes you will get an ache in your ear or ears. Thirty minutes is only 1/80th of the battery longevity reported. I end up constantly readjusting for relief. Taking them off and waiting for 40 minutes before putting them on again seems to work kind of okay. (For me this breaks the deal.) I would give four stars if it didn't hurt my ears so much.Pros:The sound quality is fine.The bass is decent.Longevity is fine.Lightweight.Sturdy/strong construction. - This headset will not break like the headsets that have swivels for the speakers. (FYI: All manufacturers install swivels because storage is all the rage because people are worried they can't put all their stuff in one carry-on. As a result they can fit all their stuff but it will break. But they will never learn that because people plan to travel but don't because they are lazy. Seems speaker swivels can be removed but people don't want them removed because it gives them hope or something. I cannot find noise cancelling headsets without swivels.)In all I suppose I'd buy 90 dollar noise cancelling headphones over these knowing full-well that they will break simply for the comfort of my ears.  Ear-aches are not fun. If Avantree were to fix the ear sizes and add noise cancellation only then will they be able to compete with the big-dogs.
5,There are three ways to hook up the transmitter to your TV and any of the three would have worked on my TV (a three-year-old regular - not "smart" - 20" Samsung). Nothing in the instructions indicated which choice would give the best sound so I first chose the easiest way and hooked up the "Audio Cable" to the "AUX Audio Out Headset" connector on my TV and the other end to the transmitter. After experimenting with that for a couple of nights I then disconnected the Audio Cable (make sure you do this if like me you began by connecting it) and connected the "Optical Audio Cable" to the "Optical Out" connector on my TV and then connected the other end to the transmitter. (The "Optical Audio" connection is a bit more complicated because after the cable is connected you have to go to your TV's menu and make sure "External Speakers" and "PCM Audio Format" is chosen before it will work.) Both connections gave excellent sound (I personally couldn't tell the difference) and both connections muted the external sound on my particular TV when the "ON/OFF" switch on the transmitter was turned ON.The only difficulty I had was finding the USB port on my TV. It turned out to be on the side of the TV not the back. The USB cable has to be connected to both your TV and the transmitter so the transmitter will have power. The headphones use a rechargeable battery for power and they were already charged up when I took them out of the box. What the instructions didn't mention was how to turn the headphones on and off. There's a silver button on the left ear-pad (there's an "L" and "R" inscribed faintly on the adjustment piece above each ear-pad) and you have to press and "hold down" the button until a voice tells you the earphones are connected. You turn off the earphones the same way until a voice says "good-bye". Overall I thought the instructions could have been clearer especially as they pertained to the earphones but they were clear enough.Once I understood the instructions (I'm a bit slow when it comes to instructions) setting up the transmitter and earphones was quite easy. The earphones are very comfortable easy to adjust and provide excellent sound that doesn't bleed beyond the earphones. (There's a "+" and "-" button on ether side of the earphone's silver ON/OFF button to adjust the volume.) Overall this unit is well designed and I'm very happy with it.
5,I‚Äôm 74 years young and a little hard of hearing. The Avantree HT 4189 allows me to hear dialogue when watching TV without bothering my wife who has excellent hearing. I use the system on my bedroom TV and I recently bought a new television. The old TV had a different connection from the new set but a number of connecting cables were included. I just had to plug in and the system connected. Everything is working great so far.
