5,My apple watch is the "starlight" color which is sort of a champagne color not quite silver not quite pale gold. I was happy to find a band that had the connectors that were specifically the starlight color to match my watch.  There were several band color options in the starlight color (and other colors for other apple watch options). And it was very affordable.  They included clear instructions and a tool to remove links if needed to get the proper size.  I've only had it a few days but so far so good.  I'm happy with my purchase.
5,This watch band is super cute I have gotten so many compliments on it! It had also been very durable have not had any problems or breakages. It also contains extra parts so you can add on to the band incase it fits too tight or if it’s too lose their is also a tool to help take off pieces as well to adjust. So worth the buy!
5,Cute band!  The metal is a perfect match to the case color. Packaging was easy to open and instructions for removing links was clear. It came with the tool removing pins - not a throw away. Should coordinate well with my coastal grandma vibe.
5,This watch band is really beautiful and looks more expensive than it is. The band itself has great color and texture and the clasp is nice and tight.  This will go with everything and it's going to be my favorite fall watchband. I did have to take out a section to make it smaller. It was a hassle because the pins are extremely tight. On the other hand this is a good thing because it means that the band is not gonna fall apart.Can't say anything bad about this watch band.
5,I tried multiple other bands before I found this one and I was unsatisfied with the others. It’s easy to remove the links to size it for a proper fit it’s comfortable smooth (so no snagging my clothes) and I get compliments on it all the time. I’d highly recommend!
4,Love this cute band. Gave it four stars because it harbers moisture after washing my hands. I ended up with contact dermatitis on my wrist. now I just have to make sure I take the watch off everytime I wash my hands. I'm in the dental field so that's a lot I was my hands about 20 x a day.
5,Love this band. It’s comfortable easy to adjust the length and very attractive. I get a lot of compliment on this band.
5,I like these bands. The one that came with the Apple Watch gave me friction burns on my wrist. I have bought several of these bands in different colors. They’re comfortable and a nice design. I get compliments all the time.
4,The rainbow band is as pictured. I did not notice a band link removal tool in the packaging.  So a nice band but too big. Plus you may want to consider buying from a company that also provided a new protective cover for the watch face.  Mine is all scratched up from previous covers.  My last purchase included a new cover so I assumed they all did.
5,Bought this for my mom and she loves it!! The drawback to this strap is that it is difficult to put on and take off. If you want it for long wear it’s great. It’s lightweight durable can dress up or down. But if you change straps a lot it’s not going to suit your use. Needs 3 hands to put on or take off your watch.
5,I like everything about this band. The price the look the easy on and off. And it looks great!
5,I bought this watch band because it was pretty and looked like it was sturdy.  As of yet I have no complaints.  I have a thick wrist so it fit well.  Usually I have to go up a size.  I had to remove a link to have this one fit me properly which was easy to do.  I wear this daily right now and have had no discoloration from the band.  I work out 4 or 5 days a week and the band has been exposed to sweat and water.  I am so far very happy with my purchase.
5,My husband who happens to be the coolest loves the look of the band!
4,I was in search of a apple watch band to elevate my look for work or date nights this is gorgeous!
5,I love the look. Elegabt yet sporty🤩
5,Easy to put on take off. Looks and feels nice!
5,I’ve been wearing the band most days for a month and it’s holding up well. The pale pink/burgundy tortoise shell style is a great color and looks like the photo in the description.
5,Se siente cómodo y se mira bello compraré ams
5,I really like this piece. I have the sports band from Apple. But this one allows me to wear my watch to nice events without looking like inspector gadget in heels. It takes it up a notch. Sometimes that’s all you need.
5,I love this and love all the colors on it. As a nurse I wear different uniforms and I always try to match my watchband along with my glasses! Lol I get so many compliments on this band and have referred and shared the link so many times that they should send me another one free lol definitely recommend this company in this band. Links are easy to remove was very helpful instructions.
5,The band looks great and it is easily adjustable.
5,I have really enjoyed this new watch band. Beautiful super comfortable and easy to adjust. At first I removed 2 links and felt like it was a bit tight for me - easily added one back. Perfect now. My wrist is just under 7 inches at the most narrow part and I like the watch to sit about an inch back from that. I will buy another one!
4,I love this band just a fair warning it is tedious and a bit aggravating to go through the steps of taking the extra chains off to have it for correctly. Luckily once you do this you shouldn’t have to again but just wish it was a little simpler!
5,Very beautiful band. Looks like a bowl of old school Christmas candy.
4,Easy to remove once you know how.  Good looking watch band and the unique starlight colors matched my Apple Series 7 watch.  Too soon to speak to durability.
5,I get so many compliments on my band.  It is durable and comfortable and goes with all my outfits!!
5,I wear an AW but it doesn’t go with anything that’s my aesthetic. I don’t want the leather bands either because the point of this watch is all-day wear for mobility tracking and swimming would be prohibitive. This watch band solved my problems rolls with my vibe and what a great pricetag too.
4,I use this band often. I have the dark tortoise shell color - I goes with a lot of outfits. It’s a little hard to take on and off the watch since it is a one piece band. But I like the look enough to keep using it. Acceptable quality for a plastic thing.
5,This band is so comfortable!
5,I love it.
5,Perfect fit after removing a few links. Fashionable and comfortable. Seems to be made of good quality. Will buy again in other colors.
5,This watch band is absolutely beautiful. They send you the tools to take out a link if you need to which is super awesome. I love it
5,Very sturdy as far as taking in and off but best thing is how it goes with everything from jeans to formal wear!
5,I love this band. It goes with everything. You can dress it up or down. And I especially liked how easy it was to remove the lengths and put back together. All in all good quality and good price!!
4,I purchased this band because my gf had one on. It was bright colors and beautiful. When My band arrives it wasn’t what I expected. It was darker then what the picture showed.
5,Perfect band. Comes with a pin and an extra link if needed. Durable.
5,Love this band sooo much- it looks expensive and has taken a beating since I got it over month ago. Easy to adjust down in size it’s definitely one of the best after market bands I’ve ever gotten!
5,I love this watch I just wish it had some smaller links to adjust it more.  I took out 2 links however it is slightly too big still.  But not big enough to take another link out.
5,The watch band is lightweight but incredibly durable. Adding and removing links was incredibly easy with the provided tool. I have three and am about to order a fourth. The clasp matches my watch perfectly. I absolutely could not be more pleased with this purchase. Highly recommended!!
4,I loved this band for summer use but noticed the metal clasp is discoloring. I don't wear it in the water and I'm surprised that it's done this after a month of wearing it.
4,My apple watch is a series 7 sports black watch. I wanted a more formal look in rose gold so I ordered the pretty watch band.  The watch band is cute but it didn't come with the watch screen protector case.  So I ordered one separately and it didn't match the color of the metal part of the band.  It would have made more sense if the seller offered a matching case so that it was guaranteed to match.  I don't want to have to keep shopping for the right color watch case to find the correct color to match the band.
5,I love my band. The color is beautiful. The band was a little too big but you only have to take out a couple of links out. Everyone loves it
5,I’m going on almost a year of using this band! I am constantly using gloves and the band has been very durable for my job.
5,There is nothing I don't like about this watchband for Apple watches!
5,I never write reviews but I’m so impressed with how this band looks!It arrives big but comes with a tool to easily remove the brackets yourself. I removed 3 for the best fit. It’s very snug so I wish I could have removed a smaller bracket but I think the aesthetics are worth not being able to rotate it when it’s on.I wore it while giving my son a bath and it was fine fully submersed in the water. I plan to exercise and swim with it as well and will report back if it doesn’t hold up.
4,Love it and have received many compliments! Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the amount of difficulty in removing the links for resizing - you could seriously stab yourself with the small sharp tools!
5,This band is very pretty and seems well made. I bought the one to go with the Starlight metal of the watch but the second time I wore it I put on a black protector for the face and that looks terrific.
5,Looks great on my Apple watch!  Really dresses it up.  It is fashionable and very easy to put on and take off.I will probably order several more for versatility!
5,Dgytdgug
5,I love this band it comfortable and doesn’t make me sweat like silicone bands!
5,The pictures don’t do it Justice! My favorite watch band.
5,Very sturdy. Very well made. Very pretty colors.
5,This watch came with its own tool to resize. Very easy to use!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I absolutely love this watch band!! It is super comfy and easy to remove. I have gotten so many compliments on my watch. I love the classy elegant look of it. Definitely would recommend!
5,Beautiful bracelet  and easy adjust.
5,I was pleasantly surprised when I received this. I didn’t set me expectations too high since it’s only $20 but it looks a lot more expensive than that. I can’t speak to the durability yet because I just got it today. I had to take out three links (with the tools and instructions that were provided). Very easy to do. Overall I am very happy! Just for reference I have the Apple Watch 5 in “gold” which I consider more of a rose gold and the hardware on this band matches decently. Up close the hardware on the band is a bit more yellow and shiny than the watch face but you cannot tell from a normal distance. If you are hesitating I would say to just buy it!
4,I loved this watch band. However I had to take it off and go back to my apple watch sport band instead. Removing links was no problem but I wish the links were smaller. My wrist size is in the middle where if I remove 3 links it becomes too tight but if I only remove 2 links it still slides around on my wrist and then my watch doesn’t stay exactly upright. Would be better if the links were smaller for people who are in between wrist size like me.
4,Only thing I don’t like is that you can’t rest your wrist on it while using a mouse at work because if it’s a tight fit the metal clasp presses into your skin. Other than that it’s nice. Also easy to size up or down
5,I love my watch band it’s light in weight and the links are easy to remove.
4,I had to remove 5 links for the band to fit my tiny wrist.  However after removing 5 links I was unable to slip the band into my watch as there wasn't enough wiggle room.  The only way to attach the band to the watch is to dismantle the link insert both ends of the band then reattach the links.  This would be fine if I am not constantly changing my bands to match my outfits.  So I have to return the band.
3,The colors on this band are beautiful.  However they look cheap.  Good instructions on how to remove slats.  Pinches on the arm.
5,I wanted a comfortable resin band for my Starlight Apple watch 7 Series. This was a colorful easy-to-adjust fun great choice.
5,I love this band. It is a very pretty pink. To be fair I have a black face not rose gold so I put the rhinestone face on it that I already had laying around to cover up the black face.
3,The look is nice if you need it for photos etc. But the feel is plastic obviously. Easy to size down for your wrist size. The wrist band is sturdy and pretty but the clasp is cheap. It’s not worth more than $15But a good entry way to high end bands to check the style.
5,I’ve ordered this same watch band twice! I love it. The first time I ordered this band was at the beginning of 2020 and used it on my watch all the time I was even using it at the gym. It is super lightweight and pretty for every day use. The only reason I bought this new one 2 years later is because I would get it wet all the time and it started getting a wet smell from it since the watch only comes off for sleep. I totally recommend it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This watch band is a beautiful tortoise color and it’s very comfortable to wear . I’ve received many compliments on it . I would highly recommend purchasing this band for the look quality and price .
5,I've been wearing this watch band for several months and it has held up well.  I work out in it and I sweat a lot -- it is easy to wipe down with a cloth. I've definitely dropped it -- no cracks or breakage yet. It's a fun upgrade from the fabric watch bands.
4,**Update** Seller customer service was very responsive to my review and are sending me a new one. They seem very interested in righting the wrong. The only reason for not doing five stars is the fact that it fell apart in general.Was at first very pleased with this watch band and really loved the look of it and comfortability however very disappointed that after 4 months the band just completely fell apart and now I’m out a watch band!
3,Can’t fine tune the size as well as other watches but it is very pretty.
3,Watch latch scratched after only a few hours of wearing in office  very disappointing
5,The colors of the band go with everything I wear.One of my favorite watch bands.
5,This band compliments my watch head perfectly. I will be buying more colors!
5,I have received endless compliments on my band.  It is exceptionally durable.  I have had it during yard work where I forgot to remove it or my rings.  It has held up to a lot of my non graceful daily use.  I highly recommend it.  Easy easy sizing to add or remove links.  I would easily purchase again!!!!
5,Wife hated the original Apple Watch band with the old fashioned two piece slip through and pin band. She loves this band in regards to looks non pinching comfort and the one piece flip latch with easy opening press pins. When band is open it stays in “one piece”! Extremely easy to remove sections for a custom fit. Doubtful but if she ever has a problem with it I’m buying her another one!!
4,Love the materials and clasp but needed to adjust it and it wasn’t clear how to do it.
4,I got the multi-color watch band and the colors are vibrant but not overly bright. The links were easy to remove and replace in order to adjust to your wrist size. It comes with a tool and extra link pin. I gave it 3 stars for durability only because it’s new and I don’t know yet how the clasp will hold up.
4,I received this watch band only late yesterday.  It is very good looking. but I did not realize what I would have to do to make it fit. I'm sure it is probably easier for someone much younger than me.  The links had to be removed in order for it to be adjusted..  A tool is provided to push the metal pieces out to do this but it takes way more strength than I have to do this easily. It is also a very awkward to hold the band while trying to remove and then reinsert the metal piece. By the time I was on the third link the tool bent so badly that I was very lucky to actually accomplish the task.  The tool certainly cannot  be used again to remove  another link. I really like the looks of the band and am happy to have it but I would recommend it for someone younger and more agile if making it fit is needed.  I only put 3 stars for the durability because I need to wait to see if those same metal pieces holding the links will not slip out.  I'll try to update review as time passes.
5,Looks great with everything outfit
5,I had to undo and redo the links multiple times before I found the perfect sweet spot. It’s a little difficult to remove the links bc of the tiny pieces and the tool to help with it ended up bending making it more difficult
5,I love this colorful tile watch band. It’s very unique. Similar to magnetic tiles my Grand daughter plays with. It gets noticed by many people and it’s very comfortable on my wrist. Highly recommend it!
5,This is a great watch band!  It fits my Apple Watch perfectly was very easy to install and adjust the size with the provided tools. The material is durable and remains looking new with daily use. I love how lightweight and flexible the links are and get many complements on this band.
5,LOVE this band  design and color. My Apple Watch is red so it’s perfect. Sturdy too feels great on. Ordering another one.
5,Extremely easy to remove a link to achieve the perfect fit. Light weight and very durable. I wear this as an everyday band and so far it’s holding up to my active work day. Would recommend and definitely will be buying in other colors!
5,I love how easy it is to use and adjust length. It’s beautiful and high quality. The latch works great and there hasn’t been any issues with the high frequency in which I wash my hands as a nurse.
4,Looked great when I first got it but after daily use I started to see the pins inside getting darker and I couldn't clean it. I thought this would be a great alternative to the silicone band since those seem to make the skin of my wrist react but this did the same after continued use.
5,Love this apple watch band! It looks a million times better than the silicone ones that they come with. A little more dressy and a little less Spy Kids.
4,Very easy to install I took quite a few links off and it fits snuggly. My Apple Watch has a very fancy look now. The strap is very easy to use in fact safer and more comfortable than the original strap the watch came with.
3,Very cute band but doesn’t fit right in the slots where it holds on to the watch. Didn’t affect the watch from staying on though
5,I purchased this watch band and only wore it a few times before having a baby and setting it aside for some time. It was beautiful from the start and I got so many compliments anytime I wore it. I recently started wearing it again and had issues with the spring link. I contacted the seller and they were incredibly responsive resolved the issue and I will 100% purchase another band from them in the future. Don't delay - purchase one of these watch bands you won't regret it!!!
5,I really like the watch band gives it just enough to be dressy but not too much that it can't be worn casual. Great for my line of work in nursing.
5,Cute and functional and came with a tool to remove links.
5,Absolutely love this band. It goes with everything
5,The color is nice
5,Really light and comfortable
4,So far it’s okay. It feels more like plastic than resin to me but for the price it’s better than those ugly bands that are available on the original watch site. It is a light and comfortable band. The only confusing part is in the instructions for removing the links. On step #3 it says to “pull out the small iron rod”. You actually need to PUSH it pretty hard for the rod to come out on the other end and THEN pull it with the B head. I think it’d be easier to clarify this part and would save people the time of having to look at videos online. The band seems like it will stay pretty secure so far. This band also served the purpose of helping to dress up my silver aluminum watch versus exchanging the watch and dropping an additional $300 on the stainless steel version. I like it enough to consider buying another one as long as this one stays on securely.
5,This watchband is prettier than it appears online. Links are easy to remove for sizing and it feels comfortable on my wrist. I get complemented on it almost every day.
5,I love this band i want a coupme more bu far one of my favorites
5,Such a beautiful watch band for the price. Great instructions on removing band pieces to make it fit. Love the color. So glad I bought it!I have now owned this band for over 6 months and have worn it every day. I have worn it on outings while moving into a new apartment and while teaching. I still looks brand new and has never given me any problems. Still give it 5 stars and worth every penny. Everyone gives me compliments.
5,LOVE THE QUALITY LOVE LOVE THE COLORS
5,The band is beautiful and lightweight. Great for any outfit. Comfortable and easy to adjust’
5,I ordered this watch band to dress up my Apple Watch. With a smaller wrist several links needed to be removed but the process was easy.  Tools and directions are included.The band is easy to put on and take off with a metal clasp.I will be ordering another color.  There are so many pretty colors and the price is great.
4,This band is gorgeous but from afar up close you can tell it's plastic (but I don't mind for the price). It's been pretty durable for the few months I've been using and it was easy to take some of the notches out so it my watch could fit on my wrist properly. Not as comfy as a silicone band so don't expect exceptional comfort but she looks like the pic and will hold up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Is light weight very colorful I love it but very long  came with a tool to adjust I have to find out how to do it I’m sure is no hard other than that it’s very cute and you can use with a different case colors
5,I have a very small wrist and had to remove 4 links.  It fits perfectly and looks and feels great.  I had no trouble removing the pins but when I had to re- attach 2 of the pins gave me a little trouble.  Make sure you are removing them and putting them back in the correct position.  Instructions are clear but I only skimmed them and didn't read closely which was the reason I had little trouble.Have already received many compliments and passed along the link to this product to 3 people.  The flower pink doesn't really look pink at all.  Sort of an off-white  tortoise shell dotted with some blush-colored specs.  Very nice for the summer - goes with everything. Doesn't pinch. When I am doing a serious workout hike or long bike ride I will probably switch to the original velcro band.
5,Can easily be adjusted to fit love the colors; comfortable to wear.
5,Love the way my new watch and looks! Easy to remove a couple of links for a perfect fit
3,My wrist is very slender—size 2.  I wanted to love this band but I seldom wear it.  It was easy to remove links to make it smaller but by the time I made it small enough to fit my wrist it was hard to buckle and difficult to install on the watch.I added 2 links back to even make it possible to buckle. Even with that  I have to start sliding  both sides at the same time to install  it on the watch.Also it is not as comfortable as my other bands. It is pretty though and I have received compliments both times I have worn it.
5,Easy to adjust the links- looks super cute.
5,So pretty! Love it!
5,I love the band!  I have gotten many compliments on it.
5,Great stylish band. I love the colors. Goes great with my rose gold watch.
3,Well half an hour and a bleeding thumb later I adjusted it well enough to wear.  Its cute and colorful but not worth hassle
5,It’s a very nice watch band. The colors are great. I had to take a few links out but it was easy with the tool provided.
5,The band is beautiful and I get a lot of compliments on it. It looks like it would be metal but it’s actually a lightweight plastic material which I like better because I’ve had metal bands and they scratch and the paint peels off. My only complaint is the tool that comes with it to take out links. It’s hard to use. Other than that I highly recommend this band!
4,I’m not happy with it. It looks a little cheap because it looks plastic. I thought it was going to be a type of stone but it’s plastic. I will be returning it. It’s over priced for the quality.
5,Fits my Apple Watch and looks and feels great!!!🥰🥰🥰
5,I am very happy with the watch band.
3,I like it. But it’s hard to change the size and it’s super easy to wear
5,This is the second one that I have purchased I now have two different colors these watch bands are very cool on your arm they don’t make you sweat They are very sturdy and beautiful … I have a lot of watchbands most of them plastic ones make my arm sweat and therefore is very uncomfortable and I ran across this one day and like I previously stated  I have two now and if they come out with a different color I will have three….FYI you may need to take out some links but it is very easy it comes with the piece that you will need to take the link out which is great
5,I love this band ! Don’t regret buying it !It goes with all colorsDurableEasy to install
5,**I’m not getting paid for leaving a positive comment**  Let’s get that out of the way first! I became a collector of bezels and bands after purchasing my Apple Watch series 5 44mm. I’ve had my share of “bad” products and some really great ones too! This is by far my favorite watch band in rose/black. The shipment was pretty fast and the package presentation was secure. Nothing was hard at all for me to just slide the bands in and VOILA!! Lucky for me I didn’t have to take away any links because it fit to my wrist perfectly. It looks like it’s made out of resin and the colors are so beautiful through and through nothing painted on here. I’ve gotten compliments and I love showing it off in public. I’m excited to say I’ll most definitely buy again in other colors.
5,I love the watchband but it was not going to fit my 8” Wrist. I had to get a hold of the company that sold it to send me some Links. They Contacted me right back. They said they would send them right to me. They did. Only they sent a whole new watchband because they were out of links  they said! They are very trustworthy about their products! I would buy again.
5,Like most the easy to remove and put on. The quality of the look
5,Love this watch band! It was easy to remove links so it's a perfect fit on my wrist. I love that they include the tool to do this as well. Makes my apple watch a little more stylish and not quite so sporty for everyday wear. I get comments and compliments on it all the time. Highly recommend!
3,This band is super cute but I just can’t get it to fit my wrist properly. The links were not terribly difficult to remove but I removed a couple and the band is still too loose. So much so that the watch will lock or shut off because it thinks it’s off my wrist. So I take out one more link and then it’s too tight and uncomfortable. I’m not sure of a solution for this so maybe it’s just that I have a weird wrist size but I was disappointed with this band.
5,Pros: Easy to adjust seems fairly durable lovely designCons: As other reviews describe color is not exactly like the photo - I was aware of this so not a problem. I purchased the Tortoise Stone Flower it’s a very pale pink/off white and deep brown
5,I got this because I’m allergic to all metals and plastic breaks my wrist out. Resin and stainless steel is great. It’s easy to shorten and lengthen. The colors are so vast! I got the tortious shell and it’s very nice. It’s not too thick or too thin
5,Easy to wear.
3,Too tight
5,This is by far my new favorite watch band. It is beautiful comfortable and easy to add/remove links.
5,I’m always looking for watch bands to feed my addiction. These are the first I’ve bothered to write a review for. First off it came super quick! I was concerned about size but the band comes with a tool to remove links as well as a few extra pins.  Since the band doesn’t twist from side to side getting it on actually required a second of thought.  I only had to remove one link which I was able to figure out how to do without the instructions….I later found once I was done.  This is my favorite bad so far! I love how it looks and feels!
4,I just received this watch band today. I would have given it a five star but getting it on the watch itself and taking the band off isn’t that efficient. Because of the angle of the Iwatch channels  when you put the band on the one side goes in but trying to get the second band in you have to twist it at an angle and this seems like eventually it will weaken and break. Same thing with taking it off the Iwtach. This is all one piece  unlike most the bands that come in two pieces. Finally this is my fault) I didn’t read the description that well and thought it was metal of some kind. It’s a light weight hard plastic. We will see if it keeps from scratching up. I am pretty hard my watches.
5,I saw this band online and really wondered how it would hold up.  I'm very hard on watch bands and with this being a heavy plastic-like material I was a little skeptical regarding the durability.  First this band is PERFECT for my gold apple watch.  It's gorgeous.  I get so many compliments on it.  The 'white' is more of an 'off-white' so it will work well through the fall and winter months.  Unlike other link watch bands I've owned this one does not catch and pull on your arm hair at all.  I didn't have to remove any links so I cannot speak to the ease or difficulty to removing links but the band did come with a tool to assist with link removal.  I ordered the tortoiseshell band as well and it's equally gorgeous.  You will not be disappointed.
5,Loving the colors in this easy to put on watch band! So me👍🏽
4,i get so many compliments when i wear the pink band. i bought the off-white colored one but the size is different. i used the same amount of chain links as the other but it fits smaller.
5,Excelente
5,This is so comfortable and chic! It’s so well made compared to others I’ve purchased. Would highly recommend!!!!
5,Love this band.  I have received so many compliments.  Great purchase!
5,Love this band. Gonna order a few more just like this but different colors.
5,I love this band. So many people have asked me where I got it. It’s comfortable durable and super cute. 10/10 would recommend
5,One of my favorite purchases from Amazon. 10/10
5,I love my watch band. It is absolutely beautiful and matches the stainless steel version of my watch perfectly. I emailed the company to inquire about getting an extra link to make it looser (I just like mine that way - it actually fits fine). They were amazingly responsive. They’ve definitely made me a repeat customer. As for the band. I’ve already gotten several compliments about it and everyone wants to know where I got it. I love it!
5,I have  very small wrists.  I am not very handy so I was worried that it would be difficult to shorten but the instructions were very clear and it fits perfectly.  It looks very expensive.  I am very happy with my purchase.
4,This band is very beautiful and comfortable. I loved the first one so much that I gave it as a gift to a dear friend and immediately ordered a second one for myself. My only disappointment is the metal hardware on the second band. The first band was a muted silver metal that matched the silver Apple Watch perfectly. The second is a bright shiny metal that I am not loving compared to the first band. I guess I expected the same product when ordering a second. I can live with it but I sure wish I had received one identical to the first that prompted the second order. Which is the only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5.
3,The color was a yellow-ish white.  Too creamy of a color for me.  Wanted a truer white Pearl
5,Comes with instructions on how to remove extra links as well as the tool to do it with. Easy to put the band back together after removing extra links. Love the light weight band and it looks great too. Have gotten lots of compliments on it.
4,This watch band is very pretty. I had to take out a few links because I have really small wrists. It slips around which I don’t like but it’s not heavy at all. I wish it was more comfortable but Ive been wearing it for a couple months now & have gotten used to it. It’s so close to getting 5 stars I just wish it fit alittle bit better & didn’t move around. Regardless it’s pretty & I will wear it for special occasions. Probably going to get another color as well to wear when dressed up too.
5,I had to take a couple of links out it was so easy to remove them. The colors are more vibrant in person.
5,Got this for my mom for Valentine’s Day good eyesight necessary for removing links as the arrows on the inside of the band are very hard to see!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Easy to remove
5,I've worn this band for a few weeks and it fit perfectly from day one and is very comfortable to have all day. Great looking many color options. I've had at least 4 different Apple Watch bands over the last few years and this one is tops in style comfort and ease to put on and take off. Highly recommend
5,This watch band was just as pictured and described. It is very pretty and so lightweight. Im a plus size woman so the band was a little snug. I wrote them asking if they sold links so i could adjust it. They messaged me quickly and responded that they unfortunately did not have separate links and would send me a watch band free of charge for me to add on. Within 3 days i received the 2nd watch band and i added two more links to fit a little looser. Removal and addition was so simple!
5,I received an Apple Watch for Christmas and wanted a more stylish band. A vlogger I follow on social media recommend this one (different color) and I love it. Very easy to put on/take off and matches everything.
5,So cute and stylish! Comfortable and easy to put on/take off. I removed 3 links which was super easy to do.
3,Coloring was good but I have tiny wrists and when I put it on the clasp hit right on my wrist bone. It was very uncomfortable. I can't speak for durability because I had it on maybe 5 minutes to try adjusting. I sent it straight back.
5,I get many compliments on this band people ask me all the time where I get it. I really like that it came with the tools to remove the excess links was very easy to do and haven’t had any problems yet the clasp is holding up very well I am a nurse and wash my hands a lot and wrists so it’s gets bathed regularly. Good product for me so far!!
2,I liked everything about this strap and wore it about a week. I was reaching into a cabinet and bumped the strap and it just broke apart at the part where it connects to the watch. It wouldn't go back together. It's very cheap.
5,Great quality and one thing I love about it is it doesn’t tug/pull on my arm hair. Definitely would recommend and re-buy!
5,The band is beautiful.  I did have to remove a link and it was east to do.  It’s very comfortable.
5,I like how light weight the band is. It looks amazing on my Iwatch. I plan on ordering more colors. I had to remove two links and it fits perfectly!!!
5,I was worried it wouldn’t look good with my rose gold watch. It sooooo does. Have little wrist so I had to remove some links. Hard to get the pins out but I managed!  Super happy
5,I love my new Apple Watch band it’s very light weight I even would forget my watch was on my arm once I jump in the shower and it matches well with a couple of my outfits!I had many people stop me to ask where I get it from. You should purchase it it’s very cute plush stylish as well as fancy and it look exactly as the picture. If you looking to purchase this band buy it.
5,Their beautiful watchbands the only thing is when you have to remove the links it does come with the tool to use you have to have patience to do it but other than that they’re great💜
5,The band arrived today very well packaged. It’s really beautiful in person! I have the rose gold watch and this color combo looks awesome with it. I’ve been wearing it a few hours and so far it’s really comfortable. My old band was the stock Apple nylon and it was itchy at times. This is really smooth. I have small wrists and easily removed 3 links. It fits great! I love that it came with the tool to remove links as well as extra pins. I was worried that the clasp might be too big/bulky but it’s not. I don’t feel it at all. I would buy more in some other colors!
5,Goes perfect with the rose gold Apple Watch.
3,I found taking the pins out of the sections easy but putting them back in after you remove the link was so difficult. And even after removing the links it was still too big. You take one too many out and it's too small but not enough out and it's too big. Not for me.
5,This mother-of-pearl effect band is the most comfortable one I’ve tried. I had developed an allergy to the metal on the underside of the rubber/silicone watch bands so bought this and no problems at all.
4,This band is SO pretty and it works well BUT it doesn't sit flush in the gap where it connects to the watch and almost every time I flip my hair behind my shoulder ( I have long hair) my hair gets caught in the gap and several strands get ripped out. Not sure if this applies to all of them or if I just got a weird one but it's the only negative I've found.
4,This watch band is ok I really wanted to send it back but I had something’s come up & I forgot to send it back within the allotted time. The band looks better online than it does in person. It’s light weight & thus far I haven’t had any issues with it. It matches the rose gold Apple Watch almost perfectly it’s just a little shinier thank the Apple Watch but not enough to notice unless you’re really looking.
5,Even prettier in person. I’ve gotten many compliments.
5,I got this band after my silicone band started causing a rash. I work in healthcare and handwash/disinfect often and I think the constant dampness was just too much for my skin under a tight fitting band.  I got this instead because it allows for a bit more breathability and my watch can move around a bit on my wrist. It's been holding up beautifully and I get compliments on it all the time.
5,Super adorable. Easy on and off.
5,LOVE IT! okay so I got the band and had to remove about 3 of the notches. I poked myself but it wasn’t too bad. Overall the process is simple but if you’re clumsy like Me take a little more care! Easy to wear and remove. The comfort is what you’d expect it’s not leather but from the picture we know that. So for what it is it’s comfy and doesn’t grab any part of my wrist. I receive so many compliments every single time I wear the watch! It’s super durable. Again I’m clumsy so the band has been wonderful for the price. When I go to stores I can’t seem to find a design like this so it definitely stands out. If you like to accessorize go for it.
5,Nice quality. East to size. Recommend
5,Pretty band! Lightweight and comfortable! Dresses up the watch!  However there were no instructions!To adjust band:Use small end of included tool. Locate the down arrow on the link. Push pin out in that direction. Use same procedure to remove as many links as needed. Then locate the split end of the pin. Put the links back together and insert pin with split end going last. Push pin until tight.The v shaped end of the tool is for replacing the pin where the band connects to the part that hooks on to the watch.
2,I returned this item without even checking fit - though it does come with appliances to help adjust band size. Very helpful. I just had issue with color as I saw it in the add. Pink became a more irredescent light purple.
5,It looks really nice and surprisingly the gold hasn't tarnished or worn down. I think I've had this for less than a year and still love it. It's not a perfect match the apple watch 3 rose gold but you'd have to be looking hard at it to see the difference. I have scrawny wrists and was able to remove the necessary amount of links to size it properly. I believe it did come with the tool to remove the pins and may and extra link or two if wanted to size (but truthfully can't remember 100% if it included extra links.
5,I receive a lot of compliments on this band. It’s very pretty and was easy to install.
5,I absolutely love this band it is so beautiful. Very easy to take links out of!
2,So I purchase this 3 times because it was defective . The first time it lasted about 2 months and the gold button broke off like nothing while wearing it.Second time  I received it and it was dirty and missing parts. And missing the post card with the instructions. (My pictures show how I received it the second time) it’s so obvious it was used and returned. Look at the end of the watch it’s missing pieces. So NOW I’m waiting on the 3rd one because I obviously exchanged it for a NEW one. So let’s hope I do r get any surprises. I really loved this band but if I’m going to keep getting a crappy one I’m just going to return it AGAIN and find a new band to purchase away from these. I’ll add stars until I get  brand new one. Not a used one all scratched up and dirty.
5,It goes well with a lot of things. It’s comfortable to wear.  It was easy to remove links so the watch band would fit my small wrists. I get compliments on it. I’m considering getting some of the other colors. I have the pink-ish /rose colors one.
5,I had a space grey Apple watch for years so when I upgraded & went with the rose gold i actually had a hard time finding an everyday band that I love. But this is it!😍 The material is great  comfortable & good quality- I think it’ll look new like forever! It comes with the tool to remove links & it was super easy. When I'm ready for different colors I'm definitely sticking with this brand! (& for anyone wondering even though the clasp isnt the exact same color rose gold it's close enough & looks great on it!)
4,Really cute and dressy or dress down.  I would've given this 5 stars if I could've sized it down by 1 1/2 notches.  1 is too loose 2 was a bit too tight.  But other than that.  I love the look and will be just fine with a slightly looser fit.
5,Looks nice with dressy clothes & work out clothes.  Was easy to take out some links.  Especially like the clasp to take on & off.  More like a typical watch band that’s easy to open & close with one hand.  Love it!!  Will order another one in a different color.
4,Not so easy to adjust
5,Super cute!  Easy to adjust and “install”. Fun colors
3,Update: unfortunately this band only lasted for five months. I used it every day wore it to work in an office. And then the pin started coming out at the latch part so it fell off my wrist a couple times on the carpet no big deal I easily put the pin back in with my fingernail. Then the third time the pins fell out of both sides of the latch and it landed on the concrete shattering my screen (luckily I had a protective shield on the screen). But it was finally time to put it to rest. Too bad because it’s cute and I did get compliments on it. But really a watch band should last longer than 5 months so I am disappointed. Can’t say I’d recommend it anymore.Original: Hubs got me this watch band as a gift. It’s so cute I love the pink marble look. It’s also easy to adjust with the tool they give you. Definitely recommend.
4,I loved this watch band! At first I was skeptical about how I was going to resize the band to fit my wrist but it was super easy and came with instructions! I will definitely buy again in different colors!
5,Beautiful easy to resize
4,I think it’s really cute but I wish there was a half-sized link. If I add a link then it slides around on my wrist. If I remove a link then it’s pretty tight on my wrist.
4,Pros:super easy to adjust to the correct sizelightweightstylishdurablereasonably pricedcomfortableCons:no cons with a dark colorhowever with a light color (pink rose) it collects and shows dirt very easily. dirt collects in the pins so you can see the build up through the links (see pic). I took apart the whole band took all the links out and meticulously cleaned it all. a few weeks later it looks dirty again. I will keep wearing the dark colors only.
4,The description states "Fit for all wrists smaller than 8.7".I respectfully say "HOGWASH".My wrist measures 7.5" and it is so tight that it won't move on my wrist at all. AND I have the largest Apple Watch made (44mm).I love the design but the length is grossly misrepresented.UPDATE: Thanks to good customer service the seller hooked me up so that I can wear this band proudly.Originally I was disappointed because the band would not fit me. I really like the style and wanted to be able to have a "different" band than others might have.Just as an FYI. The band is 6.75" when laying flat.I am now quite pleased after having the length problem resolved.
3,I order the Sandwich tortoise stone. It turned out more cream colored than I thought it would be. I was expecting a more yellow color where the cream is. I didn’t like the color at all and it looked even worse on my watch and next to my skin. The quality was okay it was a very light plastic and I’m not sure how long it would’ve lasted. I will be returning and for the price I might find a way better one at the store.
3,Paid for a new watch band and received what appears to be a used watch band.The used items were selling for about 8 dollars less.Fell like I got taken.
5,Watch band is pretty and comfortable  Love it after taking out2 links.
4,It has taken me a long time to find a band  for my Apple Watch 4 that is functional looks professional and is comfortable. I finally found all 3 with this watch band.  This band is the closest I have found to matching the rose gold color of my watch. Removing links was fairly easy once I read the directions (I tried without reading directions and failed).  Removed one star because one of the ends of the band that slides into the watch has some tiny pieces that fell apart.  They seem important and luckily I was able to get it back together.  I highly recommend this band for anyone looking for a professional looking watch band. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,One of the best watchbands I have found!
5,The band is beautiful. I love it. The metal clasp has not irritated my skin like some of the after market Apple Watch bands. I would definitely purchase it again.
4,The color is peach and emerald green. The color was not what I expected. Otherwise a nice watchband. I easily removed 2 links for a perfect fit. The color difference is why I did not give it 5 stars.
5,I love it! Works perfect!
4,This band is so gorgeous and a great value for the price. I was so excited to order this that I forgot to check the Apple Watch size and ordered a size too large - so be sure to check before you order! The band comes with instructions and a tool for removing and adjusting the size. It takes a little extra strength to get the pins removed and warning that the tool and the pins so easily bend - see my photo. Would’ve been nice if it came with at least one extra pin just in case. Other than that - looks great!
5,I get so many compliments when I wear my apple watch. It’s such a pretty design and very durable as well. Also it’s really easy to shorten and lengthen the band with the directions. I love that it lets my wrist breathe too.
5,So impressed with the quality for the price.  I can even swim with it. IAlso have the forgotten shell.  Both haven’t shown any wear.
5,Good looking but cheaply made. Bought mine last October & it’s already fallen apart!
5,I really like this watch band. It was easy to remove links to make it smaller for my wrist. I moved one link from each side. The links are beautiful and durable. This watch feels nice and cool allowing air to circulate and does not make my wrist sweat as my other sport bands do. It is beautiful colors and matches everything. I can wipe it with a damp cloth if I get something on it. I like this so much I will buy the other color. It lays flat and smooth so nothing catches on your clothes. It is one click to get on or off. It is secure and does not fall off nor come unlocked. Great band.
5,I really like the way this band looks with my Apple Watch! It’s stylish light weight & a really nice light pink. The clasp is easy to open & close. It’s comfortable. Putting it onto my Apple Watch was pretty easy. Removing links was also pretty easy. I like that it comes with an extra pin just in case you lose one you have a back up. I just got it today so I can’t say how durable it is. This was a great purchase for the price!
5,Love the look and the comfort using it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love the colors. Very light weight and surprisingly very durable easy to adjust to your fitting.
5,I love this! The pattern is casual which I like because it matches most of my clothes and outfits. It is easy to install onto the watch and it comes with tools to install and remove the old band. it was easy to adjust as the tool allows to remove the links for proper fitting. I had to remove 4 links for it to fit properly and it still looks and feels great. No complaints yet!
5,This item has gotten me soooo many compliments! It’s lightweight but durable. I work at a desk and the band doesn’t have a scratch on it where my wrist may rub up against the desk. Adding links to the watch were sooo easy. And when asking question via email to the seller they responded in a quick and courteous manner! I’ve order one for my aunt and I will be purchasing more colors in the future. I love having watch bands that are unique and this is definitely the one!
5,This is a great band it came quickly and is very pretty. It’s lightweight and easy to remove or add links.I felt I needed an extra link so I contacted the company as I saw in another review they will send you 1-4 for free they ended up sending a second band I was allowed to keep free of charge because they didn’t have any in the right color as spares. Very impressed with their customer service!
5,I did not like the heavy silicone band on my new iWatch.  I ordered this one because it was described as "light" in weight.  It really is much lighter and lets air on my wrist (between the links of the band).  The silicone band was giving me a rash because it fits so air tight.  I will go back online to look at other colors.  I had a bit of trouble taking off a link but once I got the hang of it I was able to size this band.  Great product reasonable priced!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just received it & I already love it!! I had to remove two of the links for it to fit my wrist. I have very small wrists but it was so easy!! They provide the tool to do it. Very happy with my purchase & it matched my rose gold perfectly!!
5,I like that it’s lightweight and multicolored so It can go with a lot of outfits.
5,It was a very nice watchband. Great quality. Good price. Made a very nice gift. Would buy again.
2,I have had this watch band for a few months and today it broke. :(
5,Love these bands. Absolutely gorgeous. I ordered the brownish one. I was so happy with it I just got the purple. They are very comfortable!  When I went to bed last night I forgot I had it one it’s so comfortable. I highly recommend these. I think they look very stylish. You could wear it to a professional job or everyday.I did notice the ones that are more feminine are a link smaller. I had to take a link out of the brown. I’m a 53 year old female. It was super easy to do.
5,Easy quick and looks great
5,I purchased this because I don’t like the look of the sport bands that have the “spy kid” look.  Needed something to dress up the watch to wear in a professional environment without spending $$$. Received this today so can’t comment on the durability however it is very easy to remove links just follow the directions and tool provided. I removed 3 links and it took me a total of 5 min.  Band looks really nice and is comfortable. My new favorite.
5,I love that it comes in so many colors (I already have another one in my cart!). I work in healthcare and so I take my watch off frequently to wash my hands. I can put this back on without having to stop and hold my wrist still to get it in place. My only complaint would be the tool that it came with (to remove a link) is broken. So it’s a little too big. But I figured I would just wait for my next band to get the tool.
5,Very cute band! Surprisingly comfortable I like to sleep with my watch on so I was impressed that it's just as comfortable as the silicone band. Love the colors and the design. The rose gold is shinier than the watch itself but to me it just looks like a fun detail.I didn't need to remove any links so I can't comment on the process of that.
5,This watch band is so beautiful! It’s feminine and goes with everything 💖 it was very easy to remove the extra links to get a better fit just use the tools and read the instructions that it comes with. I’ve gotten many compliments! Highly recommend 🥳
4,This watch was super nice when I first purchased. It fit perfect and was easy to put on and remove . I liked the clasp mechanism. The only down fall was that it slowly changed colors . I went from an almost white band to an off cream  light brown . By the time I took the band off it was not as purchased.
5,Looks dressier and nicer than the silicone bands. Goes well with rose gold watch.
5,This watch band is beautiful with my rose gold Apple Watch. The links were actually really easy to remove. I have tiny wrists so I was pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly after removing some links. It stays in place and doesn’t come undone even after shaking it around. My only issue is that the ends of the band where it attaches to the watch stick out despite picking the correct size of 42mm for my series 5. It’s not a huge problem for me hence the reason I didn’t take off a star. I might try a size down to see if it doesn’t stick out. If it doesn’t I will update my review.
3,This is my favorite watch band but it gives me a rash in the exact same spot every time I wear it. Because of this I can't wear it very often or for very long. :(
5,I have worn it a few days and it is comfortable and looks cute.
5,The band easily attaches to the Apple Watch.  Looks very nice.  Very easy to put on and remove.  The product was packaged very well and included the tool and directions for removing the links in the band if you need to adjust the length.  Would definitely order from this company again.
3,So I have a similar watch from target same concept except the tools that I got sent with this don’t work to remove links I ended up having to use my other tool for my other watch I guess I was hoping for $25 is was Guna be heavier this feels very very lightweight and flimsy I’ll wear it tonight bro my spare just in case the clasp/buckle area feels even cheaper I was excited about the color because all of my gemstone jewelry are blues and would’ve matched but it’s very light blue the packaging it came in was non existent $25 should’ve came in a box my opinion good thing wasn’t a gift well it was to myself for my birthday I duno how I feel about it links once I got right took were easy to take out like any normal watch but other than that I’m not too sure guess for price was expecting more quality overall cuz it’s the going price for these average 20-30$ but this just isn’t there
2,The picture is misleading. It looked like it was white. It’s not. It’s cream and looks like cheap plastic. Very disappointed.  That being said it attached and closed just fine.
5,Exactly as described. Super light weight and comfortable.
5,This Apple Watch band is really pretty. Easy to adjust and wear. I love it!
4,UPDATED REVIEW (3/20:/20):The seller reached out regarding my review and stated they would work diligently on improving said watch band. They offered a new band and a full refund.Their promptness to my review and willingness to go above and beyond- worry working with them in the future.—-The look of this band is great flatters nearly every outfit. It’s light weight as well. Biggest issue removing the band from the watch face- it feels like I’ll break the band every time (regardless if the band is open or closed). Otherwise- a great watch band.
5,I have gotten so many compliments on this watch band. It was a big too big but the instructions and tools provided to remove a link were so easy. This is very durable great quality and it looks great!
5,I was looking for a band that was attractive yet functional. Pretty enough to wear all the time and not have to switch bands before going to gym.  I didn’t want it to move around during vigorous workouts nor did I want something that would absorb sweat and get gross over time. I got the ‘flower pink‘ and it’s a gorgeous white/pink quartz color that looks great. Links were easy to remove. Easier on and off then any other band I’ve tried.I like it so much I think I’m going to get a second.
5,This was a great purchase for my Apple Watch! The silicone bands just don’t cut it when hot weather arrives! Got the pearl white and get many compliments.The band was easy to adjust. I did this one by myself (didn’t need hubby’s help) and it couldn’t have been easier.The clasp is secure and I am not worried about losing my watch.The band stays very clean and sits nice on my wrist with no irritation.
5,I had seen this exact band somewhere else for $50 & that was to much for me to consider. This one is good quality durable & looks classy:)
5,Got an instagram ad for something like this that was $50+ Once i clicked the ad. This is a great dupe and comfortable/good quality for price.
5,I waited to review this for a few weeks.  I loved this band at first.  In the last 2 weeks it has broken sending my watch on the floor both times.  Luckily I have a case on it so it wasn’t damaged.  My return window has closed so I guess it’s mine.  I just wanted to share to share my experience with this watch band. Update 7/72020 Just wanted to update this review.  The seller contacted me asking what they could do to make it right.  They’re replacing the band for me.  This company has great customer service
5,I purchased this band a couple of months ago and I love it. I looks just as the picture and it comes with a kit that helps you adjust the strap. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice accessory. 👌🏻
5,I have a small wrist so I like that the size is adjustable. Links are easy to remove. Can’t speak to durability as I just received it. But so far I really like it!
5,I purchased this band (bought for my new 40mm Apple SE watch) in mid-Feb. 2021. The description is white but it has a lovely pale lavender tint to it.  It is plenty long (for a large-boned senior woman) and easy to remove the extra links. I have thoroughly enjoyed wearing it; it is quite comfortable and complimentary to all styles of clothing. I interchange it with a couple other bands but it seems to be durable. I would highly recommend.
5,Easy to remove matches rose gold Apple WatchPerfectly
4,The watchband fit me very well. Adjusting the size of the watch was simple and they give you tools  to adjust the size of the wristband. The material the watchband is plastic it seems fragile but actually does the job. Ive been wearing it for two weeks now and I havent had any issues so far.
4,Very simple to adjust to your size!!
5,I really like this and very pleased with the quality and ease of getting it to fit my wrist.
5,Easy to remove links. Seems durable. I do a lot of Canyoneering and climbing /rappelling and knock it on rocks frequently. It has held up and still looks great!
5,I wanted to be able to wear my apple watch with my gold jewelry and work outfits but it looks so athletic and didn't really match so I got this band and it is perfect!
5,This a flat color with no shine or luminous color like the pale pink I bought before. I was highly dissatisfied.
5,Absolutely LOVE this watch band! I was concerned when I first opened it that it would not fit my wrist as my wrist are larger but it does…with room to spare! So cute and comfortable! Best one I’ve purchased yet and I have purchased A LOT of bands over the years
4,This watch band is great and very beautiful. It would have been nice though to have different size links so that it could be adjusted just right.  If I leave all the links in it’s a bit too big if I take one out it’s just the tiniest bit too small.
5,I ordered this in the Flower Pink  which is a whitish & very light pinkish combination (somewhat marbled).  I really like the color and goes very nicely with the Series 3 gold watch.  Additionally I have a very small wrist - 5 inches around - and I was able to adjust this watch by removing pins to fit my wrist.  I will probably order this in multiple colors as the quality of this watch is very good!
5,the blush pink looks good with my pink watch
5,I really like this watch band! It looks exactly as pictured. It was easy to adjust the size to fit my wrist and I’ve worn it every day for the last few months with no issues. Well worth it!
5,I was on the fence about purchasing this band. But I ran into 2 ladies at a local market that both had one. I asked how they liked them and 20 minutes later……I purchased the same day received it the next. Easy to take out links. I really love it. There’s no pinching on my wrist. I’m ordering another in a different color. Great value for the price.
5,I love this watch band. It takes a bit of time to remove the links to get it to the correct size but the band is so cute and comfortable. Highly recommend!
5,This is a beautiful watch band with translucent colors that remind me of being under water. The band itself is very good quality with nice heavy smooth links. Love it.
5,Cutecolorful and lightweight can’t tell you have it on its comfortable
5,When I bought my watch I originally had the red product sports band from apple. It was very uncomfortable. My daughter told me about these bands from this seller. Anyway I received the band it was easy to put on and it is so comfortable to wear. I would like it to be a little bigger. I contacted the seller for some extra links they said they didn’t have the individual links so they would send me a whole other watch band to use as spare parts! Seriously! How sweet is that! That’s customer service. This seller has got me as a customer for life!
5,I have worn this everyday since I bought it! Love it as it looks more professional and I still use it when I work out.
5,I have had several watch bands but every time they are too big.  Yes they come with a kit to adjust the size but have never been able to get the kit to work.  When I saw this band I really liked the look of it.  It looked even better when I received it...AND.. it was a perfect fit no adjusting required.  This band is great well worth the cost.  It far surpassed my expectations.  I extremely pleased with it.  Looks so good!
3,It’s decent. It’s lightweight and and plastic but not obviously so on your wrist. For the money spent it’s not horrible. I’ve gotten compliments.
5,I love this band. It took me about 3 minutes to remove the pieces I needed and was very easy to do myself. The colors are vibrant and work so well with my rose gold watch face. I love how it looks more “dresses up” than my other rubber sport bands and the clasp seems secure and tight.I will probably buy another color in the future!
5,Love it. Had it for over a year and still looks new.
5,It is very pretty and durable
5,I have gotten so many compliments wearing this band! It is very stylish and the price is perfect.
5,Great band great customer service. I needed an extra link and so I reached out to the company (after seeing other people’s reviews on the same issue) and they promptly got back to me informed me they were all out of spare links but would be happy to send a whole extra watch band (in the color I ordered) so I could take out what I needed and have extra on hand incase I needed to replace more in the future. Got the extra band in the normal two day shipping.  The band itself is so nice lightweight and looks like it should cost double the price. Very well made. Over all experience 10/10
4,Really like This product
2,Super cute but it looks more white than pink and that’s the part I didn’t care for but I kept it anyway
5,Love the tortoise watch band! It’s easy to add/remove links and is very durable
5,Is it great just as advertisedEasy to pullout the extra squaresIt came exactly as the picture.The only thing that I see is that when put together to me it kind of looks like a “toy” watch. That is just seems to me in my personal opinion.But other than that everything is great!Compared to the original plastic or silicone version it is much much lighter!Enjoy!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to resize. Easy to reassemble. Comes with tool. Comfortable. Looks more expensive than it feels. Wish it were heavier still works really well with my watch. I got the rose gold tortoise pattern for my black watch. Looks great. (Rose gold is gold - not rose gold).
4,I love the color and the feel of the band! I will buy other colors to change it up here and there. Definitely recommend***UPDATE*** I have had the band for about 8months and wore it everyday for about 6months one of the screws fell out that holds the clip to the main part the screw is tiny and I could not find it and can no longer use the band. So I took away a rating star.
5,It fit right out of the box. Beautiful and very lightweight.  Even nicer than it looked online
5,Works as advertised. I had to remove 3 links to fit I do have a small-ish wrist. That was easy to do and put together.I have a rose gold watch and the band has gold hardware. It looks fine together as pictured.
4,
5,Love how the hardware matches the rose gold watch. Easy to set up and looks great.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Looks great but not sure how durable it is. The straps don’t seem to always lock in place and might slide out. Looks cute though and the rose gold hardware matches my watch.
4,Love the look! Just got it so we’ll see how it wears.Easy to take links out.
5,I needed to make the watch band smaller but was completely unable to remove any of the links.  I emailed the seller and within a few short hours I had a reply and the offer to send a new band....It arrived the following week and viola! that one worked perfectly and I was able to remove 4 links and wear the band.  So 5 stars for customer service response challenge resolution and a great wearable product.  I'm a happy customer~~ thank you!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This watch band is perfect! I wear it every day and it has been holding up well. Easily adjustable by removing a link and easy to take on and off. I get compliments all the time!
5,I actually loved this band more than I thought I would. It does not look cheap at all and it goes with much of my wardrobe. I did have to remove 4 links it came with everything you need to remove them. Just remember if you remove one link on one side remove one link from the other side so your band is even and does not flop around on your wrist. Seems Durable as well.
5,Love it matches anything
4,Could be the size of my wrist but it’s a little bit “just too big” or “just too small” if I take a link out. I initially wanted to return it but figured I’d try it on first. Now I really like it. And it’s much more comfortable than the rubber band the watch came with. The rose gold design is so pretty and makes the watch look grown up and fashionable.
5,It was so simple to remove a link to make it fit for my narrow wrist. It really set the watch off. Everyone who saw it  stated they wished they had one. It’s perfect for dressing up or dressing casual. My 9 yr old actually had asked when I plan to pass my watch and “the gorgeous” band to her.
5,I love this band! Adds a touch of elegance to an ordinary Apple Watch band. The links were very easy to remove so sizing it to fit my wrist was a breeze. I am sure I will get other colors. Would definitely recommend.
5,I loved the look and design of this watch band but it already broke and can’t be repaired!
4,I purchased the black/white/gray band and they come with more room and a longer main piece but this one is thinner on its main so I had to deal with it extra tight or extra loose.
5,One of the best bands I’ve bought highly recommended…….I’m actually getting one for a friend
5,Highly recommend. I was purchasing the metal/magnetized watch bands almost monthly because they would come apart so easily. The last 3 I purchased would get caught on my clothes and fade from minimal use.I decided to try this clasp watch band and so glad I did. It's lightweight but durable. Not cheap-y looking. And I've gotten many compliments on the design. I felt the price was reasonable also. I've had it for months and no issues. Would buy again.
5,Love this band. Really steps up the Apple Watch and makes it look more classy than sporty!
5,Great quality on item price was very reasonable.
5,I love how light weight it is. It was easy to adjust and it’s the perfect for my style.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to remove and very comfortable (light weight). I have small wrists and I’ve purchased watch bands like this one previously and found when they were adjusted they would fall apart. The pins would never stay in the links once they were removed and would fall apart while wearing it. This one was easy to adjust and I’ve had no problems with it falling apart thankfully. Definitely recommend this product!
5,I get so many compliments on this band. It comes with the tools to remove links if necessary. Definitely recommend!
5,Easy to install on your watch . No problems of it coming off - really snug .I get a ton of compliments !
5,Love it!  So pretty!  I had to remove 3 links and it was very easy.  Totally recommend this watch band. (This is on a series 5 apple watch 44 mm.)*looks upside down but it isnt - i wear the watch on my right wrist.*
5,I love this watch band it’s attractive easy to attach and doesn’t catch the sleeve like some detachable watch bands do.
5,The band fits comfortably on any your wrist.
5,Attractive.  I'm pleased with my purchase.
5,What a great way to show off summer colors with this stunning band.  Not heavy on the wrist and easy closure.  I had to remove two links as I have a small wrist but the enclosed tool and directions made it very easy even for these arthritic fingers of mine.
5,Love. I just got my first Apple Watch today. Had ordered this band the same day I ordered a watch. Super happy with it. Removing a section was fairly easy using the tool. It matches perfectly with my series 5 aluminum gold which is actually rose gold. Seems comfortable enough. Can’t speak to durability until I have it for a while but seems like it would stand up OK. Can’t speak to durability until I have it for a while but seems like it would stand up OK.I would recommend this band easily.
5,Do not pass by this absolutely Beautiful comfortable Classy looking very durable. I’m so happy with this watch band best I have and I have a lot! The Nougat will go with everything it will be a long time before I change this band.
5,Looks great easy to take links out and put back together. Good quality wear it everyday- gym work ect.
5,I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I'm not sure how long it'll last but it's really simple to fit on wrist and it's comfortable. Love the price and look
5,This is a great band for Apple Watch. It’s comfortable and the colors great. I thought I would switch bands during everyday and working out but it works great during workouts too.
5,Love the pink and green color of the band Dailey easy to resize and so far very durable. Get so many compliments on it and I like It more than the apple sports band I originally had.
3,First the band is very pretty lightweight and easy to assemble. It is on the cheaper side quality-wise however it looks super chic. Unfortunately after a week of wearing it I have broken out in a terrible rash. I was unsure if it was from the band even though that was the only thing different in my day to say so I tried wearing it on my other wrist to see and I am now breaking out on that wrist as well. I have an appointment with my doctor to test what it is that I am reacting to and get something to treat it but until then I have this very itchy very painful rash that has caused swelling and a large hard bump underneath my skin. Extremely disappointed.
5,I loveeeeeee this!!!! I bought a watch wrist band from somewhere else that I really just did not like. So I started looking for a new one and I came across this. This is exactly what I hoped it would be like. It’s sturdy and it fit perfectly. I will order more from this vendor in the future.
5,I saw a similar one on Instagram for 4x the price! The links were easy to remove and it’s very comfortable. Happy with my purchase!
5,I honestly love this watch band! The colors are perfect the fit is perfect and it's durable!  It was a bit big for me when it arrived but fortunately they included the tool and instructions on how to remove links (they also included extra links in case you need to make it bigger)!  It's as beautiful in person as the photos on the listing. It's my favorite band for my apple watch!
5,This is very pretty sturdy and nice looking. It’s easy to adjust and the tools are provided to remove links if needed. I removed 1 link and it’s a little big but removing 2 links made it a little tight. Being in between link sizes is mildly annoying but not surprising since I usually am right between link sizes on most watches. Anyway I love the band!
5,Very classy. The band works with many outfits. Comfortable. This watch band had by far the easiest to follow directions and best tool to remove links in order to fit me. My wrist is small so it takes a bit to adjust. I would order this product again.
4,Adorable get lots of compliments
5,It’s unique and comfortable.
5,I was tired of wearing my “athletic band” all the time whether I was dressed up or athletic leisure attire.  This band is so easy to change out on my Apple Watch and I get so many compliments! It’s neutral so it goes with just about anything I’m wearing.  Great purchase and really good price point.
5,I am so pleased! I was worried about the band not fitting since my wrist are a little thicker than the usual. I emailed their support department to see if they could possibly send me a few extra links. Since the style is fairly new they offered to send me a whole extra band to get the links off of it to custom fit the band. Super grateful!
5,Haven't had it long enough to rate the "Durability" but it seems like it will hold up.I bought some metal bands that looked nice but were so heavy they made my wrist sore this one is light.
5,Very happy with my purchase! It's such a beautiful color and looks expensive.
5,The band is not hard to remove as long as you push both ends part way.  If you try to take one side off completely before the other you can damage the band.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have lost COUNT of the times people have inquired about this band!! It literally goes with any and EVERYTHING!! Easy to adjust the band size if too large. One of my summer faves.
5,It looks almost like abalone or some expensive material works well with all clothing styles and it is so durable.  Plus it comes with the perfect tool to adjust the band size if you want it to fit tighter.  I want one in every color!
5,Loving this band. I had to remove 3 links but it came with colorful easy to follow instructions and only took me a few minutes. Band is lightweight and coordinates with my hard-to-match “gold” series 5 (looks pinkish) watch. My fav thing about this band thou is how utterly easy it is to put on and take off single handedly. No more “honey can you help me with my overly complicated bracelet watch??” Two thumbs up from me!!
5,Links are fairly easy to remove or add for a perfect fit. Great price for a quality band.
4,Not the B sturdiest of them all but so cute and wearable. Goes with everything laid back sexy or business. Worth the great price.
3,I was so excited to get this purchase. However the material is a little lighter than I thought it would be. Also I’m a little disappointed because the band runs smaller and it’s not as flexible once it’s on my wrist. If it was longer for all size wrists and I feel like mine are very standard I would’ve been pleased.
5,Beautiful and comfortable. Feels like a fancy watch instead of the rubber band that comes with Apple Watch. Really pretty and you don’t feel like you are wearing a fitness tracker
5,Many in here writing about the difficulty of taking links out.  It’s not hard. Really.  Band is lightweight and looks exactly like the photos.  I’ve been wearing it for about a week now and I love how I don’t even notice I’m wearing a watch compared to my other band.
5,I didn’t expect to like this but I really do!! Much more comfortable than I anticipated. And it’s super easy to adjust the fit! And super cute. After wearing it for extended periods of time it will sometimes leave indents in my skin and pinch me but so has every other Apple Watch band I’ve had!
5,I get a lot of compliments on this band.  It’s easy to remove and very durable.  Additionally I have cleaned it repeatedly with alcohol with no ill effects.  Still looks lovely!
5,Not the easiest to put on or take off but is durable enough to do so. It’s held up very well and the band is classy! It goes with most of my wardrobe and feels more dressed up than the rubber band the Apple Watch comes with. Love this! It’s my new fave.  Just received my 2nd band and I love it just as much!
5,This band is soooo perfect!! I love it so much I’m going to order a second JUST to have in case lolThe package was squished and had some weird stains on it so I was a bit worried to open it. But it came with a tool and the instructions to remove links. Thank good it did because I had to remove 3.FYI the face cover I have on my watch did not come with the band that was ordered separately...
4,Good
5,You may need a watch kit to remove links but I love this band
5,I wanted a band that looked more like a nice watch. I love this color and ease of removing links
5,This is my everyday watch band! I was a little hesitant to buy because I'm so picky when it comes to turtle shell styled anything...but this was perfect. I haven't had any issues yet :)
5,I currently wear one of these resin iwatch bands and I like them so well I ordered another color! They are comfortable and in the summer I don’t experience wrist sweat like the rubber type watch bands. Easy to take off quickly to wash your hands. They come with the tools to remove links for smaller wrists! I recommend these bands and just bring on more color options!!
4,I got this today and I like how simple and modern it is. I hope the steel part don’t get tarnished but that I will have to see. So far from first impression I like it !
5,Easy to size as well! It’s great!
5,I’m constantly getting compliments! I’m not super smart when it comes to taking stuff apart to resizebut this one is easy to do. Will purchase other colors
5,This watch band is amazing for the fall season extremely comfortable and it came in the cutest packaging. The item came with two extra pins and the tool to remove links. This is actually my second purchase of the same item because my mom stole the first one I ordered because she loved the look! Perfect to dress up for a fall look and upgrade the look of your Apple Watch if you will.
5,So cute! It was a little too big so I had to remove 2 links but it was relatively easy to figure out & do.I love it so much & to get a bit TMI but I’m Hispanic and have hairy arms was honestly a bit concerned these would snag on my arm hair but so far nothing! I love the coloring & feel of it. Currently looking at getting another in another color.
5,I love it. Exactly what I wanted. Comes with the tools to remove/add links. Very easy to do. Easy to attach. I have not had any issues with it and I wear it daily
5,Best watch band I’ve ever purchased. Couldn’t be happier.
5,So glad I found this one- I almost paid twice as much plus shipping on another site but they are clearly all the same exact bands coming out of China so I am glad to have found it cheaper. Lightweight doesn’t look 100% as beautiful as the stock photo but it’s at 90% so I’ll take it.
5,It was easy to adjust by removing some links.  The watch fits well looks stylish and is overall comfortable.
3,Love the look easy to remove links lightweight BUT the spring pin that keeps the watch to the watch face keeps coming out therefore watch falls off. I have ordered additional spring pins in hopes that this will resolve my problem.
4,This might sound weird but I wish this was heavier. Other than that it’s beautiful.
4,This is a really pretty band for your Apple Watch however the quality is really cheap and feels cheap. HOWEVER it has lasted way longer than I had expected so maybe it will be fine it just have the feel of a higher quality band/very lightweight and has fake metals.
5,Absolutely beautiful! Easy to remove links for the perfect fit. Easy to follow instructions. Lightweight. Purchased the pink flower color in hopes that it did not truly have a flower pattern to my delight that is exactly what I received. Almost a pearl bone pink color. I am so very happy with this purchase. I want every color! Highly recommended.
5,Nice to have a band that can make the watch look more like jewelry.  It was very easy to alter the size to make it smaller with the tool that came with it.
4,Looks great! Very light as well.
5,Such a cute watch band!!! I was sad when I ordered the 42/44 band and it was a bit snug so I reached out to the company for a couple of extra links and they sent a whole second band for me to use to make sure I had what I needed and was happy with my watch band. While the band is great the customer service was better!
5,Good product
3,This band is pretty and the pins held up well. My only complaint is the ends that connect to the watch face are metal. I used the band for a couple of months and always took it off before getting in water. Even still when I went to swap it for a different band it was very difficult to remove as it had oxidized and was stuck to my watch.
2,This item isn’t what I expected.  I don’t like it.
5,This is a great watch band at half the price of other sites I was looking at. I received many compliments wearing it. I can’t speak about durability yet since I just got it a few days ago but as of now I would recommend! Product received was exactly as shown.
5,Watch band was exactly what my wife wanted.  However it needed one more link.  I contacted the company and they replied within an hour or so that they did not have extra links but would just send another band to pull the extra link from.  Was delivered in a couple of days.  Now my wife is happy as it now fits perfect for her.  Highly recommended.
5,Beautiful and lite weight.
5,It’s super cute! I’ve gotten many compliments! I have long nails though so my roommate had to use the little tool to make it tighter but other than that I love it :)
3,I have tried several different bands but I’ve never found one that looks classy. Not only does it look classy but it seems sturdy. I did have to remove a couple of the links and they were a little tough to get out but I do you that is a good thing as if they were loose the watch wouldn’t hold together. I may have to get some in other colors… I like it that much!***Edit… The night I got it as I was walking in the door it fell off my wrist. The pin had fallen out and it was already broken. I do however love it and I’m going to try a replacement of the same item. Hopefully the next one is better.
5,This is a beautiful watchband. I contacted the company to request two extra links but unfortunately they did not have any in their warehouse. They were more than happy to send me another watchband so that I could have extra links. Absolutely wonderful.
5,I bought this color to go with my Apple Watch 5...its rose gold....talk about cute! I like for my watches to hang a little bit even though I have a small wrist...The color looks really good with my watch! I’m purchasing another one soon. I like to change up my band every six months or so...
1,Horrific rash appeared after wearing just 2 days. I do not have sensitive skin. Wrist is red itchy and bumps - def from the band - no rash where it clasped or where watch face was. Now on steroidal cream.
5,5 stars for durability out of the package however the band material is very lightweight. I don’t anticipate any malfunctions or break but if you’re looking for heavy or dense resin this is not that. The colors are finish are beautiful as pictured. I’m very happy with the product just noting for others considering this band. I prefer the lightweight resin for summer bc it’s a grounded look but this material won’t feel heavy on a hot summer day outing.
5,I absolutely love this watch band! And I have had so many compliments on it already. I love it so much that I have already ordered another one in a different color!
4,I chose the ivory white because I wanted a yellow gold connector. The entire band looked very yellow on screen but I wanted to see what it looked like in person and it’s a very neutral pretty caramel color.
5,Love it! So pretty! My friend bought the same one after seeing mine. It was super easy to size the band. I returned another color that I had ordered but this light pink is great with my rose gold watch.
5,This band exceeded my expectations. The instructions to remove the extra links was very easy to follow. I had to remove four links; it was a breeze. The blue band looks amazing with my blue watch. I am going to order this band in other colors.
4,Looks great like natural stones easy to adjust size comfortable appears to be high quality.  Love it and the fact that the size adjustment tool was included.  Also includes instructions which is rare these days.
5,So comfortable and I always get compliments on it! It comes with a kit to adjust the size so you know it’ll fit. I have had it for a few months now and I love it. Totally worth the purchase!
5,I have had many compliments on this band. Love it!
5,Love it.. and easy to adjust (comes with small tool to adjust straps) looking to purchase another color
5,This band is the “TRUTH”! I love it. It was easy to switch. I had to take out one link which was amazingly surprising. I have large wrist and usually the bands are too short. The coloring is beautiful. I will be buying other colors. I wish they had it in yellow.
5,This watch band is perfect. It was a bit long but removing some of the length was very easy and all tools were included. It is comfortable to wear. The colors are SO cute. This is the 4 band I’ve purchased in 2 months and by far the best. I just bought one for my mom because I knew she would love it as much as I do.
5,I received this item with my Amazon Prime in two days.  The quality looks good and it is lightweight it was easy to remove links for a better fit. I love the tortoise look.  I would recommend buying this product.
5,The band (tortoise with rose gold) is absolutely beautiful! It is lightweight and very comfortable. The clasp is secure and easy to open and close and the band is quite durable. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
5,I read the reviews and I decided to buy and I’m so glad that I did! It’s light weight and comfortable. It definitely is cute but doesn’t look cheap at all. Very nice! I was looking for something that wasn’t too blingy or too athletic looking to go with my bracelets!
3,The band had a yellow tint to it compared to the bright white color in the online image. Also the tool sent to adjust the links was so tiny that it was difficult to put the pins back in.
4,Love the band but it scratched the edges of my watch which I am not happy about upon installation. Cute band but you have to be super careful when installing or removing it.
5,Easy to use and adjust links . Beautiful watchband
5,Watch was too small for me. Contacted company they responded very quickly and resolved the issue.  Great customer service and great product. I would highly recommend!!
4,Just as described! My second one in a different color. Pleased with durability and comfort.
1,One side of the magnetic connector piece that slides into my watch was made too wide so it won’t fit. Tried to replace it with another connector I have but couldn’t get pin out to take it off. The other magnetic connector on the band does slide into my watch as it should on either side. I can visibly see the one side is too thick. So it’s useless since k can’t even get the darn pin out of it to put another watch attachment on. My other watch attachment was also held in by a pin- but simple to press pin inwards and take connector off. Too bad I can’t take the defective one off. Have no idea if it’s comfortable. It is useless. Band defective. It will not fit into either end of my watch while the other side does fit in both sides
4,It was too big so I had to remove 3 links and it fit perfect for my small wrist. The only problem is it was difficult for me to remove the links ended up scratching myself with the tool provided but after about 20 minutes I was able to figure it out. Once on it looks really nice even though it is plastic it doesn’t look cheap.
5,I was so pleased and happy when I opened the package. The watch band is beautiful. I had to take out three links because my wrists are tiny but they included excellent directions and a tool to remove the pin.
1,This watch gave me a horrible allergic reaction when I wore it to work out. Swelling redness and blisters. Had to use hydrocortisone ice and advil to resolve the rash. I do not have sensitive skin and never have issues with anything like this.
5,I got the black and white marble watch band. This band is very comfortable easy to take on and off and stylish. I love it with with black Apple Watch!It is very easy to adjust the band by adding/removing links. The material feels a little light (like plastic) but it is the best band I could find.
5,I love the color of the band!
4,I like the look of this band. The rose gold matches the rose gold on my Apple Watch. The only problem I have is that I have a larger sized wrist and I asked the company to send me additional links about a month ago. I sent them my proof of purchase and have not received the additional links so the band is just sitting on my dresser. I hope someday I will get to wear it!
4,This is a very nice watch band. The pins are just tough enough to remove that I don't worry about them slipping out. The quality is very good but the coloring is noticeably darker than expected. I bought this to dress up my Gen 4 Watch for a job interview and I have to say it looks beautiful!
4,I really like this band. It’s obviously well made. The only comment I would make is that the picture on Amazon shows the colors lighter with more pastels which I would have preferred. But all in all I’m satisfied.
4,The pattern is darker than the photo but it was easy to remove the pieces to get it to my size and it fits perfectly. All in all a good purchase.
3,So my star rating is because this is a really nice band. I love it but as you can see this is not for everyday use or maybe just not with me. I love the fit easy on easy off very fashionable would order again BUT not a color closure just a basic silver perhaps as I just got this and it is showing signs of wear already. I like sturdy and durable items this band is good for some show but would not let it be your daily go to.
5,Absolutely love this watch band! Love the color and fit!
5,I have a very tiny wrist and am very pleased this can be taken down to fit (5.5”). This is my third color and this one is so beautiful on my rose color watch. I get so many compliments when I wear these bands. I was able to get the pins out myself. Highly recommend
5,Good neutral color.  Makes it a little dressier than plastic band.
5,I received this band in October 2018.  Today March 242020 I am still wearing it daily.  I get so many compliments and the band really looks expensive.  (Mother of pearl or crushed shells in ceramic. )  It was also easy to adjust by myself once I got the hang of it.  Usually I would have a jewelry store do it but after figuring it out my self I’m not spending money again on sizing watches unless it’s my expensive watch.
5,Love it.  Easy to use. I really love how it looks with all type of styles from business to sports. Enamorada de la correa. Todo el mundo me pregunta donde la compré  😉
5,This watch band was so much more than I expected. The design is beautiful! I love how it’s not just a surface look design. You can actually see it through the links. The colors are so nice! The abstract design could appear to me as rose or smoke design. It fit my Apple Watch Series 5 40mm perfect! I will definitely wanting to get more watch bands.
5,I loved all my watch bands  I love the bling covers  but have to watch now because I lost two of them . They popped off and now I watch them a lot . Lol but all your products I have purchased have been excellent and delivered on time as stated.
5,My multicolored band goes with everything. I receive many compliments on it. I have shared the link so they can purchase one too. I love it!
5,Easy to size by removing the links size fits but it’s a bit loose when wearing so I have to slide it up my wrist. If I remove a like it’s too tight. Clasp is nice the inner fold of the clasp is kinda big big it sits at the bottom of my wrist and is pretty comfortable.  Gets a little sticky to the wrist of it gets wet and is not very breathable. Very stylish and colorful goes with everything! Overall great band highly recommended!
5,The watch band is great with my rose gold Apple Watch.  It gets noticed with lots of compliments.It was easy to remove extra links.  I recommend this band.
5,It’s very lightweight so it’s comfortable to wear all day…lightweight but durable.
5,Love it Love it Love it!! So many compliments on this band. Looks more expensive than it was. Compliments my Red Apple Watch to the hilt!! No disappointment at all looks feels and wears Great!!! Buy it today!!
5,I love this I watch band it’s easy to put on on and take off and I know my watch is secure on my wrist.  I also get a lot of complaints on it.
5,I really love this band. I wanted a unique band for my watch. I wanted the band to fit looser so I bought a second identical band and I added two links. If you are removing or adding links place something soft on your table (I used the amazon bubble wrap that it came in) so that when you push out the metal rod it does not get damaged.
3,Not at all happy with the wear on the links looks like they have tarnished under the plastic. However I have received a replacement which I was appreciative for and the seller has also reached out to me and definitely provided excellent customer service.
5,I love the look of this watch band it dresses up with watch and matches the rose gold perfectly. Easy to adjust it comes with all the tools. I have a small wrist and was able to take out the links needed to fit
5,Easy to remove or add a link. Super easy clasp and very light weight. Enjoying a different style.
5,This band is fashionable durable and perfect fit!
5,Easy to install/remove.  The tool that came with it is useful and easy to use to remove the links. I love it and will purchase again from this seller.  It looks stylish and takes my Apple Watch up a notch. I got the brown tortoise one.
5,This is such a pretty band!  It goes with my Series 5 gold aluminum watch perfectly. I previously had a link-type band made of metal- but it was way too heavy to be comfortable. This band is sturdy but incredibly light weight. The picture is of the band on my right wrist. I wear my watch on the left wrist which is slightly larger. I contacted the seller who was awesome- replied to my email quickly and is sending me four additional links at no charge!  I will definitely purchase more colors!
5,Super cute I picked the pink color with the rose color hardware the only down side was that it did not include a face case so if you look carefully at my pic I have my existing black and silver face but it still looks amazing!
5,LOVE this product. I have always been concerned that my Apple Watch band is too casual but now I can wear my watch with any outfit! Very easy to adjust the size great quality and matches everything I own.
5,Beautiful and easy to adjust with tool included.  I highly recommend it.  I've only had it a few days so I can't rate durability yet.  It is very comfortable i even wear it to bed to measure my sleep and heart rate.
5,Perfect for my Apple Watch I think I have 42-44 or something like that... holding up really well so far and I’ve already had it 2-3 months. Does ok when I perspire which was annoying about Apple Watch bands (I’ve owned 5+ apple brand bands- sport basic leather etc) I actually prefer this one and it’s cheaper price!
5,Cute simple just what I was looking for.
5,I love that it feels like I’m wearing a nice watch now and the compliments I get from how nice the band looks.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I absolutely love this watch band. You can remove the links to fit your arm and that’s even better. And it goes really well with the rose gold watch too!!!
5,Great product
5,I love this band. To set up is a hassle! The pins are very well put in there which is a good thing but boy I struggled to get the links off and make the size adjustments. Other than that the shipment took like 15 days instead of 2–3 like the order said it kept being delayed. I like the band but I didn’t like my order being delayed and no word fromSeller. If you can deal with those two cons then purchase it it’s beautiful.
5,Easy to adjust to your right size. Good quality material. Not easy to break or crack.
5,This band is awesome. The colors are beautiful it’s light weight and was very easy to remove the necessary links to a perfect fit. It’s easy to place and remove on the wrist.
4,I love the style and color. The only real issue I have with it is that the band is a little tight on my wrist.
4,I love this watch band! It’s so colorful! It is a little difficult to remove links to make the band fit but at least that means it won’t come apart very easily.
5,I’m a salt water fishing guide and this watch band is comfortable and durable!
3,The pins fall out at times cause the links to break apart.
5,Love this watch band! Very cute and light weight. Feels very comfortable on the wrist. The customer service with this company is also amazing. I messaged the seller because I had a question. They were very responsive and kind. Would absolutely order from them again.
5,I was looking for a more stylish/chic apple watch band but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it and this was the one! I purchased with some hesitancy because I wasn't sure of the durability and if it would look too plastic. This band is gorgeous and fits great (I have large wrists).
5,I received many compliments on my beautiful band
3,I wanted this to work. It’s lovely. But sizing is not good. Taking out two links is too tight taking one out is too loose.Also color of the trim is nowhere near the stainless steel gold of the Apple Watch. Pic above.
5,I received this watch band today. The part that clicks on to the watch face was on backwards I fixed that but the pin is now visible on the front part of the watch. The pin holding the clamp together was bent and fell out I was able to bend it back. But it is poor quality.Update: The company quickly responded and has sent out a new band that was correctly made and quickly received! Thank you!!!!
4,I actually really liked my band. I’m not sure that sizing is an option. Fits a little loose. Should of paid more attention to details when ordering but aside from that good band.
5,AMAZING QUALITY! This watch band is perfect! I have never bought a watch band that was not authentic apple but I had to because this was so cute! Came with instructions to remove the links (super easy) everything is secured and it looks so cute! Will definitely consider buying more in other colors! If you're on the fence just go for it! Fast shipping too!
5,Love the color! It looks just like the picture. The links were easy to remove and clear instructions come with the watch and the removal tool. I’m very petite and had to remove two links from each side so it would not slide off my wrist and it still looks great!
5,This watch band is great. Very comfortable very pretty and easy to add or remove links to achieve that perfect fit. I will definitely be getting more. Again I cannot stress the fit and comfort of this band.
5,First off love the look of this watch band! I had one minor trouble with one of the rods falling off and not being able to hook my watch together but they shipped me a brand no one no charge for the inconvenience!! They got back to me ASAP! Great customer service and will be buying more bands.
4,It’s just a little big on my wrist
4,The band is really pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it. It’s light weight and stylish. Only down side to it was that it was really hard to adjust strap to fit my wrist. I had to have my husband help me and it took us a long time.
4,This watch band was given to my Granddaughter for one of her Christmas present ts and she loves it that's a good thing.
5,I really like this band. It’s easy to adjust and more importantly it’s comfortable. I get complements all the time on it. It really suits my style and puts up with my clumsy so it’s a winner for me.
5,The band isn’t too wide. Looks very delicate.It looks very nice when you’re dressing up.Just know it’s a little bit tricking removing a notch to make it smaller. Otherwise it says in place and I wear it all day with no issues.
4,I love that it comes with tools to adjust the watch to your size and it’s easy to do. The watch it’s self looks great the only dislike I have is that the paint is already coming off from where you clip it it’s not horrible but enough to show that the paint is not the best quality
5,I LOVE this watch band. This is the second time ordering from this company. They have a ton of color options and they ship fast! It is a reasonable price and easy to take on and off of your apple watch. The only hard part is taking out links however they come with instructions and the tool.
5,I have gotten so many complements on this watch band. It was very easy to attach to my apple watch and removing links to fit my wrist size was very quick and easy.
5,Love the look
5,Looks great and I get a lot of compliments on this band!
5,Great watch band! Very light weight but durable and so easy to remove/replace links. The company is also very fast to respond if you have any issues and very friendly. I needed a couple extra links and they sent them at no cost to me. Amazing company and amazing customer service!
5,I’m a nurse and this band is cute and durable. Exactly as pictured in the description. I got compliments on it all the time. Can’t beat the price.
4,Vert hard to understand how to remove links since there were no instructions provided. I had to search YouTube for how to remove/adjust trifold watch links. However once I learned how to do it it became easier to do. Producy came as described.
5,What a great company. Great customer service. I ordered a couple of their bands that were too small and requested extra links and they very quickly sent some for no cost. And the bands are beautiful. I will be buying from them again
5,El color el estilo que le da al reloj es único bien femenino y con estilo
5,Great custom fit after using tools included. Love the style and very durable so far.
5,Easy to adjust size cute and durable for price!
5,Totally recommended!!! Love it! It goes with everything it looks super cute fancy and classy at the same time. The only hard work for me it was adjusting it.
4,I love the over look of the watch band.  The color is pretty.  But the clasp is more gold then “rose” gold.This is why I only gave it a 4 star.
4,Beautiful deep purple watch band. The rose gold in the band does not perfectly match my rose gold Apple Watch.  And the links were a pain to remove for sizing but they do provide be tool just be prepared to use some muscle. Overall I really like it! Just got it today.
5,Looks exactly as I’d hoped it would. Links were super easy to remove. Very comfortable and so far very durable. Looks great. Can’t complain!
4,It was a little hard to put on but still great for the price. Comes with tools to remove links for fit.
5,It is very comfortable... easy to fit for your wrist size comes with all the proper "tools" to adjust. Very pretty pale pink tortoise shell color. Rose gold clip matches the rose gold apple watch color. Very durable extremely pleased with this band... and I receive MANY compliments every time I have it on.
5,I loved it. I like to change bands on my watch and this looks great
4,I LOVE this watch band! I had to take out some links and yes they do give you a little tool for it but it was much easier with a thumb tack just FYI!
5,Extremely pleased with the quality of this I have ordered more!
5,The band is very comfortable and was very easy to make smaller for my wrist. Also is very pretty have had many compliments.
5,This watch band was the perfect addition to my (small) Apple Watch band collection. It can be worn with a dressy outfit or casual.  Love the versatility of it.
5,Beautiful color. It’s weightless easy to put on and take off. Also easy to remove/add links. I am very happy with this purchase (so far) I just got this in the mail. Will update if anything changes.
4,Watch band is nice unable to fit it to my wrist comfortably. But I wear it anyways a little tight
5,I ordered this band bracelet and it is so cute!  I just ordered one for my daughter.  Easy to remove links.
4,The colors are true
5,This Apple Watch band was extremely easy to add or remove links. I also love how it goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or dress it down.
5,The band is resin and looks very expensive.  Easy to get on and off easy to adjust.  Highly recommend.
5,This watch band is adorable however if it gets wet from rain sweet or just damp it bleeds pink! Other than that it’s great
5,Easy to remove links.  Looks and feels good on.  Can’t comment on durability yet as I just put it in today!
5,A good buy—good quality wears comfortable and I have received compliments on the look. I’m happy with my purchase and would buy again.
3,Love the band but it’s to short are there extra links to purchase to extend the band ?
5,I love this watch band. It’s really beautiful with my rose gold watch. I didn’t like the watch cover but didn’t need it because my watch was already rose gold. The watch protector looked very artificial.
5,Today is the first day I have worn the band so I can’t speak for long term quality. I love the colors. It is beautiful! If you order it with the rose gold clasp it has a shine not matte finish on the clasp. It matches my rose gold on my watch perfectly. The white is off white so it will be perfect for fall and winter. My husband took two links out and it was very easy for him to do this. So far an very pleased!
5,Pretty easy to put on and off durable and comfortable! I can wear it to work out or go out for dinner. Love this band!
5,This is such a cute watch band! It’s great quality and the links were really easy to remove. This looks like it was a lot more expensive than it actually was. Excellent quality.
5,I love this watch band!! I get lots of compliments!!
5,I absolutely LOVE this band!!! So much so I am planning on ordering another one as a back~up and a different design. I also get a lot of compliments when I wear it!! I had to have my husband make it smaller for me though bc I couldn't do it. They sent a tool and instructions so it was very easy for him to do.  I took two links out and it fits perfectly!!
5,I was just gifted an Apple Watch but was unable to wear it due to the silicone band falling off my small wrist. I absolutely loved the fact that I can adjust the size of this band.
5,I love this watch band. It’s easy to use and comfortable.
5,I love it so much I wanted a watch band that looked like the traditional watch bands but I’m not traditional so this is perfect! I get compliments all the time on how pretty it is.
5,Comfortable easy to size looks gorgeous.
5,I really like my new rose gold wrist band.  Even though they don't label the color as rose gold it looks good with my rose gold apple watch (check out my video of the watch).  The band is light weight and it looks rose gold pearlish.  Exactly what I expected and it looks like the picture.
5,The colors are wonderful. The fit is good and comfortable no sweaty wrists it brings smiles
5,This is perfect.  The original I-watch band was too tight.  This has a band you can adjust the size.  It’s pretty looking rather than just a rubber looking band.
5,Me encantó el color es precioso de un material resistente. Excelente calidad… volvería a comprar este producto!
2,Didn’t fit my watch to big  was a little disappointed because it was real pretty
2,Larger lady.  Very tight and uncomfortable
5,Worth it! Fits well easy to adjust looks great
5,I receive so many compliments on this watch band. I love that it goes with everything and is simple to take on and off. I would repurchase again!
5,It is very light weight. It seems to hold up well over all. I like that I have the white one and I have been any fading or discoloration happening which is really nice. I love it and use it everyday.
5,This watch band is so nice and looks very elegant on my Apple Watch.  I needed something a little more dressy to wear  to a  weekend of wedding festivities.  So glad I found this one!
5,I love this watch band.  It is so comfortable and easy to size to fit.  It goes with everything and it so light I barely know I’m wearing it.  A perfect fit.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a really nice band. It’s really like weight and easy to take links away if necessary. Only downfall is that I wish the clamp perfectly matched my rose gold watch but it’s not that far off. Would definitely recommend it!
5,Oh my gosh! This bracelet is so stunning!! I love it! Move over sport bands you’ve been replaced!! I want one in every color!! So easy to size too!!
5,
5,I love this band! I purchased this one to wear for work to dress up my watch. When I first put it on it took a few tries to get it closed because I’m not used to the closure but now that I’ve gotten the hang of it it’s my favorite band to wear.Will purchase again if/when this one wears out.
5,I really like this watch band. Easy to put on and off. I get a ton of compliments on the color. Super light weight and doesn’t feel cheap at all. I also have one in white.
5,This is really cute and stylish. I love that it looks expensive but it wasn’t! Really bumps up the look of the Apple Watch. It’s plastic so yeah it gets sweaty underneath. I did buy a cover bc I am clumsy and it still looks fine with the watch and.
5,I have received many compliments on this band. It is easy to take on and off and so far has held up well!
5,Great quality and look easy to add or remove links.
5,Love it! Beautiful watch band. Gotten lots of compliments already. Nice unique and also well made and sturdy. Definitely recommend it!
5,When I first ordered this watch band parts were missing. I sent it back and theY replaced it. Overall I love it and the service.
5,I love this lightweight band looks super trendy and dressy! Came with easy tools and directions to remove links to better fit your wrist.
5,I get compliments on this watch band all the time. People don’t believe me when I tell them how cheap it was! I’ve had it for 2-3 months now and have no complaints about the durability either.
5,I love it so very much and it’s good quality..
4,Looks very cute. However need to take off the whole band when charging the watch which is the only inconvenient thing I find.
5,This band is comfortable flexible  and durable.  Really love the looks and I get so many compliments.  Ended up ordering another color.
5,Love this! It is super cute and versatile. Took a few tries to get it on correctly but was worth the extra effort!
5,The band was nicer than expected. I got a lot of compliments. My daughter loved it so she bought one for herself.
5,Easy to adjust sir to fit wrist. Band was lighter than I thought it was going to be but very comfortable.  Does not pinch. Looks great with my rose gold watch.
2,They use both shiny and brushed metals so they don't match.  It was weird and confusing.  Why not stick with one metal finish?  Was disappointed as I loved the band itself.
4,Not the easiest to remove... but super cute!
5,Love this watch band for my Apple Watch.  I have had ceramic bands on previous watches and always felt the softness and comfort of a ceramic band.  This watch band delivers all of that with so many different options on colors.  Perfect fit too with the ability to adjust the band.
5,This band is exactly what I was looking for. The silicone and even cloth bands irritate my wrist and cause them to break out. I wanted something cute and trendy so I went with this hard plastic....keeping my fingers crossed. It's been a couple months and no rash plus it's beautiful and I get lots of compliments. It fits my style and wrist perfectly. Thanks
5,I had a little difficulty adjusting the size of the band. I called customer service and The problem was solved quickly and efficiently.  The band is beautiful and so easy to remove the watch from your wrist.
5,Love this look! I’ve received many compliments. I had to remove several links which is easy to do.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this band. The color the comfort and the fact you can loosen and tighten how much u want. It came with a tool where u can remove some of the clasps. Toooo easy took me less than a minute. Will buy the ocean blue soon.
5,Very lightweight. Easy to take on and off. Only issue I couldn’t remove the 2 links needed to fit me. And the tool to remove links is SUPER SUPER SHARP sliced my daughter finger open like a knife. So BE CAREFUL USING THE TOOL.
3,Didn’t like plastic feel on skin
5,I love this watch band. A great price but looks and feels higher quality. Removing the links to make it bigger/smaller can be a little tricky if you aren’t familiar with the process but overall easy! When I need more watch bands I’ll definitely get this one in other colors.
5,the band is very nice but it has no weight to it and  the color is off more of a gold than rose gold
5,Absolutely love this band! Removing a couple of links took a bit of manhandling but I managed to do it. It fits perfectly now and I absolutely love the look. I should also mention that it’s very comfortable. I may purchase a few more colors.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really like the color for an everyday band. You can tighten the band but I prefer a loose bracelet feel so it’s exactly the fit I wanted!No complaints in my first few weeks of wear.
5,I love this watch band. It’s for dressing up or every day use. My husband did have to take a few things out as it was too big but now it fits perfectly the price was very good as well.
5,LOVE! After removing some links to fit my small wrist instant love. So stylish and have gotten so many compliments on it! I’ve worn it for approximately 3 months now and there is no wear or tear on the gold accents. So far very happy with my stylish watch band. Also very easy to remove links!
2,UPDATE OCTOBER 9: my watch band broke on the part that you slide into the watch. The little rod came out. I tried putting it back together and it lasted another day or two but broke again (over the sink) and the rod went down the drain :( It was cute while it lasted.This is a beautiful band! It came with the little tool I needed to remove links. It was a little difficult to push the rods out but not too terrible. Some of the time it wouldn’t want to slide into the watch and I actually scratched my watch where the bands slide in (just minor). I probably didn’t have it lined up right so it’s probably not a design error.  My wrist must be an odd size because the band is either too tight or loose so I’m wearing it loose but I’m getting used to it. I love the colors and it seems well made! A little pricey in my opinion but maybe it will last a long time.
5,this is a great product for anyone who wants to be stylish yet have a lightweight band. Easy to remove and very unique. Originally purchased it to wear to a party. Now this has become my everyday band.
5,I get compliments on this band all the time. It was easy to put on the Apple Watch face and looks great. Very easy to take off and put on.
5,Beautiful! I love the color and comfort. Had to take out a couple links for it to fit but the instructions made it easy.
5,Great watch band! A little to big for my wrist but the links were easy to remove with the provided tool. $20 is a little more than I like to pay for a band so I hope it last a while.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This watch is great. The pieces were easy to remove and now it fits great and is comfortable. No signs of wear so far! Does not pull your arm hairs like some watches bands like this do. Will be buying more colors!
5,Very nice! Easy to remove links to fit your arm- just try not to loose the tools. If you’re looking for a band that goes well with everything but athletic attire but this.
5,Surprisingly excellent quality for the price!  Looks so classy and the customized fit is perfect.  I have sensitive skin (even with the original band) and this hasn’t bothered me at all.
5,When I first got the band there was a piece missing but with one quick email the company sent me a brand new one. I have been wearing it for a few weeks and so far it’s very sturdy and comfortable. This is by far my favorite band I have gotten for my watch. It’s very easy to take on and off.
4,Very pretty. Clasp is in odd place so watch doesn’t stay in middle of wrist
5,It's lightweight can't tell you have it own.  Apple brand made my wrist sweat.
5,Love the color and it is easy to take on and off. Fits great.
5,I just love this watch band. It’s stylish yet works for everyday. I get lots of compliments on it
5,This band is very pretty and looks beautiful. I’ve received several compliments and it is durable. It has no scratches and no issues when getting wet.
5,I love how vivid the colors are. The fit is great and the band is very light! I’ve received so many compliments. Definitely a great buy!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Super cute and comfortable. It’s a little big even with links taken out. One extra is too tight. Arrived quickly!  Customer service great as well.
5,My wrist is a little off for size- it's either a little big or a little small- but otherwise great!
1,Welp. In a lovey twist of irony I bought this watch band because it first seemed more durable than the silicon bands Apple gives you. False.I was walking into the grocery store late tonight for emergency dog nose balm (which wasn’t in stock adding to the irony) and my watch band just broke mid-stride smashing into the ground and breaking the watch face itself. Cool cool cool.I did like this band at first—it was cute and lightweight. But the fact that it failed in its core purpose and function and caused my my newly-purchased Apple Watch to break (after having replaced one already because I dropped and broke my first one—my fault I know and also adds to the irony)… I wouldn’t chance this product with your money. Splurge a little and buy something more reputable from Apple themselves or something similarly rated. ThanksWhat a joke. (Also unsolicited pro-tip: get AppleCare on your watch because they don’t replace the screen and make you just buy a new one basically.)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So far so good. I have a small wrist so i took off 3 links and it was super easy with the tool and instructions they give you
5,Beautiful lightweight and comfortable. I’m going to buy more of these. I have a hard time finding comfortable watch bands. I contacted the company to get a couple of extra links and they answered quickly and were extremely efficient.
5,I like this band a lot just thought it’d be heavyweight but it’s super light which I don’t mind either. I just would like it to have a little more weight but other than that it’s a beautiful piece. I was able to easily adjust the band to fit my small wrist.
4,Comfortable lightweight and easy to adjust!
5,I LOVE this band! I wear it almost everyday. It goes with everything. I wore this band over my silver one to a semi formal event and it went perfectly with my outfit (black dress pants silky blouse tailored blazer and heels). My fave band thus far! Great quality and love that it can be used with casual and semi dressy outfits.
5,Good quality product don’t hesitate to purchase. The band is nice and light. Does not weigh you down or make your wrist sweat.
5,Beautiful and comfortable! Already got so many compliments. Best band I’ve had so far for sure.
4,It’s nice & came as described but a little on the pricy side as far as value you can remove parts to make bigger or smaller. It is a kinda loose or tight & it sticks to wrist with moisture. It is very pretty & made well!
5,Very dressy!! Beautiful colors. Get a lot of comments!!
5,I feel the band is delicate and could break easy
5,Looks great! Very easy to switch out I haven’t taken a link out yet but may try to sit lower on my wrist. So far so good! Looks nicer to me than the black plastic band the watch comes with
4,Not sure if I like the very lightness of this band.  Looks pretty.  Hope it holds up.
5,Loved the look of this band and it’s very light weight. The colors are very vibrant and pretty and I love how it looks different from the regular bands. I had to get my husband to help me with the link because you really have to push hard to get it off and luckily he didn’t brake it. I bought another one in a different color because I love the way they look.
3,Over charged for what you actually get. Would I recommend? Probably not.
5,I love this watchband.  It blends nicely with the rose gold apple watch but still gives me a great shot of purple.  Easy to sixe.  No compaliants whatsoever
4,Love it so much got one for my daughter.
3,Loved the look and fit of this band. Unfortunately the third time I wore this it broke because a pin fell out.
5,Super cute.  The first one I received must have been a return. The band was in separate pieces and the pins did not fit.  I returned it and my replacement was here within 2 days.  And it was great
5,I love this band.  Normally I get leather bands but need to replace them quite often.  This band can be wiped down with soap and water and does not get the moisture underneath like the leather ones.
5,My husband generally upgrade my I watched often and I had a ton of Rose Gold bands till I noticed the change “champagne gold” this is so pretty and the color (white) has a hint of different colors that are complimentary. Will def be ordering another!

It’s worth every penny .

5,This band looks more expensive than it is...I get lots of compliments on it. Comes with tools to add or remove links to make it the perfect size. Beautiful!

5,Actually love this watch band! It’s light weight looks dressy enough but still appears to be water proof so no need to change out the band for daily workouts. Links were easy to remove and was provided tools and instructions to do myself. Really happy with this!
5,It makes your apple watch look soooo classy. And it includes the tools you need to adjust it to your wrist size that alone gives them major points!!!
5,Love this band! I get so many compliments.. it was easy to remove links for a perfect fit.
5,So far so good and I love it
2,Updated review: after my review I received communication from the company about how the product should not have tarnished. They send me a replacement item which I received within the day!!!  Great customer service and appreciated them standing behind their product!!!Original review: Loved the watch at first. Then as I wore it the pins that hold the links together are tarnished and black and can be seen through the light colored links. They were not black and tarnished when I got it. The watch should take the west and tear including getting wet. I’ve had the watch for 2 months and already it’s happening. You pay for what you get.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s well made and very comfortable. Also they provide the tools to take off some links if you need. I would recommend this product
5,I really like this band. It was easy to remove links to adjust to my size and it’s a nice change to use with my rose gold Apple Watch
5,The colors within this band are very very vibrant. This is the kind of watch band that you can easily dress up or wear casually. I had to remove a link from each side so it could fit securely on my wrist but the tool and instructions provided made that process easy to do.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Love love love this watch band! I miss being able to wear my fancier watches now that I have an Apple Watch. Super easy to take links out to adjust to the perfect size. Wear it every day. Great value. Looks very expensive!
5,Beautiful and easy to adjust!
5,I love this watch band!  It is lightweight and looks great!  It was a little difficult to remove 2 of the links but I persevered!
5,I love my watch band it is very comfy and beautiful. I did have to ask for a couple extra links and the customer service is amazing. They didn’t have a couple extra links so they sent me a whole new band and told me I could use the extra as backups. Lovely experience and lovely watch band.
5,Great deal for the money and dresses up the watch
5,I love everything about this band. The colors are so pretty. The band is very comfortable
3,I was a little disappointed. It wasn’t the same color in pics. Mine is a lot dull and not bright at all. Very big for my little wrist
5,Removed a few notches relatively easily and works just fine for me. Love the print! Worn daily for the last 6 months and no problems. Would recommend!
5,I wanted a new wrist band for my watch && this was perfect ! It comes with a tool to remove the extra links && it was easy to remove !
5,I love this watch band.  Easy to remove sections for small wrists.  Comfortable and stylish.  I have received numerous compliments.
5,This is a really nice looking band. It looks way more expensive than it is. The links were easy to remove to fit a small wrist.
5,Love the colors and how light weight it is. Very comfortable.
5,Colors go with anything I wear. Light weight and comfortable.
3,Returned it because it wasn't the fun rainbow colors abut sort of darker and cheaper looking.
5,I love my Apple Watch band easy to put on and take off and I love the light fill on my wrist not heavy at all. Beautiful design !
5,I love my choice in bands. There were many to choose from.  It pairs well with my watch. The included tool was very helpful to remove two links for a better fit.
5,Love and easy to size. Looks expensive but not at all
5,Like that it was easy to attach and like the way it feels. Not loose at all
5,Very easy to put in.
5,I wash my hands a lot and the original band would let my skin humid I like this one bc I know itwill drain the waterhave. Besides is a pretty band and I  received lots of compliments I just say amazon!
5,Found this on a different website for waaayyy more! Quality is great and many compliments on it!
5,Love the colors and the ease of fitting to my Apple watch. Good clasp that can’t catch on your clothes. Lots of compliments!
5,Love.  Very easy to remove links beautiful color and super easy to put on.  One of my favorite watch bands to date.

5,I get so many compliments daily!!
5,Love that this watch band goes with the weird gold/rose gold watch. Everything else I have tried has been off color. Great for spring and summer
5,This band made my Apple Watch instantly look so much more expensive! Now I feel like it’s more unique and more me it doesn’t just match everyone else’s out there.
5,It arrived broken however the replacement process was a breeze. I had a new one in my mailbox within 2 days sent the broken back Done!It’s super easy to remove the links and the band is super cute! Love it!
5,Love this band! I get so many compliments on it! The only thing I have to say is on the backside the rose gold has worn off a little. I have other bands that haven’t done that so was a little disappointed. No one can see that side though so it’s not really a big deal! It’s a good band for the price!
4,I’m returning this because the color showing as bright aqua in real life showed as a deeper green in the advertising photos. The quality is nice and I ordered a different color.
5,So many compliments on this watch! The directions were easy to follow as I had to remove several links. Took only 5-10 mins. Looks great!
5,This band worked well with my watch and I am glad I found it.
5,So great that it comes with the tools and instructions to remove the links and size it yourself. Super easy to do and looks great! I've gotten some compliments on it. Love this new apple watch band - will probably buy more!
5,Love this band! I was worried that it would be uncomfortable and pinch my arm but I’ve not had the first problem. I would even say that it’s more comfortable than the silicone bands. I get tons of compliments on it looks very high end and not cheap at all! The links were super easy to remove as well.
5,Love it 👍🤣🤣
5,very pretty instructions were clear and easy to execute.
5,You’re able to remove the links without a problem I loved it the moment I put it on!!
5,I absolutely love this band love that it’s sizable! Which was super important to me cause my wrists are so small. I get complements and questions where I got the band all the time!
5,Looks great but is very loose. I don’t know how to remove the links.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Great band! It’s like half a link too large (when I remove one it’s too tight) but I still wear it everyday! Looks good with the rose gold watch
3,Great watch band. Very nicely made. However the color is completely different than the picture so I’ll be returning. Sad because I really like. The band is supposed to have tan and black tortoise but the “tan” is more pink or a white creamy color.
5,I love this band! I get so many compliments on the look of it. People can not believe I bought it off Amazon!
5,I absolutely love this band. It’s light weight and not too wide. I have small wrists and had to take four links out. I took two out of each side to keep it even. I have a silver watch so I can’t compare the rose gold colors. However it was true to the pictures and is very pretty. I like that the background color is a creamy ivory rather than pure white. Overall I’m very happy.
3,Didn’t want to have to adjust the size.
5,Comfortable and durable
5,Easy to remove extra links for my small wrist. Love the tortoise color. I get compliments on it all the time. Will order other colors!
5,I really like this band. It is very comfy was easy to adjust the fit and is very easy to put on and remove. It is so light weight and nice looking. I was looking for something different and I found it.
5,Beautiful watch band lightweight  and very trendy. I’ve had a lot of compliments on this band and would highly recommend!
5,Super easy to remove links if needed. Love the rose colored links with rose gold hardware!
5,You have to be careful not to pinch yourself putting it on.
5,I absolutely love this watch band! It’s so nice and looks professional for working purposes.
5,Saw this band on my friend and ordered it. Price was right and it’s a great sturdy band for every day use but attractive tortoise shell.
5,Very cute and easy to size! I love the gold details and neutral links!
4,Nice look
5,I love this band! It looks great it’s comfortable and is easy to clean.It fits my wrist without removing any links but if your wrist is smaller then it will be really easy to remove them. The tool is included.
5,I bought it to give my watch a different look but also water resistant because I wash my hands a lot. I have gotten so many compliments on my band. I like that it came with tools to take links out to adjust to my wrist.
1,I was super excited to get my band. However when trying to adjust to my wrist the tools broken which than led to everything to break and couldn't fix it any more. Waste of money :(
5,This was great band to wear but pin broke after 3 months. Customer service was quick to replace it. It is very cool looking lightweight and comfortable to wear. I hope the replacement lasts longer.
5,I love my band  easy  to removed  love the color
5,Very stylish and light weight. Loved!!!
4,Love the pink band. Have received many compliments on it. Easy to adjust size. Also ordered the brown tortoise it’s a darker brown in person. Customer service was great! Very responsive and accommodating.
5,My mom and I both ordered one at the same time and we were not disappointed! Fits great easy to adjust (removed links) and looks amazing! Highly recommend!
5,This watch band is very comfortable! It’s really easy to put in and take off. Have received several compliments on it.
5,This is my favorite! I put it on and havnt taken it off!
5,It matches with my rose gold watch and it was easy to change the bands just have to remove some pieces to make it fit.
5,Very happy with this purchase I got two different colors and I’ll be keeping both. I was worried they might lol cheap but that’s definitely not the case. The band is very pretty and it was super easy to remove the links to size it to my wrist.
5,It’s EASY to get off and on. Really comfortable and I enjoy my rainbow colored one. I’d buy it again!!!
5,I was looking for some type of band with an elegant look but not heavy - this is it.  Gorgeous yet not bulky feeling at all.
3,I thought the quality of the band looked cheap. Maybe a different color would look better but the yellowish lines in the white one looked fake. The clasp looked sturdy though and nice but I don't know how it would fare over time if it would tarnish or not.
5,Absolutely love this product...especially for the price. Looks more expensive than it was and wears well.
5,I LOVE this band. It was easy to attach its really pretty. A tortoise shell/marbled look that goes with everything. It's comfortable (doesn't pinch skin or pull hair) and it's lightweight while study as well. Easy on East off. If it came in other colors I would buy another one!!!!
2,I should have stopped when I was trying to put it on because I was essentially forcing it. Then it was so hard to get off. Glad I didn’t fully put the other side on. Disappointed because it is so pretty
5,Amazing band! It is true to it’s size and fits perfectly on my wrist. It also very fashionable and I am most definitely going to buy again!
5,So pretty and came with great and easy to follow instructions on how to shorten the band for those with smaller wrists! I got many compliments on it!
5,LOVE this watch band. I got so many compliments this weekend wearing it out for the first time i loved that they send the tool you need in order to resize the band- so convenient. The quality of the band it’s pretty great for the price and the colors match great with my rose gold watch. Will most likely order in another color.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Super cute and easy to use ❤️
5,Lightweight durable and pairs with my rose gold watch beautifully!
5,Love this watch band!  So pretty!
5,Good quality and very pretty. Would buy more in other  colors. I have a series 3 watch and the fit was great.
4,Very stylish excellent item considering how price friendly the band is definitely can’t wait to order more colors!
5,Light weight. Love the color. Only thing is it’s a little hard to put on watch if you take out 2 links. Other than that Good. Gives a dresser look to the watch.
5,Easy to place on apple watch. Very stylish. The quality makes it look expensive and the rosegold metal accent is the sane tone as my apple watch face. Its very comfortable and easy to wear! Highly reccomend! I got the turtouise with rosegold and will be getting other colors.
5,Love love these watch bands would buy again
5,Super cute way to put in and remove. Very light and fashionable!! Love love love. Great for everyday wear.
5,
5,Band quality is great for the price. The color is gorgeous. It came with the necessary tools to remove links for those of us who have small wrists.
5,Love this watch band. Easy to size and is very attractive.
5,I bought this as a dupe for the wize band and it looks just like it! Very happy.
5,Made wellEasy to useLooks great and is comfortable
5,It was time for an update to my old watch band. This band is very comfortable I get lots of compliments on it. It feels comfortable to wear and looks like a piece of jewelry.
5,So pretty
5,The band itself is beautiful perfect for spring. The only set back was taking the extra links off. They give you a single tool that you have to push the link through yourself and it was hard for me. I punctured my finger doing it. But aside from that band is beautiful.
5,
5,Great quality links were easy to remove
5,Pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it.
5,Love this watch band. It’s classy looking when I want to dress up a bit! Will be ordering more colors!
5,So far I’m loving this watch band.  Good quality and comfortable
5,Nos costó quitarle un eslabón por no tener práctica pero.. junto a mi esposo lo logramos es hermoso este brazalete y se los recomiendo para que compremos de otros colores se siente confortable. ♥️
3,My wrist size is in between I guess so it’s either too tight or too lose because you have to take links out etc not very comfortable but I love the colors! Haven’t worn it since I got it yet it sits in my drawer
5,Wonderful watch band. Very durable and so stylish! Love it.
5,I HAD TO TAKE OUT SOME CHAINS BECAUSE I HAVE A SMALL WRISTS BUT AFTER THAT IT FIT PERFECTLY AND IS SO PRETTY!  LOVE THIS.
5,This band is lightweight and beautiful!! I get several compliments every time I wear my watch.
5,I really like the colors and how light it is.Looks very good and goes with everything I wear!
5,When I initially bought it it was too big. There are directions on how to remove links along with a watch tool so that was an easy fix. The band is beautiful. I’ll be buying another one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great watch band but the directions to take out the links to adjust it aren’t that easy to understand. My husband did it for me lol but it looks great!
5,Super cute and love this watch band! I want every color!
5,Love it just like picture wear it all the time
5,This strap is awesome!  no complaints! I have worn it dirt biking and it holds up!
5,This band is the best and I have gotten so many compliments time after time.
5,This was a great choice. I was worried about how well it would hold up and it’s been great.Super easy to remove links and not as “sticky” feeling while wearing when hot.I plan on getting more soon.
5,I get so many compliments from my coworkers.
4,Cute for the price. Only complaint is the clasp gets scratched up easily from surface contact but no one can see it since it's on my wrist. I got tons of compliments on the band though.
5,Love! So easy to adjust too!
5,I like because is so elegant and happy. The color is beautifully and your arm look nice. Your apple wash see much better with this band.
5,I like it. Looks pretty and seems durable. The links were easy enough to remove.
5,Great alternative from the one I usually wear when I work out. Comes with all the tools needed to adjust the size as well.
4,Very pretty. Lightweight. Unfortunately I was unable to fit this band comfortably on my small wrist. Really liked the color and the easy on/off clasp.
5,Really like how light it is. I was expecting it to be heavier. Easy to remove link if you follow the instructions!
1,I loved this watch band for exactly one year until the day it broke out of the blue and my watch fell from my wrist onto the concrete floor shattering my watch face. Should have spent the extra $50 on a more durable band because now my $800 watch is unusable. Buyer beware.
5,So cute looks like I spent more than I did comfortable and affordable. Loving this for day to day wear!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Really cute and classy band. Purchased it for my trip to Jamaica and it blended with all of my outfits nicely. Love the band but it broke me out. I never break out from costume jewelry so I really don’t know what it was. Upset that I have to give it away. Other than that I love it.
5,I love this pretty watch brand! It’s easy to adjust the length and easy to clasp one and off!
5,The quality is outstanding I really love it and it doesn’t scratch easily
5,Perfect watch for the summer.  It’s light weight durable and looks great 💚
1,Too hard to make it smaller and I didn’t like it .
5,I like the band but it is too small.  I thought I was getting a 44 MM but I received a 42mm.  I would like to get a bigger size.Update:  Received new band.  Added the new links and it fits perfectly.  Thank you for the quick response. Very happy!
5,Love the colors and the clasp of this band. Very nice and not heavy to wear. Easy to read instructions for changing bans size
5,Love the feel of the band. It is very comfortable to wear all day. Would highly recommend this to anyone.
5,I absolutely love the colors and ease of removing links. Excellent product & Fast shipping!
5,Love the band. It is plastic but looks and feels nice on my wrist. The only complaint was the link removal tool had two of the same ends and it wasn’t the one needed to push out the link pins. I had an extra tool so I was able to remove the links!
5,I get sooo many compliments on my band I’m in love!
5,Easy to adjust to your wrist size love mine!
5,This band looks really nice. The clasp is secure. It was very easy to size.
4,Really pretty. Lighter weight than expected and love that. Easy link removal.  I am going to get another color!
5,Love this watch band. Easy to wear & remove. Very classy !! Will order again in different color
5,Great looking watch band. Note “shimmering white” had a pinkish purple hue but I like it.
5,Love the band.  I get lots of compliments on it.  It is very comfortable.
5,Loved it . Super cute on and very comfortable . I was skeptical at first thinking it would pinch my wrist but it doesn’t
5,I love my new watch band it’s very classy but light weight. Easy to take off but won’t come off on its own. Durable but not bulky super comfy!! So many compliments.
2,If you use your apple watch for looks only this would be 5 stars.  If you are like me and use the apps swimming walking hiking running.....  well don't expect to get a good heart rate or accurate readings.  UNLESS it fits you perfect.  For me I need a 1/2 size link and of course there is no such thing. Taking out one more makes it fit too tight pinching me leaving one in well NO accurate reading.They are very pretty so if you are looking for something for church or social they are great.
5,I’ve gotten one to two compliments. It’s great! Wear it everyday and it’s held up just fine. Buy it! You’ll love it.
5,I love the color because it goes with nearly everything! It’s easily removed and durable!
5,Looks just like it does in the picture. Easy to adjust and put on
4,Love the color and is comfortable
5,One of my favorite bands!!!
5,It matches the rose gold of the watch well and it’s durable.
5,Just received today and happy with my purchase. Seems light weight little difficult removing links at first. Not sure of durability at this time
5,Perfect fit
5,Took me a while to adjust to my size but instructions are great
5,Love it! Got so many compliments.
5,It's so beautiful in person! Made me like my Apple watch more! I was getting tired of my boring watch strap and this made my Apple watch look elegant!
5,I enjoy wearing this Apple Watch band. The colors are really pretty and fun. Great for casual days.
5,I absolutely love this band goes with everything easy to make my size simple to remove and put on. It’s very pretty.
5,Love it! Easy to size and connect to watch. Comfortable to wear and looks great!
5,Arrived as a blush pink with the the tortoise print versus a light cream of the tortoise print.  I like looks nice really feminine.
5,This band is so comfortable! It's durable I don't have a difficult time removing it if I need to. I workout every day and this band never bothers me while I lift weights or do any high-intensity exercise!!! And the color I purchased goes with literally anything!
5,Loved the color!  Easy to remove!  Secure!  Easy to remove links to fit wrist!
5,I don’t write reviews often (tisk tisk) BUT I have to for this band. It is absolutely stunning and very well made. I’ve been looking for a sophisticated band for quite some time and I’ve finally found it. GORGEOUS!
5,I bought this for my daughter and loved it so much I ordered one for myself
5,I absolutely love this watch band. I received it within two days of ordering it and its beautiful.  I would highly recommend the band and the seller!
5,Love this watch band! I have a very small wrist and it came with a kit to remove links it was very easy to remove. Fits great! Is a great every day watch band.
5,Love my watch band ! Simple and stylish. And I’ve gotten so many compliments ❤️
5,I love this band. It’s beautiful with the rose gold watch. BUT I will say taking the links out was not as easy as other reviews sounded. The rods were stuck in the links so it took a while to force them out. Hoping it’s a one off for this product bc I’d possibly like to buy other colors!
5,It’s so so pretty and comfortable to wear. I have small wrists so I did have to take out two links but it was easy enough. I plan on ordering another in a different color 🙃
5,Completely love it colors are beautiful and good quality product. Have to buy more for family members.
5,Looks high quality and is comfortable. Will update in a month or two for durability. But so far I LOVE it and am so glad I bought it. Looks great!
5,I have now bought 2 I absolutely love this watch band it fits perfect and is so comfortable. Definitely will buy more!
2,Box not in gift giving shape. Looks like someone had already used the band and just shoved all the pieces in the packaging before sending. Loose bits fell out when I opened package.
1,I love the band however IF you use it and truly track your heart rate this band won’t work. One link size difference it goes from being way too loose to then extremely tight. You have to be lucky for it to fit perfectly
3,Update: It keeps logging me out. Even after I took out pins and brackets (?). The Watch keeps moving from my wrist. I tried making it smaller no change. Anyway I’m going to have to return.
5,I really like the color and the comfort of this watch band. The only bad thing is sometimes it catches on my arm hair and will irritate it.
5,I love the fit. Easy to put on and take off. Best ever.
5,Very pretty. Looks like marble and rose petals. Love it. Lightweight and easy to adjust.
5,This band is exactly what I had hoped it would be. Colors are near exact as the description picture. I will be ordering some of the other colors too.
5,I love this band! It looks just like the photo and it comes with instructions to adjust the band. It fits perfectly and does not irritate my wrist. Glad that I got it!
5,Love it. Classy. Light and easy to put on and take off. Color looks great. I took off three pieces to get it to fit and that was pretty Easy to do.
3,It looks alittle darker than shown in picture but it is very light and comfortable. Easy to remove links and seems very strong but it is plastic and I will have to wear for awhile to see how it holds up to daily wear.
5,Absolutely love this band. I have a small wrist and it fit me perfectly. The color is true to the picture. Definitely worth the money. Will order other colors.
5,I love this band and already plan on ordering three more colors.
3,This is not easy to adjustFor sizing . I can’t seem to get the little rods out to fit my wrist . It’s a beautiful wrist band though and im bummed it’s hard for me to adjust the size so I’ll be returning
5,Beautiful and comfortable band for my iWatch. It matches perfectly with my rose tone case.
2,Love this watch band and have only had it for about a month or two and it’s already discoloring. Super disappointed
5,I Love it!
5,Great look and durable wear…
5,So cute!!!
5,I wear this everyday! I love it and the quality of it is amazing I get so many compliments. Easy to assemble into the watch and to take off.
5,Great purchase! Very pretty and easy to remove links.
5,Looks great. It’s lite weight I get a lot of compliments on it.
5,It’s been a week of wearing the back without any allergic reaction. Great band if you skin is sensitive to plastics. Will buy another in a different color
5,Very stylish. Comfortable to wear. Comes with directions and tools to adjust the band size if needed. I am so happy with this purchase. I got so many compliments in the first hour of wearing it.
5,Hey so many complements on this band! Hope the metal doesn’t tarnish over time. So far I’ve worn it every day for about a week and it appears to be holding up pretty well to many hand washings per day.
5,Love this watch band! Super easy to remove the links if you need to adjust the size. Its so pretty and the color goes with so many different outfits. Very comfortable to wear also.
5,Love this band! So far so good. Was easy to change and excited to use it.
5,Easy to remove and comfortable.  I just started wearing it so I can’t really tell yet about durability.
5,Thank you so much
5,My favorite band! I did have to take off a link but it was a super simple process! Love it so much I bought a second color :)
1,i have long nails and it is impossible to put the screws back in the holes. the tool does not work well either as mine is already bent and about to break. if you are not up to assembling a difficult product with no instructions DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! they need to make this easier.
2,Ehh this was "ok". Was hoping for a more luxurious feel but I got hard plastic. Plus trying to size the links to my wrist wasn't accurate. Either it was too tight or too loose..
3,Looks of cheap material. Thought it would look more like mother of pearl so maybe I chose the wrong color? Also not easy to remove links and put on watch.
5,I love this watch band and I would gladly buy something else from this seller.  Top of the line customer service.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
5,Love this band to dress up my watch when I’m not working out! Super cute and feels nice
5,I have gotten many compliments about this band. Since my purchase I have brought several more. It was very easy to remove links ( it came with the tools) which was a plus for me.
5,I love it. I got a lot of compliments for it
5,
5,I have lost count of the compliments I have gotten! It’s comfortable too.
5,Absolutely love this watch band! Comfortable light exactly as pictured great value. Easy to adjust size. And it LOOKS expensive! 😬❤️❤️ Goes with dressing up workout clothes and everything in between.
5,Super cute and easy to remove replace links as well.
5,Very pleased with my purchase! It’s durable comfortable and pretty!
5,We are leaving after the delay I must say very beautiful even though it’s plastic I wish it wasn’t but it’s gorgeous it’s worth it God bless everyone and thank you for the delivery
4,Its so good amd unique
3,It wasn’t quite what I was expecting I didn’t realize the material is plastic so it’s not very breathable and the sizing is a little weird. One link too many it’s huge and one link smaller it’s too tight so for me it doesn’t fit comfortably. But the design is very cute.
5,Looks nice rose gold matches the case of my I-Watch and is comfortable to wear!
5,
3,Cute after I finally removed the two links. Very difficult to do as the tool to remove the links was very sharp and literally cut my hand twice! Overall it’s nice two bandaids later🤦🏻‍♀️
3,Great item. Only issue I have with it is it was supposed to be rose gold and its gold doesn’t match my rose gold watch. False advertising on that part overall looks great hopeful it will be durable.
4,Totallly worth it!!!I had to remove some links to fit my wrist but otherwise.. Loving it!
5,Beautimous!!!!!! Fantabulous!Absolutely love my watch band!
5,The media could not be loaded.

5,I am very happy with the watch band.  Looks nice and is very comfortable.

5,I wear this everyday and it fits comfortably with no pinching
5,Love love love!  So much prettier in person.  Everyone always compliments me on this band saying how pretty it is and that they’ve never seen a band like it.  I’m like Amazon! These bands are so affordable and stylish beats paying for those ugly straps from Apple at high prices
5,Buy it!!!! So pretty and can literally be worn with any outfit :-)
5,I’ve had it for a little while now and it still looks great
5,I love that this band comes with its own tool to remove links if you need to adjust it for sizing. This makes it super easy!
5,Great watchband. It was a bit of a pain in the *ss to get the links off to fit my wrist though - you really need some solid arm strength! It’s very easy to put on and take off. Classy and stylish a departure from the usual black.
5,Attractive and comfortable
5,The watch band looks exactly like the photo on Amazon and looks great with my Rose Gold iWatch.
2,Update 10/25/21The second band has not lived up to previous expectation. Starting a few months ago the pin pops loose from the band and the watch falls off. This started happening with my old one after about a year of use. This one was just after a couple of months.As this is the second time I can no longer recommend this band.This is my second band from them. First was for Fitbit. Now for my Apple Watch. Very nice bands. I swim in it wear it all day every day. Metal finish is still like new. Perfect rose gold match for my Apple Watch. I highly recommend these bands.
5,Great product I love my new watch band
5,Took out a few links using the instructions provided. Fits perfect.

5,It’s very pretty and it goes with a lot of things!
3,Beautiful band it just didn’t fit my Apple Watch and the exposed edges were very sharp. Also the packaging was torn and the inside tape looked like it was previously opened with dirt and paper pieces under the tape. So I’m assuming this was previously sold and sent back. Sooooo NOT a new product 🤨 I will Be sending back.
5,Love the strap so pretty and good quality.

5,It’s so unique and beautiful! I love it!
5,Just enough links to fit my wrist. I’m an average sized male 5’10” normal sized wrists. I’m assuming it fit for anyone with a heavier build unless you buy two or ask the seller for extra links.

5,Love! Pretty unique band. Easy to remove extra links.
5,So fashionable! Easy clasp! Very well made!

3,The explanation of the product is not comprehensive enough. I asked if it was compatible to my brushes gold because the picture was not good enough to tell I never got an answer so I ordered it and it was rose gold erg it is on its way  back. I am sorry because I loved the band color so if ever you decide to make it for the brushed gold please let me know.

1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I would give it 5 stars but since I have no tools to make it adjustable to my wrist size I give it a 1 .

5,I am very pleased with the band. Super light weight& durable. Recommend this!
5,Very comfortable fashionable
3,Looks super cute! Easy to remove the links only issue is that after some time it got lose even after removing links. The clasp is also wearing out the gold color. Love it but the quality it’s not worth for the price it’s being sold

5,Love! Easy to remove links! Would buy again :)
5,I love my new band.
2,If you don’t have a skinny wrist and don’t like wearing your watch super tight and snug do NOT buy this! It comes with the tool to remove links from the chain but no additional links.
5,Cute. Im happy with my purchase
5,I received my watch band today. It was a little big but they send you the tool to take links out. Took me maybe 3-4 minutes to take out the links. The band is very comfortable and matches my watch perfect. Will order more from this company again.

5,Above my expectations!!! Love this band. The tortoise looks and feels high quality. Gives my Apple Watch a dressy feel but I can still dress it down with jeans. Buy it!
5,Very easy to remove unneeded links to fit my wrist. Super flexible and comfortable.
5,I love to be able to change bands easily and have them dependable as to not come open and fall off as others do. I recommend this company!
5,While a practical item I wanted a touch of whimsy. It’s attractive and the colors while not shy do not shout.
5,Matches my rose gold watch perfectly!
5,Good..
2,I loved this watch band for the style and functionality. After wearing a few times I noticed that my wrist broke out in an itchy rash. I switched back to my other band for a while and the rash had cleared up. After sanitizing and wearing this band for 3 hours the rash was back and worse than ever. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.
5,Love it
5,Love this! It looks very classy and it’s versatile in style.
5,Love theseThis is my fifth one different colors
5,Love it!!
5,Very pretty.  Easy to put on and adjust. Comfortable.

5,The band matches with my gold watch perfectly!! I like the way it looks when I wear my suites or dresses!!

5,Love this watch band!  So cute and stylish. Looks more expensive than it was and the links were easily removed with tool provided.  Can’t beat the price.
3,Love the style but it came too big for my wrist and removing the links is impossible. I’ll have to take it to a department store once things open back up.
5,Beautiful
3,Cute concept but just didn’t fit right now matter how many links I added or took off. Little too cheap looking for me.
5,Easy to adjust.
5,I absolutely love this band and I will be purchasing it in other colors as well!
5,Like the fact that the clasp doesn’t come loose or open easily so I don’t have to worry about it falling off. Comfortable and cute.
5,Awesome look!  My new favorite band!
5,Ive had this since January & its held up nicely. I've worked out & have gone swimming with it.
2,It’s really hard to get on once on really hard to get off
1,Very disappointed. I ordered the Tortoise Stone Flower for Starlight. Neither the band or the clasp look anything like the picture. The description does say copper stainless steel buckle but I took a chance that it was wrong. What I got was the regular tortoise color with a copper buckle. If you are looking for a match for Apple's starlight this is not it.
5,Easy to adjust size. Comfortable. No complaints.

5,I love this band. It’s light weight it came with a tool to adjust the size of the band. It’s worth the price

3,Runs small and narrow had to return it. It felt like plastic though so I don’t think it was sturdy either
5,Comfortable
5,I love this watch band! It’s a really pretty white - almost purplish color. It came with a tool to remove extra links and it was really easy to use.
2,Not very comfortable would not click into watch well so one side was loose.
5,Just as pictured. Light weight and you will get many compliments.
1,Do not buy this band! The very first day I used this band it broke and caused my Apple Watch to fall to the floor and the screen broke! I’ve had it for three years without any issues until this band.  All I did was move my arm quickly and the little spring loaded bar that attaches the band to the watch popped out - on both sides! Now I have to get a new watch 😭. I guess that’s what I get for buying a cheap band on Amazon. But it had so many great reviews and it looked so pretty that I decided to give it a try. I am really regretting that decision now! It’s too bad because the band is a beautiful color and was comfortable  but obviously not made well at all and not worth risking your watch!
5,I love it
5,I love the colors and I’ve been getting lots of compliments.
5,I love how great these look and how comfortable they are.
5,Great quality ...looks good too!
5,So far it’s great. Easy to adjust. Looks and feels great

5,I get a lot of compliments. Easy to remove links in case it’s to big. Good quality.

5,I absolutely LOVE my watch band!
5,Looks nice on and is comfortable to wear!
5,This band is very easy to assemble and is even more beautiful than the photos!
5,It’s a really cute and unique looking watch band. The rose gold matches the series 3 fairly well
2,The links were hard to remove and the size of the sections were too large and it was difficult to get it to fit mywrist which is very small.  When I tried to adjust by removing links it was either too big or too small.  I adjustedit finally but it was very uncomfortable.  I am not wearing it anymore.
5,This band is prettier in person than the picture shows. It was easy to remove some of the extra links to adjust sizing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
3,The band is very pretty and it is light. I am getting a rash from it and the clasp is starting to stick.
5,Excelente banda colores muy lindos excelente empaque y viene con una herramienta para ajustar al tamaño que se necesite.
5,So pretty and dressy
5,This watch band is so pretty. If fits perfectly and it’s comfortable
2,The watch band has removable links and includes a couple of tools to remove them. But there are NO instructions. I tried many times to figure it out with no success. It’s really cute but if I can’t adjust the links there is no reason to keep it.
5,I just love this watch band! Thinking about getting another one in a different color.
5,Good quality.  Great price.
5,Beautiful band.
5,Super easy instructions. Looks and feels great!! (So far its only day 1)

5,Perfect! So cute! It was easy to take the links out and the quality is amazing!
5,It's very versatile and looks great with most outfits.
1,U have to use tools to fix it but what’s sent is not sufficient and it’s too difficult. Need a jeweler to do it.
2,The links are so difficult to remove that I haven’t even fitted it for my wrist yet. I’m most likely going to return.
5,Good looking light weight watch band. Neutral gender which is what I love. Seems good quality. Came with small adjustment tool which is very handy.

5,Perfect I love it
5,Absolutely beautiful!!!!! Can’t complain
5,Omg this looks amazing on my watch. I’m going to purchase more from the same vender
2,This watch band is simply just cheap hard plastic.  Not comfortable and definitely does not secure tightly into the watch.  The metal is also very cheap feeling.  This watch band should be priced more in the $10 range then over $20.
5,I love it! Many compliments!
5,Its so pretty. Goes with everything.
5,Bought this for the wifey and she loves it. Well constructed and lightweight.
2,Cheaply made. Not sturdy like my other bands. Can’t see it lasting too long.

5,Love it!!! Beautiful!!
5,love that you can adjust the size by taking links on and off
1,There are no additional clasps on the band to help with sizing as well as this was supposed to be white. Only good thing is it fits my watch but it was not what I ordered or thought I was getting.

5,Great brand

5,𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗲

5,Everybody comments on it. Very comfortable.
5,I really like this band.  It’s one of my favorites!
2,After removing a link as outlined the band was to tight and with the link in it was to big. I gave it to my sister who’s wrist is larger then mine.
5,I like it so much! Super light too
5,I switch my bands frequently and I didn’t have a white one so this worked out great!
5,Love this band! Fashionable and lightweight!
2,Looks and feels very cheap. Very low quality materials were used. It’s difficult for o tell from the pictures how it really looks in real life.
5,Love the band but a pin came out of the latch and I can’t find one to fit.
2,I love the look of this band. Feels much more high class than it is.  However I have only worn it one day and one of the links connected to the watch face has chipped away leaving it weak.  It is still wearable but Does concern me.
5,I get so many compliments great quality and style
5,Very comfortable. Great buy

5,Love this item
5,Pretty
5,Attractive piece.
2,I loved the color of it (purple) but it's way too small.
5,Very comfortable and light goes with just about everything.
5,Closest to Rose gold I've found!
5,As a replacement for my old band. It fit well.
5,Super cute loved it.
2,difficult the size difficult to adjust.cute and light weight
5,Super cute and fashionable. Easy to adjust to size.
2,Looks great my issue is that the links are put on backward so they curve the wrong direction. Needed to take out three extra links but was easy enough to do. Only issue is that the links are obviously reversed
5,Great
5,Love it!!!

5,Super cute!
2,This band is not worth the price at all. Over $20 for extremely cheap plastic that scratches instantly. Would not recommend unless you’re into cheap things. Honestly thought the quality was going to be a lot better based on the pictures.
1,
5,Me encanto
5,Gorgeous i love it
5,easy to adjust and so darn functional!
5,NA
1,I had a horrible allergic reaction. Had to go to the doctor from how bad it got
3,The band size was smaller than listed and didn’t work for me.
5,Love love love this band. Have had many ask about it.
5,My favorite
5,Love it
5,So many compliments!
5,Cheap plastic
1,This band is a lot smaller than the description says. The was a email address that I received with the order of I had to ask questions. I sent a email to ask if the sold additional extension pieces and the email was returned saying the email address didn’t exist  I will be returning this product.
5,Loved the ban
2,One part of the belt is broken can't use feel like I can lose my apple watch
5,Good quality for the money
2,cute but i had i have worn it for a month and it’s already broken
5,It looks expensive but very nice
5,Looks and works great
2,I’m returning it. It wasn’t the description I thought it was. Pretty but not me
5,Great band
2,I had to return because link was missing. Pieces Of band were cracked. Tools to remove links were provided. However  zero instructions on how remove links.
5,love the color and is light weight
5,Looks good.
1,The band on the right piece that fits on face of watch is too large. Band on left is my old band you can see the difference. Also two stems as shown are are two small. Stem on right is from my current band. Maybe I was sent wrong size. Other than that it is a very pretty watch band.
5,Looks great!
5,Very please with the product color and quality.
2,It’s cheap it’s going to break the bar that connects it to the watch is loose and moves around you can tell it can’t be compared to an OEM from Apple and too expensive..
5,Love it!
1,Cute. But not durable. Typing at work and my wrist hit desk and a piece chipped off. Waist of money now.
5,Love it!
2,This is a very attractive watchband. However I had to take out two links which was easier said than done. The tool provided did not work very well. Once the links were finally removed the clasp would not stay closed tight. Very disappointed.
5,Love it
5,It looks beautiful!
5,N/a
1,I have had this watch band for 4 months ish and it has broken off at the pin two times. Luckily both times I was able to find it. Not giving it a third chance.
1,Watch slides right off!!! Won't attach to watch. Took a while to get it fitted & never knew till to late to return it!!!
1,Do not get this. It’s so hard to put on and take off the watch itself. It’s easier to put on your wrist though. I’ve only had it for about two and a half weeks and it already broke. It’s so difficult. The sizing is all wrong too. If I shorten it by one little piece is too small. But if I leave it as is it’s too big. I also thought it was going to better material. But it’s just the cheapest plastic there is. Not happy with this.
1,I returned it since I couldn’t put on my watch
1,I didn’t want to believe the other reviews but I learned the hard way that this band really gives out at the worst times. It unexpectedly broke and my poor Apple Watch is all chipped because of it.
5,So pretty!
2,It felt cheap.. ended up returning it!
2,It was not the same color as it appeared in the ad!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!  The pins that hold the metal clasp pop out with minimal pressure.  There are no words for how much I wish I hadn’t purchased this band.  It was a $500+ learning experience.I did love this band...right up until I needed to replace my watch...
1,This is my Second one. I had myLast one for almost a year and it broke. I ordered a second one and every time I try to wear it I break out in a horrible rash on my wrist.
1,To many problems with this watch band to difficult to adjust to your size complicated
2,Looks nothing like the picture there is no flower pattern at all.
5,Sturdy easy to adjust. Beautiful
1,It came apart like this. If anyone knows how to assemble back together please help. Lol.It’s too big for me and I was going to follow instructions on how to take pieces out but it appears it’s just missing a link or something for it to clip back together. Bummer! Customer service refunded me though.
1,After two months of wear pin no longer stayed securely in Apple Watch face making it unusable. Worth noting I changed straps every few days which may have contributed to poor longevity. Regardless 2 months is too short!
2,Cheap quality/ hard to slide on watch face
2,Quite flimsy and much darker in person than in the picture.
5,Me gusto todo
5,love it!
2,I ordered “shining white” and this has a strong pink hue to it.
1,It’s a shame because it’s so pretty but it’s way to big. I don’t have a big hand so I don’t see how this could ever fit a women’s wrist; it dangles off the wrist. It is easy to put on and remove and does not get you arm hair stuck on the chain (one of my fears about these types of bands). But sadly had to return.
2,The pin pops out every time I try to wear this band. I’ve given up trying to fix it.
1,Clasp was broken and the pin to attach it to the watch did not catch. Also- it looks so cheap. I am surprised by all of the good reviews!
1,I was so excited to get my band. I loved the look of it and didn’t have an issue taking out two links once I read the included directions using the tool that was provided. I wore the band for approximately two hours and then it broke at the part where it slides in to the watch face. I didn’t even get a full day out of the new band. I was incredibly disappointed.
1,This looks so cheap and tacky. I purchased a similar watch from a different seller a couple years ago and was hoping this purchase would be similar quality. I was wrong. I’ve never even worn it. I refuse.
5,I love this watchband! No more sweating!You make it as loose or tight as you want by adjusting the band.Dont make it too loose otherwise it wont count your vitals.The colors are fun and look nice with outfits.The band helps to dress up the watch.I have never had one band break. I wore one band every day for 3 years without the band showing signs of wearing out. I think its one of the best materials made for a tracker watch ever. I like the product so much I have given them away as gifts.I also heard back from my friends I bought the bands for and nobody has had a allergy reaction to this band but some had allergy reactions to the rubber bands that come with the watches.Also I find for myself the bands are easy to change out.Im a buyer!
5,Love it!!
5,Love it.
1,I really loved this band! But today about 2 months after I bought it so I can’t return it now it broke! The pin that holds the band to the bracket fell out somewhere and gave me a heart attack because I thought I lost my watch! Luckily I found the watch but not the pin. So it was a waste of money.
1,DON’T BUY THIS CHEAP GARBAGE — I don’t know what caustic chemicals they used to make this band but I’ve worn it 2x now and it gave me the worst rash and blisters both times! Sending it back asap.
1,Keeps falling . Not well made . I bought this thinking it was the same I had for 3 years in white  but this  was a different brand useless because in less than an hour of uses it slides from the inserts and falls . Then I realized the good brand I had was wearlizer not this junk .!
2,Don’t like. Looks cheap pin shows Closure is so big it makes then band stiff. Don’t recommend
1,Love the look of this band but it broke after a month. Luckily I was paying attention & didn’t lose my watch!
2,I returned this band it looked really cheap. Paper thin flimsy and not worth the price.
1,If you get this it know that ends up looking duller than pictured
1,I liked this band at first but it only lasted a few weeks before it broke. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it.
1,The pins were very difficult to remove!!  Again pitiful product to which I say don’t waste your time. I started to return it but after the difficulty I had to line up the links I just tossed. Never to buy anything like that again!!!
1,This band has come apart on me twice. The first time it sent my watch flying and cracked the screen 😡. The second time was at the park and a stranger caught up to me to return my watch. Don’t waste your money!!
1,This is the 2nd time I order the band and 2nd time I’m unable to remove the links to fit my wrist. I thought the 1st was defective especially since it looked used but I was wrong. At least this 2nd band came in better packaging and seems to be new. Sending it back again.
2,It won’t stay attached to watch. One side keeps slipping out. I love the look but unfortunately will be returning it.
1,I got the tortoise stone band and the metal is gold not rose gold as advertised thus looked terrible against my rose gold watch :(
1,The band is jammed into the watch and can’t be removed. The links are impossible to reattach. This is total garbage. I am going to have to take the watch to Apple to have the band removed.Also I purchased the pink and received the gold band. Very disappointed.
1,I’m totally bummed that I couldn’t get this band to attach to my watch. It was so difficult to install. I decided to return it.
1,Band is cheap looking and not well made.  Cracked while trying to adjust the size.  Do not recommend !
1,FOUR MONTHS and the pin connection to the part that clicks into the watch rusted and snapped. I am a nurse and constantly wash my hands because i have a skin reaction to the alcohol at the hospital. Its pretty but doesnt last to my standards.
1,This was a waste of money. It lasted less than a month.  It looked great while I had it but poor quality.
1,Not comfortable and didn’t fit my wrist even though I took links out and tried to get as close as I could
1,as soon as I tried to put this on my watch it broke. I can't fix it.
1,It’s too lightweight. Feels like a cheap toy
1,They give you instructions to get the pins out to size the watch but you can’t get the pins out.  What a hassle I’m going to have to try to send it back
1,Do not buy! Almost lost my $700 Apple Watch because of this POS! Luckily a nice neighbor found it and gave it back...watch band broke shortly after purchase. Too bad it’s cute and light but dang not secure. The pins come right out!
1,38-40 was more like 42-44.  Way to big
2,Looks cute but my wrist is too skinny. Unfortunately can’t wear it with my watch.
1,
2,Was too small!!
1,This watch band is so cute but it continues to unsnap and fall apart.. this is due to poor quality.. very disappointing
1,So disappointed. I really loved this watch band and got several compliments on it! It is very lightweight yet felt very secure. I was planning to order in another color! However it broke after less than two months. It just snapped off and can’t be fixed.
1,Broke after 3 months…. This is such low quality. Don’t bother
1,It pinched and rubbed a raw spot on my wrist. Wasn’t right for me.
1,The attachment point is too large for the slots on the watch!
2,Just couldn’t not make this band work. Wrist are too small
1,Clasp broke on first day of wear. Cheap made and not like the picture at all.
1,Very cheaply made. Light plastic.
1,Poor quality. Light weight cheap plastic.
1,Because it already broke didn’t even have a four year not even six months
2,Way too big and couldn’t get adjusted.
1,Really cheap product. So cheap i was afraid that my watch would actually fall off.  It’s not comfortable at all. Not worth the money.
1,Not sure about fit really cause never could get links to come out to make it fit my wrist so waste of money
1,Unfortunately the band is small on me . It very cheap plastic .
1,To hard to adjust. I have arthritis and can’t to it. Very disappointed
1,Worst band ever
1,This is the first time I have worn this watch band and one end does not fit into the clasp.  It slides in and out and does not latch.
1,It constantly pinched my skin
1,Broke after 4 months. Apple Watch fell on cobblestone after band just fell apart. Do not recommend.
5,The comfort
1,Haven’t been able to wear it because I am unable to remove a link. It came with the tools but it doesn’t work. I have had multiple people try it and nothing. Very disappointed.
1,This watch band is a piece of junk. Cheap light plastic NOT white. It’s a pale lavender color. Maybe worth one dollar. Looks like it’s from a grab-it machine at the pizza place.
1,This band is hard plastic. Hard to remove links. Often pinched my hair hair.
1,Literally the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with! Trying to take out links so it could fit my wrist was a nightmare!!!!!  Not good quality material :(
1,Extremely hard to resize. I gave up on it and couldn’t use the band
1,I guess I should have believed when they call it “light” because it is not to my liking but if you are looking for a very light weight band- this is it
1,Looked so much more fancier and sturdy in preview... in reality very flimsy and fake looking ... sounds and is plastic.
1,Steps increase with just moving wrist.
1,not what was advertised
1,It was broke
1,I wasn’t fully happy with the product and the seller contacted me right away. The seller refunded me hassle free good customer service.
1,Felt cheap and didn’t fit my wrist
1,Looks so cheap!
1,The watch band didn’t fit my Apple Watch ..How do I return it ..
1,This product did not come with proper instructions or proper tools. I tried to return the item but never received a return label. Very disappointed.
1,Cheap quality like plastic. And worse part of it all it didn’t even for my 44mm series 5 watch! Not worth the money.
1,I didn’t like the quality so I didn’t keep it.
1,It stated that it fit the 3 series and its to big. The part u connect is way to long
1,The rose gold isn’t rose gold. It looks much more gold gold. Otherwise it’s an ok watch band.
1,The watch was supposed to be ROSE GOLD. It is just gold. Disappointed.
1,Not easy to delink and is sitting in my junk drawer.
1,It broke after only wearing it a couple of times
1,Junk! Fell apart in no time!
1,Not for big wrists sent back
1,Very cheap plastic can not get the links out even with the link removing tool
1,Returned it- very cheap quality. Not what it looked like in photos
1,Do not purchase
1,Chinese made piece of crap
1,Very poorly made and would not recommended
1,It was too big. Bummer.
1,Wasn’t good quality. Returned it the same day.
1,Broke two weeks after I bought it.
1,luce muy barato para el costo$
1,It was broken. Very disappointed!
1,Fell apartReturned
1,Hinge started rusting after a few days of wear
1,Cheaply made
2,The band is too thick. I took a link out and had to put it back in. The band is too big but with a link out too small. The white is ugly. Hideous in fact. I have a brown one from another brand I loved but it got spray paint on it. Going to look back for that. This wasn’t worth the $10 I spent.
1,I originally really liked this band. The colors were perfect and the band felt great. After maybe a month of being used the space where the pins are that hold each link to the next began to get dark. I hadn't wore it in water so the only water it ever sees is when I wash my hands which would mean minimal amount of water touched the band. Very disappointed in that. The darkness is VERY visible on this light color so now it looks bad. Spent $20 on this band that looks bad after a months use.
5,I absolutely love it. Very elegant with a “rolex” feel to it 😉
5,I received 2 of these bands as a birthday gift and was so disappointed when one of the bands had one piece that fit the 38/40 watch and one piece that fit the 42/44 watch. It was past Amazon's return window so I contacted Light Source Company and they apologized and offered to send a new band for no charge! I received the new band yesterday (only 3 days after initially contacting them) and it now has the correct sizes for both insert pieces to the watch! I have the Sunlight Ocean Blue band and the Pearl White band - both beautiful and really nice quality. I will definitely purchase from them again.
5,Absolutely love this rainbow band. Pretty and durable. Always get compliments on it.Had it for over a year now and if something happens to it I’m rebuying the same one.
5,Great gift!
5,I liked it!
5,I received the rainbow band as a gift and it is so cute. The links were easy to remove for a custom fit. It’s also made from  resin so it’s going to be great for my daily swim and it looks great with a dress. Win-win!
5,Have to my wife.
5,This is a great band. The tortoiseshell makes the watch dressier. Links were easy to remove and that process took about 5 minutes. Matches really well with my Apple series 5 gold case. Definitely worth it!
5,The colors are beautiful and the pics do not do it justice
1,UPDATE- decided to keep it and it already broke after a week. don’t waste your moneyIt’s OK. the stone flower is definitely a pink and black tortoise and not a brown and black- so keep that in mind.My wristband came with the instructions arrows facing out so I had to take the links apart and put them back together.It’s not wide enough for a 40mm watch so it looks odd. It’s also an odd width on my wrist- can’t take any more links out but it’s definitely going to slide aroundWill return
1,I bought four of these bands and fell in love with the look and feel. Easy to size and fairly easy to change out. You could wear with jeans or a dress.  Out of the four only one didn’t have this defect. On the underside next to the watch it wasn’t completely molded and it looks like it would break at anytime. I sent those three back and kept one. I am wearing it everyday and hoping it won’t break. These would be fantastic if this design/mfg flaw could be fixed.  I would buy more if they do.
2,Broke on it’s own one day after 3 days of normal at home wear while I was walking. One of the links just separated and down my watch went. Couldn’t find pieces to put back.
2,I totally liked this band but in less than a month the clasp broke. I would have lost entire watch when this happened but was at home when watch dropped to the floor. Never found the clasp that apparently broke off.  Would like to replace this item but an afraid to lose a watch.
1,Loved it want to wear it so badly but I am unable to remove the links even following the instructions is there a video that I can follow
5,I love this! I ordered the rose gold and I love it. Definitely going to order other colors to switch up. You can’t beat the price at all! I was shocked it came with a tool to remove links which was perfect because I needed to remove one. Looks expensive!
5,I have the rose gold watch and the connectors are gold instead of rose gold but it makes no difference. It's a beautiful compliment to the rose gold watch. This is probably my favorite band ever. Easy to adjust to fit my write (instructions were easy to follow). Seems very durable and will last a long time. Super classy look for dress-up or casual. Love. Love.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Muy buena calidad y se ajusta a tu muñeca le puedes quitar espabones
4,A little disappointed in the packaging it looks like someone spilled their morning coffee on it. This was a gift so I went ahead and took it out of the box and put it in something nicer. The band is OK it feels a bit flimsy I’m hoping it’s going to last
4,The watch band is an overall good value. I bought it to wear with my Iphone watch during the Summer months. The white band looks like mother of pearl-ish so it looks nice. It is plastic so works well with being outdoors and around water. The links were easy to adjust. The only flaw I think the design has is that the band shape is a little masculine for women all the links being the same size. So it is very "sporty". In my opinion if the links tapered a bit it would be a bit more feminine. But in any case I have been very happy with the product and I certainly did not feel the need to return it.
5,I absolutely Love this watch band.  It is beautiful and it exceeded my expectations.  It would be a great gift for anyone.In regard to taking out the pins it was a bit tricky at first.  The key is just to push it out in the direction of the arrow.  I was nervous about that but it was just that simple.  Now when you put back the pin pay attention to which end of the pin came out first that will make the process easier.
5,This watch band looks exactly like those heavier weight clunky watch bands but It is so light weight and comfortable! I love everything about it! And the best part is it is super easy to remove links. They send you everything you need and it was the easiest watchband I have ever tried to size!  The rose gold is a little shinier than my watch but other than that I have no complaints. Recommend!

5,Love it. Perfect band to dress up my Apple Watch. It was a little hard taking out the pieces to make it smaller because the metal kept breaking on me . I managed to get it to work so it’s good now! Comes with everything you need to add or take away pieces for adjustable sizes. Such a pretty marble color too! Would buy again !
5,It was a little big and I had to remove a couple of links but otherwise it fits and looks great!  I like being able to coordinate with my outfits!  Can't comment too much on durability because I haven't had it long but it looks and feels well made.
5,Easy to switch out and being multi colored it goes with everything. You will enjoy how it fits in with all colors you wear.

It comes with instructions and tools to resize the band length so it is guaranteed to fit your wrist securely! Great product I will probably be buying more in the future! Thank you :)
5,The band was bigger than I needed so I began to take it apart with the included tool and didn’t read the instructions (shame on me) and took it apart from the clasp which caused a challenge to put back together but it didn’t take too long I had my husband fix it. Lol it’s beautiful and so cute. Love it way more than my sport band I had for over a year. It’s definitely not as comfortable but it’s gonna go well with outfits for fall and winter.
5,I love this watch band! I’ve had it for a couple of weeks and it’s help up great so far. I’ve been wearing it during my workouts gardening going out etc. And it still looks great! I was concerned that a band like this wouldn’t give good heart rate readings during my workouts but I’ve had no issues. I adjusted it which was super easy to make it semi snug on my wrist. It has a small amount of movement which is what I wanted.The rose gold doesn’t match the rose gold Apple Watch which bothered me when I put it on. But honestly haven’t noticed since.
5,Love this watch band! I get compliments on it all the time. It is comfortable. Looks much more expensive than it was. People are often shocked that I found it on Amazon. I’ve sent the link to several friends.
5,Beautiful band. It matches my watch perfectly. It came with the tools to adjust the length and it was pretty easy to adjust. I love it and will buy other colors!
5,I've only been using this band for a couple of hours but I'm pretty impressed. It comes with tools for link removal; that definitely came in handy. Once I got it fitted it's about as comfy as a regular Apple Watch band. You can even rearrange the links for different rainbow effects if you so choose. The gloss on it is very nice as well; really gives it that quality look. 10/10 so far.

I upgraded to a larger size and gave my 38 to my daughter with the similar wristband.  It was super durable after having it for a few years and I was looking for something similar when I found this one.  I am very happy with it thus far.  Very easy to remove links and very comfortable to wear daily.  No complaints!
5,I was skeptical about the quality of this band but was pleasantly surprised! It is very cute and comfy. It even comes with a tool to help remove links to make smaller. I had remove several but it still looks like a bracelet. Cute!
5,I loved this band the minute I found it in my searches. When it arrived it was slightly too small for my large wrists. I contacted their customer support for a solution. They were so quick and helpful and sent me out extra links so I could keep my beautiful band. It’s so nice to have something a little more “dressy” than the typical silicon bands. Plus it’s not as sweaty! That’s a huge plus. I highly recommend.Color ordered: Flower Pink
5,I would take a photo but my watch is charging and so is my phone but I absolutely love this watch band. It is amazing and so light weight and durable. I looked over a lot of the comments and had some mixed reviews but now having bought this product I am in love. The tool that comes with it to remove links works amazing I was able to make the watch band fit exactly like the one I got from apple. 10/10 love this product and recommend buying this
5,I love the watch band.  It was simple to use and make adjustments for my wrist.  The tool and instruction on how to adjust the bank were included in the product.  It is a very nice-looking band and very simple to adjust.  I am truly enjoying it.  I plan to buy more bands in the very near future!  I highly recommend the product.  It is great pricing and the look and ease of the band are wonderful!
5,It's a very pretty pink color.It's easy to put on/take offOnly downside as I had to have someone at Zagg in the mall do the adjustment—was afraid I would bend/ break one of the pins. As I recall it held up well—will let you know in another 8 weeks.
5,I love the this band! I love the color and how comfortable it is.
5,Love this watch band! It took me a while to find a watch band I liked and I finally decided on this one. Very pretty in person. Very light and comfortable but feels sturdy and durable. I found it more comfortable than the rubber watch band. Links were easy to remove. I also love that the connectors were black like my watch it can be difficult to find black connectors. Plan on buying more colors.
5,I bought two different colors and l love both of them.  They were a little tight and the company sent extra links no problem.  Would recommend
5,I love the colors and look of the band- lots of compliments. Looks like it’s made of stones.  Very easy to remove and add links to have the correct size. Directions straight forward. I would buy again.
5,I like how the band can go with any clothes I wear and how comfortable it is.
5,Perfect amount of pink where it’s not too much or too tacky. Easy to adjust/remove links. Great quality.
5,I’ve been struggling with pretty watch bands that are difficult to open and close. I love the ease of this one. 💕
5,I love how cute and colorful this watch band is!  It was a little big but the instructions and tool that were included made it super simple to remove the extra link.
4,I like everything about this watchband with the exception that it is not for people with larger wrist measurements. I purchased 1 and it fit but was very snug. Too snug. I purchased a second band and used an additional link from it to adjust the fit for my wrist. It would be nice to have an option of getting additional links at a reduced price.
5,Stylist Affordable band with Easy instructions to readjust.
5,This is so cute and comparable to more expensive bands. It was easy to take the links out to make it the right size.
5,My fav band yet. Cute and durable
5,Surprisingly this is a really nice band. I wasn’t sure how good it would be best it was inexpensive but I’m impressed.
5,I love it! It was easy to remove the link so that it would fit my wrist.
5,What a fabulous watch band. So pretty adjustable links too
5,Love it. So pretty and elegant. Can’t wait to use it in my Apple Watch a5
5,This band is beautiful and super comfortable.  I got several different types before landing on this beauty. It goes with everything eye catching and its fits perfectly for my apple watch 6.  I can't speak to durability because I have only had it for 3 weeks. I am very satisfied with it.
5,Very easy to adjust to your wrist and looks nice and feels comfortable
5,Very nice textures and quality
5,Love it!
5,Very cute
5,Love the color! It was very easy to remove the extra links. Supper lightweight.
5,Beautiful colors! It matches everything and is comfortable. Also I needed an extra link and the Seller was extremely generous and responsive! I highly recommend this product and seller =}

Had to remove two links for it to fit my wrist. The instructions for removal were self explanatory and easy to follow. Would buy again.
5,Cute and versatile
5,I was really happy with this watch band. It is lightweight and adjustable. It's also very comfortable and doesn't snag your hair or skin whatsoever. In addition it looks very high quality.
5,Lightweight and beautiful color. Will likely order more! I dont have a small or delicate wristbut not large either. about 6 inches and removed two links with a comfortable fit. I have the 3 series in the smaller size. Easy to put on the watch. Not sure if the fake gold will last as only received it today
5,Very nice band for the money.
5,Finally a band that I really like! Very comfortable and stylish.
5,I’ve been looking for a versatile band like this one. I absolutely love it and recommend it.
5,My husband loves his watch band. Not too fancy or dressed down it’s just right!
4,I really like my Apple Watch band and have been getting a lot of compliments. It is very light and comfortable. Adjusting it was easy as well. I’m glad that I purchased this.
5,Love this band ! It was so easy to take links out with the tools provided ! Fits perfect !
5,Easy to remove extra links and very comfortable!
5,I love the design i buy more for sure
2,Have small wrists so I had o remove a number of the links.  The pin removal Tool included broke almost immediately.  Ultimately Could not get band to proper size and position latch at right place on wrist.  Band does look pretty though...wish I could have been able to wear it!
2,It needs to be larger it is too small
5,very good
5,It’s very beautiful and it’s easy remove especially with the kids that they sent to adjust the size. It’s very comfortable
5,Easy to adjust.
5,I highly recommend!I was looking for a band that was not to sporty and I could wear out with nicer outfits and this band is so cute.
5,I get complimented every time I wear this.  It really is beautiful and goes so well with my rose gold apple watch.
5,Very pretty! And easy to adjust the straps.
5,I’m so happy with this product!! Not only is it an overall good product but the links are EXTREMELY EASY TO REMOVE! It’s like slicing a butter knife through butter easy. I brought a watch on here and the links were so hard to remove it took me like 2 hours to remove one link.. Highly recommend.
5,very comfortable and easy to adjust
5,Super easy to resize really light and comfortable but doesn’t slide around. Not great for running but clearly not meant for that. Have gotten compliments really happy with it and would totally recommend.
5,This is the second time thinking the watch came with the band ...I do like the band but disappointed no watch sorry.
5,I wanted a pretty watch band that I could wear everyday or even out for dinner and drinks. This band delivers. Looks very pretty with rose gold Apple Watch face. I have received many compliments. (Review written by wife :))
1,Looked like a cheap kids toy.
5,Great durability and really comfortable
1,Had sharp edges. Had to return for refund.
5,Exactly as described.  Delivered quickly and easy to attach and adjust size to wrist.  So lightweight and attractive.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Well made. Provide everything needed to remove links…. I removed 3 links and it fits wonderfully.
5,My friend has a similar watch band and wanted to try it out. The fit is perfect I have a larger wrist and was afraid it was going to be too tight. but works well and it light weight and universal enough for me to wear to work or wear on my workouts.
4,I love that I can take the links out to adjust the size. It is so comfortable and cute at the same time. The links were very easy to remove and adjust.
5,Durable and nice watch band
5,I wore this to a wedding. It was beautiful. Def worth the money.
3,Liked this a lot but broke after about a month of use. Hard to attach and detach from watch if you’re alternating regularly to a sport band.
1,Cheaply made! Don’t even bother !
5,Hermosa súper recomendada
5,I was skeptical of the quality but for the price it’s really worth it! Most importantly it’s so comfortable and I receive a ton of compliments on it! Love it
5,Great purchase! It was easy to set up. Feel comfortable
5,Really nice band. It was very easy to take a link out. I love the tortoise mixed with the other colors
5,I’m obsessed and customer service was amazing.  I thought I need to remove a link and accidentally loss the replacement pin.  I reached out for extra pins and they sent me a new watch band because they were out of pins. I am very pleased!
5,Love it!
4,The band seemed nice but the color was much more purple in person than I expected.  I am returning and repurchasing another similar band that seems to be a “flatter” white.
5,This band is very pretty and is very light weight!!  It’s very comfortable!!
5,Great price and super cute. I ordered 4 or 5 of them by now.
5,It’s light weight and I love it
5,I love it. How easy is adjust the size and look so fancy. Is perfect.
5,I love the look and style of this. I was easy to size with the instructions. The picture was accurate.
5,Cute band! I ended up returning it because I found a similar color (light pink) that was less iridescent and shiny and cheaper and the same quality.
4,This watch band is great quality and cute. Unfortunately it’s too big when I put an extra link on it and too small when I take one off.
5,Beautiful watch band and awesome seller. The piece that attaches the band to the watch face came apart. I contacted the seller and not only did they send me a part to fix it they sent me another band! Amazing customer service.
5,I love it! Great comfort and durability
5,I love this!!
5,Looks great with the black watch cover . Love how easy it is to put on .
5,This is a great wrist band! It fits comfortably around my wrist. I can wear my watch all day with no issues. I love the color!
5,I’ve had it on for a few days and I like it a lot. The color is great...Easy to remove and very comfortable
4,Stylish durable plastic material. I’m just hoping the rose gold doesn’t turn black or my skin green.
5,I love my new watch band. Easy to take on and off but stays snug and in place while wearing. So cute and trendy! Probably order more styles in the future!
5,Like it. It looks really nice with my rose gold watch.
1,Broke right away.
5,Love how colorful this is and feels light weight
5,I LOVE these resin bands!! Such a great alternative to the rubber and metal band options.
4,Really happy with this band. It's fun and pretty and should hold up pretty well for the price.
4,Super cute and comfy so far but the ups dude scared the shiz out of us all 😂😂
5,Wife’s favorite band and she has a lot.
5,Pretty. Comfortable to wear
5,Great quality for the price!
4,Very nice product! Easy to adjust.
5,Very nice stile and looks great
5,Seems to be good quality fits great and so cute!
5,Love it fits well comfortable

It’s nothing wrong with the current one I have but I think it is just time to get a new one! It was so easy to adjust and so easy to put it on! Love the color too.
5,I love my band it was easy to take links off and I get so many compliments on it. So glad I got it for Christmas.
1,Bought 2 different bands and while they are beautiful they are so cheaply made I have small wrists so it’s not as if it was tight but every time I tried to put it on it would fall apart. Disappointed.
5,Love this watch band it is the perfect way to dress the watch up.
5,Pleasantly surprised.  Can’t speak to longevity or durability but looks good and is comfortable. Was a pain removing two links from each side but that’s true of any of this type of watchband. Happy to see that the pearl white was not a bright white.
5,I now have a white band and a black band because I love it so much! Definitely a great buy!
5,The band came as advertised (pictured) and I really like the design. It is comfortable and does not pinch. It is easy to close and open.It was just a little small for my wrist so I contacted the company for extra links. They responded the same day and I had additional parts in two days. Great experience!
5,I love the color. PURPLE is my favorite color..
5,Love these watch bands
5,Happy with my purchase!Good quality.
5,No dislikes
5,Great quality and fits my Apple Watch really good. It was also easy to take out links and adjust them.
5,Me encantó

It’s really pretty easy to use and easy to put on and take off. The only reason I gave 4 stars for durability is because I’ve had it for 3 days so I don’t really know how long it will last but it feels durable and I hope it lasts me a long time because I love it.
5,LOVE this band!!!  Quality is superb and at first glance you’d expect it to be an expensive band!!!  I loved it so much I bought another one for a friend!  Easy to take links in and out to adjust to fit and it comes with the kit to do so!  The rose gold hardware also matched perfectly to my Apple Watch!!  I’m a little OCD so that made my day!!  Definitely recommend!  I’ve had it for two months and it is still holding together and looks just as great as the day I got it!

5,Good watch band. Is made out of a cheap feeling plastic
5,Super cute! Comfortable fits well and easy to adjust when you follow the directions included. Will be buying another color for sure.
5,I was a bit skeptical purchasing this watch band since I’ve only used the original rubber bands. But honestly his band is beautiful and stays in place. Had to remove 2 links which was super easy.
5,I got the flower pink it's pretty & the buckle matches the rose gold watch perfectly. It was really easy to remove the 2 links and re-assemble the band. it fits and looks great! It took me a second to figure out how to fasten it but now it's really easy to do. I already ordered another color my only criticism is I wish they would offer more colors with the rose gold buckle.
5,Love this belt. The colors are really nice for my rose gold watch and look as nice as more expensive belt. So glad that I purchased this
5,This band is beautiful!!

It’s plastic but thick so unsure about how durable it will be. Other reviewers did mention this could be a problem. So far so great!

5,I always get asked about this watch!
5,The sections where easy to remove to adjust width to fit my wrist. Love the white it goes with everything and classes-up my watch for fancier outfits.
4,I really like the band only issue is that the metal clasp tends to rub on my wrist
5,Easy to remove clamp.  Resistant I have dropped my watch and no chips.  Looks great with casual looks
5,I love this band. It is very comfortable.
5,I get many compliments on this band every-time I wear it.
5,buenos
5,I am in absolute love with this band. I have gotten nothing but compliments because of it and everyone I know wants one. I highly recommend!
5,I have lots and this is my new favorite. I have a 17” wrist and was easily able to remove enough links so the band fits well. Great buy!!!
5,Looks just like the picture. Love it!! ❤️ Came with the best sizing tool. Better than the one I bought. Can’t say enough positive things!!!!!!
5,You won’t regret it! Love this new strap for fall !
5,This is good quality. It comes with everything you need to create a comfortable custom fit. It is beautiful! Highly recommend.
5,Very good looking light-weight easy to size and a good value
5,I have purchased several style bands this one is by far my everyday favorite band. Very light weight takes a few hits. Love the color
5,Classy light durable & love it
5,work in a warehouse and this band is VERY STURDY. It’s also super stylish and I’ve received a ton of compliments on it totally love it!
4,I really like the style of this watchband.  There is one problem though.For those with smaller diameter wrists like mine it is very hard to attach the 2nd side once the first side if on.The bracelet design (which is nice) doesn't allow for the band to turn as it needs to to slide the 2nd side into the groove easily (again for smaller diameter wrists) without putting a lot of strain and torque on the band closer to the first side that is already attached.A different way to secure the band other than the bracelet style would be ideal.Not sure if I'm keeping it because of this...I'm doubtful it will last long with that type of tension and torque on the band often (change out for band to exercise in change back to wear this one casual/dress).If your wrist is a larger diameter this may not be a problem.
5,Love this watch band super cute

5,Beautiful watch band. Sturdy and well made. There are many designs to choose from. I’m going to order at least one more for variety.
5,I just got this watch band in the mail today & these photos are just after opening. I can say it’s very nice & it was easy to remove/add links. I can’t speak to its durability just yet but it doesn’t feel cheap. Hope it works out for me since I’ll be wearing this to work.
5,It’s good quality and I love the color
5,I really like the color I will wear this band a lot!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Got this watch band cause the rubber ones were giving me rashes from trapping water underneath on my skin. This band doesn’t give me that issue. It’s got a nice design. It’s comfortable and definitely durable. I hit it off stuff all the time lmao. The only difficult part was removing some of the pieces to make it smaller. It took me a second but I figured it out and now it fits great.
5,Love the way you can adjust the band. It’s easy to take off & also easy to put on.
5,The color was as pictured.
5,Love the look !!
5,So it was Too big at first and I fixed it but i absolutely love it
5,Love it
5,Beats the $55+ that Instagram was trying to sell me! So glad I found this!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a super cute comfortable lightweight band. I will definitely be purchasing in another color. It was very easy to remove a few links. My favorite color and goes with everything .
5,Easy to remove links!
5,This watch band is so easy to put on and take off. Very pretty also. I have gotten compliments how pretty it is.
5,So comfortable.  Was able To remove 4 links to fit my waist — watched videos on how to remove links.  Love the style and look.  After purchasing 1st watch band I bought a 2nd one.
5,Great quality

5,Dressed my Apple Watch up so perfectly! Love it so far
5,I will totally buy more of these in the future. It's a good item and fashionable!
5,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She wears it daily.
5,Very pretty
5,Love the style!
5,This is gorgeous!! I love that it came with all the tools and clear instructions. I will from here forward only order from this company for my watch bands. Exceeded my expectations!
5,This band not only looks stylish it’s very comfortable and much easier to put on than the original Apple Watch band. I’m more than happy with this purchase. Love it!
5,Color matched my starlight 7 perfect easy to adjust so far it’s been holding up Very lightweight comfortable and fashionable! It looks great. I like it. If it continues to hold up I’ll be getting the rainbow color in the next😁
5,This watch band looks so classy.  It is comfortable and easy to put on and take off. I also purchased a white trimmed in gold face cover to take it up a notch.  Many compliments already.
5,The colors are really pretty in person!!! They are bright but not garish. It’s much lighter than most other bands too so it’s good for smaller wrists. I hope it holds up after time. For now I am really happy with it.
5,There is absolutely nothing that I don’t like about this watch band! If you like this style of band you will like it too. I’m thinking about ordering it in a different color.
5,The band looks as it appears in the photos. Super cute and compliments the rose gold Apple Watch nicely. I am wearing it through workouts and no issues with quality I’ve had it about a month. A little tricky to remove extra links but it comes with little tools to do so but honestly I think this is always tricky. Totally would buy again.
5,Very pretty and fits great. Comes with a kit to take pieces out for sizing.
5,Love this watch band it's very comfortable.
2,This Apple Watch band gave me a rash that I cannot get rid of so I'm probably going to have to see a dermatologist now because it's been a couple weeks and it's getting to be pretty bothersome. Should have looked at the reviews a little more closely. There are other reviews stating the same happened to them as well. Buyer beware.
5,I love it! It’s great quality and looks so beautiful. It reminds me rose quarts. Super cute.
5,Perfect choice
5,This watch band is nice and colorful for spring and summer.  Very easy to size.
5,Love how easy it was to put on my watch. Came with the tools to remove the extra links so it fits perfectly!
5,Very lightweight super cute
5,Absolutely in love with this purchase!!!! It looks great on! It also comes with the tool to adjust the band and easy to follow instructions which was the best part! I ordered the same product on a different site and paid twice as much and it didn’t come with the tool to adjust the band which is why I came to Amazon to order another. I wish I would’ve never bought it else where and I came here first.
5,Beautiful well made
5,This is the second color I’ve purchased. Love them!  The colors are vibrant and it wears light and easy.  Planning to purchase more colors.
5,Super light weight as if your not wearing anything. Suits my aluminium case and easy to adjust straps
5,I love this band. It was really easy to put on my Apple Watch.
5,Really nice and light !  Beautiful colors look like a sea shell
4,I like this product because it is durable and easy to clean. Among the other similar products. This one have a fair price.
5,For the price it’s attractive and durable. Extra links were easy to remove. 😁
4,Uncomfortable and difficult to assemble
5,Good qualityLooks niceWould buy again
5,Just like the Photos and very good quality.
5,This watch band is one of the best ones I've purchased! It is super easy to adjust. Comes with everything you need to do so. Highly recommend!
5,I love this band. I had to take out a couple links with no problem as it came with the tool. It is very sturdy and I get a lot of compliments. Would purchase again if needed.
5,I ordered this over a month ago. Very pleased with durability thus far. Gets lots of compliments. May order the lighter color as well.
5,Great band!
5,I love this watch band so much I think I might buy  another one in a different color.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had to remove 2 links for fitting and it was very simple to do it. It’s light and smooth. So far great quality!
5,Good quality
5,Love the colors!! Had to take out a few links…tool came in very handy!!! My wrist is small so it’s not the perfect fit keeps moving and not the most comfortable but I still enjoy wearing it!
5,Love love this band! Get compliments on it all the time. Comfy and durable. Very pretty especially when the sunlight hits the pink. Would buy again. Had it for almost a year and holding up great. Easy to take links out if needed.
5,Even I could change my band and removed a link with a little help from my son!  The resin keeps it lightweight and pretty!
5,I love it! So easy to use and to adjust to your preference
5,This is so cute! I thought it was easy to remove links. It makes the apple watch look cute and more professional! I have had no problems with it
5,My wife loves the appearance and its coordination with the rose gold of the iWatch case.  Sizing with by link removal was straight forward using the supplied link removal tool.  We have not had the article sufficiently long to comment on durability.  It does seem substantial however.
5,I like the weight of the bracelet the closure which is easy for me to fasten. And I like how it looks on my wrist. I am ordering it in another color now! I highly recommend.
5,I've had this watch band for a while and it has lasted me. It looks great and holds great. I would 100% re purchase it!!
5,This is absolutely gorgeous.  Level up my Apple Watch series 6… it’a super easy to install and fit my wrist exactly how I like without having to remove any lengths.  If you did need to remove lengths they’ve included a tool to do so. Unfortunately I can’t speak to how easy it might be to make that adjustment because I didn’t need to but it’s very thoughtful of the vendor to provide the tools and instructions.  It’s exactly the right shade of gold to match my watch and the ivory tortoise shell is so stylish and feminine.  I am in love with it!!
5,I loved the picture of this band but it looks even better when you get it. Unfortunately I have super tiny wrists and this type of band doesn't work perfectly.  My husband removed 4 slots. He said they were very easy to remove or ad slots. He firstly remove 5 pieces but that proved too small to pass through my hand. so he added one piece back and now it's fine just a bit too large for my wrist still fine for me
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Update after 2.5 months:SO IMPRESSED with this watch band. I have been doing some hardcore working out and running and this watchband has stated in place and stood up to sweat rain workouts-you name it! Looks pretty and couldn’t be happier!This watch band is beautiful and I love it already! Super easy to take out some links (I took out 3 of them) and so far very comfortable. I’m curious to see how it will feel when I am running and working out but very impressed and looks much more expensive than  it is!
5,At first a little big. Followed the instructions on how to remove a link. Did so and now wear with pride. Really nice. Fits perfectly now.
5,it was super easy to take out the pins to adjust. and looks cuter than the kate spade one that doesn't adjust.recommended!
5,Ce bracelet est parfait pour la Apple Watch 38mm. Féminin et beau design !
5,This is a beautiful watch band. It's unique and very comfortable to wear. The more I look at it the more I like. I really like the clasp it feels very secure and it's easy to put on. It was very big for me but it comes with a tool and instructions to remove links now it fits perfectly.
5,I bought this strap to make my apple waTch more attractive. It also was nice over the summer as it didn’t get too warm like the band the watch came with. Classy looking and affordable!
5,Love the way it fits and looks ordered another one in a different color as wellDoesn’t make my wrist sweet like the plastic styles do and way more secure.
5,The watchband looks beautiful. The removal of segments to adjust was easy and straightforward to complete.Great product!
5,I love this watch band. It is light weight and easy to wear. I bought it to replace my metal one that was super heavy. This has been on my watch since I ordered it and holds up well too.
5,Love the colours!!  Bought this same product before in a different colour.  Liked it enough to buy a second one in a different colour.
5,My band came in in less than the expected shipping time which was great! It looks super cute and I've been using it tons since I've received it. The tool to remove links is included with instructions about how to change the size as well
5,Absolutely love it! I cannot speak for durability as I just received it but it’s a beautiful band! I bought it for my series 5 and it fit perfectly. Instructions were also very easy to follow for link removal. Very light weight and fashionable. Shipping was also incredibly quick (free one day shipping😁).
5,Very beautiful and reasonably prices product even provided tool to make it small and big. As per your individual needs. I must recommend to all female buyers to have one in their collection.
5,Best wrist band for Apple Watch. Fits perfectly and great contrast with 42mm. Good quality and comfortable to wear.
5,I loved my new Apple 6Series band it's so sophisticated! Really beautiful and gave to my smart watch a new and nice look :)Easy to install and remove and even to take out 2 links was all in the box tool instructions etc... took me 5 minutes.Wonderful! what to say about the price!? wow!!!
5,I have a nickel allergy and the band that came with the Apple Watch triggered an allergic reaction. This band has a stainless steel clasp which is perfect for me.  Love it.  Thanks
3,Love the watch band but unfortunately I had a severe skin reaction to the band!
5,Love this! Colour as shown in the picture. Lightweight and still practical enough to wear during a workout. Transitions easily between gym and office!
5,Very cute! Easy to change!I bought one pink for myself and a friend!The metal matched quite well.
3,Love the colour I choose so far no problems so hoping it will last up to daily wear.
5,This is a really good apple watch band that is way cheaper than the actual apple brand bands but just as good. Save your money and get these instead!
3,Feels plastic and is very thin even I ordered the 42/44 version. Looks weird against the watch but it is functional and doesn’t break.
5,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch band!!! It’s so beautiful and so light on my wrist and the colours are perfect with my rose gold watch. Thank you for providing this item!
5,this is a very nice band.  No pinching or hair pulling.  with a solid closure
1,It was a really nice watch but poorly constructed.  The pin popped out right away when putting the watch on the apple face and when put back in it would pop right out and broke.  So Now it’s broken.  I wouldn’t buy it again.
5,This is the prettiest watch band .  I have had many compliments on it .  Comfortable and goes with so many things
1,Felt like plastic I returned it. If you want a light weight watch band this is definitely for you. It felt cheap and definitely was not Stainless Steel
5,Very fast delivery as described and easy to adjust
5,love it！It was very cute and light weight
3,Not enuff instructions for this
2,Colours aren’t true to the pictures. Sending back for a refund.
5,Fits ok. Easy to remove links. I bought the blue version
5,So much better than the sport straps. Gives it a dressy look
5,This is such a nice watch band. Looks great with my rose gold watch. I have a bigger wrist but still fits nice. Very comfortable. Good quality.
5,Love this product it looks so good  with my watch and super fast shipping
5,I loved the strap. It’s extremely comfortable and stylish. Good value for money
5,Easy to install and looks really nice.  As shown
1,Band is very beautiful but one connector does not lock into place. Was so excited to have a “dressy” band but disappointed that I’m unable to wear it would risking it coming off my wrist and damaging my watch.
5,Beautiful colour and pattern easy to adjust comfortable loving this watchband.
1,Trop petit dommage pas de choix pour la grandeur très beau et léger
1,Really disappointed with watch band. All cheap plastic. Fell apart within a week. Just lucky I did not loose my watch. This will be going back to seller.
2,They look nice but I spent an hour trying to remove a link and gave up.  Sent it back.
5,Really cute and so comfortable! Extremely light weight!
5,Really like. Took some doing to get kinks out
5,Bought this because I wanted a pretty inexpensive watch band.  Works great.
5,I liked the product that I purchased as a gift. Everything is OK so far. It looks beautiful adds a "fancy" dimension to a utility item as the watch.
5,Légèreté
4,Cute.
5,Very nice and light weight. Looks better in person.
5,Beautiful. Ended up ordering 2 more as gifts!

5,I like my new watch band
1,The bracelet was to small I returned it
5,Light weight
5,Nice looking
4,Light and comfortable but a bit tricky to install and remove compared to other Apple Watch bands
4,Optisch sehr gutLeider keine Verstellmöglichkeit am Verschluss
1,le look fait cheap
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’ve been looking for a nice tortoise shell strap for my Apple Watch for a while. This is perfect colour and easy to change the wrist size with the tools that are provided.The down side is that the top adaption to secure the strap seems to not fit securely. If you see the video the bottom clipped in fine but the top is slightly big for the screen. I won’t be able to wear it like I currently do incase I lose my watch however ok for shprt periods
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Sehr schönes Uhrband bin ganz begeistert. Ist sehr leicht und das ist meiner Meinung nach wichtig wenn man die Uhr den ganzen Tag trägt. 5+ Sterne. Es war auch ein set dabei damit man die Glieder entfernen kann falls das Band zu lange ist. Jederzeit gerne wieder ☺️
5,This is a watch strap I had on other regular watches and I loved it the strap is so very light in weight and it does not stick to your skin(can’t stand that!) so when I got my I-watch I wanted that kind of strap again.  When I received my order  I was so pleased this was exactly what I wanted finally no more silicone bands!!  I immediately attached the new strap and absolutely loved the neutral colour I put it on and :( it was snug.  Now I’m disappointed this was truly what I wanted so I sent the seller a note asking if they could send me a couple of extra links so as to enlarge my strap and I was willing to pay for these parts.  Let me tell you this company went above and beyond and I know there are other companies that could take lessons from this seller.  Within 1 day my issue was resolved via email with them sending me another strap (for parts) within 2 days at “No Charge”.  I couldn’t be happier.  There seems to be so few companies that genuinely appreciate their customers that I had to inform you that this one is legit.
5,Love this watch band. Super light and comfortable. Doesn’t pinch like many metal ones. Matches my rose gold Apple Watch perfectly. Colours are very pretty. Goes with everything. Bought it for winter travel for in and out of the pool. Anxious to see how it holds up over time.Update... had this almost a year and love as much as the day I bought it. By far my favourite band!
5,Can adjust strap to your wrist size very simple to do with the tools provided love how it’s a clasp strap easy to take on and off
5,I waited a few weeks to test out this band before writing a review and I have to say - I LOVE IT. It really dresses up the Apple Watch to another level and is very durable (I’ve worn it everyday with my hands in water and it’s held up wonderfully). I love the colours too...makes the watch look a bit more feminine and less sporty even though I wear this band when working out as well. Overall if you were hesitating on purchasing this band I would say it’s 100% worth it!
5,Looks and feels very high quality. It was big on me but removing links was very easy. I have a gold case on my Apple Watch but the original gold aluminum matches pretty well with the rose gold on the band. Also the band does lock into place on the Apple Watch 5!
5,Very pretty band. I have been wearing it all day everyday for the last 3-4 weeks and it has held well so far. Adjusting the band was super easy as per the instructions. The clasp makes it super easy to take it on and off super convenient. Overall the quality feels cheap but it works fine and looks great for rough use. Might purchase the other colour variants they sell in future!
3,I bought this thinking I would be getting something good but tbh it was not the best quality. It felt very cheap almost plastic so I have returned it.
5,I don’t have words for how much I love this band. I ordered this one and another silicone one as I expected this one to not be as comfortable. To my surprise it’s more comfortable than the silicone band and the color is Beautiful. Photos don’t do this band justice. The clasp feels good quality. It was very easy to remove the extra links and customize size. This band is absolutely worth it. I wish they had more colots.
4,I wanted to love this band so badly! I ended up returning it because it just didn’t fit. I have a 5” wrist and the size of the links themselves are just too big to accommodate me. If I removed 3 it was still too big. If I removed 4 it was too tight. The actual band itself is absolutely stunning. Looks very luxe and classic! It’s also very lightweight and would be comfortable for a long period of time. Heartbroken it didn’t work for me!
4,This is a beautiful watch band for the more recent IWatch models.  It looks perfect with the rose gold coloured watches.  The reason I’ve not chosen five stars is because the first band had a broken section on the inside of the band.  I believe though that it is a durable band and will not scratch easily.  I do not hesitate to recommend this watch band.
5,Super schönes Band dass bisher auch hochwertig wirkt!
4,I’m really happy with this. The fit is great for my wrist. For those with bigger wrists than mine I think it would beneficial to have one or two extra links cause it didn’t come with any extras. I also think a small satchel or case to keep the extra screws and tool would be a nice touch. But overall I love the look and feel of it. The colour is true to the picture.
5,Me gusta todo de la pulsera del reló cómoda fácil de quitar y poner y muy bonita
1,I really liked the look of this strap though it was lighter weight then I was expecting.... BUT IT GAVE ME A RASH!! thought at first maybe it was too tight so I let the rash clear and added another clasp in but AGAIN a rash with less then 24hrs wear... i’m the process of returning.
5,Really pleased with strap it’s  light weight a was easy to talk a link out….would buy again
1,Received 5 days ago put it on the watch watch easy. I’ve worn it 3 days and it’s already breaking (see photo). Don’t waste your money on poor quantity.
5,Amazing. Fits great after removing a few links. It’s great that it comes with the tool. Very easy to use. So comfortable and doesn’t stick to your skin. Best $30 ever spent. Way better than the band provided by apple! Makes the watch look so much nicer.
5,I have the rose gold watch and this band looks amazing with it. The picture doesn’t do it justice.  Glad I bought it.
5,Livraison rapide. Bonne qualité
5,I had seen this watch strap advertised on Instagram from some overpriced website selling them for £35+. I thought there is absolutely no chance I am spending that much on a plastic watch strap when I like to chop and change them frequently to go with my outfits or activities.Decided to have a look on good old Amazon to see if I could find something similar and lo and behold found the exact same item for about half the price! Bargain.I have used the tool that came with the watch strap to remove a few links. The process is really easy to do if you follow the direction of the etched arrows on the inside of each segment.
5,I love my new watch strap so nice and comfortable. Paired with the Swarvoski crystal watch frame really added a fresh punch to my Apple Watch.  Very pleased
5,Il vient avec un outil pour enlever les mailles ou en ajouter pour l’ajustement.
5,A nice change from the usual sports bands and something more dressy. Had to remove a few links but relatively easy. Already considering another in a different colour!
3,The band changed colour and now looks dirty at all times. Not happy because I really liked the creamy white colour that it was when I first got it.
5,I do not like wearing my Apple Watch do so out of necessity and have tried numerous straps all of which I found uncomfortable until now!!! This strap is lightweight secure easy to adjust looks fab and super comfortable I love it!!!! Definitely recommend these
5,Très facile à ajuster. Les outils sont pratiques pour enlever des mailles. Mon colis est arrivé à la date prévue
5,Love the colour! It matches perfectly with my rose gold Apple Watch!!
5,I love this Apple Watch band! My order actually came sooner than I expected and the band looks even nicer in person.
1,I wore it one day and the band is already broken. Really disappointed. I loved the look and the weight.
5,Easy to install and adjust the size. Colour is a milk white with specks of rose.
5,Arrived fast and as ordered. Exactly what I was looking for to have a classy look with my apple watch!
5,The band was somewhat difficult to put together take apart to get the right size. Took a better part of an hour. Since the clasp is a clasp that is clipped together already and you just snap it it comes off the watch together. Which is a little hard to slide on and off. But doable. Once on it fits perfectly and it’s super light and comfortable. My new favourite!
1,The colours do not match.
3,Honestly really cheap quality this won’t last long as the clip is already giving me hassles and it’s only day 1. Wouldn’t recommend at all.
5,I love love love this. My go go gadget looks fancy now 😂
5,I love the colour! I like that it doesn’t feel cheap; and the fit is excellent!! Easy to add or remove links!
5,Love this band. Looks great with the Apple Watch gold.  It is very comfortable I even still wear this band for working out.  Doesn’t seem damaged or bothered by sweat so far 🙌
1,Very flimsy and the color is way off. I ordered white not beige
5,Love the tortoise color! Easy to adjust and install. Very comfortable to wear and odor-free too! Nice copper colored buckle matched my rose gold case. Will be ordering another color.
5,Super comfy and looks great. The links are a little challenging to change but once you get them out the strap goes back together no problem. The clasp feels sturdy and stays closed really tight. I’ve had some watch straps just pop open with the wrong movement and this one is great
5,Absolutely love this band!! So comfortable and beautiful!
5,Love love love this band!!  The blue is so elegant and different.
5,Cute watch band - rose quarts colour
2,The band doesn’t irritate my wrist like some have. It’s comfortable. I’ve gotten many compliments on it as well.  However it’s only lasted 6 months of light wear.
5,Great Apple Watch band! I bought it for my sister and she absolutely loves it. Very elegant looking but perfect for everyday. Be prepared for several compliments!
4,Easy to install and remove
1,Too plasticky but it was attractive.
4,It's hard to find a good match for the rose gold apple watch and after trying so many I'm going to settle for this one.In the picture you can see its more of a yellow gold.Other than that the band is comfortable and the instructions are easy.
5,the colour is gorgeous looks rich and it’s super comfortable
5,I didn’t love this watch strap very light weight feels a bit cheap for the money.
5,As advertised easy to make smaller.
5,Really easy to attach to the watch and comes with tool to remove links if needed.
5,Mir gefällt das Armband sehr gut. Ich fand den Preis erst sehr hoch aber bin jetzt froh es bestellt zu haben.
5,Love this product!
5,Love it.
4,Excellent
5,
5,Je l’adore !
5,Good quality
1,Very bad quality
5,Really pretty watch strap . Easy to take out the links to adjust the size of the strap.
5,Adore
3,Ich hatte das Armand für meine letzte Apple Watch. Sieht edel aus. Jetz hatte ich ein neues bestellt. Leider passt das Armband aber nicht auf die Apple Watch 7
4,I like the colours! Easy to remove links.
5,The colour did not disappoint it’s beautiful! Plus I was able to remove links easily. They included extra pins so that was nice too. I wear it daily right now and would definitely buy this again and other colours. :)
4,Allerdings hab ich das Problem mit der Großen Anpassung entweder zu groß oder zu klein.Ansonsten gefällt mir das Armband vom Design fühlt sich auch leicht am Handgelenk an
5,Looks great! Exactly what I wanted and is light weight .
5,Good comfort fit
5,Uhrenband ist wirklich sehr schön mit der Anleitung kan man sofort die Glieder perfekt raus geben und individuell anpassen.Mein Problem hier ist leider das es mir entweder zu eng oder zu locker ist. Ich müsste ein halbes Glied sozusagen rausnehmen können das ist der einzige Minuspunkt.
5,Really like this watch strap it fits me perfectly out the box it also comes with little tools to take out the pins so you can make it bigger or smaller very comfortable. I do think it’s a little over priced though as I have brought another on eBay for £9.89 so if you want one cheaper get one on eBay 😂.
5,Had to remove a few links easy task as came with correct tool looks amazing with Rose Gold Apple watch
3,Das Band gefällt mir optisch gut und ist angenehm zu tragen.Leider ist auch hier das rosé nicht identisch mit dem der Applewatch.Schade dann wären es 5 Sterne - so suche ich dann doch weiter nach dem perfekten Band. ;)
5,I get so many compliments on this. I find the sport strap irritates my skin so always use third party straps as they’re cheaper. This is stylish and eye catching.
5,I can now mix and match my straps togo with my outfits.
4,Sent this back as advertised as whiteAlthough very nice it is cream coloured and didn’t go with anything else I have
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very good quality and very easy to fix it. ( had to make it smaller it was super easy to do it)
4,Sieht schön aus aber ist aus Plastik also sehr leicht und nicht richtig einstellbar es ist mir entweder zu groß oder zu klein Dörfer gibt es da nicht
4,Das Produkt überzeugt durch Qualität und Design. Es passt gut zur iwatch7 und sieht nicht billig aus
5,Das Armband war mir etwas zu groß ließ sich aber ganz unkompliziert verkleinern! Ich trage es seitdem tagtäglich. Es ist ein sehr angenehmes Material und lässt sich durch den praktischen Verschluss sehr schnell an- und ablegen! Das Armband ist optisch wunderschön! Es sind so tolle Farben enthalten! Ich habe schon sehr viele Komplimente dafür bekommen! Ich werde mir auf jeden Fall noch weitere Armbänder in anderen Farben davon kaufen!
4,J’ai cassé mon prétendent bracelet pendant les vacances qui n’était pas du tout dans le même style. Mais celui ci est vraiment plus classe et agréable à porter. A voir dans le temps si rien ne se casse et si le fermoir tien.
4,Bon bracelet fantaisie de qualité! Bien solide facile à ferme possibilité de régler la taille du bracelet facilement grâce à l'outil fourni dans la boite.Couleur plutôt blanc cassé que blanc blanc.Pas top pour le sport car le bracelet ne "colle" pas à la peau.
4,J’ai commandé ce bracelet il y a plusieurs semaines déjà et je le porte tous les jours ou presque.Il est super joli il fait son effet pour cet été.Par contre niveau taille je suis entre deux mailles. Du coup je le porte court et le soir je peux le trouver trop serré.
5,Llevo usándola como un mes y he de decir que me ha encantado. La original que traía el Apple Watch que es como de silicona me provocaba alergia en la piel y esta sin embargo me va estupendamente. Es cómoda y ligera (y muy bonita).
5,Macht einen sehr guten Eindruck und für den Preis absolut super. Werkzeug zum Kürzen des Armbands ist mit dabei. Pfeile auf den Gliedern geben an wie man sie zu lösen hat.Das Muster ist wie auf den Bildern zu erkennen und sieht wirklich schön aus. Der Roséton kommt dem der Apple Watch sehr nahe.
4,Die Farbe des Armbands ist zwar nicht weiß sondern je nach Lichteinfall ein heller Fliederton oder perlweiß. Aber es ist sehr gut verarbeitet lässt sich problemlos kürzen der Verschluss ist perfekt. Es trägt sich sehr gut. Über die Haltbarkeit kann ich jetzt noch keine Aussage treffen. Ich bin trotz der Farbabweichung sehr zufrieden und kaufe voraussichtlich ein weiteres in einer anderen Farbe.
4,Molto bello e leggero sebbene in plastica.Una stella in meno perché se la misura non va bene a questo prezzo bisognerebbe avere in dotazione il kit per avere la possibilità di levare qualche maglia. A mio marito è andata bene quindi polso medio maschile (22cm) ma lo volessi io come si fa?? Peccato. Specie a questo prezzo. Ci sono in vendita altri bracciali in acciaio (non plastica) con i quali si riceve tutto il kit completo di perni nuovi e strumenti per stringere il bracciale.
5,Das Armband hat eine wirklich gute Qualität. Es passt super zur rosegoldenen Apple Watch 6 und sieht sehr schick aus. Der Schliessmechanismus funktioniert gut und bis jetzt nach mehr wöchigen Tragens sind noch keine Abnutzungserscheinungen erkennbar.
5,lightweight fitting colour light on the wrist - very recommendable
5,Very nice stylish band and even comes with an accessory to resize. Overall very happy 🥰
5,Le bracelet est très léger c’est du plastique mais il fait vraiment son effet. Il est très joli et habillé vraiment bien l’Apple Watch. Je ne l’ai que depuis 2 jours donc je peux témoigner de sa solidité. Il est vendu avec l’outil pour enlever des maillons si nécessaire
5,Preis/ Leistung für das Uhrenband ist okay und Tragekomfort ist angenehm.
5,Excellent value for money fits perfect on my Apple Watch great piece of kit even comes with a watch tool to remove links highly recommended and would most definitely buy again.
5,Absolutely thrilled with this strap really pretty  light and soooooo easy to make it smaller took me seconds. I also bought a rose gold watch face for my Apple Watch to go with this strap. Perfect
5,Great strap! I life the colour the quality and it came with a strap resizing kit which is fab. Really comfortable too!
4,Très beau bracelet et de qualité par contre pas facile a installé ! Mais je recommande quand même !
4,Bit fiddly and difficult taking the links out tofit my small wrist but looks fantastic now it fits
2,Habe das den Produktfotos nicht entnommen dass es so rosa ist. Dachte das wäre eher weiß daher geht es leider zurück.
4,Super schönes Armband und einfach zu kürzen. Sieht richtig edel aus & ist ganz Leicht. Das einzige was mich etwas stört ist der extreme Unterschied zum Silber von der Apple Watch aber das ist bei allen Armbändern ja so. Aber trotzdem super schön & werde es behalten
3,Mich hat die Qualität und das Aussehen des Armbands für meine Watch leider nicht überzeugt.Deswegen ging das Armband zurück.Schade eigentlich auf dem Foto sah es gut aus.
5,Ich finde das bunte Gliederarmband perfekt. Es ist leicht schön bunt und passt zu jeder Apple Watch. Ich habe es auf einer silberfarbenen SE.
3,Plutôt  bon produit  léger  simple a régler avec l’outil fournis. Toutefois avec une utilisation quotidienne il a fallu que je remplace des maillons en 3 semaines seulement.  En effet les maillons en plastique se fissurent au niveau des tiges qui lient les maillons. Qui dit fissure dit casse. Donc faire attention à l’état des maillons assez régulièrement si vous ne voulez pas potentiellement perdre votre montre.
5,Sehr schönes Armband :)Modern und schlicht.Größe kann angepasst werden.
5,This bracelet is beautiful and looks more expensive than it really is. Links are super easy to remove. Great product
5,Bought for my mother she likes it. Looks nice better than the standard apple watch straps. She has said is comfortable.
2,Leider recht billig gemacht und sehr leicht
5,You need to watch the video and have good dexterity to fiddle with the tiny screwdriver and little bar to remove the unneeded links 3 as I have a small wrist. It looks lovely on and feels very comfortable.
5,Sieht genau so aus wie auf den Fotos. Man konnte das Armband ganz leicht selbst kürzen. Sitzt super 👍
5,I cannot stop talking about this strap!!! Not only does it look really expensive it’s also extremely comfortable! Not to mention the absolutely amazing customer service I received. I needed a few links extra and the company sent it out to me within a day as I was moving house and on a time constraint. Received so many compliments already and my sisters have ordered themselves different colours of the same strap!
5,Passt super zu dem Roségold. Das Wechseln bzw. Entfernen der Glieder geht problemfrei und ist auf der Anleitung sehr gut dargestellt. Es ist schön leicht und sehr angenehm am Handgelenk.
5,Première fois que je commente un produit ! Beau bracelet reçu dans les temps. Très satisfaite de cet achat et le rendu est tout simplement top ! Je recommande vivement et vais certainement en commander un autre pour varier les couleurs selon les tenues.
5,Passt und sieht gut aus
5,The strap is easy to adjust the length so easy when taking off and on.Great looking with the watch.
5,Really pleased with this watch strap. Looks great very good quality light weight and super comfortable and easy to put on and take off. Worth the price in my opinion. Easy to adjust with the tool that came with it as needed to take a couple of links out to fit neatly around my wrist. It fits perfectly with my series 1 Apple Watch.  Really tempted to get more colours. Would highly recommend.
5,Se pone fácil y se pueden quitar los eslabones para hacerlo más pequeño es resistente y se ve bonito y llama la atención de las personas que este modelo de correa no está muy visto para I watch.
5,
1,Erst war ich total begeistert aber den dem ich mir einige Male die Hände gewaschen habe sah ich das die Verbindungsstücke aus Metall komplett schwarz geworden sind. Das sieht echt unschön aus.
5,Un pulso de muy buena calidad el diseño es tal cual se ve en las imágenes. Lo tengo ya hace tiempo y hasta ahora no presenta el mas mínimo desgaste supongo que todo va en el cuidado. Muuuuuy recomendado!
4,Kunstharzarmband für Apple-Watch passt sehr gut und trägt sich auch sehr gut. Beim anbringen des Armbands ist etwas Geduld gefragt. Rutscht nicht so gut rein. Preis ist ok.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lo adoro! Colori molto vividi come da foto la qualità sembra molto buona.Arriva ben imballato nella sua scatolina contenente istruzioni (in inglese) con fotografie molto chiare e dettagliate e attrezzo per allungare o accorciare il cinturino.Molto molto soddisfatta!
5,Muy recomendable.Me ha sorprendido mucho muy bonita
5,Il est vraiment très  beau le bracelet mais reste à voir la finition dans le temps
5,Arrived before the expected delivery date. Lovely strap. Easy to alter. So lightweight. Will defo be ordering another one
5,I really like this strap. It’s comfortable looks nice (I’ve had quite a few compliments) & doesn’t look cheap.I had to remove 3 links which was very easy to do.It’s easy to put on and remove & feels secure on my wrist.
5,Really love the watch strap and it was super easy to remove a couple of links.
5,A very nice watch strap
5,Easy to take links out and looks nice
5,Love the Pearl and it looks prettier in real life. It feels really light but is good quality. Completely changed the look of my Apple Watch and super easy to remove links with the tool provided.
5,Sehr schönes und arbeitsfestes band. Die Qualität ist super. Trotz meiner Arbeit sieht es noch immer aus wie neu. Trage es jetzt schon 3 Monate. Es sieht auch sehr schön aus. Lohnt sich wirklich 👍🏼
5,Great strap easy to adjust pastel colours are lovely I’ve had lots of compliments would definitely recommend.
4,Queda bonita puesta
5,Très contente de mon achat ce bracelet est très joli et chic !Très bel effet au poignet je recommande.
5,Easy to replace the watch strap with the tools included (so you can customize the fit of the band).  It's easy and wearing well!  Thinking about buying another!
5,Very easy to put on and removed
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me ha gustado el diseño y es una pulsera muy cómoda. Además se adapta a cualquier medida de muñeca fácilmente gracias a las instrucciones.Lo recomiendo.
5,Bin sehr zufrieden. Anfangs dachte ich es ist billiges Plastik weil es so leicht ist und nach nichts aussieht. Aber an der Uhr und Handgelenk gefällt es mir dann sehr gut! Auch dass es so leicht ist. Man spürt das Armband kaum. Klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,Nice and comfortable great customer service 5 star's
5,So toll
5,Se porte avec tout style vestimentaire !!
5,Prodotto come da foto arrivato intatto nella confezione c’è anche il chiavino per togliere le maglie in più
5,Coloratissimo leggero di facile manutenzione. Lo consiglio!
5,Sehr leicht schmiegt sich gut ans Handgelenk gut zu kürzen (einfach Glieder herausnehmen) Schliesse hält gut und schaut  sehr gut aus!!!
5,sehr zufrieden
3,Was a bit disappointed with the colour it’s much darker than the pic advertising it but will still wear it though
5,Very impressed. Very pretty and well made. The instructions to remove unneeded links was pretty straightforward.Already had a few comments about how lovely and expensive it looks!Would buy again!
4,Lovely strap would definitely recommend only downside is can’t get size correct. Take two links out cannot fasten so have to have it loose
5,Súper elegante. ¡Me gusta mucho!Fácil de ajustar bien empaquetado cuidado y rápido.Además barato. En Wizeband la venden a más del doble. La misma.Encantada compraré más.
5,super produit il va a merveille avec ma montre rose
5,Era un regalo para mi mujer y le ha encantado. Ha llegado 2 días antes de lo estimado y embalado perfectamente. La correa es preciosa no pesa nada y trae las herramientas necesarias para quitar los escalones que sobren. Hay que tener un poco de maña pero se quitan bien.
5,The strap is very good. I will come back if necessary. The packing is also very good. The quality is very good completely consistent with the seller's description very satisfied really like it completely exceeding the expectations the delivery speed is very fast the packaging is very careful strict the delivery speed is very fast very satisfied with a shopping
5,I love this strap. I have a large collection of different colour Apple Watch straps & this is my absolute favourite. Came with a tool & instructions to remove links & only needed to remove one for it to fit comfortably. It looks great 👍
3,Me ha gustado el color. No me ha gustado su calidad y su anchura.
4,Sieht super aus
5,Looks pretty lovely colour. Light and comfortable. I’m satisfied with this purchase.
5,I absolutely love this band! The tortoiseshell colours are lovely and look great with my gold Apple Watch Series 6. It's easy to remove and add links and it feels very sturdy. I'm already deciding which colours to get next!
5,I really like that strap looks different  comfortable and easy to adjust to your wrist.
5,Arrived on time comfortable and value for money.
5,Bellino unica cosa che pensavo fosse lucido però è opaco ma è bello lo steso
5,I love how light the strap is and easy to remove.. it’s very comfortable to wear. Very pleased with the overall quality and value for money .
5,Gefällt mir super! Die Glieder lassen sich mühelos herausnehmen!
5,Aunque llegó un día más tarde es un tema logístico que no afecta al hecho de que me ha gustado mucho.*Tacto muy agradable.* Le da un aspecto muy elegante al reloj* Quitar los eslabones ha sido facilísimo* Se adapta perfectamenteAhora he de ver cómo envejece
5,
5,Queda muy chula! Fácil de poner y viene con la herramienta para quitarle eslabones que yo le tuve que quitar un par. Durabilidad no se porque sólo hace una semana que la tengo. Mi marido dice que le parece cara
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Brilliant value for money! Makes my Apple Watch look extra fancy
5,Una pulsera de resina muy bien fabricada superligera y con un packaging perfecto en mi caso necesitaba un par de eslabones más y tardaron 15 minutos en contestarme y 3 días en enviarme no los 2 eslabones sino una pulsera más de recambio. Mi única pena es que para caballero no tengan muchos más modelos...
3,Looks better with the watch on the picture. Bracelet has fair quality and comfortable very lightweight.
5,Muy bonito el color es un poco más rosado que en la foto pero igualmente queda muy bien. Además lleva las herramientas adecuadas para poder ajustarlo a la medida de cada muñeca
5,Ich habe das Armband nun seit fast 6 Monaten und bin immernoch top zufrieden! Es sieht super schick aus und ist sehr bequem zu tragen. Würde es wieder kaufen
3,Très bien attention au fermoir métallique un peu grand pour les petits poignets.
2,It's not good fitting to the wrist not comfortable and not good for Apple watch not worthy to spend the money
3,Das armband hat eine tolle Optik nur leider juckt mir das Metall der schließe am Handgelenk so dass ich es nicht immer tragen kann.
1,Had this for only a short time and don’t wear it every day. However it’s already rusting. I don’t wear it in the water or anything just rusting from washing hands and general wear. Not very happy with that! You would think they would use a rust resistant metal. Would not recommend this strap at all for that reason.
5,I have a few of these straps now. Good quality comfy and perfect fit.
5,Lightweight arrived promptly
5,Es muy bonita cómoda y no pesa nada. Simplemente me encanta
4,Ligera
5,Es un regalo de navidad y la verdad que la persona que lo tiene está súper encantado con esta correa aparte si tienes el Watch dorado queda súper bien!
5,Amazing quality. Love the colours. Need to get more!
5,I get lots of compliments on the watch band.
5,Würde es immer wieder kaufen
5,This price is very good. Many companies are much cheaper. It feels very good to use very good size is also quite particular there are many options like friends can really start I still like this product.
5,Bracciale bellissimo che rende il mio Apple Watch ancora più elegante. Molto leggero. Nella confezione che attrezzo per togliere le maglie in più veloce e comodamente! Lo consiglio
5,Wie abgebildet. Die einzelnen Glieder des Armbands lassen sich ganz einfach mit dem beiliegenden Werkzeug abtrennen und auf die entsprechend Größe anpassen.Angenehm zu tragen kratzt oder piekst nix.Gefällt mir sehr gut!
5,Super toll und hübsch. Ich liebe es. Größe anpassbar. Passt auch an sehr schmale Handgelenke.
5,Plus que conquise par ce bracelet !!! Facile à manipuler  notice claire et effet wawou pour cet été !
5,Really nice strap very comfortable and secure. I have had lots of compliments about it. Hopefully there might be more colours to come. Would definitely buy more
4,Se puede ajustar a  la medida de tu muñeca
5,Amazing product I’ve had so many compliments and have recommended it to so many people! It’s easy to attach to your Apple Watch screen and is comfortable to wear.
5,La verdad es que le queda muy bien al Apple Watch y además me ha resultado muy fácil quitar las piezas de más para ajustarlo a mi muñeca. Un acierto de correa y original.
5,Sieht sehr elegant aus
5,Ein tolles Armband. Bin total begeistert weil auch der Preis erträglich ist.
5,Me ha encantado la correa combina con todo y es súper cómoda.
5,I love it really easy to adjust and looks elegant and good quality!

5,Looks great and really good quality. Has did a few months now and metal not tarnished etc
1,Not only is is cheap looking it came broken
5,Encaja muy bien se ajusta fácilmente en tamaño y sobre todo no pesa nada que las similares en metal añaden mucho peso al reloj
5,Meine Uhr ist schwarz aber trotzdem alles passt! 😍
5,Kann ich nur empfehlen. Passt auch gut zu dem Rosé Ton der Apple Watch SE. Optisch sehr schön.
5,Tolles Armband sehr schicker Optik passt eben
5,Super Handhabung wirkt sehr edel der Tragekomfort ist auch erste Sahne
5,Looks really nice comfortable on the wrist and very easy to change size.
1,This arrived and was returned the same day.  The strap felt so flimsy and lightweight I was convinced it would break very quickly.  easy to return though.
5,Super tolles Armband allerdings etwas zu klein sitzt am Arm sehr eng bekommen es garnicht zu
5,Perfect match my watch the quality is very good cost-effective is also very high is a good product with good quality and low price.

5,Se adapta perfectamente al Apple watch
5,Très joli  facile de l’ajuster à la bonne taille avec le mode d’emploi et le tournevis fourni.
5,Cinturino davvero fatto bene e facilmente adattabile. Consigliato davvero
1,I was unable to re-size the bracelet - when I took a couple of links out it's impossible to get the bracelet back into its hinge.  Ended up throwing it away - TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
2,Not the colour I ordered and very difficult to attach to the watch.
5,Es muy bonita y de gran calidad!!
1,Cheaper quality and expensive.
5,Muy buena calidad
1,The nails in it became rusty very quickly
5,Bracelet en plastique très lègé. Imitation métal.
4,Overall great product and quality for the price. I love the way it looks especially with a rose gold apple watch. I get lots of compliments on this particular band and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish watchband. However I did have one heck of a time trying to get the extra clasps out to make the band size fit my wrist. I struggled quite a bit with it but did eventually manage to get the job done. If you lack patience though I would suggest going with something different as it can take some time to remove the pins. Regardless I am quite happy with this purchase
1,Gefällt mir nicht
1,Waaaay to big for a females wrist!
5,I love this watch band great quality easy to remove links to adjust the size and very durable.
5,Very happy with this product
5,I like the colour and how simple it was to resize.
5,Good quality and good look! Very cute
5,Gorgeous!
5,Good quality and good look! Very cute
4,Very comfortable easy to take on and off.  It looks classy as well.
5,I love it  slightly dresser  comfortable to wear and love the look.  It doesn’t look athletic which I like.  I definitely would consider buying this watch band in other colours also.
5,I love this band. I get a lot of compliments on it.
5,Love it. Super easy to install and very comfortable . It does looks beautiful
5,it’s light  it’s elegant & beautiful...all my colleague complimented it😊
5,Love the band. Comfortable and stylish. Love the colour. Very happy.
5,
5,This is a beautiful lightweight feminine watch band. I chose the pink and it is very softly coloured and pretty. Easily installed on my Apple Watch and easy to size also easy on/ off. Great purchase great price will probably get other colours
5,Really like it.  Easy to make it adjusted to fit my wrist.  Will buy other colors.  A bit higher in price but still good value.
5,Really like it.  Easy to make it adjusted to fit my wrist.  Will buy other colors.  A bit higher in price but still good value.
5,Looks really well made!!!Lov it
1,Very flimsy and cheapDisappointed
5,Is a very comfortable band and looks great
5,So great still after more than a year and so many compliments
3,It’s easy to install however the quality is not too great  it’s pure plastic .. I was more looking for solid one. And the Color is abit different. They have used the filter in their picture here. So the colours are not as bright at all
5,A little different than your average apple watch band.  Looks nice.  You remove links to size it to your wrist my wrist is strangely between two sizes so it's a little loose on me but if i remove another link it's too tight so a bit loose it is. Worth the money to purchase.
5,Love this watch strap. It goes with everything and is comfortable.
5,So pretty. Feels light to wear. Easy to adjust to wrist size. Love it!
5,Coloré et léger très beau look
5,I've bought plenty of Apple Watch bands over the past few years. I've only worn this one for a few days and I've received complements already. It comes with the tool to remove links; the band feels sturdy. The marble effect is lovely. I would definitely consider getting this band in a few other colours.
2,I live the design name color however the overall watch band was too light in weight n flimsy.
5,I'm so in love with this watch band.  I was worried it would look too plastic but it looks like mother of pearl.  Its so beautiful and fits PERFECTLY.  I have quite large wrists and find it hard to buy 'woman' bands as they're always made for tiny little girl wrists.  I'm so happy with the quality and look of this.  I will be looking for more options from the same brand!
5,I absolutely love this band.  It is comfortable beautiful and extremely light weight.
3,This is a really nice watch band and I like it a lot but it definitely isn't white. It is light pink.
5,Great quality and looks beautiful on my wrist!
1,Not happy it cheap and will break easy the clip is already not working right
4,Good product and would recommend to friends and family
4,Fits well. Easier to put on than the included band.
5,Looks great!
5,Love this band very very comfortable love the easy on and off light but not too light and love the colors.  Get a lot of compliments with this one.
5,Good fitEasy to fit to wrist sizeLove the colourChanges the look of the watch
5,Love ut
5,The watch Band came in nice packaging and I absolutely love it!! the colour is really nice and it’s really comfortable also - I forget that it’s even on! Although it fits me perfectly beware if you have larger wrists it’s quite hard to adjust the strap would recommend to anyone!
3,Like the colour but the band looks cheaply made.
3,Easy to adjust the band to fit your wristBut no slack when sliding the band to your iwatch.
5,This band is beautiful and was easy to size.
5,Il est très joli et j’en suis bien heureuse 👍🏼
5,Nice easy to clean and easy to adjust
5,Love. Just what I expected!
5,I liked everything
5,This watch band exceeded my expectations great product and fast shipping!
5,Received this as a birthday gift. Very complementary and easy to adjust. Love it.
5,It was for my wife a present
5,Quick delivery and just like photo. Thank you
4,I took one link out and it's still a bit too big but with two links out it's just a little too small.  However it looks great it's light and it looks very sturdy.  Overall very happy with it.
3,I love the watch band very comfy doesn’t get caught on the skin etc. however I have splashed water on it a bit and now after a couple of months I can start to see that the metal bars inside the marbled band have turned from silver to black so I would recommend getting darker colours to hide this.
5,This item arrived quickly and was worth the money.  I have the purple with rose gold and have had many positive compliments.
4,Les mailles à enlever pour ajustement sont un peu larges. Pour certains poignets l’ajustement peut être non approprié
5,Really beautiful and easy to adjust. I have very thin wrists so it’s not a perfect fit even with the adjustment but it will do! Love the design and how it matches my rose gold watch!
5,This band was exactly what I wanted and was surprised how nice it was when it arrived.  Easy to shorten band with tools provided.  Nice and light to wear and looks really good but I do not wear daily so I hope it holds up long term. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,Love it!! So much better than my discoloured white strap!! Will be buying others !!
5,Product was exactly as described. The band length was very easy to adjust with the tool supplied with the band. My wife absolutely love the bands. Great value for money as now she has two very good looking bands to dress UP any outfit as required. Very quick standard delivery as well. Thanks
5,Looks great.  Good quality.  Have received many compliments!
5,Super fast shipping really light weight. It came with the tool to adjust the links and instructions. Highly recommend! I’m really really happy with my purchase.
5,Got it for the wife and loved it.
