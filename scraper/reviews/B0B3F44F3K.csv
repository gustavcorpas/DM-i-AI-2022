5,Have you ever wanted to feel as if you were at a private concert of the music you love at home?This is what Rizizi offers in this model it is an oasis to the ears the sound quality is exquisite and its shape is a marvel for those of us who enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking in the mountains going for a run walking quietly around the house or just being somewhere with ourselves; because there is no danger of falling to the ground and not having wires gives us freedom of movement that we all like imagine being at home doing simple things like cooking and enjoy your favorite music without having to disturb others or take a quiet evening to listen to the audio book you have pending.Another plus that this model of headphones offers us is that the case in which they are kept indicates the charge level that each earbud has due to an easy to see screen in a bright green color in the front face; so I don‚Äôt have to worry about how much charge will have or to run out of battery in the middle of that song that we are enjoying now we know certainty how long it will last us and when we must put them to charge them again this charge can be done by means of cable or placing them in its base that is beautiful to the sight.Another improvement in this model with respect to the previous ones is that the microphone works perfectly which allows us to answer calls at any time whether we are doing sports driving or while listening to a song we can pause and answer without problems; I  hear and I am heard clearly two fundamental things for me in this type of product (nobody wants earbuds that do not sound well or keeps disconnecting the Bluetooth to be able to answer the phone call).Another thing I liked is that we can pause what we listen by pressing the button they have right in the ear is simple and very practical as well as increase the volume without having to remove the phone or computer.I have tested these headphones with Bluetooth connection on the cell phone and laptop and I must say that something that surprised me pleasantly is the distance it supports because you can be about four or six meters and still hear perfectly just as I did the test leaving the receiver in a room and I on the other side of the door being closed and still listening well which I like because it gives us an autonomy of movement and saves us from being with the phone always on top to listen.With respect to your listening has a practical size can put it in the bag a kangaroo briefcase since does not occupy almost space the design is discreet and classic which I like because it looks elegant with the rest of my devices in black this case also works as a charger so if we arrive from some activity where we use them and have lost some charge we can put them in their case without connecting that will begin to charge and as I indicated we will know with certainty that charge has I have used them for hours and really keep going so I can spend up to days without having to connect the case to the power or put it in its charger base.One suggestion on the case that as a user who likes outdoor activities I would ask and that would be useful is that it should have some place to put some kind of strip to hang it or tie it inside the kangaroo or bag to avoid losing it because if we are outdoors they could fall and it is something that depends on the site could be an oversight that we would regret a lot. As a user if there was no option to put something to tie it or have a kind of keychain I would look for a cover to keep them and take them everywhere.So what can I conclude after the time I have used these Rizizi earbuds? That it is worth buying them because the sound is excellent (I love going for a walk in the mornings with them they are that oasis while I walk) its design does not mistreat the ears they are very comfortable so we can spend hours using them without pain now we can take calls and be heard clearly; it is a let's talk on the phone and continue doing what we do. And the plus of the design of this case that for me is one of the best I've seen with the inclusion of that screen that makes us finally know how much charge they have. In short I highly recommend these Rizizi headphones.
5,I‚Äôve worn all sorts of ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù earphones and as soon as I put these on WOW!! These very much impressed me. First tune: Take No Prisoners - Megadeth. The bass response was excellent even on low volume. Wearing these at the gym was a blessing so I didn‚Äôt have to hear all the obnoxious gym rats chatting instead of working out and their loud grunting as if to draw the attention to the fact they are trying to eek out one more rep. Saved my sanity and the gym is a pleasant experience again. The fit was comfortable out of the box and I wear glasses. The tech with these was easy to use and I appreciate that you can just pop them in and out of their case to connect/disconnect to Bluetooth. I would absolutely buy again!
4,So I‚Äôve had Bose Apple and Beats products.  They are obviously more expensive and quite honestly the quality of the sound and and overall manufacturing is clearly superior. However I need the over the ear loops I sweat a lot when I cycle here in Houston.  Regular buds won‚Äôt stay in my ears and I‚Äôm tired of losing them.  For under 40 bucks these are great value.  The sound quality is decent and they stay in my ears. No noise canceling which is what I would expect for the $.  Yes you can spend 2-3 times as much for the ‚Äúnamed‚Äù brands but if you‚Äôre looking for something that gets the job done at a great price these might be for you.
4,My only complaint for these would be that if I pause my music for a couple minutes they always disconnect and I have to reconnect them. But it‚Äôs not a big deal. They sound great and the battery lasts forever. I haven‚Äôt even charged them yet and I lost track of how long ago I bought them. Super great purchase!
4,Sound is decent for running buds. So far so good!I have several hours of use in the mostly running on the roads paired to my phone and Garmin watch with some music and Spotify on the run. I have also sued them for a little video viewing on Note s22 and tab s7.  It has been a great experience has been great in all uses so far.Don't think I qualify as audiophile as I want them to be first a great running option and secondary phone and entertainment and for them at they excel.
5,At first I didn't like these and was gonna return them because they seemed too big for my ears and felt uncomfortable however the sound quality is just perfect to me so I kept them and eventually figured out the correct way to wear them and they're soo comfortable and did I mention how awesome the sound quality is?? Just GET THEM  You Won't regret it! ‚ò∫üëç
5,These over the ear headphones are perfect for me. I have used them for more than a month. That's at least 20 hours of gym time. Pods or buds just fall out for me. These stay put while I do my routine. The sound is about 8 out of 10. I am not an audiophile and I listen to a mix of rock country pop some hip hop. They paired perfectly with my android phone. I place them back in the case when I'm done. I have not needed to recharge the case yet. It shows %25 still left. Volume control pause change track answer phone are all easy. What a bargain! One of the best things is I can leave them in my gym bag for over a month without recharging.
5,Headphones are great for my workouts.  If I run or in the gym these have been the best work out headphones I have owned. The sound quality is good (not great) durable and even when sweating after an hour or running 10 miles no issue with moisture or anything.  Battery life is very good and portable charger is great and convenient.  Definitely would recommend to anyone who works out.
4,I bought these on Amazon Prime Day and so far I'm pretty happy with them.  The only issue I've had has been with the connectivity.  This has happened twice I have to pause what I'm listening to on my phone and when I go back to listen my phone acts like it's playing but there is no sound.  I'm blind and use the android talk back and that is not coming through either.  The only way I can fix it is to power down both headsets and phower them back on again.I still like them a lot they are very comfortable and have decent range.
5,I use these earbuds for audible books watching TV & listening to music. My favorite thing about them: I have had these for 2 months now using them consistently and haven't had to charge them once! They pair to bluetooth really easily. The sound is great! I have no problem hearing with just one earbud in. They are not too big or heavy so they don't fall out. These are perfect!
5,Charge lasts forever.  Love the convenience of seeing what percentage charge they are at.  Great sound quality!
5,I use these at bedtime to listen to audiobooks. They are excellent!  Great battery life as well.
5,These fit great and never slip out even when I run. Noise cancellation could be better but overall a great buy. Long battery life too!
5,They are nice headphones with quality sound. Only complaint would be that do hurt after wearing them for a while.
5,Awesome headphones so far! Sound is great and very comfortable. Still testing out the battery will update later
5,Great headphones. I use them for work and got a lot more quality then I figured I‚Äôd get.
5,On first use they are easy to pair with IOS phone nice instructions and they are comfortable to wear. Case is big enough not to lose may be too big to comfortably carry in a pocket. Love the charging display. The sound is nice with podcasts and the range away from your phone is amazing! Worth a try. I have not tested noise canceling phone call music or battery life. Will update as I do.UPDATE: Using for a few weeks now and they are AWESOME! They are comfortable secure and sound great. I can still hear around them for safety when working in the shop or walking on the road. They have a charge that lasts a really long time and if i put them in the case in between they last almost a week! I have called a few people and they do not complain at all or notice I am on bluetooth headphones (I usually get complains with everything including plug in head sets. You will love these.
5,The earbuds have a crystal clear sound. The volume is amazing and the charge last a long time.
5,After three months of use right bud stopped working completely! I am so disappointed and won‚Äôt recommend. Was great while it lasted and thank goodness I bought on sale
4,First the battery life is awesome. The case has an LED display showing battery life. I used them over a week and did not need to charge the case.Getting them to fit into my ear is more difficult. Just trying to find a place you can touch without turning it off & on is the first challenge and I found I needed to keep adjusting as I wear them.If the fit isn‚Äôt exactly the sound goes in and out.For the price they work great!
5,Charge lasts for many hours.  Each ear pairs separately so use together for noise cancellation or charge one while you use the other.  Reasonably quick charge too so never runs out.  Comfortable and stays on.
5,The sound quality is good I do not know about the battery life yet
5,These fit good and sound great. I'm impressed.
5,I haven't had anything negative happen with them.
5,I don‚Äôt use them very often but i do love how secure they are in my ears. Definitely would purchase again!
5,Works great when I'm mowing lawn for 6 to 8 hrs a day
5,I do like the small ear buds and the case to charge which is nice to see the charge level from the outside.  I use them  only for phone calls not music because there isn't much bass. I'm not returning them.
5,These ear buds are a great buy for the price the charge in the case and the ear buds last quite long and the sound quality is very good as well. I would recommend these to anyone.
4,Fits my ears well. Sounds good. Not JBL or Sony good but certainly good enough.
4,I constantly have problems connecting to zoom with these. They work fine with everything else. Sound quality is decent for the price.
4,Seems to be decent quality for price. Warranty seems to good to be true with free wireless charger upon completion.
5,These are great! Comfortable to wear all day battery life is great.
5,I really love how long they last. I use them at work and love them I recommend them to my sister and she ordered them and love them too.
4,These work great for the money. Not much noise cancellation though although this is not why I purchased them so I'm not bothered by it. I like being able to hear what's going on around me and if I don't I have over the ear headphone that have great noise cancellation. . They fit and feel great. The one thing that I don't like is when the buds are in the case charging and I try and make a call and they connect to my phone. This happens often. They shouldn't connect to your phone when they are in the case.
5,The production voice is very clear with better sound quality
5,Very happy with quality of product and purchase experience. Ear loops hold them in place nicely and sound is most impressive.
5,I recently bought these because I was tired of my old pair of headphones falling out all of the time while I was working out or moving around while wearing them.I must say I was truly blown away by the sound quality on these headphones for the price! For them not being a very well known brand these headphones sound quality was way better than I ever expected not to mention the bass sounded amazing too. I have had issues with cheaper headphones not being loud enough to block out outside noises in the past but that was definitely not an issue with these.They fit in the ear very comfortably and the hook part that goes around the ear was very comfortable also. I've had problems with headphones like this hurting my ears before after wearing them for a while. I had no issue at all with these headphones.They were definitely worth buying! I did get the extended warranty with mine just because I can be rough on my headphones sometimes... But even if I didn't if anything ever happened to these headphones I would be very happy to get them again.
5,The sound quality is great. I never turn the volume all the way up and it's plenty loud with just one ear bud. The charging is relatively fast as long as you keep it from going completely dead on the case. The buds themselves last roughly a full day with moderate use and I switch between ear buds so one is always charged and ready to go if I need it. I love these earbuds as they have the same type of plug in as my cell phone so it's just one cord and I'm good to go.
5,Use these earbuds to listen to movies at night in bed. Great option since I don't disturb my wife.The quality is incredible. Battery lasts for at least a week. Ear pieces fit so well I don't know they are in. The overall construction is substantial so no fear of rolling over on them and breaking them. Even the case is "off the chart" high quality. The only problem this company may have is that Tesla may try to hire away their product designers.
4,I enjoy these headphones a lot super clear with the right about of bass.
5,Fantastic battery life and great sound for such a minimal price. I have nothing negative to say.
5,Comfortable and sound great
4,My only real complaint is they click on my glasses arms when I run.  I have to tuck the around the ear part under my glasses arm to prevent this.  Kind of a hassle.  Wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased the ones that go around the ear just thought they would be more secure for running.
5,The quality is good!
5,Great product for the price-good sound quality battery life and charging case.
5,Have had couple days and oh my they are wonderful! Easy comfy no slippage at all and makes my walks so much more enjoyable. Highly recommend them
5,Needed earbuds for the gym and walking around town while keeping costs down. These earbuds worked well for me. Stayed in and on ear while exercising. Sound was very good considering cost. Calls were okay. Battery life good. If you want a go-to second pair of earbuds these are it. I have 4 other pairs of earbuds including Bose which I use for the house only. I exercise a lot have my own tennis ball machine and walk a lot. Most of my earbuds I use have the hooks to lock around the ears. If you need a second pair of go-to earbuds I would recommend these.
5,These aren‚Äôt noise cancelling but they‚Äôre great for the price retain battery life great comfortable great buy
5,I bought these to wear when walking because I was tired of a cord sitting on my neck. I tried Apple style buds but they kept falling out. These buds with the ear loops stay in and sound great. The most amazing thing is the battery life. I use these for an hour 4 or 5 days a week and I haven't recharged them since they arrived! Couldn't be happier.
5,I love these things!  They sound great and are perfect for watching movies on my laptop.  The charge lasts for hours of continuous use and the case charges the earbuds multiple times before it needs recharged.  Just as described very happy!
5,I like earbuds that wrap around the ear so they don't fall out. These go around the ear comfortably enough to make them feel safe from falling but not too tight. The sound quality is good and the buttons function well. These earbuds pair more easily than most others I've owned and the charge on the earbuds as well as the charge on the case last a significant amount longer than others as well. I also like the charge percentage display on the front of the case. Very clear and easy to see while charging. These were a great value for the price.
5,Excellent noise reduction and sound quality
5,Never used ear buds before. Had plug in ear phones etc that I didn't use.These are amazing.  Sound quality nice; especially like being able to change the size of the ear piece.  Small fit better in my ears & the sound even better. Only using to listen to music while on my morning walk. 4 days (45 min/day) on original charge now at 60% so I'm fine with the battery. Don't know what it is like with the phone but am only using them for my walk. Like the security of the over the ear design was worried that they would not stay in my ear. Comfortable while wearing my sun glasses. Very happy with my purchase price was very reasonable for this quality.ADDENDUM: I want to clarify still only using for morning walk the original charge is down to 37%. So it has been going for a few weeks original charge started at 98% so I'm very satisfied with the battery life. Still think the sound quality is excellent. I think the smaller size of the ear piece fits me best.I didn't use ear phones or head phones cuz they weren't comfortable either fell out or had poor sound quality.
5,After two unsuccessful attempts with other brands and styles of bluetooth headphones I finally found one that really meets my needs.  The headphones were very easy to pair with my Android phone.  The headphones fit comfortably around my ears and snugly into my ear canals.  As soon as the music began streaming into the phones I knew I had found the right pair for me.  The sound was crisp and clear with a solid bass depth. the charging case seems well-constructed and durable.  I have great hope and expectations this pair will last me for quite a while and produce the sound I expect whether working out at the gym or mowing the lawn.
5,I got these for work.  The little arm that goes over the ear keeps them from falling off and they last all day.  Even without putting them back in the case to charge they last the day listing to music.
4,great battery life and for the price a great value. not great for noise canceling.
5,Great case/ Charger easy to connect..Love this product!
5,Update:  so far I love them.  Easy to pair sound is fantastic.  Can't say anything about battery life because I have only had them for a couple hours but they were fully charged when they arrived.Can't wait to use them.  Decided on these because of the poditive reviews.  I will come back with a full review.
5,Noise cancellation great!
4,Liked everything so far
5,This was a birthday gift for my grandson so I don‚Äôt have any precise information only that he loves it!
4,For the price these things are awesome!  they hold their charge - I love the charging compartment!  The sound is ok but it may be that I am not able to find the perfect fit yet.  But definitely solid as far as staying in your ear - I have taken them biking off road (can't call it mt biking as I am in Florida but pretty rough terrain and they stayed in.)
5,Liked everything
5,These came fast and were priced decent. I like the way the feel in my ears and they sound good. Easily connected to my Apple Watch and phone.
4,Ok so far
5,I wanted earbuds that stayed in my ears no matter what and these do that and do it comfortably.  Great sound great attractive case with useful charge information and great price!
5,I have these on my desktop PC.  I have speakers as well.  When I need to listen privately I take the earpiece out of the caddy and it automatically switches to that output.  Put it back in the cradle and my speakers turn back on again.  Perfect!
5,I‚Äôve been impressed so far. The product and customer service seem like a great value for the cost paid.
5,It really last my whole 14hr shift
5,I have many piercings and am very active. These are the only wireless earbuds that stay in place. The sound quality is that of more expensive brands. I love em!
5,These little earbuds are the best I‚Äôve ever owned‚Äîeither buds headphones wired or Bluetooth. The sound quality is incredible they are so comfortable to wear and the battery life just keeps lasting and lasting! I love that when you set them back in their carrying case it automatically turns them off (so no fussing with buttons to turn them on or off) and the case itself is the recharging battery station even when it isn‚Äôt plugged in! And then there is the cute little LED display that tells you the battery level of each earbud separately! Overall these are the best and I love them.
5,These earbuds have been excellent.  I find them comfortable whether it is playing golf working in the yard or just being out.  I don't worry about them falling out like other earbuds.  The sound like all earbuds are just not quality but these are very good for earbuds.  And yes I would but again.
5,These earbuds are great! I use them to work out to help block out a good amount of noise and sounds great to!
4,Overall a great deal for what your paying. Decent sound and bass aswell as a very grippy style that allows me to do all kinds of mechanic work and workout with them staying in. Only complaint is they hurt the inners of my ears after hours of use even though I swapped to the smallest earbud size. Still love em and use em every day
5,Very easy to use terrific sound comfortable long charge- 5 stars!
5,Very good sound and value and the wireless charging is mesmerizing to watch. No more falling out when I‚Äôm riding the mower. I love the physical volume button you click it up or down. I tried holding it a couple times and that‚Äôs not how it works. Quick pairing just remember to take both out of the case at the same time.
4,Very comfortable.  Very light.  The charging cable is too short though.  It's only 12 inches long.  Had to buy 3.3 foot USB-A to USB-C cord and charger extra so I could set it up on a table or counter to charge.  Perhaps the 12 inch cord may work if you are charging it off your laptop or desktop.
5,Use these at work switching from ear to ear about every hour for 10 hours a day and don't need to recharge for 5+ days. So battery life is great. Sound is also quite good for anything under $100. Would buy again!
5,These earbuds have excellent sound quality.
5,So far soft and comfortable like that the case is not real small so it'll be easier to find in my purse or luggage.  Seems to be sturdy too.Just received this so will add more later.
5,These little guys are amazing! I've been using them about a week now and wish I'd sprung for them earlier. I wear one for Webex/Teams meeting for work then while off the clock watching the news or Amazon Prime Netflix whatever. I can't compare sound quality b/c these are my 1st bt buds but the battery life & handy case/charger are top-notch. Case is lightweight and itself holds many charges so great fof travel. As a bonus I can charge it using my Big Blue portable solar panel when camping w/out power (tested & works). Love the volume controls on each bud. All-around a great purchase!
5,I like the display of power level. I also like the warranty. I will see about the quality tomorrow.
5,OKAY SO FAR I'll let you know in18 months
5,Fast shipping. I love how they fit my ears which makes it easy when im workin out. Im able to connect one or both if i want and the charging typically last me up to 3 days before i need to recharge ( i inly wear them to the gym and im usually only there 1 hour to 1 n a half hours
5,A little uncomfortable at first but I switched to the larger ear buds and now no problems.
4,Enjoy them for the gym
5,I bought these headphones for use on the treadmill. The ear clips hold the pods firmly in my ear while I am jogging. Sound quality is very good and I am very pleased. Easy to charge in convenient carrying case. They are not the most high end in terms of sound quality. But for everyday use at the gym they are perfect.
5,Listened to an audible book while I rode my bicycle 8 miles with Zero glitches volume controls worked fine then had my buddy call me to check the mic/ear. I left the phone in my car and walked all the way around the car having a conversation and out about 15 ft away with zero problems. Having ear loops in my opinion is SOOO much better than just plugs or wire connected.
5,Great sound quality as well as noise cancellation. My daughter was behind me and I was not able to tell she was even talking to me
5,They are comfortable they sound good the battery life is SO long and they charge quickly.
5,These earbuds work great and the sound is awesome I will buy these over and over
5,Love the product! Unbelievable Great quality for the money. Qualities: noise cancellation great   long battery life  visual battery life no guessing  great fit - stay in place with over the ear fit  best sound quality of earbuds I  have purchased . Definitely will consider buying again if lost or damaged  or even for guilt giving
5,I ordered these because they were a good price and they went around my ear and I thought I would be able to hide them under my headband easily for work. That is really not the case because these are bulkier than most earbuds. They are louder than most as well and sound good.
5,I bought these for $22 on prime day. What a steal. They have don't have many features but it stays connected. I have had several other more expensive pair. These are the ones I wear everyday.
5,I‚Äôm very happy with these earbuds. I use them when I‚Äôm outside getting exercise and they work perfectly. Great price and excellent quality in my opinion.
5,Sounds is very good.
4,Sound quality isn't great but they are comfortable and the charge holds.
5,I use these in the gym. It takes a little getting used to the piece around the ear but now I feel weird when I use my earbuds that don't have that support. I'd have to stop in the middle of a workout to catch my old ones before they fell out. The sound is great and the battery lasts forever.
5,These are the best wireless headphones I‚Äôve owned especially when you consider the price and the LIFETIME GUARANTEE. The sound is fine and they do last for 40 hours. I‚Äôve used them for six days at least a couple hours a day and they‚Äôre still at 60%!Update:  Two weeks in and I haven't charged them yet!  Still at 20 percent so the claim of 40 hours is true.  I registered my earbuds for the lifetime warranty so if one of the earbuds does stop working (like other reviewers have noted) I assume they will be replaced.
4,for listening five stars.  not the most comfortable i‚Äôve worn but also not uncomfortable.  was told the microphone quality was ‚Äúnot great‚Äù.
5,For the price this is a great product. Doesn't need to be charged often but I only use it for 30-60 minute workouts. Sounds comes in great. Doesn't bother my ears. I also like that it tells me how low the battery is!
5,Excelente producto
5,These headphones are comfortable stay in my ear have good battery life and are plenty loud. I go to the gym 4-5 times a week for an hour or a little more and they easily last the week without a charge.
5,
5,So i received these yesterday and i must admit.. these are a banger for the price. I went with these because they gave me trust and better to risk some $35-$40 to test wireless headphones than paying more than $100 for airpods or bose or whatever that im not sure if they will hold during mytrainings. These Rizizi fits very well for training! Of course they don‚Äôt sound like beats but if you are training and you are not a soundaholic? These are great. def recommend! I personally like the quality soundUpdate to 24 July 2022 : still great for training 100%. They hold my shadow boxing and calisthenics movement very well despite my big amounts of sweat. Now  only thing to test is the long term durability.
3,I ordered these this past prime day and in most respects I was extremely happy with them.  They were very comfortable and stayed in place far better than my last earbuds (the tiny sort without the over-ear hooks; maybe my ears are an odd shape but that last pair wouldn't stay in at all).  Sound quality was excellent: nice and clear with decent range and certainly worth what I'd paid.  They charged quickly and the charging case worked well: quick light and a good size (small enough to toss in any bag but big enough that it's hard to lose!)Sow why only three stars?  They arrived July 20th.  The right ear stopped working September 5th.  For now I'm still using the left ear until I find a replacement but a month and a half of use is not quite what I had in mind.
5,I really love over-the-ear headphones because I get sick of having to adjust wireless headphones when they slip while I'm active. Other brands have even fallen out of my ears causing me to retrieve them off the ground or a semi-dirfy gym floor!  The charge % indicator is visible while the case is closed which is nice. My only criticism is that the base is not as deep as I'd like...something I can easily overlook due to the sound clarity comfortable fit and price. Definitely a great pair of headphones for the price.
4,Great sound quality and battery life.  These lasted 1 week for me in the gym.  They can‚Äôt handle sweat. Very disappointing.  Return was quick and easy. My search continues.
5,These earphones are awesome.1. The sound is outstanding crystal clear and balanced2. They are very comfortable easy on the ears3. The battery life is outstanding each earphone lasts for more than 8 hours each.I highly recommend these earphones.
5,After going through multiple earbuds these have the best balance or sound quality and comfort. Just buy a pair and thank me later.
5,I used these earphones working in a warehouse with lots of machines going. I can hear out of them great when I'm on the phone. Listening to my music I still hear very well enjoying my music. And the fact that they last me all night I love that. They are the best earphones I purchased and I have purchased several over the last year I've been at my job. This is one I have not been disappointed with and you won't be either!!!
5,These headphones are great quality and stay charged for a long time!! Easy to use and would buy again.
5,These are very comfortable and I do not feel the pressure like with other wireless headphones.  I also like that I do not have to worry about losing them while exercising and that the button is not so sensitive that it gets bumped all the time.
3,I had these for 2 months before I heard a static pop and the left ear doesn't work anymore. I love how these fit in my ear so I'm really bummed. Earbuds don't fit in my ears so these worked perfectly.The sound is pretty good. The charging is a bit wonky. It shows only 1 of them as being charged. I have no idea if the other is actually being charged. Battery life is great. I don't like how it constantly disconnects from my phone if I don't start a video or music with 15 seconds. That's annoying. But overall had these worked for more than 2 months I'd have given them 5 stars.
5,These have been the best earbuds I have owned by miles! I have owned several pairs that have stopped working or fell apart (even Bose!). For the price you can‚Äôt beat these buds.
5,Fits nice and sounds good. I like the case and easy view into battery life.
4,Updating my previous review...I will give this an overall 4 stars due to the customer service I have received.  They do their customers best interest at heart.  As far as the actual headphones go...I don't like the fact that the in incoming ringtone is that of a an outgoing call.  It has messed me up twice making me think I am the one making a call and waiting for someone to answer me.  I am being told that this setting is set at the factory and can not be changed.
5,After purchasing many earbuds over the past few years I cam say that these are wonderful for the price.I have yet to test out the noise canceling feature but I can say that the sound quality is excellent....crisp and clear with good bass.  Hopefully the noise cancelation will be as good.  The charger case is actually attractive and the over the ear hooks are comfortable.  A good purchase!
5,They had great range and great battery life but they stopped connecting to devices after a few months. Even tried removing them from the device and re-setting them up.Seller replaced headset and new one seems to be functioning just fine.
5,Great product and easy to pair with my phone.
5,These are the Best wireless earbuds ever! You charge the box and put the buds in the box and they auto charge auto disconnect. When you're ready pick them up and put them in your ear...and auto Connect!!
5,Sound was awesome!!!
5,I use them at work. Noise canceling is great. Sound is great. Haven't had to charge them but one time.
4,Work well little short on distance. I recommend them so far. I haven't had them very long. Has a nice charging case with it's own battery with digital read out of charge status.
5,Love that it shows battery life left.
5,Great headphones!
5,Love these they do all they promise.  When done they automatically charge when put in the charging station. Charge lasts long.
5,I like the fit of the ear buds and I like the charging case. The battery lasts a long time too.
4,Great value
4,easy to use
5,I just received these but so far so good.  Sound and battery life and packaging were all as promised.
5,I use these for working out. The sound and clarity is awesome. Great product for the price. Highly recommended.
5,Very fashion design. I liked the charging indication showing outside it looks very cool and I compared the quality with my other earbuds this is the best one worth the money!
4,While they are not noise cancelling they are great headphones for a very reasonable price.
5,I only use 1 while walking and 2 for yard work.  This is the first independent buds I've had that sync together perfectly.  Great sound.
5,I was surprised at how great these work and sound quality.  I have used them for work and for outside activities.  They are perfect.
5,Light weight and comfortable
3,When I look for a Bluetooth headset I look for several things:ComfortSound qualityBluetooth delayPairingBatteryFor comfort they are mediocre.  The over the ear part keeps them on but the in-ear part is way too long.  I don't know how to compare my ears to anyone else but these stick way too far into my ears to be comfortable.  I can set them on the outside with a bit of a twist on the over ear hook and they work okay but my ears still hurt after an hour or so.  Because of this you would not want them for working out.The sound quality is very good.  They seem to have a good audio range and accuracy though I did not put it on any test equipment to validate.The Bluetooth delay is unacceptable and really annoying if you are using it to watch videos or YouTube.  I have attached these to several devices (laptops phones tablets) and all of them show a significant delay.  I have 3 other Bluetooth headsets/earphones and none have a delay nearly this bad.The pairing is good.  It seems to find most devices quickly and connect pretty easily even with two separate ear units.  The range also seems decent particularly for small earphones.The charging base is interesting and seems to work well but only having used them a week I cannot comment on reliability or battery life.  Just note that the base tells you how charged the base battery is not how charged the headphones are.
5,Using these for fitness biking. Good crisp audio earbuds stay in ear and last a long time.
4,I like the sleek look of the charger. The sound is good. I really like the over-ear design. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the drama involved with getting both earpieces to work. I had to factory reset.
4,Noise canceling and great sound.  I tend to go through headphones quickly for some reason so happy this also happens to have a lifetime warranty if you register it
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Good Bass! But dislike there is no lanyard attached to the case to put around neck
5,4 different brands in the past year  all crap.  But this brand buy far the best! Battery life is outstanding! Far exceeds the others.  Andgreat sound!
5,The battery life on these earbuds is fantastic they sound great and came with a great warranty!
5,Other earbuds fall out when exercising. These don't and are comfortable. I live in a windy area and folks on the other end say they can still hear me clearly even if walking out in the wind. Love these!
5,Very comfortable I wear one headphone at work and listen to music or audio books. Simply tapping the earbud pauses whatever I‚Äôm listening to if I need to speak with a customer. I am happy I have purchased these.
5,The headphones arrived on time and connected easily to the Pixel phone.  The sound quality would rival a pair that cost double the price.  The over-the-ear holder lets me enjoy my music on the go without having to worry about the headphone falling and breaking.  I can't speak to the battery life as they are new and holding very well so far.  The case is sturdy and will protect the headphones when traveling or just throwing them in a bag.
5,So far these seem great!  I got them for my 11 yr old son and the small ear pieces fit him nicely.  He loves them.  I called him and he answered with his earbuds and the sound quality on both ends was excellent!  He said the music sound quality is great too!  They came charged and ready to go.  I'm thinking about getting a pair for myself!
5,Love these  they‚Äôre awesome!!! They stay charged so long!
5,Good
5,Fantastic product.
5,Really nice earbuds ESPECIALLY for the price.  The batteries in both earbuds and the case last a LONG time.  Sound quality is better than other earbuds I have owned even ones that cost double.
5,The RIZIZI Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones are great.  They are a great fit and the sound quality is very good. Love that a single charge will last more than the entire evening of use and the recharge does not take long at all.  I usually recharge the earbuds in the case 4 or 5 times before I recharge the case itself.  I was fortunate to purchase mine on Amazon Prime Day which made my purchase and extremely good one.
4,I haven‚Äôt used them yet as one earbud was out of battery but they look nice feel nice and the info about them is presented well. I can update this.
5,I got these when they were on sale and I was skeptical given how many awful pairs of headphones I purchased on Amazon. But this one I don't regret!!!They are awesome just like other reviewers say.So these are main facts about this set:1. Great sound noise blocking and super BASS!2. LIGHTWEIGHT. Easily holds on the ear and you cannot feel it it doesn't weigh the ear down and fits great.It will come with two additional earbud sizes.2. The charging case is smooth and modern it uses Type C charger which is very accessable.6. Controls are easy to use.7. Battery life is also great. I can go listening to music for  a full day without charging and charging itself is very fast.
3,UPDATE: Having used these for a while I needed to update the review. The buds do NOT sit comfortably in the ear - it's almost as if the mechanism is upside down as they fit better in the ear with the arms at the bottom. Customer response: I received an email after registering them within 12 hours asking why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 and asking me to change my review. I also registered for the free gift of a wireless charger. The charger was lost by UPS and I a filed a claim and sent the information provided by UPS about the lost item to Rizizi. It's been now more than 72 hours and nothing but silence from the vendor.The buds are okay - but there is more to say against them and the company than for them; they were inexpensive - so if you don't mind a poor fit and are looking for a pair that you really don't care about go for it.Just purchased. Very easy to pair right out of the box; the large type charge indicator is very easy to read; very good bass response! Didn't really buy for working out. I gave four stars because I can't speak regarding battery life just yet; I haven't had them long enough to comment.
4,They're pretty comfortable. I use them for listening to music and for phone calls and it's nice that I can use either headphone alone for calls.
4,Very good wireless earbuds. Excellent sound quality long lasting charge. Good quality  and easy to operate. Now priced higher than competition e.g. O'Keefe
4,So far these are wonderful. The stay on my ear better than ear buds. Easy to connect
5,
4,Good sound battery. Noice cancelation not greatOverall good product
5,So far so good!  I've only had the earbuds for a few days but so far I am impressed.  I was a little concerned about the ear "loop" keeping the buds in my ears because they are pretty flexible but they stay put even when putting on my motorcycle helmet.  I will update this review when I have a chance to fully put these little buds to the test but as of right now nice little buds at a great price!
5,Liked it thus far. Been using it daily and works great. Allows me to ignore my co-workers charter whitest jamming out to my Spotify playlist on work.
5,I love this product! It has great sound. The charging case is sturdy with a great design and the ear buds stay on my ears even when I am sleeping. Not to mentioned the charge time and how long my ear buds stayed charged. I've already recommended this product to my friends and family.
5,i use these constantly even at the lowest setting on my phone i can‚Äôt hear anyone around me talking lol & they‚Äôre comfortable & don‚Äôt fall out easily!
5,I bought these to replace a very similar set of earbuds that I was very happy with except that after about four hours they started to hurt my ears. That doesn't happen with these. I've worn them for a full eight hour shift at work and they are completely comfortable the entire time. The batteries in the earbuds have lasted the entire time I've wanted to use them (eight hours once but a minimum of four hours every other time). These are not sound canceling which I find good because if I turn the volume very low I can still hear my coworkers. Not that I want to hear them so much but I can hear my boss and that's important. LOLSetup is ridiculously easy. Just take at least one of them out of the case and search for RIZIZI in your phone's Bluetooth settings. Tap on it and you're done! The case has a built-in battery that can be charged either wirelessly or using a USB-C cord. I charged the case wirelessly when I first received it just to top it off -- it was delivered with a 94% charge already. That was quick and efficient. I'm charging it now using the cord (for the first time since the initial charge nine days ago) and that is also working well. I'm not sure how to describe the bass from these. I've played a song that had a lot of bass and while these did not fully reproduce the full effect that large subwoofers would (obviously) they also did not "buzz" as some speakers will when overpowered. I should also mention that they fit very securely in your ears. I ride a motorcycle and have worn these on the freeway and I never once felt at risk of one of them falling out even at "slightly" over the speed limit (2X).For the price these really can't be beat!
5,Really great volume and sound quality. The buttons are a little tough to get used to but it is easy for me now.
5,These are awesome. Impressed with the quality!
5,I received my pair on Sunday and was surprised that they were almost Fully charged! Immediately I removed them from the case excited to try them out. I've been looking for the perfect pair as I have purchased and tried several over the years. I'm on the go alot on a daily basis from the time I wake up until I lay down for bed at night. Not to mention I'm also a big multitasker so these come in handy. My husband is so critical of background noises when I'm on the phone with him especially in the grocery store or at work(hospital). I'd been talking to him earlier in the day with some other headphones so when I talked to him later I didn't say anything about these New babies I had in my ear because I wanted to see if he noticed the difference.  Well he DEFINITELY did as I walked outside with the wind blowing and he patiently kept talking without one complaint. Usually he yells OMG call me back üòä. Later I told him about these new ones I had so I purposely kept making noticeable sounds that he'd normally complain about and I'd say did you hear me making all that noise...... He didn't. Long story short. These are WINNERS to me as they are light on/in my ears background noise is minimal compared to the other pairs I've worn and used. I also like the fact that the charging case holds the charge as well and indicates the battery life. A big bonus is that they also connect to my tablet so I'm now able to watch shows without disturbing anyone else. The case is a nice size compared to others I've purchased in the past as I'm able to carry them in my pocket. Would I recommend these .... ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY would!!! Great price for a GREAT product... Bravo to the company who made these. I'm now looking forward to my next 2 staycations with my Tablet and these New Bluetooth earbuds. I LOVE THEM
5,Easy to set up.  Great sound.
4,So far they‚Äôre good
5,This is the first pair I bought so I don't know what to compare them too. I do like them. The battery life is great.
5,I love my headphones went to buy a second pair and they went up $22. Why?? But other h the an that I‚Äôm in love with my running headphones.
5,These are the BEST earbuds I've ever owned! I recently went through two different other brands and they didn't even compare. I absolutely have to have music for my runs and they did not disappoint! I listen to music around 50% of the day so of course I'm picky when it comes to hearing my jams. The sound quality is great the fit is spot on and the charger is an added excellent bonus!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†So far so good
5,Using for the first time. Setup was easy and fit is nice. Instructions seam good.
5,Nice sound comfortable!
5,Fit great charge quick and hold a charge... The sound they put out sounds akin to over ear headsets... big recommend
5,Will be happy to try this product out coming in the near future. So far the ease of connection and quality is great!
5,It‚Äôs great good sound quality and comfort.
5,I love how easy it is to pair these to your device. And the different size pads for the ears make sure you get a good fit. They stay put in my ears even when I‚Äôm outside working in the garden. Good sound. Price couldn‚Äôt be beat and the fact they come with a lifetime warranty is great too. I don‚Äôt think I could have gotten a better product at a better price anywhere.
4,Great sound
4,Decent sound quality and fairly comfortable to wear.
5,Comfortable and stay in my ear.
5,Great sound great battery life. The best part for me is when you put them in the case and close it they actually turn off and charge. Something many I've bought don't do is turn off when put in the case and closing it which is veryfrustrating. The best I've had and you can't beat the price. Also highly rated on best earbuds list. Deservingly so.
5,Noise canceling isnt bad and the sound is pretty good for the price they are i will definitely buy and again and recommend to friends
5,Comfortable as they fit over the ear
4,Sound is good and easy to connect
3,Not noise canceling. Sound wasn't the best but ok for the price. Battery life is superb! I had problems with them staying connected while I did chores around the house. They would randomly disconnect and I would have to pair them agai. For some reason the ear hook came off the speaker.
4,Just got them today.  I'm surprised just how good they sound.
4,The sound on these earbuds are really nice.
4,These are really comfortable and have good fidelity.
4,Work good.  Comfy fit. Nice sound quality
5,They arrived quickly and in a secure package. They are sleek and quite beautiful in my opinion. They are easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound is amazing. I tested the range by leaving my phone on the first floor and going up to the second floor and they stayed connected with no interference. I prefer earbuds that wrap around the ear so they don't fall out. I cannot wait to wear these during my long runs!!
5,The reviews were good so it was an easy choice for headphones. They arrived in a timely manner fully charged and ready for use. From working out to working these headphones are great in the noise canceling department. I will buy a 2nd pair just in case these are ever missing.
4,These are awesome there loud nice base stays in my ear me and my wife love them will be purchasing more.
4,Haven‚Äôt used yet. Charging up. Look nice
5,I love that you recharge the earpieces directly from the case and it gives you battery life.
5,I love these.  They fit well around the ear - no more feeling like they are going to fall out of your ear.  The sound is great.  To switch/stop/etc the button 'clicks' as opposed to being just touch sensitive which is a pain whenever you touch the earbud just to adjust it.  The battery life is better than expected and the box as well as the buds remain charged even after weeks of no use.
4,As expected for the price point.
4,Comfortable. Fits well.
3,I liked the product.  It worked well and I loved the sound.  At first one bud went out.  It wouldn't even charge.  I went with just the one remaining for a while then it completely died.  Not a very long life.
4,The sound quality is great
5,These are the best Bluetooth set I've ever used  the sound is amazing and the battery life is beyond good.
4,Work great and sound great!

5,The earbuds work well have good sound good fit and good storage. I'm happy with the purchase so far (1 month)
4,
3,Great for talking on the phone or watching videos. Not the best for good quality music in my opinion. I have trouble keeping them secure if I‚Äôm doing anything very active. The charging case is great though. No issues with connectivity. Overall pretty good.
5,These earbuds fit well and the sound quality is good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out.
4,They are very comfortable so far. I will write more once I have them for a while.
4,Great for working out
5,So far it's been one day but I'm a big fan of these headphones.  Great bass.  Great noise canceling.  Worked very well for Android Samsung S10. Love that it came with an extended warranty.  I did use an equalizer on my phone which it complimented very well.  Set up was super fast and easy.
5,Thought I‚Äôd treat myself to new earbuds (within my budget) and what a treat. I was not expecting the sound that comes from them. Bought them for running and mowing the grass. Fit perfect. I would recommend!!
5,The earphones work great and the price is amazing. I was expecting to have to pay a lot more for bluetooth earphones but these were perfect. The charging case is sturdy and I love the sleekness of it. Its easy to navigate to different songs while listening to music and adjust the volume. Overall a great set of earphones.
4,Good sound quality
3,I have been very pleased by how these bluetooth wireless headphones fit in my ear.  I wear them while working in my office while driving (only one ear) and while working in my woodshop.  I also enjoy the functionality of the case and easy of charging.However the bluetooth connection has been somewhat glitchy.  It will sometimes drop the connection between youtube videos and sometimes when on a phone call.  If I get in my car while using the headphones for a call it will not seamlessly transfer the call to the car but instead causes a lot of weird feedback until I power off the earpiece.  Whereas some some of this could be an issue with my phone (Android) I don't not have these issues with any other bluetooth devices used by my phone.
5,He tenido auriculares costosos sin embargo tenia muchas expectativas de comprar unos econ√≥micos pero que se ajustaran a mis exigencias qued√© fascinado con este producto la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a es impresionante as√≠ como su calidad de sonido.
5,Just got the earbuds. So far so good. Came with 100% charge which is great!
5,Fit well. Easy to connect. Great sound. Connects to Siri. Charging case with magnetic connect. Seems great so far! I always have trouble with your phones staying in my ears and these appear to fix the problem. Which should make them good for working out but I haven‚Äôt tried them yet. But sound seemed great and I love that it connects to Siri.
5,Excellent sound. Easy to use.
5,I‚Äôve just opened the box and popped the buds into my ears. They work perfectly out of the box. Very comfy on the ears. Very nice sound. Love having the battery life and charge status in front at eye level. I‚Äôll come back at a later time to grade noise canceling and battery life.
5,Easy to use really good sound and long lasting battery. Great product for the price.
5,Hubbys acct but wife bought them lol they are amazing. Sound is great can‚Äôt hear our big John Deere mower over them my sole purpose of getting them. I am very satisfied with them. You can use just one of them if need to for whatever reason.
5,Very comfortable when using and doesn't move or fall out no matter what exercise I do.
5,this is a good quality product i am grateful my coworker told me abt it.
5,Just needed something better than my regular ear buds because they kept constantly falling out of my ears when working out and since they are touch control re-adjusting was a pain. Quick search on the zon‚Äô and I found these on sale. Good sound great price responsive buttons and most importantly they stay put while exercising. Happy with these and would recommend!
4,Not bad
5,Rizizi headphones are awesome I love them.
5,Comfortablegood fit. Great sound
5,Worth every penny! Sound quality is on par with more expensive brands! Finally can ride my lawn mowers and work on my pool without worrying about one falling out! I have multiple sets of Bluetooth headphones with one earbud. Can‚Äôt believe what a great warranty! Now there‚Äôs piece of mind it will be replaced if lost or damaged!
5,The battery life is excellent and combined with the charger case they last for days. The sound quality is excellent too with plenty of base. The bluetooth connection is easy to manage and it has a good range.
5,Great sound and battery life. Use it for work and I love it. Got it on prime day at a great price. I have no worries about it falling fits on my ear Amazing.
5,Great headphones. Love the size convenience & functionality! A+ all around!My ears are oddly shaped and don‚Äôt hold the ‚Äúbud‚Äù style headphones in place; especially when working/running/lifting weights etc.  These are a nice alternative.
5,Super Easy to set up.Very nice sound on music and during calls. I was pleased that the mic on phone calls worked well.Finally  the fit and light weight make this easy on my ears.Overall  very pleased.
5,These are great for working out. They stay in your ears and are sweat proof!
5,Build quality is good pairing is seamless sound quality is exceptional with great bass very comfortable to wear all day if needed. The only thing I'd say could be improved it the charging case lid hinge. It works well but if something ever breaks I would say it will be the hinge. These buds are still well worth the cost!!
5,He likes them
5,Similar to my powerbeat pro but fraction of the costUpdate: 6/15/22Even better then my initial thoughts once I used the correct size ear inserts for my ears! The bass is amazing I‚Äôve been using the medium size inserts which sounds good but with the large the seal around my ear is much better. Sounds like a completely different set of headphones!I would pick these over my old powerbeat pros any day!
5,Excellent value for the price.  Easy set up for bluetooth.  I use these while working out and with hooks over the ears you never have to worry about falling out.  Would recommend to others
5,Great sound quality. Stay in place while running. Feel good.
5,So comfortable! I love the ear hook that keeps them in place. It‚Äôs so nice to not have to worry salt then falling out as I do things like exercise and chores. I only gave a four foot battery life because I haven‚Äôt used them enough to get an idea of it.
3,Not the best but they work well for my teenager who is always losing everything
5,Excellent product that meets your specifications I recommend it for any sports enthusiast. It fully meets expectations quality material good battery life comfortable and good sound.It works very well the charge lasts a long time it lasts for me about 7 hours with a single charge and constantly playing it connects very easily to my devices and the sound is good. Also I like that the charging case shows you the battery percentage and when the headphones are charging.It is more than I expected for the value the microphone sounds perfect the battery lasts a long time has lasted me all afternoon and part of the night with constant music and I have not had to charge the charging case is comfortable to carry even though it is a bit large for my liking. I have used them with my laptop and with my smartphone when I go out on all my devices even with my TV and they work great for me.I have also used them in the gym and when I go for a run they are comfortable and work quite well. Perhaps the only thing that I have noticed as "bad" is that sometimes they begin to lose a little signal even though they are charging well however I have reached 7 hours of continuous use with them and everything is fine.I bought it for its functionality while playing sports and it met all my expectations I recommend it.
3,The good:- Good bass- comfortable- Stays in place- Connects easily- Good battery lifeThe bad:- The case hinge feels really really cheap and I can already tell it's going to break soon- The "Power off" voice sounds really low quality- The audio isn't crispAll in all it's a product I don't dislike enough to return but on the other hand I don't like it enough to buy it again. I've gotten better for a similar pricepoint.
5,Very easy connection good quality and comfort. Good sound.
5,Great sound
5,I just received them today.  They were easy to pair with my iPhone.  I only use one earbud at a time.  I tried each by themselves and they seemed to work fine.  I generally use them for podcasts so the sound is fine for me.  I can't vouch for music yet.  Battery time is important to me because I sleep with them but I haven't tested that yet.  I will update this later if needed after longer use.
5,Work great noise canceling and nice sound!!
5,Earbuds are very nice! Pretty comfortable to wear and the functionality is pretty easy to use. These are pretty cool. I can use each one separately and charge separately when i need to. they connect to my phone and Chromebook pretty easy. The charging case keeps its charge for a while so i dont have to charge all the time either. Very nice for the price.
5,Good so far!
5,I love the fact these are affordable! Has great sound long battery life. No need to spend 100's these are just as good.... highly recommend!!!!
5,My  experience with this model of wireless earbuds was excellent it was easy to pair them with my smartphone. you simply remove them from the charging station and select them from your bluetooth menu and Instantly they pair.I bought this model because they have the ear loop to secure the buds into your ear channel. I found this bud remains secure in my ear and was comfortable at the same time. The loops are always too rigid. Not so with these. The ear loop is flexible and has a soft rubber coating for comfort.Sound quality so far looks good . Bass comes through nicely giving depth to music. Answering phone calls is a snap by simply clicking one bud or the other. That feature I like so I don't have to think about which one answers the call while I'm riding or training.Overall I'm very pleased so far with this product. battery life is excellent it lasts long 7 - 8 hours. The buds can operate independently so there is the option of using only one at a time which could solve any issue with battery life but at the cost of sound quality. This model is a good choice cost wise for what I'm using them for and that being a lot of outdoor activity which brings weather related hazards into play. If something happens to them I'm not out a lot of money. I'd simply buy another set.
5,I don't normally write reviews but for $22 I'm extremely impressed with these headphones. I wear them while I work and other headphones I've had have never really stayed in well. They had a tendency to fall out but these are perfect. They hold on nice and comfortably to my ear. They sound surprisingly good. I love that there is a volume control on the headphone itself. Can't beat these for the price
4,Decent
5,Excellent sound quality!
5,After debating Powerbeats pro I decided I could get similar style for far less $. The ear hook is comfortable sound is clear and pairing was super easy. Though you really don‚Äôt need the instructions- they aren‚Äôt laid out in the most logical order.
5,I really liked the fit & feel of them & they have ear hooks which keeps them secured even when I'm exercising. The sound is great & the battery lasts a long time.
5,Buen nivel de volumen  se fija muy bien a la oreja  buenos bajos.  El mejor que he probado en ese rango de precios
5,Wanted to try ear buds like these & with this price I couldn‚Äôt go wrong. I am so happy with my purchase! I even got rid of all my other ear buds because these do such a great job!
5,Not noise canceling. Blue tooth works great. I exercise up and down the pool lane at my health club.  Sound quality and battery life very good. Adjustable rubber tips for inside ear comfort.
5,The craftsmanship in this earbud is superb. I was hesitant about purchasing this because it was so inexpensive I thought I would be paying for junk. I got what I wanted very inexpensively I‚Äôm very happy I bought this. I would recommend this to everybody that‚Äôs looking for a sport earpiece very comfortable to use easy use in the battery life is excellent sound quality is clear I can‚Äôt say enough about it.
5,I am using them to listen to music while taking walks working in the yard or just relaxing while reading.  Also to receive phone calls while outside.  They are comfortable to wear & the ear loops ensure they stay in place.
5,These are great if you like running! they wont fall out and stay in place. Seeing if they will stand the test of time.
5,Does exactly what they promise it will do. Great sound for the price and good mic too
5,I really like how sharp the bud case looks after unwrapping the package. Bud case showed charged at 30% by display. Display reads very clear
5,So far I love it! Sound is smooth and perfect bass. Sits comfy on ear and doesn‚Äôt hurt.Connects easily. No complaints. It‚Äôs great! Don‚Äôt know about battery life for now as I‚Äôm using them just several days
5,Sound quality is great and noise cancellation is awesome when mowing the lawn! Thinking of buying a second pair.
5,These are my 3rd or 4th set of ear buds. All others kept falling out of ears limited play time prior to needing recharged and limited noise cancellation.  These have covered all these other company deficiencies.  I love them.
5,I just received the product today and barely used it. Not sure it‚Äôs longevity yet. They look really nice and are comfy. The sound is pretty good especially for the price. If everything stays in tact after at least 6 months. I can leave a proper review.
5,I like the feature that charger case does not need to be plugged into an AC outlet to charge the earbuds. Have been using it for a month and still working well.
5,Very good product simple to use love that it has a volume control on each earbud and the easy to read battery display is a great feature. Very comfortable to wear great bass and over all sound while playing music and talking on phone. Glad I bought these.
5,Earbuds arrived in good condition and are easy to pair with my phone and laptop. Sound quality is loud and clear. The case comes not fully charged less than 20% but that is expected. Would recommend these earbuds if you're looking for an affordable pair of over-ear Bluetooth earbuds.
5,Amazed with the quality! Don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling off like AirPodPro
5,Very excellent quality both sound n product itself! So glad that I ended up choosing these out of the ones I choose from. The sound is amazing clear n loud bass is great!! Very easy to use n love the charging info displayed it helps alot
5,The bass is great they are very easy to use overall happy with the product!
5,Better than other I have used.  Reliable excellent sound quality and the charging display is very useful.
5,Finally an inexpensive pair of earbuds that have great sound!  I‚Äôm very impressed and happy with my purchase.
5,Very pleased with the Rizizi earbuds. Exceeded my expectations.Update:  changed to 5 stars after listening to earbuds costing twice as much as Rizizi. Have listened to music podcasts and audiobooks to great enjoyment.
5,They fully charged in 2 hours as advertised easy to connect to Bluetooth. The charging case is going keep them protected when not wearing them. Bought them for listening to audio books and music
5,Just got them a few minutes ago easy to set up easy to charge sound fabulous the rest of it I don't know yet
5,I ordered these because they fit over the ears as I‚Äôve had no luck with earbuds that fit in the ear. I didn‚Äôt expect them to sound as good as they did. Going to order a second pair in case I loose them!
5,Headphones Sound Great fit comfortably and I love the digital screen on the charging case! Most definitely best for the price!
5,Have been using the buds for a month and battery life is great the display helpful the piece fits in my ear well and sound quality is great. If I could change anything it'd be nothing.
5,Unlike the $100+ earbuds I bought before these they connect quickly and easily and are simple to operate. They're not bulky or heavy at all. I love them.
5,Great product
5,I love the fact thay it has a hard case. The ability to wirelessly charge the case is a great option. Having a lifetime warranty is great as well. I love the fit. It's great in my ear.
5,All components are sturdy and attractive. Instructions provided are clear and thorough.The fit is comfortable and secure. Good purchase!
5,I‚Äôve been looking for wireless earbuds that don‚Äôt fall off at the gym. These are perfect and the sound is amazing! I highly recommend this product!
5,So far they are great. Sound is fair comfort is real good and they look like they are well made product. I would buy them again if they are still available after they quit working.
5,Sounds amazing!
5,I really like the noise cancellation because when you work out and do other stuff you can really focus and listen to music
5,For the price these are the best. The charge last for hours! The sound is decent and you could also use one bud while the other charges. These are amazing for the price!
5,I brought these earbuds to listen to music while on my 6 hours trip on a plane. The quality sound is great and the use of the case to recharge my earbud 4x over again without the worry of and USB is fantastic.  Worth the price and would highly recommend.
5,I have had previous ear buds that never last very long on the battery but these are very good. I use these to listen to music and podcasts while I'm quilting and love them.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Just recieved today have now tested two wireless earphone products..pretty solid
5,Love the case with the battery level on outside. Earbuds sound great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The battery life is amazing the sound is so awesome and it tunes out everything else around me so I can focus on my music. They are amazing for working out literally they won‚Äôt fall out my ear no matter what work out I‚Äôm doing. These are a great investment and I‚Äôm so glad that I purchased them.
5,Used for working out and for working in the yard.
5,I like everything about the product  but the case is a little bulky.
5,Initial review of these headphones is great. Great overall sound. I love that the case charges the headphones without having to be plugged in (unless it needs charged). It claims that the case will charge the headphones several times so I'm interested in seeing how many. They paired quickly to my Samsung phone which I've had trouble pairing other headphones that easily. Overall a great product!
5,Love it so far. No ear buds falling out of my ears!
5,I purchased a set for my wife because I was pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality.
5,Very happy with the RIZIZI earbuds. Good sound and comfortable to wear.
5,They are comfortable and the volume goes up loud enough.
5,I liked the clarity and I'm using as as earbud to answer my cellphone
5,So far so good!  Only had them one day to be determined!
5,I absolutely love these. I bought them for working out something that will stay in my ears when I move around a lot. The sound blows my mind. I can't go past 50% volume because the sound is so good.  These are just as good as Beats.
5,Treble is noticeably clear. It handles base well. I feel it sits more flush in my ears when slightly turned upwards (counter clockwise for the right earbud and clockwise for the left earbud). The bluetooth range is quite far when connected to my imac. Extremely happy with the purchase! oh and the warranty's customer service is considerate and attentive.
5,I ordered for the battery life but got so more than I expected. The battery life is amazing. The fit and over-the-ear style is awesome. The fit is comfortable.
5,Great sound and comfortable fit! Stays securely on my runs and allows me to listen while getting work accomplished in the office! I loving knowing exactly how much battery life is available ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5,Very satisfied with this product.  Easy to pair with phone the sound is good and comfortable around ears
5,It will disconnect for some strange reason.
5,Easy to wear stay in place  holds charge long time. Can recharge on  wireless pad
5,The bass is incredible! These are better than my $100+ earbuds. If you like bass test these with a song called " Bring" by Randomer.  Great deal... getting another pair! I just unboxed them I'll send an update if they suck as time goes by.
5,This earphone is purely amazing. I really like the case for the earphones. It gives me live update on the battery status and it supports wireless charging! So cool!
5,So far I have enjoyed how well the work and they are comfortable to wear
5,I really love these headphones. I like them better than my firecore set.  These arrived at a really opportune time as my backup pair of spidoc headphones broke.  One thing I like about these is the harder case for protection.  I am positive my spidoc set got a little squished in my pocket. The sound on this pair is very nice. They are also comfortable and don't pinch my ears after a long time wearing them. I think these earbud are good for long wear times. I do not focus much on quality of sound and all that kind of stuff so all I can say is that these are more than adequate for my needs. They are good at blocking outside noise which I like but this also means to be careful of surroundings. The charge display is nice looking and seems to charge just fine. My other set will not fully charge from a cable but only from using a charge pad. This new set does not have that problem. I love that they have a separate physical volume button on them. Over the ear earbuds are the only kind I use so that is nice too. They stay on my ear and I do not have to constantly adjust and fix them for comfort.
5,Good! I like the case and the digital display.  I have ear plugs and it is comfortable even with the plugs
5,If you are looking for Bluetooth earphones you should not look elsewhere.  This set is for you.  I highly recommend these earphones.  First of all the sound quality of these earphones is excellent.  The treble and bass of the sound is great!  I love listening to music when I work out at gym.  I am enjoying working out even more with the excellent quality of the sound.Also the battery status shown on the front of the case is very convenient.  I love this feature.  Not a lot of earphone cases come with this feature.  This feature helps me to decide whether to charge or not.  These small details that this manufacturer puts is very customer care minded.  I am very appreciated about this.I don‚Äôt have to say anything about the price of these earphone.  The price is just right and very affordable.Lastly I really like the straps as part of the earphone.  I understand that some people don‚Äôt like these straps that go over the ears.  However these are double protecting the units.  As I mentioned I love listening to music when I work out.  I also jog.  This prevents from falling down from my ears.I highly recommend this product.
5,I have tried many earbuds.  Some much more costly than these.  I believe I have finally found a set that do NOT hurt my ears!! Highly recommend.
5,I was looking for a quality wireless headset at a decent price. And I found it in these. The sound quality is amazing. I have a hard time finding ones that don‚Äôt hurt my. These are so comfortable and they provide extra cushions. Extremely satisfied!
5,Super happy with the look and feel! Quality product for the price.
5,I get a new pair of earbuds about once a year. This year's acquisition is the best yet. I'll get right to it.PROS:- The sound quality is the best yet. Videos play clearly. Friends can hear me clearly on the phone and I can hear them clearly.- Wraparound earbuds are the best. I can't stand earbuds that try to fit in your ear without being secured. These earbuds fit snugly but comfortably so.- The on-earbud controls -- namely power and volume -- are both responsive and easy to use.- Battery life is spectacular. I've used these consistently for days and the charging case remains almost full. These would be absolutely perfect for something like a camping trip where the case will successfully give you numerous recharges without needing a power source.- The case is compact and the display provides clear live updates about charging status.CONS- I was skeptical about the case's ability to stay closed. It primarily uses a tension+magnet system to close. I prefer zippers. This is ticky tacky.- The case display is perhaps a bit brighter than I'd like. Again this is a very small concern.On the whole these are great and a slam-dunk choice.
5,I loved this product for the comfort and fut and also for the rubber coating on the charging case so it's non slip. Also it has a lifetime warranty
5,I was skeptical in buying an off brand ear buds because of poor sounds quality but this one exceeded my expectation. It does have a good bass and noise cancelling. This is perfect for working out!
5,Works great and battery lasts about 4 to 5 hours
5,I love that the sound is clear and that they stay in place comfortably even when running
5,Amazing! They stay in your ear and have great sound quality.
5,These are great headphones for the $30 price range. The charging case is a nice size the wireless charging on the case works quite well.  I would recommend using a smaller qi charger for this as the small footprint can make using larger ones a bit of a challenge got get them lined up.  The usb c connection provides fast charging to the case.  The sound quality is good for the price point.  My only criticizem is I wish there was more deep bass.  This is a problem with most headphones at this price point.  Other than that the sound quality is great.  The fit is nice and they come with 3 interchangable tips.  Call quality and sound is good.  I tried using this as a bluetooth alternative and I personally would not use this while driving as it does a good job of noise cancellation. You block a bit of surrounding noise while wearing these.  I used them at the gym walking the dogs jogging etc. They are comfortable they stay in place and they have a decent range.  I have not noticed any signal loss with these as you do with some headphones at this price point.  These headphones are a great alternative to the typical ear buds.
3,Only issue is that certain sounds make the speakers pop and become very loud and static sounding.  Most of the time they are perfect.
5,These are really good earbuds.  I wasn't expecting the sound quality to be as good since they are inexpensive earbuds.  I use them at work to listen to podcasts so that I don't disturb others in my office. They do a great job of blocking out the outside noise.  The sound is clear and crisp.I have also used them for phone calls and when asked if they could hear me clearly the answer was yes.  The battery seems to hold up well. I love that it has a battery meter on the front of the case and that you can see the battery level of each earpiece.  The buttons work better than any ear pods I've used thus far.  The middle power button works very well and isn't overly sensitive.  I've not used the volume buttons as I usually use the keyboard on my computer.They fit well into my ears.  The earpiece helps them stay in place as I have another set of in-ear buds that tend to pop out of my ear at times.  The headphones come with an instruction manual a USB-c charger and several removable earbuds.
5,Love the sound quality! Love the design which makes it easy to stay in place and not having to worry about it falling out of my ear.
5,I've only just started using these but I'm quite happy with them so far. They're comfortable and both the earbuds and the case have a nice quality tactile feel about them. Much nicer than I was anticipating.
5,They are quieter than I expected. I guess I was expecting to hear concert level sound. It's just right for phone calls or listening to audio/video privately
5,I received the item and tried it. The sound is clear and the earbuds are light. So far I like it.
5,Really like these earbuds!  They were easy to pair with my Android tablet.  The earloops fit very comfortably for hours even while wearing my eyeglasses.  The earbuds stay in place and they don't pop out of my ears.  Great clear sound quality with several volume levels.  I could even hear while a television was playing at a normal level in the same room.  While listening to my playlist I walked to the end of my yard (approx 162 ft) and there was no distortion.  I can walk through the house listening to programs without having to carry my device around with me.After using the earbuds for about five hours the battery usage was only 26%.  The earbuds can also be used together or they can be used separately which is great if you don't want to totally block out all sound.  It is also very helpful that the case which can be charged wirelessly shows the amount of charge remaining on it as well as on the earbuds - no more guessing and running out of power unexpectedly.Reviews are very useful to me and I heavily rely on them when purchasing most online products.  Hopefully this information will help someone in their search.
3,I bought these because of the ear loops. The regular rear buds always fall out of my ears.  Battery life is amazing! Still on the first charge a week later.But here's why I hesitate to give it even 3 stars.The bass advertised seems to be missing in the pair I received.Let channel has problems connecting to Bluetooth without the right channel.During phone calls the audio cuts in and out even with the phone right next to me.
5,I‚Äôm just trying these out but I can tell already that I like the way they fit and feel much better than my old Apple wireless earbuds.
5,My husband just purchased  these and he loves them. They fit more secure than his apple air pods and the sound is great. What a great value!‚Äô
5,Nice looking and comfortable setWill come back to update once I charge and use earbuds.After using earbuds It made me feel like I had made a great purchase the sound is amazingly good. A lot better than I expected
5,These earbuds have excellent sound the bass rocks! They hold a charge all day and they stay in my ears without falling out.Fast shipping too they arrived a day early
5,I like the way the are secured behind the ear I don‚Äôt need to worry about them falling off while I‚Äôm working out. The sound quality is great nice and clear
5,Earbuds fit well and feel unshakable for working out. Sound quality is acceptable for workout listening.  Instructions are in readable English.  Pairing was simple.
5,Long battery life.Sound quality the best out of all my earbuds. They stay in place quite well
5,It is a pretty good product and I would give it a 10/10
5,Fit is good and sound quality seems better than other buds I own.

5,Ready to use 3 min out of the box. Easy pairing love that both earbuds have identical controls so I can use one at a time when needed. Sound is amazing. Using for phone calls for work hoping that sounds just as good. Will update review if I have any issues.
5,Shipped fast linked easily easily to figure out linking and settings. Perfect for what I need and at a great price
5,Quick shipping‚Ä¶arrived 100% charged and ready to go‚Ä¶ paired easily and sound great
5,The charge life is great the sound quality is great overall a very nice product!
5,Quality ear buds.  Would highly recommend.
5,Very nice wireless electronic ear buds with clear crisp sound and volume. I love the charger case because it allow about 3-4 recharges of my earbuds without being recharged.
5,The headphones work great and I am able to use them while working out.  I sweat a lot and needed something that would work during my workouts and doing yardwork.
5,Fits very comfortably. Sound quality is great and love the volume control on the earbud itself.
5,For the price they are pretty incredible as far as sound comfort and ease of use. Plus the speed of charging and the case charging without having to be plugged in is a massive win.
5,Sound quality good and they stay in your ears!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Just got the headphones the other day and love them.  The sound is so crisp and clear very well made.  The case is the best part in my opinion.  It has the ability to show me the battery life of the headphones and the battery life of the charging case as well.  No more wondering how much battery life is left in either product.  In addition the charging case can be charged wireless as well!!! That is another great feature of these headphones and case.  The individual volume buttons on each ear piece is very convenient and makes it easy to adjust the volume.  The headphones block out the outside noise extremely well so I can stay in the moment with my music or whatever I am listening to.  They fit comfort in the ear and have extra rubber pieces to change out to fit more snug depending on your ear.  I have done intense cardio and weight training with the headphones and they do not fall out during strenuous activities.  I really like the style of the headphones very sleek and stylish IMO.  I would recommend these over and over again.  Thanks Rizizi!!!!
5,So far the fit and the sound has been fantastic! It‚Äôs a super good deal for the price!

5,I really liked the ear clip it holds the bud securely in place and actually holds until removed.
5,There light on the ears and sound great
5,Excellent sound quality! Well balance with music podcasts & calls. I love the digital meter which makes it easier to determine how much juice you have left.

3,Great sound. Loved them but they hurt my ears the way they were made. It's probably just me. Other than that I would have kept them. Doesn't seem to be big cimaint in the reviews about how they fit so it might just be me
3,Sounds  good battery life good for the wars good
5,Works great! Enjoying listening to my audiobooks :)
5,Really nice that they charge in the case
5,Sound quality is pretty good and they paired really easily worth the price.
5,These headphones are dope! They fit perfect in my ear  they are loud and noise cancelling. Very easy instructions and set up.
5,I'm a big fan of these wireless headphones. The headphones are very comfortable and never fall out when I am running. Bluetooth connects immediately to my phones and it comes with multiple different earbuds so you can adjust to your specific ear size and shape. The sound is really great for the price and also works pretty well when answering phone calls. I enjoy the convenience of being able to pause and change songs by tapping the buttons on the headphones. The battery life is more than enough and it charges fairly quickly. I also love that it comes with the charging case as you can charge the headphones anywhere even without plugging the charging case in. A nice touch is that the case displays the percentage of charge that it is so you know when you need to charge the case. I also like that the headphones are separated (not attached with a cord like other similar headphones) so you can only have one in your ear if you would like. Overall a very good pair of headphones for a cheap price!
5,Sound is great and they are great for the price.  Love that the case is a battery as well.
5,Easy to setup.  Sound is AWESOME
5,Awesome purchase
5,Charging case is a little  big. Sound is great. Easy to use and paired to my phone very easy.
5,Great shipping time and product for the price. Maybe not the best earbuds out there but very good all things considered.
5,Good quality and long battery life. I like how it has a clip over the ear so the earbuds don‚Äôt fall out as easily.
5,So far so good loud like I wanted good bass and the button on the side was super easy to click.
5,Just listened for the first time and the sound quality was good
5,Perfect for workouts cycling and casual listening. Great charging case design. Comfortable fit and secure fit on ears. Would recommend great value.
5,Amazing sound quality
5,Purchased these to replace I Beats Pro which were mothing but a cluster**** to operate. So far no issues using them for 2 plus hours a day. Very comfortable. Nice to view the charge level outside of the case. Can't beat the price and highly recommended
5,Great audio quality would recommend for people with a flexible budget.
5,The one step pairing was simple and quick. Commands are straightforward. Sound quality is very good.
5,Love the sound from these ear buds.  Love the charging case and they are very comfortable to wear.

5,Great product arrived quickly easy to operate and so far working great for my gym time

5,So far I love these earbuds. The sound is great and they are very easy to use.
5,I am so impressed with the quality and sound of these headphones. They are so easy to use and go perfectly with my new 10 inch fire tablet. Set up is a breeze!!
3,Not bad for the price but it‚Äôs annoying inside the ear.
5,Very loud. Great clarity. Great pricing. Great for working out or just blocking out the world.
3,I only used these buds at the gym and alternated Left and Right each time.So in 5 months "maybe" 40 hours each? Right earbud stopped charging. Fortunately I bought the extra 3 year protection. I had to purchase the same pair again because I tossed the box long ago and needed it to return.BUT the 3 Year protection is no longer offered which leaves me feeling less than confident as to how long they'll hold up.
5,I use this primary on long walks. Wind noise is minimal and the sound and separation is fantastic. Extremely happy with these.
5,Just got these during Amazon Prime days they seem great so far!  Clear sound and easy to use.
2,Easy to use like the case and they stay in my ears awesome.The bluetooth on them sucks.  The range is terrible compared to other bluetooth headphones that I have like I walk away 5 feet from my phone and they they start cutting out.My biggest complaint though is while running with them which is the main reason I bought them.  The headphones do not stay linked/paired while running and even sometimes while walking.  So be running with them and its pretty constant that one side will kick out for a second or two and then link back up.  It even happens at times when walking with my dogs.  It's really annoying to have one or two headphones linking up or not being linked and slightly behind the other one.  I would stay away from these headphones for working out/running.  I have had other pairs that did not do this a single time while doing the same tasks yet alone constantly.  Normally walk with my phone in my pocket and run with the phone in an armband...
5,As I said before sound quality and battery life. Just start using this device will update later
5,Good secure fit good quality of sound. Price was part of the reason I purchased these and they are worth it.
5,Awesome exactly wat I had ordered
5,Connected one earbud at a time and works awesome!  Easy to use too!  Better range than many other brands.
5,Got it and already love it! Snugs over ear very loud and charges quickly! Like visual so I know how much I have until I need to charge and the volume setting.
5,So far my earphones are working good. I will update once I‚Äôve used them a month.
5,Nice that it fits into a case to charge good sound quality.
5,High quality sound convenient hooks for the ears very comfortable to wear without having to worry about them falling out of my ears.
5,Great for walking & working out. Music ok. These stay in and on my ears - Priceless!
5,Compact easy to use and pair. Comes with a lifetime warranty. Clear audio. Great headphones especially for the price point.
5,These are the best ear buds I've ever had. They fit comfortably have Excellent sound and they are very affordable.
5,I love the box they come in. Fits snug and sounds great.
5,These are some of the best earbuds I've had in a long time. I look forward going to the gym. I would recommend these to anyone.
5,Sound is great quality and easy to set up (pair) with my device.
5,Wraparound style is for workouts.  Sound and battery life are both great for the price.  I'll  know about longevity eventually.
3,The sound quality for music is great. Couldn‚Äôt be better. But anyone i call complains that the sound on their end is muffled.
5,These earbuds sound great and very comfortable
5,I don't use this for working out but it works very well. The sound quality is great.  I haven't owned it long enough to comment on the battery. So far it's great!
5,Love having all functions on each earbud!! Sound is great. Range could be better but works fabulously for me!
5,Sounds is very good and this stays on my ears which makes exercise a breeze
5,Great earphones so far. Still to soon to tell though.
5,I bought these on Prime Day and glad I did. Comfy and good sound plus decent distance.
5,They sound good and don‚Äôt cut out on Bluetooth. Would buy again.
5,Arrived very quickly and the storage case was already fully charged. They‚Äôre very comfortable and I‚Äôm looking forward to using them.
5,Great price for wireless earbuds and the digital charging display that appears is a fantastic quality of life feature
5,Wow great sound long lasting earphones!  Glad I was recommended by Amazon for these!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†If you like great sound quality & comfortable headsets these are a good brand to buy. When you are working out or at work these wireless headsets are great to last you for 9+ hours that is a full days work and there is no need to have to recharge them until your shift is over. Even for wearing them for a long period of time they don't hurt too much. The charging case is a little bit big for my taste but I do like how it shows you the percentage of the battery in the case and that it displays when the headsets are charging! They also hold on to your ear very nicely it doesn't feel like the headphones might fall from your ear. They are perfect for when your running or any other exercise activity so that when your in motion they don't come off easily as some other headphones do! They style of these headphones are very neat they don't feel like it's heavy on your ears! So hopefully this review helps you to buy this product I don't see any down side to getting this product.
5,The sound quality is great. Very easy to use.
5,Work well so far
5,Very good sounds quality stable ear support and good price
5,Great product and sound. Charging box is a game changer And very comfortable to wear.
5,Right out of the box these are perfect. Paired easily to my android. So far I'm thrilled.
5,The headphones are fantastic. Super easy to setup and very lightweight. Great sound quality as well.
5,Well madeGood price
3,Seriously it's BAD.  Reminds me of the free headsets airlines pass out on request: tinny hollow and with no bass of note.  Apparently all the walking thumbs giving these junky knockoffs FIVE HUGE STARS are hearing impaired have terrible taste in music or only use them for audio books or podcasts.  If that's you by all means enjoy this mediocre product.  You can and should do better.
5,So far so good. Just received this product and it shipped fast and works great!
5,Great Fit and comfortable....
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Realmente esta es una exelente inversion  estos audifonos respetan la calidad y la funcionabilidad que deben tener unos audifonos. Primero son exteremadamente comodos al oido  de manera que cuando llevas unos minutos con ellos se te olvida que los traes puestos. Segundo buena calidad  buen balance entre bajos y agudos si desea aumentar los bajos solo cambie las almuadillas por otras mas grandes o a la inversa si desea mas agudos. Hago llamadas de exelente calidad y ni hablar de la duracion de las baterias me han durado la carga hasta 8 hrs increible. Realmente recomiendo este articulo es mucho mejor de lo que me imaginaba realmente supero mis expectativas. El estuche es formidable  carga inalambrica y muy suave al tacto  exelente idea la de poner indicadores de carga realmente ya se cuando estan totalmente cargados. Los audifonos emparejaron exelente con mi galaxy s21 ultra  es buen producto. Me gustaria solo que mejorara un poco en los agudos para que sean completamente superiores a los beats . Esta opinion no esta sugestionada por la compa√±ia digo lo que pienzo y totalmente recomiendo este a cualquiera que necesite buena calidad y exelente precio.
5,Fits nicely in the ears. Great at noise cancellation
5,Sound is great. Lightweight. So far so good
5,Like that had wireless charging good sound and stats well in my ears!
5,First delivery was timely as advertised.  Instructions included where easy to follow. No issues pairing with each other or my android phone. Wasn't fully charged when received but didn't expect it to. It was easy to charge and I did so on a wireless charger.I really like the digital display showing charging level and that each one is being charged.I've only had it for a week or so but find the audio very good. The ability to pause/play is useful and easy to do.  As is proceeding to next or previous track.  Also no need to power each off as they turn off when placing in charging case. Speaking of charging case is a vast improvement to the one I previous had. That one zipped and wore out quickly but this case is a hard shell and very compact.  Also I've had no issues with battery life and comfortable to wear.Lastly as long as they continue to perform as they are currently it will have been a wise and satisfying purchase. This is the 2nd one purchased from seller and nothing but good things to say & would recommend.
5,These earbuds are awesome! The sound quality is crystal clear and amazing. I love the look of these earbuds and especially the case. I love the hard covered case and that they seem well protected. Also I love that the case can charge while staying closed because the charging cable hookup is on the outside of the case. It's also nice to see the charging percentage on the outside of the case that way you know how much time is left for charging. I will say I miss the pocket netting on the inside cover to hold my extra earbuds and charging cable but that is just a minor thing. Another thing I notice is that when I have the earbuds pressed into my ears the part that goes around my ear is very loose and doesn't touch my ear. But maybe it's not supposed to. Thankfully these are extremely comfortable and don't rub against my ears. You can't beat the price on these earbuds! Definitely worth it and affordable.
5,stay in well sound great
5,The sound quality is like having a stereo system in your ears.  Wonderful.
5,Good sound quality and fit
5,I‚Äôm so tired of losing wireless headphones. These wrap around the ear and stay secure in your ears. The price was right too! I listen to podcasts and audiobooks a lot. These earphones allow me to move around and not worry about losing them. A very good value.
5,Fantastic.
5,Great quality! My nephew loves them! I bought 2 pair and they work great.
5,Awesome product. Sounds great and the phone option sounds clear as a bell
5,I loved these earbuds especially for listening to audio book on long drives
5,The sound and connectivity are excellent! Fast shipping and quality product
5,Only just received them but the sound quality is good and loud. They fit comfortably and securely on my ears
5,Like them so far
5,Very comfortable stays in my ears love the case gives me retro vibes. I use them for running and u can adjust the earbud sizes to fit your ear.
5,Great product
5,Fit and finish of earbuds and charger are nice .
5,The sound quality is so clear. Music has bass but the sound is crisp. Great purchase!
5,The product works great so far! I love the look and feel of both the charging case as well as the headphones themselves. Super easy to pair to my phone!
5,The battery life is amazing and the sound is great.
5,Sound quality is good. They are comfortable and light weight
5,Sounds and fits real well.
5,The quality of the product and the sound quality are both good.
5,Great
5,Just received this so I cannot comment on battery life. Easy setup great sound
3,These are just ok. I got them on Prime day so they were really cheap like 20$ so it isn't worth returning. My biggest complaint is that they don't contour to my ear enough so they sit just outside leaving a gap so not great. Beside that they are good.
5,Love the fit in my ears and the sound
5,Priced well and looks like a quality product. Now if they just hold up I'll be very pleased.
5,Pairing was very easy and fast. And I really like the sound quality!!!
5,Noise cancelling is excellent and it had rich sound
5,Works great so far
5,Cool earbuds
5,The sound and clarity is great. Easy to pair.
5,Excellent sound from such small headphones!  Easy set up comfortable fit.
5,Nice simple package.
5,They connected easily and sound is great
5,The earbud fit is snug and comfortable. They are easy to use for any purpose.
5,I am excited about using my new headset!!! Love it.
5,Good product for the price
5,So clear!  I love I am not connected with a cord.
5,I had the previous earbuds that this company made and I really liked those. But the company surely improved with these new updates! They clearly listened to their customers about the previous ones. These earbuds tell you how charged they are so that you are aware of when to charge them/charge the charger. I love the wireless ear buds because it makes working out at the gym so much easier! A lot of earbuds like Apple really hurt the inside of my ears quickly. But these are super comfortable! The price is also very affordable. Wireless earbuds are becoming a major trend Samsung and Apple have come out with theirs are are coming out with updates. They cost over $100! With my last pair of earbuds I lost one of them. I was upset but i would have been way more upset if I had spent over $100 on them. These are so affordable with amazing quality the same quality as air pods. The company is very reachable and customer friendly. I am extremely happy with my purchase time and time again from this company. Highly recommend!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†So comfortable I always worry about that since I wear glasses and I feel like the in ear only always easily fall out. These were great!
5,They arrived early and were easily paired to my phone. The sounds are great.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I ordered these headphones expecting what I paid for (which was about $30) and ended up being pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is comparable to that of my AirPods (which cost me a lot more than that) and the ear hooks are really useful when I go to the gym. The battery life is just as advertised (about an entire work day) and the case itself lasts about a week (which I‚Äôd estimate to say about 30-40 hours).These headphones are a good balance between too cumbersome to put in your pocket and too small that you end up losing them. Although the case seems a bit big the battery life is long enough that you don‚Äôt need to carry the case around. The hooks are perfect for outdoor activity and don‚Äôt stick out too much when wearing them. I really like how the headphones look and feel and I could easily go to sleep wearing them.All in all these headphones were an excellent purchase and I would highly recommend these. You won‚Äôt find better value on Amazon for headphones.
5,Looks and feels great on my ears. Easy to use and charge!
3,Played some music for ten minutes and put the ear hooks back in their charging case. The battery display percentage ticked down about 1% per minute. The sound and noise canceling were average at best.
5,Everything is great so far!  Soundfit and battery life.
5,They are what I ordered and we'll packaged and charged right out of the box.
5,I am very happy with these headphones.  Cycling I can use either the left or the right in order to still here the surrounding noise.  The sound is great very crisp and clear and the volume buttons on these bluetooths is an added plus.  They  have a simple  button placement for volume play pause next and previous track and have the common commands for taking or skipping junk calls. The ear pieces fit comfortably in the ear and I have no worry of them falling out when on the bike or working in tight spaces at the house.  The seem waterproof with I need due to the amount of exercise and exposure to perspiration.  The cordless charging is nice and I think the snap lid on the charging ports is a plus.  No zipping needed.  Setting up this device took less than a minute and the music was playing.  Havent had a single problem as of yet and have over 300 hours of playtime on them.  Great sound system for the price
5,Sound great and are comfortable
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I got these earpods and got more than expected. First of all the case looks great. The digital leds are and plus so you know how much battery left in the case and how much you had in your earpods. Second point they are very light. Sounds are very clean and strong. They fit very well great for workout like running cycling boxing heavy bag work everything that you need to move a lot and don't have your pods flying all the time.The volume control on top of the pods was the best part what saves you to care your phone on hands all the time. The battery last longer than others models and if do you need to use them for long time. You can choose one side it time and keep the other one charging at the case what gives you a lot playing time.If you are looking for a sport earpods don't miss this one.
5,My phone for music and tablet for movies.
5,These earbuds are comfortable and have good sound
5,Love these earbuds. The arm that wraps around the ear is great. I can't keep regular earbuds from falling out of my one ear. These work great!
3,Like the sound quality and noise canceling features. Battery don't last all-day and the charger dock needs work. You have to force it down to charge. Any bump or movement with discharge it and connect to your device unwanted
5,Great pair of headphones. Quality made very happy with the purchase!
5,Works great for price! Thank you!
5,The earbuds fit perfectly and sound amazing despite being at under half way volume
5,Impressive sound quality just purchased so can't rate battery life.User friendly easy pairing and good controls.
5,I just received these in the mail and paired them up with my phone. I love them already!! I'm heard of hearing and these are great!
5,Very comfortable good sound quality easy to use.
5,Good stuff
5,They sound great! They stay firm in my ears and are very easy to charge! I love them!
5,I am really enjoying the earbuds the sound is awesome and I really like the charging case
5,Great earbuds! The extra charges are convenient too.
5,I use these while I am walking
5,I like it so far. Too early for a final review
5,Great sound!  Fit securely on my ears!  Love them!
5,Great sound. Perfect for working out. Check size of the case
5,East to set up and great sound quality
5,Love these earbuds.. very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears easily like others
5,Nice little headphones. Easy to use. Make great gift. Happy with my purchase.
5,Good sound. Able to turn one off and only use 1 earphone.
5,Charged fine paired fine sounds fine.
5,Overall I really like these earbuds. I like them better than my Firacore Sport earbuds that I got at about the same price point ($30). They stay really secure in my ears and they look nice. I really like the dedicated volume buttons as I'm pretty bad at getting the "double click" speed right on earbuds that only have one multifunction button like my Firacore Sports.The sound quality seems nice but I am not an expert or someone who prizes really high sound quality. These earbuds are perfectly adequate for listening to music and podcasts.One small gripe I have is that between the 3rd and the 4th volume level (3rd click and 4th click up from silent) there is a much bigger jump in volume than between other levels. It's a little annoying but does not overly impact my satisfaction with the earbuds. Also you will need to be a bit gentle with the charging case as the lid's hinge feels a little flimsy but for $30 it's fine.
5,So far it is great. They are easy to pair and fit well in my ear and stay steady as I move.
5,The headset is amazing and the clarity and bass notes make it worth owning.
5,Love them they are awesomee!!
5,I use it for working out and taking conference calls.
5,Excellent sound safely secure around ears long battery life sleek charger box and great price!
5,Great headphones
5,Love the fit and feel
5,Great
5,I love them they work great!
5,Nice sound quality and easy volume control
5,Easy setup and wonderful sound
5,Works very well so far and doesn‚Äôt hurt my ears
5,These are some awesome ear buds! They charged quickly and provide a long amount of play time. The battery display lets you know exactly how much power is left in the ear buds preventing the hassle of having the ear buds die mid workout which we‚Äôve all experienced and we‚Äôve all been annoyed with.The quality of sound is great. The sound doesn‚Äôt get distorted at higher volumes and the volume is higher than any of the previous ear buds I‚Äôve owned. Additionally the bass levels are insane which also don‚Äôt distort the sound.They also come with 3 different sizes of the rounds for inside your ear. This ensures they fit properly through any workout. I lift weights run cycle and so far I‚Äôve no issues with them staying inside my ear. I also sweat a lot which often causes ear buds to fall out of my ear. The internal rounds and the ear clips create a close connection with my ear.Overall I‚Äôm very impressed with these ear buds and am happy about the purchase. You can‚Äôt go wrong with these.
5,Easy to connect great qualityCharges quick battery life is great
5,Everything is awesome with these sound quality is great battery life is great
5,Good price great fit excellent noise cancellation.
5,I run and jump while having these on. Great quality product
5,Great so far easy setup and connection and they sound great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Rizizi wireless sport headphones are a great buy with an excellent price.No set up needed just use the bluetooth capability and you are done.Extremely clear sound built in microphone to make/receive calls.The case is compact smaller than a pack of cigarretes and can recharge your earbuds several times.Earbuds are lightweight they stay in place even running each has its own control volume and on/off.Quality sound is great I didnt use all the volume up because they are powerfull. While turned on they can block other exterior sounds making the music more enjoyable. Box came with 3 sets or rubber ear caps in different sizes.It says to last 6-8hrs on a single charge but mine went over that easily.Exterior case display screen that shows earbuds total charge and case % left.Comes with USB charger cord type C but not the head you can use your phone's.Great for everyday use gym walk work travel
5,Awesome Bluetooth! Clear sound and mic is clear! Comparable to other higher price options
5,Worked well out of the box
5,Great sound
5,Love it! Works great!
5,So far so good. Seem to charge pretty quick too.
5,When you open the box the first thing you notice is the case. It‚Äôs sleek smooth and sturdy. I‚Äôve had other cases that seemed cheap this is not the case here. They also give you a charging cord but you need your own charger plug but anybody purchasing something like these would expect that.I run a good amount so comfort is important I took them out for a 3 mile run and were pretty comfortable. I prefer the type that hook around your ear so these were exactly what I was looking for. I wore both and the sound was clear. I really like that they pair individually as a lot of the time I only wear one while I run. I also used them on a job site to take calls. The worked as should and I didn‚Äôt have any issues. Overall for the cost these are excellent and I don‚Äôt see a reason to pay for a pair that might cost over $100 when these are available for a lot less.
5,They look sound and feel great
5,The sound is incredible. But like I said time will tell the story. And if they don't live up to their expectations I will be doing a second review.
5,Ear loops are flexible and comfortable. Sound quality is much better than expected!
5,Great ROBUST sound and comfortably fitting too!!
5,So far good battery life and sound quality
5,Great buy! Sound is clear and easy to use. Definitely worth mentioning to friends.
5,Great price. Good sound.
5,very happy with great charging
5,Very comfortable and sounds great!
5,So far so good. Great quality and sound. I have only been using for a day though so we'll see if it last.
5,Comfortable and easy to use
5,Stays in place decent sound quality too
5,These are for active work and lifestyle.
5,Fantastic value works great!
5,i got this the other day & waited a bit before putting up a review cuz i wanted to test it out for a few days first. i love them! super comfortable nice size not bulky reduces background noises not all but most of them. for instance my roommate sometimes snores (loudly) & i can't sleep so i'll listen to music or an audiobook. a couple other earphones i've tried i can still hear the snoring. they were also uncomfortable or would fall out. these felt fine even laying on side & they cut out most the snoring.these were super easy to pair to phone tablet & computer. i really also like the l.e.d. display of charge level. they charge super fast. they arrived at 100% charge. i streamed 5 hours of tv & they were at 80%. the sound is very very good. and phone calls are very clear. i am very happy with these & would recommend to family & friends.
5,Very good soundComfortableGreat battery lifeExcellent value
5,They work really well and are quite comfortable.
5,Bought for my teenager and he loves them!
5,Great fit price and sound quality. Love the lifetime warranty too!
5,Great quality sound and reasonably priced.
5,Use for work. Listen all day. Great battery life.
5,Great sound and very comfortable!
5,Feels high quality and was really easy to set up. I was able to use a usb-c I already have for my phone.
5,Recently I have been looking for a quality pair of headphones without having to break the bank. For the price these headphones are a steal! They fit comfortably and have great sound quality. I love that I can adjust the volume and change songs using the buttons on the headphones. This makes listening to music so much easier when I go on runs. The shape of the headphones ensures that they stay in place and do not fall off whenever I am running about. The headphones last for hours on one single charge. I also love that the case lights up and shows you how charged each individual ear piece is. Additionally if you are trying to conserve battery energy you can use one ear piece at a time. The headphones come with an instruction manual a USB-c charger and several removable earbuds. I like that the headphones came with several different ear buds so I can choose a size that best fits my ear. All in all these are a great pair of headphones at an even greater price.
5,Love how comfortable they are in my ears
5,Shipment arrived fast as was exactly as expected
5,Great product
5,IT IS GREAT. WEAR THEM WHEN I WORKOUT. EAR BUDS WON'T FALL OUT DUE TO SWEAT!!
5,Great Sound! keeps me on my feet at work
5,I like it I use it for listening audio books
3,It looks exactly like what I ordered and after reading the instructions it seems easy enough to follow. It is charging for the first time so I won't know more until the first time I use it. I will update this review once I have had time to see how well it works
5,I already had the previous model but lost one earbud so I got these bad boys. The charging case is very convenient and has a nice sleek feel to it very heavy duty so definitely protecting the headset just throw it into any bag. The charging display looks very 80s - haha it disappears after a bit so no problem if you dont like it or are bothered by the light. The fitting on my ears is nice and comfortable for running and other activities. They do provide the earpieces in three sizes which is always very important for me as my ears are super small apparently. For some reason I feel that the sound in the previous version had slightly more bass which I prefer. But this is really good for phone calls and video conferences. Pairing was so far very easy and no complications. I used them for a few phone conferences and during one long run and the charging case still shows 91% battery so that looks good. Overall great product especially for the price. I definitely recommend it.
5,Can‚Äôt wear normal earbuds when excercising without them falling out. These work great.
5,These are not the best but they definitely are nor the worst.
5,I love this earbuds. I am amazed with this product and the quality of it. Very nice üëçüèª I definitely recommend it.
5,The ordering process is smooth and the fit feels customized.  The sound quality is super good.
3,By far  these are the  best  Bluetooth ear buds I have  bought on Amazon only had for two days so I may  need to update  if i have  issues with  them  i doubt I will but ya never  knowUPDATE: the hearing case won't  chargethe  ear buds anymore
3,These okay enough for the price.  I haven‚Äôt ran with these but I have cycling. These don‚Äôt block or cancel wind noise.
5,So glad I found this!
5,I would buy it again
5,Very comfortable and great sound!
5,The fit was pretty good they didnt fall out when I jogged.
5,Product shipped quickly and works great!
5,I liked they stayed on I use the paddle boarding and hiking
5,Sound is so clear!
5,Works great and received them pretty quickly!
5,The sound quality of the earbuds is really nice. When you power on and off the earbuds you don't get a loud sound going directly into your ear. Instead you get a quiet or muffled sound that doesn't irritate your eardrums. The earbuds come with spare pieces for different ear sizes or for replacement. The cord that it comes with is a Samsung one so in case you lose that charger you'll need another Samsung charger. The case let's me know if my earbuds need charging and since charging my earbuds it has only gone down a few percents. When you do charge the earbuds it charges quickly and while you allow your ears to rest from wearing earbuds you'll be able to use the earbuds again. I prefer to use one earbud at a time to allow one to charge while I use the other. I constantly switch between my devices so I needed earbuds that connected and disconnected easily which these earbuds did.
5,It came already charged and ready to go!
5,So far product.is great delivered on time and works as promised
5,Amazing  product
5,Excellent earbuds for sport or working out.
5,Great deal bought on prime day for 40% off.
5,The fit and the sound of the headphones are exceptional.
5,It was great and I love the affordability!
5,Comfortable.  Good upper volume
5,Hello! Had these earphones for about a week now and they work great. I wanted specifically an earbud that would loop over my ear so it wouldn‚Äôt fall out when running and this did exactly the job. Audio is fine and the earbuds are surprisingly comfortable considering I have smaller sized ears. The earbuds come with multiple little ear tips to suit specific ear sizes. The case is actually very cute y‚Äôall! It‚Äôs a Matte black finish and had a smooth satiny feel with a rubber ish outside (as opposed to smooth plastic). It‚Äôs great cause it makes the case a lot less droppable coming from a clumsy person. The case had a display showing battery life. The earphones also come with a charging cable obviously and charge through usb c. Overall this was a pretty decent purchase and I‚Äôm glad a took the risk on a low review count product. Would buy again!
5,The stated earpiece charges from the case is impressive!
5,Great fit and great sound!
5,I like them
5,Great sound for audio and calls
5,Great product. Works great and it very comfortable.
5,Love these headphones so far!!

5,Looking forward to see how they hold up during a sweaty workout.
5,Just received headphones can't wait to try them out.
5,Sound quality is good.. will update after more uses
5,Surprised how great the sound is and that they are so light I actually forgot that I had it in my ear. Would definitely recommend for the price.
5,Easy to set up and to use. Sound  quality is just right for music and for extended speech (audiobooks).
5,Study case Comfortable fitNo connection issues
5,Fits comfortable and stays on while exercising
5,Haven't had a chance to workout with them yet but the sound quality is very good
5,Very comfortable to wear and long battery life!
5,Liked the sound quality for the purchase price
5,I bought these headphones to replace a different pair that would not charge.  These headphones not only show you have much charge the carrying case has on the outside of the case both headphones show you that they are charging.  This is not a problem since the main weight of the headphone is on the recharging post in the carrying case.  They fit snuggly do not wiggle around while in my ears and instantly pair to each other.  The ear loop is great I don't feel like they will fall out of my ears while working out.  I had no problem pairing them to my phone and my TV.  They provide great sound and there is no lag in the sound.  Each headphone has its own volume control so they are simple to adjust.  I use them while I'm working out so the long battery life is great.  I highly recommend these headphones.
5,Wireless charging is a plus.
5,Love the look of it. I‚Äôll have to update my post after I have had a chance to use it.
5,Great value!
5,Good sound quality great for workout
5,Fast delivery and product is just what I wanted.
5,Nice storage case/charger.  Great sound and fit
5,Comfortable and amazing sound

5,I am really happy with these ear buds overall. Here is my favorite part.... I don't really like the touch ones because I have trouble making anything but the on/off and volume work.  This has a volume on each "bud" which I really like.  The actual button is a push button so I won't hit it when putting my mask on or adjusting my hair.  I was able to use it with bixby on my phone without any problems.  I mostly use them for music and podcasts so the volume and forward/back are the main ones I use.  I really love the extra volume buttons and they advance the song as well.  I also like that the ear hook part is comfortable.  Easy to put on my wireless charger.  Overall I am very happy.
5,They have great quality of sound. The sound is very loud and clear. The earpiece behind the ear is very comfortable. It comes with different size tips. So you can find one that fits you. Great design very comfortable. I love the earpiece that goes behind the ear so they don‚Äôt fall out while running or exercising. Very good for someone who's always on the go. I like how the LED screen shows you the percentage remaining. Makes it easier for me to remember to charge it. It is wireless charging so it's good for on the go. Just grab the case and leave. The case is very sturdy in case they fall they won't get damaged. I would definitely buy them again. Would make a great gift for the holidays. I will be buying a pair for my husband. Overall excellent product. I highly recommend them. Absolutely love them.
5,Very comfortable....good sound quality
5,These are great for an inexpensive pair of wireless earbuds!The most important feature for me is an actual button to press for play/pause. I have found that other kinds have touch buttonsand being a machinist with grease on my finger they don't pause/play.I love that they go around your ear for a snug sure fit. They stay in and don't move while working out!!The sound quality is GREAT!  Nice mix between high mid low ranges.  The bass is perfectalong with them not sounding like a tin can.The battery life is great! After listening to them for 9hrs. a day the battery life is still at 30 percent. I have to charge the case every 4 days and the best part is they can charge on a wireless pador the USB supplied cord.I Highly recommend these!!!!
5,Feel great! Sound is wonderful!
5,So far the best bluetooth buds I've had
5,The clarity is awesome!!
5,Stays put during workout.  Very nice product
5,Easy set up and works well

5,Great value sound and easy to use!

5,This product was a gift and they loved it.
5,Love the charging case and the headphones actually stay in my ears which has been an issue for me with many other brands.
5,Great value and good fit.
5,Really good fit stays in place.
5,I like everything about it
5,Sleek design
5,Very good looking and convenient
5,So far so good!
5,Warning tho- they are not waterproof. I think I messed mine up after I spilled some water on them. Lol I think these headphones are well worth the $30 I spent on them. They wirelessly charge on my docking station (just a regular wireless charging dock). They are nice and loud and block out other sounds when the headphone is pushed into the ear canal. Otherwise I just hang them on my ear so I can hear what is going on around me. My husband has small ears and he says they fit comfortably. The sound quality is good. It is hard to hear him on the phone when he is using them though. I like the convenience of having the case be its own charger too. Also you can use one headphone at a time if needed. It has a digital charge display and it blinks when the case is charging.
5,Good fit
5,Great product for a great price
5,Amazing
5,Looks great easy connect just perfect
5,Work great
5,These headphones are amazing.
5,Great product! Delivered charged and paired with my phone so quickly! Sounds great and lots of functions that are easy to understand. Very pleased!
5,Love this ear bud set
5,I was excited for these earphones to arrive in the mail and I was not disappointed. The packaging was very nice and neat and it came with a clear set of instructions. I had no issues pairing it to my phone or laptop. One thing to note is that when switching between phone and computer you must turn off bluetooth on the first device to pair it with the second. The sound quality is quite good considering the price and it does cancel out some noise to an extent. The earphones come equipped with various buttons to play next/previous track adjust volume and use Siri. It comes with 3 different ear bud sizes and the ear hook prevents them from falling out while exercising. The charging case has a great magnetic open/close function and the charge level is conveniently displayed on the front. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Love the comfort.  So far.
5,Good fit. Very easy to use and works great.
5,Light weight. Great price

5,Great headphones for working out.
5,So far so good!!
5,These stay put while working in the yard.
5,Love the fact that you can actually know how much battery life remains on the device. Unlike my other headsets where I have often found out that they are out of juice while I‚Äôm still in the middle of activities. Sound quality is also great and it connects through Bluetooth pretty quickly. My other device sometimes doesn‚Äôt connect or sync so the fact that this device would connect right away is appreciated. The way it fits in my ear is also great. It is so comfortable that I barely realize wearing it while I am exercising or studying. On top of it this device is not too expensive. I have paid way more on my other units in the past and they are half as comfortable and convenient as this one. Definitely value for your money! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a headset‚Ä¶
5,These earbuds are great the sound is amazing. Order these you will not be disappointed.

5,The Rizizi headphones hold a charge better than every other wireless set of headphones I have ever owned. The sound quality is good and the maneuverability of control while using the headphones are their controls is easy. The skip play and volume up/down is responsive and intuitive. I enjoy using these headphones at the gym and they never fall out. I also have good luck with audio quality while using these to listen to podcasts. I accidentally ordered two pair but instead of returning the other I am giving the others to a friend because I myself enjoy them so much. I think this pair of headphones is a great competitor to over priced designer headphones. The charging status display is handy and adds a level of uniqueness to this particular pair of Rizizi headphones. 5 Stars and I would definitely recommend to a friend.
5,Super easy to pair with my phone and sound quality is excellent!
5,Fits perfectly very good sound great product for the money.
5,This is a very practical set of earphones for everyday listening. Bluetooth connection is very fast reliable and seamless and connects without any hassle or delay. Sound quality is good for attending work meetings or listening to news but it lacks Bass if you want to listen heavily to music. Earphones have a nice set of controls and you can change volume or browse your playlist back and forth by touching your earphone buttons. Battery has been also working well during past 3 weeks and batteries last over 3 hours. It automatically shuts down to save power if it's not active. It sits easily on ears and doesn't fell of if you move around or sprint. It has a nice looking package showing battery life which is nice and useful. Overall it worth the price given its features functionality and quality.
5,Good sounds easy to pair great ease of use
5,Great product

5,Probably the most comfortable earbuds I‚Äôve ever owned. Quality is great for the cost
5,So far so good. Comfortable and good sound quality
2,So I received these on July 29 they worked great. No issues with charging and the charge would last me almost all day sound is good fit was good. but now a month later for some reason they won't pick up phone calls. I can hear music youtube tictok any media apps I can even hear the phone ring but when I hit the button to connect nothing. I can't hear the person at all. I'm really disappointed they weren't real cheap but not overly expensive. however they're to expensive to have just a month. :( the only other thing I can say about them is the range isn't as far as some I have had but that wasn't a major issue.
5,Great product!
5,Sounds great. Pairs easily and stays on your ears while working out.
5,easy to use charge quickly good for working out
5,Great sound hopefully it holds up over time.
5,Truly a great price for the sound quality.
3,The left headphone keeps disconnecting repeatedly. No matter what I do to reset it disconnects
5,Great headphones. Love the display of battery life for each earbud
5,Very nice
5,Great sound! Nice fit! Pretty boss!!! üòéüíØüî•
5,Very good headphones. Sound great with lots of controls
5,These are easy to connect. Great product
5,Good sound  Great product. Quick charge.
5,I use the wireless earbuds when I work out. They work well and are easy to use.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I just received mine and the right side is not turning on.Left side works just fine though.I will be returning these and hopefully receive a pair that works.
5,Right price great features
5,The ear buds sounds great! Very clear sound
5,I liked to size of the airbuds and there quality.
5,These earbuds are comfortable sit securely in my ears and last for HOURS! The sleek profile is a big plus. One of my main uses is for audiobooks. You can use each of them independently giving up to 9 hours of listening without charging up hugely more with the high capacity charging case. The range is excellent.They connected to my phone right away. I had them in at work all day and they are very comfortable. The volume turns up really loud or really quiet which is good for when I'm using them while falling asleep. The volume controls on the headphones are an added bonus that no one else has offered.This company is great too I've had one issue before and they immediately made it right. I also own other pairs that I've had for years. I highly recommend these you can't beat them at this price.
5,Good quality and quick service
5,Excellent value for the price. Great sound quality easy connection. Love these!
5,Easy set up and great sound
5,I just got these Bluetooth earphones today and they are just awesome. They fit perfectly in the ear and from the front they don't stick out at all. (See in the pics).  They offer really clear and loud sound. The noise cancelling is actually very very good.  You can actually hear the base as you listen to music or a movie. They feel very easy to keep in your ear.The case is smartly designed being compact and the earphones sit perfectly aided by seeming magnetic contact.The earphones seem sturdy and we'll built. The buds sit in my ear extremely comfortably.  I will definitely buy another pair of these once they become available again.They charge easily on my wireless charging pad and they really last for many many hours on a single charge.
5,Nice product
5,Work great. Easy to get started.
5,Stays in the ears well sound quality is really great
5,Sound

5,Good sound  good fit. Good product.
5,Good product
5,Excelente producto
5,Soind is great battery as well
5,I have been fiddling with these headphones for a week straight and I have to say that I like these headphones. True to there word they are noise canceling headphones great for talking on the phone or through social media features that work just as well. One of the best features I like is the volume button on each head piece that helps with adjusting volumes and the wireless charging is very handy. The only cons that I see and don't like are: when they are not in use they will disconnect on their own and sometimes that leads to unpaired themselves. Another is thst sometime when you want to pause the music or media you are playing it doesn't always work. So other then those I like these headphones
5,Like that it shows the percentage of battery.  Easy to connect.
5,Great sound. Very comfortable.
5,I like the light up charging display
5,Zero criticism
5,So far so good! I will submit another review after more time has passed.
5,Great so far!

5,Easy to use great sound
5,Easy to set up
5,Super sound quality for the price point
5,These ear buds are outstanding.  I tried them out when I was out mowing the grass for the last time and I couldn't even hear the mower and they weren't on the highest volume.  Sound quality is really good as well.  While I don't necessarily need the screen on the front of the charger/storage case it's a nice touch.  The buds fit well and tight in their holders.  These buds are also easy to use.  I easily paired them with my phone and they auto-shut off when you take them out of your ears (at least mine do - they must somehow sense when they are taken out).  Overall nothing but positive things about these.
5,Love them.
5,So far so good.
3,Just bought & so far I am highly satisfied with the sound. However I did not receive the C charger or extra buds that was suppose to come with it.
3,Good volume. Quick connection. Decent sound quality. Unsure about durability and connection stability.
5,Just ordered these wireless headphones and was surprised on how well they sound and block out outside noise.  You can use both or one a time and they connect via Bluetooth quick and easy.  They are comfortable to wear with different ear sizes and fits comfortably around the ear as well.  The case is not like my previous cases.  This is a solid case with an added charging monitor to gauge power reserve.  When fully charged they last a long time.  I have found that they disconnect when using certain apps otherwise they stay connected.  Overall I'm extremely please with these wireless headphones.  For the price these were well worth the purchase.
5,Best I‚Äôve had right out of the box!
5,Sound great. Easy to pair and charge. First day of use. Will update if anything changes.
5,Work perfectly
3,Phone call quality is horrible.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I've had the product for almost two weeks and so far i love it. I love the hoop that it has that latches to my ear which also makes it super comfortable. I had no problem pairing Rizizi to my android device. The sound quality is nice and the battery. The longest I've used the ear buds for is about 5 hours and i had about 60% battery life remaining. I'm not sure if the ear buds are water resistance and I'm not willing to try that. But it is sweat proof tho. Overall the product is a nice buy.
5,It arrived super fast. Sound quality is good. Charges quickly and is easy to use.
5,Great product
5,
5,Great Quality for a great price!
5,Amazing !
5,Good sound

5,They‚Äôre a good buy for the money.
5,Very nice and good quality headphones it comes with noise cancellation.
5,These earphones are very user-friendly!! I‚Äôve owned several sets of earphones and earbuds over the past few years and these are by far the most comfortable and easiest to pair of them all! They fit my ears very comfortably they come in a sleek rounded case that displays the charge percentage on the front. The charge lasts a long time and the earphones pair together not separately which is great! The sound is pretty good as far as volume but not a lot of fullness of bass. The design is easy and I look forward to using them hands-free at the gym! I am very satisfied with this product.
5,These are great ear pieces
2,I bought these because I lost my other wireless headphones. I'm on a lot of calls and video calls so wireless headphones are super important. The sound quality is great but if you're wanting to talk to someone it's no so great at all unless you want to scream in the phone as if you're at a concert. I tried everything but regardless of what I tried noone was ever able to hear me on the other end.Long story short if you're buying them to just listen to music or a book or something these are great. If you are buying to use them to talk on the phone video chat make videos etc DO NOT buy them because you will end up returning then just like I am.
5,Great product for the price
5,
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†They have a good sound and are pretty loud. They fit me well and come with other ear pieces in case they don‚Äôt. I love the piece that goes behind the ear so that they don‚Äôt fall out while moving around or exercising.  I have bought this brand before and wanted to give their new model a try. They are great and much improved from the previous ones. The way you plug it in to charge with the USB -C cable is way better than the old ones. Nice bright LED screen shows the charge remaining and I love that they have a separate physical volume button on them.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Amazing product
2,I originally got these for running but unfortunately they aren't remotely waterproof or sweatproof. Within about 15-20 minutes of working out they started continuously disconnecting/connecting on and off and it was impossible to keep them both playing for more than about 5-10 seconds. I've used a couple of pairs of wireless headphones for running before and never had a problem so this was pretty disappointing. For everyday use they're perfectly fine- they're pretty comfortable and the sound quality is about what you would expect for the price. However you should be very careful if you're planning to work out in them.
5,I don't think I can speak more highly of these headphones! The sound is great very crisp and clear. I love that you can use left or right. They both have convenient button placement for volume play pause next and previous track and you can even answer or denie calls. They are extremely comfortable I can wear them all day and it comes with extra ear tips for sizing. But I think the best part is the wireless charging! Yes wireless charging it works wonderful I placed it on the pad and the numbers start to flash to indicate charging. The front led scream is easy to read and super convenient. If you're on the fence do it!!
5,Easy to use
5,easy to operate
5,
5,Easy sync to my phone tablet and laptop and very simple to switch between. I love that these come with three different sized ear inserts as I always seem to need the smallest available. The wrap around part is comfy on my ears some chafe after wearing all day but I am glad to say that these don't. The case is nice too not just for style but as someone with kids being able to charge it without opening the case (kids have been known to take them out if the case is open).
5,I received my headphones sooner than expected. They were already charged and ready to use. I used them while working out and the sound quality was nice and clear. My workout consists of me running on a treadmill and it seem to block out the noise.I also use the headphones while I was at work and it lasted my whole shift which was 7 hours. My ears are small so I did have to adjust the headphones a few times to fit me comfortably . I also had to make a few calls while using the headphones and I was able to hear my clients.
5,I have used many earbud products. These earbuds have a great sound quality and battery life is phenomenal. I took three airplane trips (2 hour flights) and did not have to recharge my my earbuds. I like the fact that they hang over my earn and with a mask on I did not have any inconvenience at all. Just make sure that you put the rubber pad on that fits your ear. If they are too lose you will not get a good fit in your ear. I had to experiment with this a bit until I got it right.
5,Item arrived on time and already charged to 80%.  The display on the case is bright and easy to read.  The pairing of the device took 5 seconds.  You dont need to do anything to the headphones to pair other than go to your device and find the "A12" connection and then connect to that.  What I like best is the fit.  The headphones contour to your ears.  I have other headphones that dont fit the ear nearly as well as this brand.  Overall highly satisfied with the purchase.

2,I‚Äôve used these phones about 25 times in the gym over the past 6 weeks and one phone is now broken. I place in the charge pod and a little red light blinks for a millisecond and the phone doesn‚Äôt charge. I can‚Äôt turn it on and it has stopped working. The left one is fine continues working but now I have an issue with poor quality build for this product.
2,Love the headphones. Great value for the money. Comfortable good sound but on my 2nd set since I returned and replaced with this one. Right earphone shuts off and need to have the case to get it to reset but does not happen automatically. Sometimes it takes a while for this to happen. I am now going to return the 2nd set for a refund.
2,These earbuds worked great for a few months but then the left bud stopped working.  Even though the earbuds are fully charged the left earbud begins to make static sounds then stops working completely.  My date of return has passed (August 2nd) so I cannot return these.  Unfortunate because I appreciated the way they fit in my ears and provided good sound.
5,I have bought alot of different headphones over the years. For myself and presents for others. These are by far the best headphones I've ever bought. The quality of sound is superb. The distance I can go away from my phone is amazing. I can even go into our basement to do laundry without audio interruptions. All my other earphones audio is disrupted when in my basement. These are very comfortable on the ears. Well worth the price which in its self is not bad at all.
2,These were great headphones for the price right up until the left headphone stopped working.  It will not turn on and it drains the charger/case continuously while it is plugged in.I'm going to contact the seller and if they don't replace them I'll mark this down from 2 stars to 1.
5,I like this one the best from this brand!Reasons:1) It's stylish beautiful box and ear buds with ear support hooks. Easier to work out they don't fall off.2) Sound quality is great !3) Noice canceling!! Very important to me.4) Connectivity!  Easy! otherwise it can be pain the what you know! Specially when there are 2 individual ear bud units.5) Worked well this all my devices my Uber work phone ( Android)  my personal phone ( iPhone 12 pro max). My Smart TV and Laptop.
2,The right earbud no longer works. Will not charge or turn on anymore. These were cared for very well and should not have any reason to malfunction. Purchased only a few months ago and use has been moderate to light. Unfortunate as I really liked these!!
2,The battery indicators for each half do not actually show the current battery charge state they just have a rolling animation whenever the earbud is charging and off when it's full.  I was hoping that when plugged in I would see something that would indicate the current charge level but regardless of the charge state they just flash 1-2-3-4 bars in sequence whether they're 90% or 0% charged.  They function fine but I was really hoping that the indicator would actually indicate the charge battery state of the individual batteries or it's just pointless.
2,I'm a runner so if you use them otherwise maybe they are ok. I got a replacement set because only one side would charge. Second set same issue but I only wear one so I can hear traffic etc. But that one cuts out in less than 1 hour possibly due to sweat/moisture? Returning this set too.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,The sound quality is amazing and very clear. They are extremely comfortable and work great for hard workouts without having to adjust the earbuds constantly. This is now my second pair because my wife claimed the first pair as her own. You cannot beat these wireless headphones for the price. I have wasted money on expensive designer headphones and each time I have been disappointed. You can get a high quality product like this at a very reasonable price and be much happier.
5,Work well shipping was as quoted and charging case is great.  Charging case is better than previous models and has a digital display to tell you how charged the battery on the case is.  Also previous cases had a very restrictive space for charging cable meaning you couldn't use just any USB C cable to charge it as most wouldn't fit but this one doesn't have that anymore.Sound quality is on par for the cost and battery life is great too.
2,Can't really rate this product since I couldn't get one of the earbuds to pair with my device.  At first both earbuds did pair with each other but once I tried to pair it with my bluetooth only one side would work.  I tried all of the things the user guide said to do if only one earbud worked but it seemed to not help.  I even tried it with other devices and it still gave me the same problem...only one side would pair with my device.
5,These earbuds are great! The sound is excellent! They are easy to pair to my Samsung S20 phone.  The battery lasts almost all day. I love the volume up and down buttons on the side of each earbud. They are comfortable in my ears and even announces alarms if your phone alarm is going off. The bass is loud and sound is crystal clear. I would definitely buy again!
1,I've had these for a while and these are my observation over time and in a variety of settings.I use these with an android phone that I carry in my my pocket while walking working or riding the mower.The distance from my pocket to the earpieces is what? Three feet at most?  The headphones constantly drop the signal stutter and randomly lose the connection altogether.I tried placing the phone at a linear distance of five feet +/- with a clear line of sight and in that case they mostly stay connected (Note I said "MOSTLY").The right earpiece randomly shuts off and won't reconnect unless I restart my phone & them manually restart the earpiece (in that order).Although they show charged they run out of juice unexpectedly.On the upside they do fit nicely on the ear and provide a good musical experience when and if they stay connected.If you place your music player on the stereo within ten feet in clear line of sight to your chair and hold your head perfectly still while facing the player these earbuds might work for you.Best of luck.
5,Excellent budget running wireless headphones.  I use it for my running session very nice fit in the ears.  One of problems with wireless headphones is the constant adjustment of the headphone itself and the fear of it falling off.  This headphone was snug and very comfy.  Sound quality is very good and battery life is excellent.
5,Just bought this heads phones I was not sure if they will be good specially for the price. I gave it a go and I was surprised of the quality of the sound that was coming out of the headphones. It is super clear and crisp. The bluetooth function is also outstanding specially when listening to music then someone calls...it switches without a glitch. Overall great product and I recommend for everyone.
2,From what I get from the people I talk on the phone with wearing these. They can‚Äôt hear me very well. And they will cut off on their own while I‚Äôm wearing them. I won‚Äôt know until I feel my phone vibrate with a call
1,One thing I would like to say when these ear buds worked they were great. Sound comfort and performance were really good. That being said the right ear bud completely died on me after a few uses. Twice. The first pair I ordered were great for about 6-7 uses. Then the right ear bud died for no apparent reason. I tried all troubleshooting possible but ultimately was unsuccessful.So I sent those back for a new pair in exchange because I did like them when they worked. The new pair came I sent the defective pair back and I was happy with the exchange. Until of course the same exact issue popped up. The right ear bud died after a few uses. I once again tried all troubleshooting read the manual 10 times over no luck.I did see some other customers had the same exact issue so I'm not alone sadly. I'm sending this second pair back and I'm not going for round 3. I really wanted to like these but obviously the universe doesn't want me to.
1,I purchased one pair of these and immediately loved them. They were comfortable stayed secure in my ears during exercise the sound was great easy to use. BUT after about 6 weeks one of the earbuds simply wouldn't charge or turn on. I was so happy with everything else I figured this was a fluke and bought a second pair without even trying to return them. Everything was great until this time after 2 weeks of use one of the earbuds had the exact same issue: wouldn't turn on and won't charge. I cleaned the charging ports and tried every trouble shooting thing I could find on the internet because I really do love the headphones otherwise. I have to give them 1 star because no matter how awesome earbuds are I really need both of them working. I will update my review if Rizizi contacts me and is able to resolve this issue with me.
2,Worked for two months then one of the ear buds quit working.  Only 30 day return so out the money.
5,Nice pair of headphones but I have had one issue. Sometimes the connection randomly drops when I stop using it. For example if I pause the movie I'm watching occasionally the connection will drop shortly without warning. It's not a huge problem‚ÄîI can reinsert the headphone into the case and remove it and it'll reconnect.
5,Wow‚Ä¶. They are extremely comfortable and come with different size ear pieces. It‚Äôs great for running given that it wraps around the ear. The sound is great and blocks out a lot of the surrounding sound. The charging case charges quickly and has a screen which clearly show the charge for each ear piece and the case itself. I highly recommend this product
2,The charging case is very nice and built well. Battery life seems to be OK. It does charge quickly The buds pair very easily and connect to Bluetooth quickly. They are a bit uncomfortable in the ears. The sound quality is very thin mediocre at best. I would not recommend these.
5,Really happy with these new headphones/earbuds. I would say sound quality is pretty average but the dedicated volume rocker button and the battery display on the case make these better than the rest in this price range. No issues with sound dropping or cutting out and the control buttons are very easy to use. Very pleased with these!
5,I tested how well the noise cancellation would work by taking the el (elevated train) and calling the job. They actually heard me! I did find though that they appear to lose a connection briefly when I am not that far from my phone. They are more comfortable than the other ones (Firecore Sport). I believe y'all should give them a try!
5,what a great unit. I wanted an extra pair of earbuds and I thought at this price what could I lose? Everything about the earbuds is top of the line.  The ease of use the comfort. The ear hook make it easy to fit. And the sound. Hard to beat the price. These will become my favorites.
5,These headphones are great! When I opened the package the headphones were at 93%. The sound quality is nice and clear. I often use them while running  and they do not come out. The headphones stay nice and snug.I truly recommend this as a definite buy!
2,They sound good and are inexpensive but do stop working with even the smallest amount of sweat. Would not recommend to buy unless you only use while sitting in an air conditioned office.
5,This is our family's third pair of headphones from this company and they do not disappoint! Super great battery life and sound quality and the fit is really comfortable as well. We have not had any problems with the headphones breaking or wearing out. Overall would definitely buy again!
5,The headphones are very comfortable and light weight over the ears. Has a great crisp sound for audio be it for music or phone calls. The phone call does not sound muffled or that you are far away from your phone! Great buy for the price!!!
5,The over the ear earbuds are the best.  These are super comfortable and stay in place while running.  Sound is very clear and volume is great.  The case looks very sturdy. Shipping was super fast.  Which is perfect if your headphones go out and you need a new pair ASAP.
5,The sound quality is good. You could hear clearly even amid background noise. Also it fits the ear well without feeling uncomfortable. Since I have not used if for more than a month I hope it lasts long for me.
2,Not sure how come so many people give it 5 starts - the headphones connectors are very low quality and can't properly charge the headphones from the case leaving the headphones connected to the phone and eventually out of battery.Returning these headphones.
5,Love the charging case! It's very sleek and protects the headphones well. Battery lasts pretty well. The charging screen goes away after a few minutes but it is still charging. Comfortable to wear and the sound quality is good. Great buy for the price.
5,My husband likes it  it‚Äôs sound clear and loud  the case it‚Äôs nice and small and it shows you the battery charging for each earbuds not inside like the other ones  it bring the cable charger it charged quick
1,We bought two pairs of these headphones. I bought a pair a bit after my wife bought them. They sounded great and stay in your ears which is important while working out. One of the negatives that I noticed really early was the left ear tended to cut out if you had your phone in your pocket and turned your head. That is an intermittent problem.The main issue came up about a month after she purchased them. The left ear phone stopped working. She went through all the processes that the instructions state and even used my charger to see if that would fix it. It didn't. I would suggest not buying due to this unless you like just using one ear.
2,Cool case.  I loved the green LED display!Problem is that the most important thing about earbuds is sound quality.  The sound was ok but not balanced enough for my taste.
5,Spidoc wireless bluetooth earbuds are excellent quality;  easy to pair;  easy to use;  can use for gym running and casual use;  overall an excellent purchase and I recommend to anyone looking for a product like this for any of their devices.
2,One earbud Stopped working a few days ago. Were great before then.
5,These headphones are very comfortable to wear easy to use and provide great sound quality. The charging station provides a digital reading of the charging status which is very nice. I highly recommend these headphones!
2,The earbuds fit great and stay in ears well but I found out while biking that these things HOWL with any wind and listening to music is quite bad
5,I‚Äôve been looking for running headphones for a while now. I love that these stay in my ears the whole time I‚Äôm running. They have great sound quality too and the charging case is very convenient!
5,I use these for running and they stay in place better than any other ear phones I have had. The sound quality is excellent. No problems pairing to phone and staying connected.
5,The charging case is very sleek and the digital display is awesome to show you the charging progress. The headphones fit great and are very comfortable. I have purchased a couple different wireless headphones and these are my favorite.
1,I am so happy with these earbuds! The battery life is crazy good. I‚Äôve used them in the gym taking walks on flights. No complaints! Well worth the reasonable price.***update***. I‚Äôve had them now for 2.5 months with reasonable use. They started making a weird beeping noise every 30 seconds or so and then die. They are fully charged (according to the charging case). I‚Äôm so frustrated and disappointed because I honestly loved these and wouldn‚Äôt mind replacing them after a good amount of time and use has passed. But 2.5 months is unreasonable for a product to fail. No luck reaching customer service and my Amazon return window has closed.
5,These are great headphones for the $30 price range. The charging case is a nice size the wireless charging on the case works quite well and has great sound.
5,Great experience recently ordered one transactions were straightforward. The sounds quality and confort is off the chart and the battery life is excellent. Very delighted with this wireless.
5,Love the fact that you can see the digital display of the pill power battery life is great and the sound quality is good
5,These never hurt my ears no matter how long I wear them. They truly have great sound quality and block out other noise. These are a great value for the money.
5,These headphones are sleek and fit my ears very well haven't had any issues during some intense activities/exercises. Sound quality is better than expected and the battery life is holding up well.
5,I like that there are actual buttons on the product as opposed to touch sensitive controls. These are much more responsive and intuitive. Sound quality is good and they fit my ears well. Overall I am pleased.
1,My headphones came with a horrifying and dangerous malfunction.  While I had the headphones on I pressed the button to pause and then without touching anything else when I pressed the button a second time to continue play again the sound came out not at the same level as before but at the highest volume.  The first time it happened the sound was so loud and painful that I was forced to quickly rip them off my head.  Then when I tested it (without wearing them) I could see that this malfunction occurred randomly and intermittently.This is probably the worst type of malfunction imaginable with ear headphones.  A one star rating does not even begin the convey the horror I felt when the painfully loud sound come screeching through the headphones into my ear.
5,Great little headphones. I like the earhooks because I've had issues in the past with just buds falling out. Wireless charge works well.
2,Was going to send them back and I accidentally threw the item away . Ugh. Sound had no bass and was distorted
2,Awful & I forgot to return them.. damn
2,Takes way too long to be discovered even when previously paired.
2,Updating my reviewThese SOUND ok BUT only for listeningNOT good for telephone callsHorrible sound to whomever you‚Äôre speaking withPicks up all ambient noisesReturning
5,Great investment. The information on the pod is super helpful to know the battery level.Super easy to use and perfect earphones for a workout!
5,The sound of this product is simply amazing the light weight design and the way it sits in your ears is very comfortable I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
5,The ear buds arrived quickly. They are comfortable to use and the digital display makes charging them easy.
5,They have good sound quality the mic works well even when I'm wearing a mask and a great fit for active users.
1,I bought these so I could listen to meditation music while sleeping therefore not bothering anyone else.  The batteries last at most 6 hours  When they get low they start to screech--just what you want at 3 a.m.  Plus if you roll over on your ear they just turn off.  Very disappointed and cannot recommend these.  After two weeks the battery didn't even last 6 hours--maybe just 5 minutes.  Since devices no longer have plug-ins for the old fashioned corded ear buds I am still searching for something like these that will work through the night.
5,Bought as a gift haven‚Äôt used yet. Great packaging looks quality.
2,Sound went bad in one bud after a few weeks.
1,I bought July 5th it's August 31st and the right ear peice isn't working.  Red light only blinks on that one.Blue and red light work on the other one. No blue light on right side tho.I've contacted RIZI so we'll see what happens.  I'll update my review depending on how my experience goes.It was too late to return via Amazon but hopefully customer service will replace them.  I'll update when they get back to me.
1,Headphones fit well  sounded great  charged for the first 90 days.  After that the left side headphone would not charge in the case- The earbud was making contact in the case fine and it still charged the right earbud fine.  Just disappointing.  I use them while running biking mowing the yard n such so at least 4-5 times a week. Just luck of the draw and got a crappy pair I guess.
1,If you buy these for sure don‚Äôt just put them in a pocket. They broke immediately at bud because the silicone snagged my pants. The plastic is so cheap it just busted.On top of that the case dropped on a hardwood floor one time and left insanely deep scars in the cheap plastic box.Would absolutely love my money back but the return window closed 4 days ago.Absolutely furious and what a trash product. Give my money back you cowards.
5,These comfortable headphones connect quickly without hassles. Sound is excellent.
1,Unfortunately I loved these headphones when I initially got them July 13. It was a month and they have already crapped out. Let me rephrase that one headphone did. I wore them at the gym during workouts and outside when I ran. Didn‚Äôt go in water outside of the sweat on my body. Since it‚Äôs past the 30 days (barely) I can‚Äôt even return them. Maybe they have worked well for other people but unfortunately not for me. So take the chance if you may!
5,These earbuds are great. They have a good quality sound and they're very comfortable
1,I bought these to wear to the gym. The reviews seemed good and so was the price. At first they worked great. Good sound and very comfortable. Then after a week or so the right earbud would just shut off and not charge. I tried restarting and umparing and all the tricks but nothing stopped the problem. I returned them and got a new pair and the same exact problem happened. This time I'm getting the refund.
1,Today (day 11 of use) the right earbud stopped working. It wouldn't turn on and it wouldn't charge. The connector tips are clean no corrosion. Tried turning the left one off and then tried turning both back on to see if that would get the right one to work; nothing. These haven't been abused gotten wet or anything. I can't return because according to Amazon I need the original box. Who keeps boxes to every single thing they buy? Packrats maybe... Anyways for $22 I'm not gonna fight this. It's just not worth it. You get what you pay for and I learned my lesson.
2,The right earphone stopped working after two months.
5,Good sounds quality easy to use fit comfortably. Battery life is long.
5,Comfortable great Bluetooth range & sound quality
2,They fit.
1,Left earbudI‚Äôm sorry to lump you into this. You‚Äôve been terrific. Worked every time. You‚Äôre reliable sound great and exactly what I paid for.Right earbudYou‚Äôre lazy and unpredictable. I charge you the same amount as your counterpart and yet you decide when to work and when not to work. One day ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go!‚Äù The next day :beep beep beep aka ‚Äúnot today amigo‚ÄùDisappointed overall.
1,I have bought 3 different sets of cheap Bluetooth ear buds over the last 3 years and this is the fourth one I normally assume 1 year life span for these cheap ones but Rizizi takes the cake the right ear bud has stopped charging after 10 days. Noise cancellation is non existent and the fit is also terrible. The only reason I wanted something that has a contraption that makes it sit around the ear is why I bought this. What a waste of $40
1,I went through two pairs and neither made it more then 20 minutes.  First pair both died 20 minutes into my first run and then the left one died 20 minutes into my second run and never worked again.  Second pair again the left one died 20 minutes into my second run and then died 25 minutes into my third run.  I had hoped the first pair were lemons but after having similar issues with the both pairs I would not recommend.
1,I have had these for 2 months & use them about 4 times per week at the gym. The right headphone is glitching saying ‚Äúpower on‚Äù over and over and it won‚Äôt turn off.
1,My biggest issue with this is the way the controls work.  Hold the button to advance the track once? Volume controls on both sides are redundant. One of those should be used to advance the track. Sound quality is below average.  I know this was cheap but I can't give it above two stars. It's not worth buying. I got a refund and threw mine in the garbage.
1,These headphones are terrible! They constantly disconnect. If they are in your pocket and you raise your arm they cut out. Unless you plan on having your phone right next to your headphones (which then what's the point?) Then save your money. Plus they are not very comfortable and slip around.
1,These are a waste of money. One set stopped charging after a couple of weeks. Returned for a replacement which lasted for 3 runs before the right earpiece decided to stop working. Please do not waste your money on these. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that these are the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
1,Volume not very strong could barely hear. Also the wire that goes around the ear is not the right shape/ size. Hurts my ear.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The headphones worked ok for about 6 weeks but then would no longer turn off/charge when returning to the case. I tried turning them off manually but they still wouldn‚Äôt charge and would turn themselves back on while on the case and connect to my phone even when I wasn‚Äôt using them. Really frustrating product.
1,After the first use one of the charging pins got stuck down and now left earbud is very difficult to charge.  Then during my second run wearing these the the right bud fizzled then stopped working altogether. It will not charge or turn on now and I tried all the tricks. Also these randomly connect to your phone Bluetooth even when they are in the case and charging even after turning off.  Very annoying. Don‚Äôt buy.
1,Buyer beware. Bought these for mom to use for work calls the gym and while running. The pairing was easy. Unfortunately trying to use these for calls was a bust. We tried several different conversations over the course of a week and they sounded great for the first 5 minutes or so and then on the listeners end it was sounded like she was under water in the shower. Same happened on her end when listening to music. Will be returning.
1,The product looks nice great comfort level wireless charging but not durable at all. Product lasted 3 weeks before it needed to constantly needed to be re-paired to the device as well as the other earbud. During use one earbud would cut out and within 7 weeks one earbud died.  The return window for this product is short. BEWARE
1,This was my replacement from the first one breaking and now this one is broken. DO NOT BUY!
1,The pair lasted a month then the right earbud simply died apparently because it is no longer charging.These earbuds generate a trace of white power material  like you would see on a car battery that accumulates on the charging contacts.  Cleaning them did not fix the failure to charge.
1,Absolutely awful. Broke on day two. Asked for a replacement. Replacement broke before I even sent back the first pair. Sent them both back and asked for money back. It‚Äôs been 10 days since they got them back and they never gave me my refund. Waste of money.
1,The right earpiece no longer charges even though the base charging station is at 100%.
1,I've only had this for around 5 weeks and the right ear piece just stopped working which is a shame because these used to be great. Only the right ear piece doesn't work won't connect to any device doesn't make any sound and doesn't charge.
1,Used these maybe a dozen times since I purchased in July. Right earpiece died. Won‚Äôt turn on won‚Äôt charge. These may not be as sweat proof as they claim.
1,Was great when it worked.  Left earpiece stopped taking a charge.  Missed the return date by 8 days.  Wow.  Be aware.  Many are lucky; I was not.  POS.  DO NOT BUY
1,I was very happy with the purchase until one of the earbuds stopped working overnight just after one month. I guess this is what happens when you get cheap stuff. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre a human and sweat
1,Right earbud died and no longer can get a charge. Of course it happened after the 30 day return period. I liked them when they worked. At least I got them on sale.
1,I have had this headset for less than a month. And used them maybe 5-6 times. Two days ago battery died within an hour. Today it died in 15 minutes.Big disappointment.I don't have a box anymore. So not able even return them. Will have to just throw them away.
1,Very uncomfortable earbuds and sound quality is ok but keep disconnecting
1,Disappointed. Stopped working after 4-5 times use.
1,I recently bought these and the right earbud doesn't work at all. I have also seen several buyers saying the same thing. For the price if these we should at least be getting 2 functional earbuds!!!!!! What a waste of my money.
1,Used many earbuds for jogging. These suck as they won't stay connected and the music shuts off mid run. Over the course of a 30 minute run they disconnected 3 times and I just gave up on them. Save your money buy something else these are useless
1,After about 12 days they started intermittently charging 10 days later they don't charge all. I'm now stuck with 2 dead ear buds that steer not even 6 weeks old.
1,right ear bud stopped working charging... don't buy these
1,Left ear bud stopped working after two weeks of receiving them.
1,After a few weeks of use the left earbud has stopped connecting to the charge port. I've tried cleaning the earbud and the charging port with no success.
1,Worked great for a week. Then like most the right side ear bud would not pair! If I knew how to fix this or prevent would rate a 5 as sound was great. Any help out there?
1,The first set I purchased did not sync the second earbud got a new one and the battery would never fully charge and then it died. Poor quality product but liked it when it worked.
1,Bought these in July 2022. By mid-September they already won't hold a charge.
1,Compre primero un par para mi y me gustaron tanto que compre unos para mi pareja pero problema los audifonos se enlasan entre si y no se puede usar los otros mientras unos estan en uso porque no se conectan ni funcionan por ese motivo.
1,I have already bought a second pair and both do not work after 2 weeks.
1,These earbuds are uncomfortable to wear poor audio quality and have the smell of plastic. I had other earbuds and they sound much better than these. These also don't fit nicely and not very comfortable. Returning these.
1,Started making a buzzing noise in one bud after 1 month. Product was fully charged and unabused
1,Initially I gave a 5 star review but I'm changing it to one star since it stopped working after 59 days of use. :(
1,The buds stopped working after 2 weeks. They wouldn't turn on. I would not recommend.
1,I've bought headphones from a dollar store with better sound quality than these to top it off I've only had them for a few weeks and the left ear isn't holding anymore.
1,Fit nicely in the ear. The bass is fine but not great.Updated review: right side earbud stopped working after a month of use
1,Battery went bad almost immediately. Will not hold a charge.
1,After daily use for 3 weeks one earbud won‚Äôt charge and volume control on other no longer works
1,Right side made loud buzzing soundWon‚Äôt turn on or charge
1,I used this twice and the right earbud just wouldn't charge. I played around with the charging dock but nothing worked.
1,Fits good comfortable battery length isn't good or sound would not buy
1,Right ear quit working after 2nd use. Won‚Äôt charge or anything
1,The item connected to my phone straight out of the box and never connected after that.
1,I wouldn't recommend at all. Quality not good.
1,Expensive for a 2 time use
1,No video I threw away
1,They are VERY awkward and uncomfortable
1,Very poor sound quality.
4,Got these headphones for my kid he likes them so far. I will post an update soon.
5,I am very happy with these earbuds. The battery life is excellent as I can use it all day before needing a charge. Both left and right can be worn as a single piece as well which is nice for the office so I can still answer calls while listening to music in my other ear. Highly recommend for working out or yard work as the over ear piece keeps the earbuds in place even when moving around a lot.
3,I purchased the earbuds in April... and they were great... I use them mostly for listening to music on my walks or audible books.  Sound and battery life were great and I use my other headset for more sweaty sports... I took care of these... no sweating... running... shaking... I have to add that they sit in your ears without moving... and without constant adjusting... however one of the earbuds stopped working... just died.. not charging not working... just dead... so I only use them lightly for 5 months... I was hoping to at least get a year... unfortunately that was not the case... so 5 months of greatness... and then just nothing.... lol so buyer be aware... :)
3,Didn't last 6 months and no warranty information I can find on this product.
5,Theses earbuds work as good as my wives beats for a lot less price.
5,I‚Äôve had these for a week. The sound quality is great the set seems to keep great charge and does a better job connecting/disconnecting the Bluetooth than other pairs I‚Äôve had!
5,Excellent ear buds that are comfortable and easy to use.
5,I use it for work and for gym
5,Great Product
5,Work Great
5,Very easy to set up.  Sounds good and comfortable.
5,They fit well and work well. We'll see how long they last.
5,Very comfortable!!!
5,Easy to use. Great sound.
5,Mostly good things for me when I looking for replacement ear buds for biking.*Wireless charging case with optional USB C port (for charging as well).*Wonderful battery life.*Hooks that help stay on during workouts.*Sound quality is awesome for its price.*Bluetooth version is 5.1 but latest version at time of this review is 5.2. Trust me you won't notice the difference between the two.Highly recommended!
5,Great product and soun
5,The packaging was nice and neat. It came with a 79% charge. The LEFT battery protector was moved but it appears to be charge right now.  Have not used it yet but happy with the Rizizi.
5,Love these and lost one. Now I need to order a new set. If you're thinking twice about the purchase don't. Just go for it they're well worth it
5,I use it to listen to audiobooks
2,When they work they work as you would expect a pair of budget wireless earbuds do.But in my 3 months of using it I've had multiple occasions where one or both of the earbuds will simply go offline and not function. And when one of them goes down the other cannot connect by itself. It will act as if it's broken: not able to charge buttons won't work and then in anywhere from hours to days later it will work again.Even when they DO work they are low quality. Will suddenly disconnect when video or music is paused. Will not consistently auto connect and play sound from device will often have to go into my phone bluetooth settings and manually connect to them.They are unreliable quality. Not confident to bring them on flights or long road trips.Battery life not great will require charge after 3ish hours of continuous use. Case itself carries multiple charges which is okay.
1,Stopped connecting after 5 months of light use. Worked great when they worked. Tried everything in the rizizi manual and also Googled the problem. Nothing works to get these connected again. Very disappointed. Senior throwing away $40. Ridiculous!
2,I have used these almost daily for over two months. Then today they start disconnecting for a couple seconds every 2 or 3 minutes. I tried turning them off and back on again but it is still happening. They are fully charged as I keep them in their case when not using them.  Before today they would have been 5 stars. Also when I logged on to review my order and post a review the original listing was removed and this new listing is what I found when searching for them. I can only guess the old listing had too many poor reviews.Before today I would have given a list of positives.  They sound great for small ear buds.  They fit comfortably.  The charging case works perfect.  I really like these and wish they lasted more than two months.
5,I really loved this product! I usually have trouble using headphones as most of them doesn't stay inside my ears and keeps falling off. I came across the previous model and is still using them now and fell in love with it. But after this headphones I truly recommend RIZIZI headphones to anyone who have issues of headphones not staying in place. There are many plus points to this:1) Fits perfectly in my ears and stays in for a long time2) Good cover and design3) Can see the battery percentage on the box which helps me charge them before it dies( one disadvantage of the previous model was not able to know how much charge is left)4) Have control buttons on the side of the earphones which makes it so much convenient5) Comes with a USB-C charging cable and spare ear budsThere is nothing which I can think about to get better according to me. I am not a person who puts reviews but this is something which I wish everyone needs to experience. Not that expensive too! I would definitely buy this for my loved ones! Hope my review will benefit someone!
1,I was so excited when I first got these. The sound quality was great the battery life was amazing‚Ä¶ but when things are too good to be true they usually are. After about two months one earbud stopped working properly it would just turn off on its own while I worked out and wouldn‚Äôt turn back on. A few weeks after that the battery life began to only last one use at the gym‚Ä¶and soon after they both died. Completelydisappointed‚Ä¶ :(
1,They stopped charging after only a couple of use.  Not worth the money.  When I bought them they where 39.99 they dropped the price to 29.99 I‚Äôm sure for a reason.  100 percent would look elsewhere.
1,After 2.5 months the product stopped working.  It does not charge.Even after following all of the manufacture troubleshooting instructions they don‚Äôt charge nor respond.Since I am beyond the return and exchange period I have no recourse but to write a bad review since I don‚Äôt know how to reach anyone to help.Lost $30 on this one.Try spending the extra money on a better product.
1,Some time I can't handle the latency of the voice even that some people don't notice it but if you sensitive to that like me don't ever think about it. And the cut of the voice at 70% charge also super annoying when it happens in a times my hand is not easy to reconnecting with mobile bluetooth. Plus the first rizizi buds I got had a charging  problem so I had to return it and get a second one as a replacement good thing that replacement was easy process.
5,Love these ear buds. The fit is great - they don't move at all during vigorous exercise - and they have a great range of sounds from bass (modest but at least it's there unlike most buds under $200) midrange and highs. Charge lasts for at least 3 hours and I have not had to recharge the charger for 3 weeks.  I did run into an issue with he charger but they are sending me a new one.  Overall happy esp. with the midrange.Disclosure: They are sending me a charging pad for writing a review but I would write an honest review regardless. I don't need a free charge pad - it's most important to make sure that if others are going to rely on my opinion they will get a true one.
2,These hurt so bad I can‚Äôt even wear them. I‚Äôve tried every size ear squidgy  they give you and they all hurt so bad I‚Äôm giving up. The hook that goes over/behind your ear hurts too. I needed these to drown out the incessant barking of dogs at work (I work at a dog boarding place) but these didn‚Äôt do a good job of that; however that might have something to do with the painful squidgy things I‚Äôm not sure. Anyway all in all I‚Äôm completely bummed out and disappointed. Onto the next I guess.
5,They hold their charge and they are light-weight!  Getting them for Christmas gifts and stocking stuffers!
5,Very intuitive and easy to use!!! I love the way the Bluetooth connected and started working before I figured out what I was supposed to do. The sound is really good too - very immersive.
3,Fits comfortably in the ear without falling outthe sound is very clear also love the fact that you can see the battery level of the earbuds on screen
5,Great product that is worth the price.
5,so far so good comfortable
5,These are my second pair of ficore head phones. I still have my first pairs but wanted to try the upgrade. I don't like smaller buds that are stuck in you ear and are lost easily so these are great. I have had bose and galaxy ear buds and my ficore headphones out performed all of them for the price. My only gripe is that the battery life on my first pair was not as long as I would like but they have extended them with the new pair. If I'm trying to exercise my galaxy buds fell out the ficore clip and inner ear piece stays in place. They stay on my ears when I'm exercising and they're mostly external so they don't hurt the inside of my ears. They don't have the active noise canceling that the earbuds live have but they have a much longer Bluetooth range so that I can use them much farther away from the device that I have heard them with. I also love having buttons as oppose to not knowing what you are touching or what it does. I use these when I travel at home doing work or just out and about. They are also quite durable as I have dropped them several times and have seen no change in the quality. I plan on buying these for as stocking stuffers for family because when you lose those $100 ear Buds you need a back up.
5,I was pleasantly surprised with these.  The battery life lasts really long! The sound quality and noise cancellation is super. This was a great buy. I highly recommend them!
5,Good Quality product so far finally able to get a pair small enough they don't hurt the insides of my ears.... Thank you
5,I really like these headphones.  I use them running and they stay really well in place. The sound quality is also really good.  I was suprised at how well the music sounds on these compared to my more expensive headphones they are similar in quality. I like that they tell you how charged the charging station is  as well as the headphones.  For the price these are definitely the best headphones out there.  These would make good gifts for the holidays.  Very comfortable I recommend using them at the gym or while running.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I'll reiterate what I've said in my review video for those who don't have in interest in watching it. The battery life is roughly 7-8 hours on a single charge. It came with 2 pairs of additional ear buds and a USB type C charger (just the cord not the actual plug on to the wall side) I really appreciate the LED display that not only indicates how much charge is left in your case but how far along each headphone is to full charge. Didn't test out the wireless charging feature but it does have that capability.  There are volume buttons on top of both headphones holding down either + or - will skip or restart the song (a chime will let you know when you've held it down long enough) pushing the button on the side of the headphone will pause the song.  After about 8 hrs straight of use they did become a little uncomfortable but I'm sure any pair will start to feel that way over such a long period of time.  Overall these might be the best pair I own simply for the LED indicators on the case  it's really nice to know when it needs to be charged instead of bring surprise that they aren't.  Also they came out of the box fully charged so that was a nice plus so I could use them right away.
4,Noise cancellation
5,These headphones are easy to use the bluetooth paired up right out of the box with no issues. The sound is impressive and I love the way I can see the battery levels on the carrying case. I am very happy with them and  I would not hesitate to buy again.
5,Like them.. would buy again..
5,These headphones look absolutely amazing. They look like high quality headphones and sound like them too. The box they come in conveniently charge and store them in style. For the price these cost it is absolutely worth it.
5,I was so incredibly surprised by these and would absolutely recommend them to anybody shopping for a pair.  I will even be buying two more sets for me hubby and son.  Thank you!!
5,Ok‚Ä¶so my first thought was‚Ä¶these are probably crappy Bluetooth headphones. WRONG!!!!! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about them.1. Each headphone can be adjusted! There is a volume putting on each one and can adjust them independently2. Easy push button center. I hate the sensors that rarely work nothing like a button.3. Wireless charging case‚Ä¶what?? Yep.4. Each bud has a mic on it.This is just a great product and an amazing value!!!!
5,Received the headphones lastnight. Wireless charging was quick the display screen is a definite upgrade from previous designs. The fit is perfect the weight does not cause my ears to get irritated while wearing them. The sound quality is more improved than the past versions of the headphones I've had from the company. I played different sound quality videos off of YouTube they passed the test for 8d music hearing it as if it was playing from all around me. The product over all first impressions are good will update in a month or so with a review on how durable they are and the case is.
5,This company has done it again. The sound is great and pairing to what ever Bluetooth device is Evan easier. The charging black case has a green light LED that tells you the percentage of the portable charge you have so one can safely go about there day knowing their headphones will be fully charged when they are needed. Having two ways to charge the case is an amazing feature. The two options are by wireless charging or by Type - C. The case itself has a smooth finish which feels great to the touch and when you close the case you do not have to worry about the two headphones getting loose. The case makes that clasping noise when you close it. The headphones feel great to wear while running  jogging ridding a bike or laying out on my porch. I can wear these headphones for an hour or more without having to adjust them.
5,Sounds amazing
5,The ear buds are comfortable as I prefer around the ear devices for use when walking or exercising.  It comes with alternate sized ear pads to use if the ones fitted are not the right size for the user.  The quality of the sound is also good.  There are two features I like in particular the additional buttons and the charging display.  The added buttons on both ear buds allow the user to change volume without having to do so on your phone (or whatever device is connected) as well as connect to calls skip tracks etc.  The buttons are easy to manipulate.  The other feature is the charging percentage display (see pic).  There's two types of displays one for the storage unit and one for the ear buds.  This is useful to see what percentage charge the storage unit has as well as the individual earbuds so you are prompted to plug in and charge up as needed.  The earbuds power on and connect quickly and are stable they don‚Äôt drop the connection.  Overall highly recommend this product.
4,Works as stated
5,I use these earphones while doing my daily 2-mile walk in a local park.  My previous pair did not have the over-ear loops and would constantly fall out of my ears.  These feel secure the sound is great and they come with 3 different sizes of pads so you can select the ones that best fit your ears.  A great feature is that the charge percentage shows right on the outside of the case‚Ä¶no need to open the case to check!  I am very happy with these earphones!
5,I really like them
5,So far I'm liking these.  Great for working outdoors.  Sound quality okay.  Lasted over 4 hours with no problems.  Easy to use.
5,So incredible bass compared to other buds I have had...used for 2 months now. Only recharged once...very comfortable too...love the mute/pause feature...the case is a little big is my only complaint. Still a 10 out of ten. So far
5,Works very well and easy to connect to my cell phone (Samsung )  I use it all day  I think I got lucky to buy this headphone
5,Works great for music and most of the time answering calls. Dunno if it's my phone but sometimes I'm hard to be heard from other side but it usually works well enough. Can connect easily long lasting battery life and cancels out noise really well. Good buy. üëç
5,It has been a week and I'm thoroughly pleased with this product. Best thing about this product is the charging case where it displays charging case's remaining power. Bluetooth headphones produce good quality sound with effective noise cancellation. I highly recommend this one.
5,These are very comfortable and easy to wear while doing things like running or working out.
5,Without a doubt these are the best wireless headphones that I have used up to this point. The connection between my phone and the headphones happens seamlessly. The headphones provide a great volume and very easy to use with the charging interface being available on the outside for you to view.Distance: I am able to stand at least 30 feet away from my phone and the headphones still play clear without any skips in the music.Clarity: The mechanics behind these headphones are quite remarkable. For sound quality they can be compared to the bose wireless headphones for a fraction of the price.
5,I just realized I‚Äôve been wearing one of these all day. Got my calls listened  to navigation and audiobooks - without recharging or discomfort. I only use one at a time because I have to be aware of my surroundings and communicate with people. I carry the case with me in case I use up the charge and quickly change out to the other ear. This is a much better product than I expected for the price I paid during prime days. I don‚Äôt listen to a lot of musics but for clear spoken word these are great.
5,Es lo que queria todo bien.
5,2 days after the window close to return this product the left earbud stopped working so I could not return it  or get my money back
5,They work well and feel great
5,When talking over the cellphone people sound clear and so do I. You could use 1 or both earbuds.When listening to music it is also loud.The light in the front of the case does stay on for a while but it turns off after 30 seconds.It holds really good charge.Love that it's compatible with wireless charging.I have connected it different phones (Samsung and Iphone) and tablets.
5,these are the best headphones I‚Äôve ever used. They are great with noise canceling and the battery life is incredible I will buy these again
5,I got these after getting an older pair from the same company. Definite improvements in quality. Highly recommend!
5,I am pleasantly surprised how much more comfortable these are than my old headphones. I like that it has a volume button as well. You are able to do everything you need without touching your phone.
5,I like to use the headphones when I walk alone.  I can hear the music and still be aware of sounds around me.
5," Hello. My name is Nancy and I would like to start this review by saying that I bought a set of bluetooth ear buds about six months ago and they didn't stand up to my expectations so about three months ago give or take I bought a different brand of bluetooth ear buds that were supposed to be top of the line bluetooth ear buds and although they were a little bit better. Like the first pair of bluetooth ear buds. They took a long period of time to charge and then would not last close to an eight hour work shift. On top of that I constantly struggled with them to stay in my ears. So I started my surch for my next and hopefully my final pair of bluetooth ear buds. After a long and tiresome surch I finally decided to buy a pair of Rizizi bluetooth ear buds. They came in a timely manner and they were in a very nice rechargeable carrying case that zipped up which is very convenient because unlike the first pair the lid kept falling off. Any way the dark color of the case is very nice because it doesn't show the dirt and dust from my work place like the first two pair of bluetooth ear buds did. The Rizizi bluetooth ear buds have a convenient flexible loop on them that makes them very comfortable to ware for a eaight hour shift at work and they stay in my ears without any problem what so ever. The Rizizi bluetooth ear buds charge remarkably faster than the first two pair of bluetooth ear buds I had bought and they stay charged my complete eight hours that I am at work and then my husband used them as he cleaned the snow off of our very long driveway and walk ways and that takes about two and a half hours and they were still charged. My husband and I both are very pleased with these Rizizi bluetooth ear buds! So anyone that is looking for a fantastic pair of bluetooth ear buds that charge very quickly and stay charged for a very long time (not sure how long) but my husband and I used them for approximately elevin hours and they were still playing music. Oh yeah I almost forgot to include the quality of sound that the Rizizi bluetooth ear buds provide. They have amazing sound. Seriously. The base trebble and in stereo sound is fantastic! With the first two pair of bluetooth ear buds my husband could barely hear them over the snow blower. With the Rizizi bluetooth ear buds he said he can hear the music perfectly. So with that being said. My husband and I both highly recommend the Rizizi bluetooth ear buds for anyone who's in surch for a great pair of bluetooth ear buds
5,Amazing product and well made at a really good price
4,I really do like them.  I don't usually review until I've had the item a few months..hence the "so far".I spend a lot of time on the phone.  The most important part was for them to hear me well without a bunch of amplified background noise.  And I have had no complaints everyone says they are good.  Only draw back would be the volume level.  I can't get them to go quite as loud as I would like usually they are fine at max but there have been times I wish for more.  Battery is as expected.
5,Finally I've found earbuds that let me know how much battery life is left (case) and fit comfortably and securely. Plus the price was good.
5,Fully functional.
5,Great sound quality and construction. I'm glad I made this purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it so far
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The wireless headphones were a great addition to my tech collection.  Not only do the headphones charge wirelessly but there is also a battery indicator on the case that displays how much charge is left on the headphones as well as the charging case.  The case even has a smooth matte-quality finish.  The headphones seem like they should be more expensive for what you get.  Also the packaging that the headphones arrived in is quality.  It came with extra earpieces as well as a short usb-c charging cable (wall mount isn't included which isn't a big deal considering how easy it is to get one).  The sound quality is very crisp and clear.  The headphones are also comfortable and stay in place as they mount over the ear.  The only recommendation that I could make is that it could come with a longer usb-c cable but even then this isn't a big deal as many customers may find that they could use the same charger that they already use for their phones.  Great product!
5,Great product
5,The earbuds work great. I would recommend them. The price can't be surpassed for the quality.
5,Highly recommend these great sound batty life and range.
5,I use these mainly for tv viewing and they work better than expected. The charge lasts a long time and the pairing is easy. I didn't realize that there is an added feature - a charger/battery built into the case. So once the case is charged you can use it to recharge the earbuds several times without using a wall charger
5,It exceeded my expectations. Great sound. Easy to use.  Earbuds charge in the charging case. Charging case can charge earbuds multiple times on 1 charge.
5,Sound is excellent and love the way they Stay in Place.  Good Choice
3,Difficulty connecting to iPad and iPhone. Will try one more time before returning product.
5,Really lightweight
4,Good and enjoy
5,clear sound easy to pair easy to answer calls good price
5,These have great sound call battery life and comfort
1,It worked for a month then died this is my 3rd time can you send return label to give to UPS to return this? Or I won't buy from Seller ever  again
1,I was initially impressed when I got these headphones but I noticed after a month my right headphone would tune in and out and now it only works about 10% of the time. It‚Äôs so frustrating when I‚Äôm in the middle of a workout and it completely turns off and there is nothing I can do to reset it. I wish the problem happened earlier so I can return them
5,Una de la cosa que me gust√≥ mucho de este aud√≠fono fue la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a que dura aproximadamente 8 horas con una carga al 100%. En el art√≠culo viene con 2 pares de aud√≠fonos del color negro y con un cable USB tipo c el estuche es tordamente confortable ya que lo puede agarrar hasta con una sola mano y lo puede guardar hasta en el bolsillo de tu pantal√≥n sin ning√∫n problema  el estuche tiene un peque√±o panel led que no indica el nivel de la bater√≠a de los aud√≠fonos y del estuche el estuche es compatible con cargado inal√°mbrico los aud√≠fonos vienes con 3 botones que tiene la funci√≥n de subir o bajar el volumen con solo presionar la tecla + o ‚Äì de  los aud√≠fonos tiene otros bot√≥n que nos permite pausar reproducir saltar o reiniciar la canci√≥n o usar nuestro asistente de nuestro celular inteligente. Otra de la cosa me gusto mucho fue que los aud√≠fonos vino con carga al 100%.
5,I really like these headphones.  I love the wraparound ear pieces.  They are secure no matter what activity you are doing.  Sports and yard work do not move them so your sound is uninterrupted.  The stereo between the two ears is real stereo.  You can hear the sound bounce back and forth which isn't always the case with other headphones.  The sound quality is great for in ear speakers and they are very sound cancelling.  My favorite thing about these headphones is the ease of use.  They pair with each other automatically and pair easily with your devices as well. The buttons on the ear pieces allow for great control of the sound without always reaching for your phone.  The power meter on the case and the c cable charging allows you to always have a ready to go headphones with full power.  These are my favorite headphones so far and definitely the easiest to use.
5,I bought a previous version of these bluetooth headphones which had some annoying quirks to them. I am glad to say these are much better quality and the quirks were primarily addressed on this new Rizizi headphones. First off the charging mechanism is much improved. Charging starts almost instantaneously upon placing the headphones in the charging case. The digital display on the charging case is very useful as it indicates the remaining charge on the case and the charging status of the case and headphones. Both the wired and induction charging methods work as expected. Unlike the previous model the headphones are oriented with the right headphone on the right and left headphone on the left upon opening the charging/holding case. The headphones quickly paired to my android device. The sound quality of streaming videos and music was rather surprising for this cheaper pair of bluetooth headphones. Also I was able to walk away from my android device into all surrounding rooms on the same house level with no connection issues. Lastly the call quality is good on both ends. I was able to hear clearly while the person on the other side could clearly hear me. Overall I am very happy with these bluetooth headphones.
5,Easy to recharge The quality of the calls are coming in clearly.Noise reduction so far so good .I can place my phone inside my bag and never miss a call .If you are on the go a lot or driving these are the ones to have
5,The battery last a very long time and the noise cancelation is awesome.  I totally recommend.
5,Love the battery life indicator and the actual battery life of the product.
5,Useful headphones. I use these when mowing or running/walking. They stay put and last for a while. I charge them using the USB charger. The charging does not take long. They state their charge at 100 when complete. Would recommend.
5,Excellent sound
5,The earbuds have a great sound & last a while on a single charge. The display that shows the charge left on the case is great & also shows the earbuds charging. The easy access of the buttons are great also. The range on them are better than most i have used & love that they turn on & connect to the phone.
5,These wireless earbuds are great! Easy to use great sound quality and long battery life.  Love the case and seems to charge up quickly.  Can use just one or both earbuds and they link up with Bluetooth without a problem!  Love them!
5,Earbuds have great sound quality and are perfect for staying in my ears.
5,Tried them on and was blown away by the bass... Never heard audio this good at this price point.  Fast delivery.  Get em!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I recommend this product to anyone for hanging out listening to music working out walking and even zumba. The sound is great and they are very comfortable on the ear. It comes with different ear buds to find what is most comfortable for you. The case is sleek and small. It comes with the usb cord to charge and a manual. It is user friendly to set up and use. I have uploaded a video and photos to see exactly what comes with the product. On the side of the case it shows how charged the product it. Even better the headphones come charged and ready for use! The shipping was quick and packaging was good. Whether it us working out meditating or just hanging out this product is great for any activity. I have used other headphone but the battery dies or something happens. These headphones seem like they will last. Really excited to continue using these headphones.

The sound was clear when I made calls listening to music and to podcasts and to steaming movies. I was surprised that it was loud and clear in all different forms. I also love the fact that each Bluetooth piece has their own volume control so that you can wear one or both of them and adjust the volume on both of them separately.  I tend to wear only one sometimes and it's good to know that I can wear either the left or the right one and control the volume. I didn't even need to use my volume booster app cause the volume was great the way it is. I found my favorite Bluetooth and will be buying this for my wife and kids . The price is right and so is the quality.  Stop reading this and buy yourself and others one or two.
5,I'm a runner and Crossfitter and have trouble with ear buds staying in. I can honestly say these are the most comfortable earbuds I've tried. They stay in without causing ear pain they are low profile (don't stick out) so fit nicely under a beanie in the cold. Sound is great and functionality is easy as can be. Very happy.
5,Great!!
5,I am fascinated with the earbuds fits my ears perfectly! The sound is fantastic and the battery is longer than other earbuds I had before. I am very happy with it.
5,Use these almost everyday and charge them only once a week. Great sound quality too. Highly recommended!
5,These are very loud and bass is good.. my fav headphones.. but after a few hrs they make my ears hurt from wearing em too long.. i wear em about 8 hrs a day for work
3,No me gust√≥ por su bajo vol√∫men
5,The product works great
5,Battery life is great. Noise cancelation is pretty decent. I can hear other people but like barely when I have these in. These are pretty decent headphones. Only downside so far is they are a little big in my ears and it hurts my ears a little bit but other than that these are great.
5,The headphones are great
5,I received these ear phones as part of a promotion.  First impression I am pleased.  I am very happy with the prior generation of and these seem a bit better  They are a bit more compact and more comfortable. Easy to connect.  Long battery life of the predecessor is yet to be verified.The audio quallity seems fine to me.  I don't listen to music just audiobooks.
5,Sounds excellent upon receipt and stays snug on my ears.
5,These are easy to learn and use.  I like the case battery and charging LED indicators on the outside of the case.  They fit my ears and have bluetooth connection and out-of-range pings.  No problems so far.
5,These headphones are the best workout headphones I've ever used!
5,So far I really like these earbuds. They are comfortable and stay in my ears. I love that it shows the battery percentage on the case. And there are actual buttons to pause and turn the volume up/down on each earbud themselves. I usually only wear one at work so this feature is something I had been looking for.
5,Easy to use and holds charge for hours of listening. They fit comfortable in your ear and don‚Äôt make them hurt after extended wear  time. Very loud and good sound! Can hear and be heard during phone calls.
5,use these for yard word ear buds stay in place. Great  Buy
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I bought these headphones because the previous version was okay. These have seriously leveled up. I have never had a more comfortable pair of headphones. I have pretty bad cauliflower(cauliflower in all the wrong spots in my ears) and they still fit like a glove. The charging case is better because they fit more securely. You can look and see how charged the case is and which headphones are still charging. These are upgraded to include all controls on both ear buds so you don't have to reach up with both hands to get the volume right. They are durable and the sound quality is awesome. They also charge very fast. They are black and very sleek; they don't make me look like an alien like previous versions. The sound quality is great the base is very clear like I feel like it is actually hitting my ear.
5,I have owned several different sets of Bluetooth earbuds which I use almost every day for work and around the house.  Sound clarity is great on these and the home base they nest in to recharge is well thought out.  love the digital readout on battery levels for the buds AND case - no more guessing how much juice you have left!  I also like the ear hoops that loop over the top of your ear.  This way I can remove the sound but keep the bud draped over my ear if I need to talk to someone briefly then go back to listening.
5,I have purchased several other headphones looking for a good sound and comfort and I think I finally found them.  These headphones were extremely easy to pair to my phone and are super comfortable they stay in place while running so you don't have to worry about them falling off.  The sound is amazing and the fact that they have wireless charging is great.  The display helps yiu see how much battery you have left so you know when it's time to recharge them.  Overall great headphones.
5,Physically: comfortable secure fit and easy to operate controls. (multifunction and  plus/minus on each ear)Audio: great sound. caution it can get loud enough to hurt.Battery: they will last all day on a single charge.
5,EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT THESE EAR BUD'S NO FAULT'S YET!

5,I received these ear buds earlier this week and I am very pleased with them so far.  The ear buds arrived quickly and they were packaged well.  It was nice that the case was already charged on arrival so I could try them right away.  They paired quickly and easily to my iPhone via Bluetooth located under MY DEVICES showing as ‚ÄúA12‚Äù without having to use the manual.  They fit comfortably on my ears and I haven‚Äôt had any issues wearing them for extended periods.  There are on and off buttons on the sides of each ear bud and the volume buttons are on the top of each also.  The buttons are easily accessed and have a fast response time.  You can adjust the volume using either the left or right ear bud and it changes both at the same time.  I have used this to make a few phone calls and the sound was clean.  I asked the people that I talked to if they can hear me clearly and they confirmed my voice was clear.  I still need to try outside to see if any background noise affects the sound quality.  But so far so good.  The battery seems to last a long time and the case charges both with the attached cord and I really like that I can wirelessly charge on my qi charging pads.  Overall I really like these ear buds.
5,7/3/22 - used em on a 2hr hike in 90¬∞ temps and they are very comfortable. Never had to adjust em. Didn't feel any discomfort at all. Tempted to buy another pair at this price.7/1/22 - Unbelievable value. I have Apple Airpods Gen2 but when I run they tend to slip and fall out. These are the solution. The case is pretty large so I dont carry them with me on runs. Love the battery life digital indicator. They fit Snug and come with additional Silicone ear size options. For the price these are too good to pass up.  I have yet to test the mic quality when talking with others. Stay tuned!
5,Easy to pair and navigate
5,I recently purchased this item and found that like its predecessor this wireless bluetooth headphones has a very long battery life. More importantly this fits well in your ears and does not fall out like so many other earbuds when running/exercising. Thoroughly impressed.
5,I received these today. They are comfortable to wear. Sound is very good. I listened to both music and Babbel doing a French lesson. Both were easy to hear with great sound. I also answered a call and the person heard me just fine. I like them so much I asked my wife if she wanted some. Of course she said she would just use mine!
5,Great product great price
5,Great for everyday use.
5,These ear buds have amazing sound quality easy to pair sleek design and very comfortable for long wear. The battery life is also very good. There is a charging case with digital display that let's you know when they're fully charged which is a very nice feature. The ear buds charge quickly. Quality is there at a great price... Highly recommend these.
5,I‚Äôve only used them once so far but my first impression is very good. I‚Äôve had trouble keeping earbuds in while running but no problem with these. Very comfortable & light.

Instructions included with the earphones were helpful and clearly written.  Not something typically written about but for some it is important.  Would ship well for well and not a worry of anything being broken within shipping.Contents:  Shown in clear bag is a collection of 2 other sizes for ear inserts (1 already installed on earphones that being of the medium size). Also included as a usb-b to usb-c type connector for powering the holder and earphones.  NOT INCLUDED is a power to usb adapter although plugging into your computer it will charge no problem.  Also not included but pictured is the wireless charger but if you have one it does work (highly recommend).  The charging base for the earphones is like a separate battery that can charge the earphones after each use. When placing in the base there will be a battery symbol that shows the charge in the earphones.  The charging base station has a very long lifespan as well and can pretty much last days without needing a new charge even if you listen a lot.  The case also is very small in size (2‚Äùx4‚Äùx4‚Äù roughly) and feels really nice to the touch.  For a head set with earhooks this may be the smallest you will find.Ease of Use:  Right out of the box these things are very simple to pair.  Simply take them out go to your Bluetooth list on your listening device and add the device.  On my iphone this worked very easily but imagine that many other devices this will be about the same.  A suggestion is from moving from one device to another is to forget the earphones as they will default to want to connect to that device.  The purpose of this is for ease of use.Sound:  The quality of sound is actually quite clear and is well balanced.  For a workout earpiece these really do take all kinds of music quite well.Controls:  The volume on both sides is key because not always do you wear both ear pieces.  Being able to have quick access to volume is key and good that both earpieces have the same control.  The one touch button of play and pause and then the double tap to activate siri is also nice and available for both earpieces.Overall:  Highly suggest purchasing these if you are looking for some good affordable earpieces for working out or just plain on working.  These will for sure be long lasting for you and your listening pleasure.
5,I am surprised by the quality of sound of these small earbud headphones.  The ear pieces make a rather nice fit and help to block out external noises.  The quality of bass also surprised me.  The charging indicators are a nice addition as well as the charging capacity and battery within the case.  The over-the-ear loops help to keep the earbud headphones in place during exercise and physical activity.  The material is soft and pleasant.  There is a magnetic connection between the earbud headphones and the charging case so a good connection is ensured.  The case is a hard case which gives me piece of mind when putting it in my backpack or in my pocket that my earbud headphones won‚Äôt become damaged.  Individual volume control buttons on each earbud headphone is also something different between this pair and other pairs that I have owned; it allows you to volume up or volume down even when using only a single earbud.  Overall would recommend to a friend.
5,Great fit!
5,These are the ones to go for if you love music just as much as I do then these wireless earbuds are just for you first off the base on these earbuds are out of this world I was blown away by how amazing they sounded they also give you a lifetime warranty with them you can't beat that for a great price I highly recommend these hope this helps

The connection between the buds is solid and does not break often.The battery last about 8 hours. The LED battery info on the outside of the case is amazing. No more wondering how much juice is left. Charging is easy with a USB C cord.The sound quality is clear and the bass does not crackle. I love that there is volume control on both buds. This is an improvement over the last model.The fit is very solid and it does not feel lose while running. There is no moving in your ear at all.The microphone is very solid and noise canceling works well. I can take calls talk and listen easily enough.The noise canceling is very good for helping me ignore comments from people I run by.  As well as barking dogs and other noises.I think these head phones are very good especially at this price point
5,The charging case displays the battery life which is nice the earbuds fit securely and the sound is good quality.
5,I like that the earphones set in the ear without blocking regular hearing.  They are just the right size and the quality of sound is extra nice.  I would definitely purchase these again in the future.

They have excellent battery life and charge very fast. The front display is very handy to indicate which headphone is charging and how full it is along with the percentage indicator shows how much juice the case has left. The earbuds are comfortable to wear long term and are light enough that you do not even notice that they are there. Sound quality is excellent for such a small package. You can hear the bass and the high notes of any song. Unlike other brands these earbuds go to insane volume. Noise cancellation is not as good as say over the ear headphones nor is there active noise cancellation but for how big they are they do an excellent job cancelling out your surroundings. All in all a perfect gift for yourself or a friend
5,Great fit!
5,Great sounds come in small packages! These earbuds are great for working out and actually stay in unlike other brands. They are stylish and hold charge well. Don‚Äôt hesitate!‚ÄîBUY THEM! :)
5,This is the 3rd set of ear buds I have from this company.  They just keep improving!  There is now volume on the ear piece they are even more comfortable.  The sound is amazing and all for $30.  I highly recommend.
5,Love the headphones work perfectly good!
1,After less than a month the right earbud stopped working in the middle of my run. I put it in the case to charge and it wouldn‚Äôt charge. Terminals were clean and still didn‚Äôt work. I see others had the same issue. Junk. If something can‚Äôt last 30 days then don‚Äôt bother. Look elsewhere.
5,The ear hook doesn't bend or mild around your ear so it's kinda pointless. But they do work amazingly well! The battery life is crazy long and they do cancel out a significant amount of sound. I love being able to see how much charge is left. It shows the charge of each one and overall.
5,It has a VERY long charge  And I love how loud my cell sounds with them. I do wish I could  improve the bass. Still learning about them. So fare these was the best ones I bout in a very long time. Price was a steal. I think its time for me to buy these for gifts now before they run out.
5,The product immediately paired with my phone with no issue. They fit nicely comfortable especially around the back of the ear. The sound quality is excellent. Talking on the phone was a success. Other brands I have used would result in complaints from people I would be on the phone with I sounded like I was in a tin can.
5,These work better than any other headphones I have used.
