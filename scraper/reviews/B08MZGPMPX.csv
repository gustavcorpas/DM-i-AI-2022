5,I use this at the left side of my bed. It clamps onto a side unit. What I find remarkable about this clamp is that I attached it about five months ago and it has not loosened its grip at all. Rock solid stable.  The phone holder is equally effective at holding onto the phone even with an occasional mid-sleep bump of an arm. The lenght and flexibility are also excellent. I fully recommend this product.
5,First my intent on buying this was to mount on a baby grand piano and be able to do video lessons with students.  My concerns when buying it were:1.  How strong the goose neck would be?  I have goose neck mic stands and the goose necks do not hold in position anything very heavy.  Nor do they hold their shape very well.  This holder seems well made and of solid construction.  The goose neck portion is VERY strong and feels like a solid piece of steel rod.  It takes much more effort to bend than a normal mic stand goose neck.  It does hold its shape very well.2.  How would it attach to the piano.  I did not want something that would damage the finish but hold tightly.  The clamping mechanism is easy to adjust and tighten down.  The clamp itself has some rubber pads that keep it from scratching the piano.3.  Will the phone clamp securely hold the phone when placed facing down.  The clamp is strong enough to securely hold the phone in any position.  There are a couple ridged areas that you will want to make sure the phone is behind to make it secure.Now for a few "take note of" points.1.  The piano is on wooden floor joist and not a concrete floor.  While playing or even walking around the piano there is some "bouncing" of the piano.  It is not a whole lot but it is there.  This causes some bouncing and movement of the holder and phone.  It is not so much due to the holder but on what it is attached.  I might have to move it to a stand on the floor but it also bounces some.  I will need to check to see how much it affects the view by the student.2.  Dialing "911".  I have an iPhone which has the capability to dial 911 when pressing the side buttons together.  Be careful not to clamp the clamp over these two buttons.  Also do not press these buttons while trying to put the phone in the clamp.  You can either take note of this while inserting the phone or simply turn off this feature on the phone.  The later was my choice after accidentally dialing 911.Otherwise good quality and price. Sturdy. I can see it working for multiple scenarios and applications.
5,I have a cluttered home work desk with 2 PCs Bluetooth speaker clamp on lights...This phone holder is just what I needed to keep my Android phone out of the way but accessible!Very sturdy but easy to place where I need it.  Love the gooseneck design.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!!! Love love love this product!!!
5,This product is exactly what I needed for my IPhone and I’d highly recommend it to anyone in need of such a product !
5,excellent product!! stronger and fits perfectly.
5,Sturdy and able to grab a 3/4" pipe.
5,I love this product so much that I purchased four for myself and three for business associates. Great product!!!
5,Highly recommend I have Neuropathy and this really comes in handy
5,It’s been in my car for a couple of weeks now and is still holding on like new. I love that I can adjust it so that it’s not in the way of anything since my car is small.
5,Of all of the different gooseneck phone holders this one has best worked with my disability. I have very limited dexterity and strength. The neck easily moved but it's still sturdy. This is the first gooseneck that the clasp hasn't broken on me.
5,It is great to use to watch videos from my phone while in bed
4,When I upgraded my iPhone to a 13 it never occurred to me that I’d have to find a replacement for something I used every night that I purchased years ago on Amazon but found it wouldn’t hold my new phone so I had to start my search for it’s replacement.While for my application/use of this I couldn’t attach it to my headboard of my bed because it was too thick and so was the edge of my nightstand so I was left with being able to attach it to the metal frame that holds my box springs and mattress on the side of my bed so it’s a little in my way getting in and out of bed.They could have made the main pole more flexible in my opinion it’s rather stiff and difficult to bend however I was able to bend it back towards me so that I could watch movies on my iPhone while laying down in bed.I’d have liked it to be longer or extendable so it would sit up higher from the edge of my bed but I think my mattress sits very high so that’s something to consider if you intend to use it like I have.Using it in this manner I have to lay on my left side all the time in order to watch anything so I get tired of having to do that.Until I can find another place to attach it to in my bedroom so I can view movies on my phone I’ll just keep using this way. I guess I’m satisfied with my purchase.
5,I purchased this item after my first one broke almost two years after purchase. I was so happy with the first purchase I decided to purchase another. I'm hoping this one lasts as long if not longer than the first. The phone holder/clamp broke at  first the rubber hokdees was able to repair then the clamp itself broke irreparably to pieces. This one seems more sturdy.
4,Bought 6-7-2022 already broke
5,I purchased my first goose neck and it worked wonderful for several months. There was a small defect and the the base and neck separated so I contacted customer service and they shipped me out a new ASAP. I'm so glad they did because I love this product!
5,Have a bed with some kind of headboard or a floor lamp nearby? Then this just might be the product for you.  Bought it for someone who was at first sick in bed for a few days and juggling phone to watch movies and YouTube videos.  In this day and age its most likely not "if" going to get sick but "when." Its a functional accessory to have in the house.  (I was also thinking it would be great to use in the car for kids in the backseat. Less likelihood of a dropped phone.
5,Product is good but a little wobbly but that’s expected from the design!!
4,Pro: large clamp long length stiff but flexibleCon: so long it bounces and wiggles easilyKnow what you want. The extra length is convenient but be sure you mount it to a stable surface.
5,Stronger than I thought.  Easy to use.  Adjustable in both attaching to table and inserting my iPhone.
5,This is perfect for residence hall time!
4,Overall very good product. Very easy to clamp a phone with one hand. About 3 seconds required to dampen instability. Product lasts about 2 years with constant daily use before plastic clamp breaks.
5,Smooth and quiet but sturdy to adjust...I love it!
4,too short
5,A friend of mine had a stroke and was only able to use her right hand. So I brought this to the hospital and clamped it on the sidebar and she was able to send messages FaceTime and go to her Facebook account
5,This is my second one my first one lasted for about 2years of hard use I liked it so much I bought it again
5,I ordered this one after searching and reading a ton of different reviews. It was purchased for a patient of mine that has a limited grasp and coordination due to neuropathy but still is young at heart and tech savy. Easy setup and perfect for use on a bedside table. The simplistic clip is very user friendly for placing the phone on and the little rubber backing is a nice touch for stabilizing. It took a bit of muscle to adjust how it would fit her needs the best but super sturdy to where I don't feel like it will ever flop down with the weight of the phone. No complaints here she's very happy to not fumble and drop such an expensive phone so much! It even fits with a thick otterbox case on. Would recommend!
4,Bought this product on Nov 28th 2021 and loved it however it snapped within 6 months. Seemed like a quality product so I expected it to last longer.
4,Very well made  sturdy.  I just wish the length extended just a tad bit longer.  But love it! Both my grand kids want one for watching their tablets in bed! Buying that one next! Happy with the purchase.
4,hope it wont fall off
5,happy with the product
5,Previously bought a gooseneck phone holder from a different company. It lasted for a year or so before the entire arm broke off so I bought this one to replace it. This one seems studier and better made. I like the material of the arm -- it's not plastic or rubber but feels like kind of like faux leather material? Either way it's nice and so far the holder is working well. Seems to be able to hold a decent amount of weight so it does not sink or sag even if i am resting my hand on it a little bit.
5,I have purchased the previous model to this one some time ago.  Those lasted well.  However THIS new/upgraded design is much more robust and with the added swivel head makes it so much easier to use.I highly recommend trying this product at home at the office (frees up hands and desktop).As an Engineer I am very satisfied with the improved design and workmanship.
5,Wonderful!
4,Is pretty good
5,I took so much time researching what phone holder to get because I use it for photos for my webcam etc. and decided to go with this one. Definitely was the right choice!! Super sturdy even for a iPhone pro max! Can go anyway you want it.
5,Sure it took them three redesigns to get it right.  But they kept working until they had it – something their competitors failed to do.  What makes me the expert?  I have been using similar phone arms from others since early 2017.  I have bought more than a dozen of these arms over the years continually replacing them as they all eventually broke.  The most fragile part was the phone clamp which was poorly designed using thin plastic – it rarely lasted more than a few months.  Alternative phone clamps were so stiff that my fingers would collapse while trying to insert the phone.  I have an oversized Galaxy S9+.Why would I continue to buy these?  Because while they are working these phone arms are a really really useful.  My favorite use is for hands-free reading Kindle books watching YouTube videos etc. after I go to bed.  Great way to distract me and shut my mind down so I fall asleep.  Just be sure the book is not too exciting.  Key accessory:  try connecting a Bluetooth mouse to your phone and put it under the sheets.  No longer do you need to touch the phone which will otherwise do some bouncing.You still might ask what is so great about this arm compared to others?  All of the material choices are heavy duty - there are NO thin and frail plastic pieces to break.  The phone is easy to mount with a mild but firm spring and it is a snap to position thanks to a ball-socket joint.  The arm itself is stiff but I think it is a perfect compromise of rigidity and flexibility.My hats are off to the engineers who designed this.  For me it is one of those small things in life that makes it all more fun.  Thank you for a job well done!
5,I love everything about it. It holds my phone to record great. The arm is flexible enough but sturdy enough. I like how the arm is thick to grab hold of to move. I had one before this one and it was a pain to move around.
4,Love this design color is cool in white.  Very simple to insert phone just be careful not to let the clamp press down on the side buttons as the clamp will only hold the phone sideways not longways. works as expected so far . . .
5,I use this by my bed while I am winding down for the night. I can move it wherever I need to in order to be comfortable and still be functional on my phone. I give this 5 stars even with my two issues. I’ve owned this since December of 2020 and it finally broke last week at the base of the arm. My other issue is that if there is any movement it will wobble for a long time but as long as it is stopped it will be completely stable. I am already purchasing a new one right after writing this.
5,this works. it’s stable but obviously it shakes if you bump what ever it’s attached to. i just got it so i can’t speak to the concerns about the gooseneck failing at the base. i can confirm it will hold an iPhone 12 pro max IN a giant indestructible otter case no problem. also the clamp is adjustable so it will attach to just about any desktop or tabletop.
5,Perfect for my needs! The neck is so sturdy that it take a bit of muscle to bend but i can hang my mini fan on it and it dosnt bend with the weight. I love how the clip can be adjusted for wide bedframes!!! easy to use!! I LOVE THIS!!!
4,I like the versatility of this holder and overall it functions as described. My only complaint is that it is very sensitive to any vibrations.  If I am filming at my workbench it picks up every little bump or vibration and the phone camera bounces accordingly. I have to attach the devise to something disconnected from the work table to keep the arm from bouncing.  This makes it less convenient and more difficult to frame the video.
5,Very sturdy and feels like it will last I have a big heavy phone (surface duo) and this works great even for it.
4,This product broke after just a few months of use however wonderful costumer service reached out to me immediately and sent me a replacement!
5,I had a similar product to this one before but it was magnetic.  I just upgraded to an iPhone 11 and wanted to utilize the wireless charging which does not allow you to have a case with metal in it so I got this “grip version“ instead.  This one is so much sturdier and easier to use than the one I got from the other company.  Just keep in mind that it is sturdy but flexible; meaning if you have it completely extended your phone won’t droop… but I would say this product is good for FaceTime and watching videos and you should probably keep web surfing to a minimum because if you touch the phone while it’s on the mount (and again only when fully extended) it will slighty bounce up and down for a few seconds but this is not the fault of the product. I think it’s the perfect balance of sturdiness and flexibility. If it was more flexible I think your phone would droop and if it was sturdier it would be hard to move it around.  You can blame physics for that one not the product.  I also saw some other reviews saying it wasn’t that easy to move to different locations.  I completely disagree.  It’s very easy to detach and reattach it somewhere else.  Also a grips the phone really well...  It’s a great product and I am a very picky consumer.
3,Works until it doesn’t.
5,Super sturdy very sleek and has a wide vise grip like jaw.
5,It’s very sturdy and clamps well at both ends.
5,The product is good. It's sturdy
4,Works as intended but shakes for a bit when you even touch it
3,The stand is very brittle and snaps easy. Had to replace mine twice
4,A little stiff maneuvering into place but works well it was a real treat not having to hold my phone to watch a movie while in bed. 👏😀
4,I previously bought the version of this Lamicall gooseneck phone holder that had an expandable grip instead of this clip style. I preferred the expandable grip on the old one and this clip style doesn’t seem to have the same range of articulation at the clip’s ball-joint attachment as the previous version did.That aside I’m glad I ordered this. I keep it attached to my headboard for now so that I can watch videos or do Zoom calls hands free and on short notice. My last one broke at the attachment of the rod to the base after being flexed at that point too many times. But it lasted a year and I hope this one will last longer.
5,I use the Lamicell Phone Holder to hold my phone when I read electronic books and news in bed. I can lie flat on my back and don’t have to arch my neck forward to read something that would otherwise be resting on my chest. This model is long enough at 38.6” to reach from the side table where it is clamped to directly over my eyes. It is strong enough to easily hold my iPhone Pro together with case wired headphones and attached MagSafe charger without drooping. In addition the clamp that holds the phone is easy to use and rotates 360 degrees.
5,This gooseneck is great. The base clamp is padded and does not mar whatever furniture you may clamt it to. The flexible gooseneck is a little stiff but that is a good thing because it will not move out of position if you have a heavy cell phone. The cell phone holding clamp easily accommodates various sizes of cell phones. I love this  gooseneck cell phone holder. I have it clamped to my bed's headboard and when I feel like watching a video while in bed I simply insert my cell phone into the cell phone holding clamp and that's all there is to it. This cell phone holder makes watching a video while in bed very easy and convient.
4,[Update] The seller was kind enough to reach out to me in order to send me a replacement. I received it last week and just put it up on my bedside table. Will put an updated review as we go again :) thank you so much! Customer service is great I appreciate yall!The product was superb in the beginning but after only a few months use of it the arm base near the clamp came undone and ultimately broke today. Very sad as I loved this product. I want to recommend it but this is the second one Ive come across that has broken shortly after purchasing.
3,This is the second one I’ve bought. The first lasted a couple of months this one 5 months. Amazon gave me a refund but I’ve gotten used to these. Both broke in the same way. The arm attachment to the base broke. I would look for a different manufacturer. This last one was supposed to be more sturdy than the earlier model which it seemed as if it were. I guess the longer life was an improvement but it still broke
2,I’ve had 2 of them. Each lasts about 7 months before it fails. The gooseneck is basically a flexible strand of braided copper wires (like coat hangers twisted) and wrapped in a dense rubber jacket. This is what makes it flexible. Until it fails it is an awesome product. The clamp holds it in place the claw grip hold a phone securely and the neck is very flexible offering many different options for placement. Unfortunately the connection between the gooseneck and the plastic clamp that attaches to a desktop or a headboard is just too weak. After 7 months of adjustments it breaks making the entire thing flop. At that point it’s a useless product. My first one failed at 7 months and 11 days. My second one failed at 7 months and 4 days. Fairly consistent. I just can’t justify buying a 3rd one so I’ll be looking elsewhere for an alternative.
5,The sturdiness is great.  It attaches securely to end table by sofa.  It’s very versatile; can go with you wherever you go as long as there’s a surface to attach it to.  The only reason why I give maneuverability 4 stars is b/c of the extreme stiffness of the product.  I must use both hands to change it’s position after being attached to table or the like.  Having said that it needs that stiffness in order to not be weighted down upon holding onto your phone or tech device.  My neck was in so much pain from having to work on my phone so often & this gooseneck phone holder has allowed for healing to be obtained in my neck.  I highly recommend this product.
5,I had similar products before and it wasn’t as great as this one. Definitely good quality.
1,Preface: I am including this review on all three of the holders I have purchased since Jan 2021.I was super excited about this product when I first saw it; I am no longer.It's a great idea however the material construction WILL NOT hold up to too much movement. Due to the necessary placement on the head board each morning I have to "push up" the holder to get out of bed and at night I have to "pull down" once in bed to attach my phone and adjust the viewing angle. This is mostly because I listen to podcasts to fall asleep or if they become to much of a distraction a white noise app. But I also need to be able to hit the snooze button at least once in the morning. Bad idea I know.The first one I purchased lasted several months from Jan 31 2021 to the middle of September. The second one only lasted 3 months crapping out on me in early December 2021. The third purchased shortly thereafter I was super careful and gentle with since the first two broke in the exact same spot. Kid gloves seemed to extend the life of the arm but eventually it also gave out. After it snapped a few nights ago falling and slamming my phone into my face a few choice words some duct tape and several pairs of chop sticks I have MacGyvered it to hold temporarily while I figure out a more permanent solution.I'm sure this would be great product if you never EVER had to move it.
3,I had the previous version model of this item. I liked it better because this one makes a lot of “creaking” noises when I move it and it doesn’t seem as stable. It shakes more than I recall the previous model shaking.
5,I really like this item. I can now set my device up and be hands free. With this tool I can now work on multiple projects at once.My only complaint is that it isn't long enough. I say this knowing it's the longest one I could find on the web.
5,It’s very flexible to move around so you can watch at whatever angle is comfortable for you. The clamp is sturdy and keeps my phone in place even when I have to readjust the neck. Also the twist clamp is wide enough to fit and secure on my headboard. It’s versatile enough you can adjust and  secure the twist clamp on other headboards and things that vary in width. I’m happy with this purchase.
5,I've been seeing variations of this product on Amazon for a couple of years and I must admit the concept has had my curiosity peaked. However because of less than stellar reviews I've been hesitant to make a purchase. I finally took the plunge on this most recent updated version from Lamicall and I couldn't be more satisfied. Many of the reviewers' complaints of other models have been "to short" or "product broke." Based on it's cost this product has proven to be equitable for me. I've used it daily over this past month in many different positions moving it from the kitchen living room recliner to the bedroom and it's performed perfectly. Yes it's made of plastic - except for the adjustable tubing - but in using common sense you should realize to make major setup adjustments before anchoring it to something fixed. It will take some patience and strength to properly adjust the tubular arm to each particular application and it can be removed and stored in seconds when you're entertaining. I've made the decision to buy a second one just so I don't have to keep moving it from room to room and readjusting. This particular model has proven to me that even though it's primarily made of plastic with reasonable care and expectations it will last well throughout it's cost/benefit period for me before it needs replacing.
3,I bought one 2 months ago and absolutely loved it. Used it everyday but unfortunately it snapped at the base making it unusable.
5,I bought this for multiple reasons but right now I'm using it to attach to my kitchen table and help with my art projects. I plan to use it to attach to the bed and where ever else I might find it useful. This product is very well made and sturdy. It's a little hard to bend but once you get it where you need it you'll be thankful for it as that's what helps with keeping it sturdy. I'm very impressed and would consider buying again just so I can have two.
5,very easy to used.
4,This product has a Much better grip at the anchor than I expected. I secured it to my 3 inch thick wooden headboard. It doesn't leave any marks at all. Very well engineered pads that are dense yet grip well. There is some bounce to the phone when the arm is at a maximum extension IF I cause a bump or movement to my bed. However it is easily calmed with a gentle touch to the phone grip. Be careful of phone placement or you may get a "factory reset" request from your phone (mine is a Galaxy 8). The grip pushed the buttons responsible for the issue that I didnt know about. Easily remedied by moving my phone one inch to the side. Not an issue for the grip at all. It holds well even with the phone 75% to one side.  I would like to see different grip adapters available for my tablet. I am comfident the arm could support the weight easily. Overall I would buy this again and have recommended it to 3 people already.
5,I don't have a secondary photo device so this is a "take my word for it" review.This works great on my bed to keep my phone in a position where I can watch shows listen to music apps or read a book with no issues at all. And the gooseneck is malleable yet strong to retain shapes and go back to original positions easily. Also overall resistance is soft so when I need to get out of bed quickly I can push the entire arm away easily and return without hassle.The jaw that holds the phone is plenty large with perfect tension to keep my phone from falling out or on my face (y'all KNOW what I'm talking about ;p)Finally the mounting clamp needs to align the gooseneck at a 90-degree angle vertically upwards/downwards. So don't mount this somewhere that the base clamp starts the neck horizontal. the neck is flexible but it doesn't do well when making "U" turns.
4,works well replaced another one from another manufacturer.  This one is nice but if you interact with your phone the entire unit will sway/wobble
5,Very sturdy yet flexible. I love love love it. It fits my Iphone 12 Pro with no issues at all. The stem is long enough to do whatever I need and to move it out of the say as well. It's awesome I would buy another one.***UPDATE***It was awesome until it was not. I’ve had this for 7 months and it’s failed. The neck has snapped from the base and now just flops and won’t hold up at all. It’s useless. So disappointed because it’s become a desktop necessity. Will look for a different brand and keep trying to see if I can get one that lasts at least a year with mild desktop and bedside use. The neck has completely come out of the cover.I would recommended getting this for only light use in one location without to much movement.**UPDATE***Company sent a replacement very quickly. The customer service was excellent and had no issues. I now have 3 of them in the house because they are so useful.
5,I like the sturdyness
5,Sturdy but precious version got broken after 2 years. Let’s see how long it can last
5,If anyone is on the fence about getting one of these then go for it.  I was skeptical on how useful and easy it would be.  I  find I use it more and more when sitting in my favorite chair doing some reading or watching my phone like a big TV screen when going to bed.Concerning a comment I read earlier about it being to hard to bend to manipulate shape I wholeheartedly disagree.  To me it has just the amount of rigidness to keep it in a temporary position while also supporting the weight of the phone without to many shakes. I actually own one of the larger size phones with a heavy duty case.  Anything less then this rigidness would probably cause my phone to slowly move out of position.  The clamp portion that holds the phone is great too.  This little swivel ball mount like clamp is so versatile you don't need to spend a lot of time getting the stiffer rod in place.
5,It’s a great buy
3,This thing works the way it’s supposed to.  It’s plenty long enough.  The only problem and kinda keeps me from using this more often is that the neck of this is so stiff.  It’s not easily adjustable.  I generally need to use both hands to adjust the shape or angle I need. It’s annoying really.  But overall I would still say it’s worth the money.
5,This product is great! I am able to hook my phone on to it and I am able to have a hands free device. All my internet is only on my phone so holding it is a huge problem. No more problem!
5,In my opinion the best phone holder on the market. I have tried several.
5,Like the sturdiness and the way it attaches to smaller round part of bed rail. White color blends nicely with rail. Great for video calls. Listening to music calls using speaker. The bottom part provides a good kind of anchor and the upper part is flexible and swivels.  Excellent product.
5,Super sturdy and and convenient to help create content
5,I wanted something to mount to my gaming desk and table to have my phone mounted and elevated.  Along with being able to move it in anyway I need.  This works perfectly.I recommend!
5,I used this very little and it broke at the base. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  Update The seller contacted me and offered to make it right. This seller stands by their product and you can't ask for more than that. BTW I loved this thing and it's very easy to mount and holds your phone securely
5,I bought this item to use for some virtual music lessons. I clamp it to my music shelving unit when I have those lessons and remove it with ease for in-person lessons. I don’t need to adjust the arm much as the part that holds the phone can swivel easily. However I’d be wary to adjust the arm a lot as I feel like it would lose its stability over time. For my uses it works great!
4,It’s not bad I bought it to do videos and need something to hold my phone and it’s really stiff but it will keep your phone in place but when you try to turn it any direction it feels like I’m going to break it lol but not bad for the price.  P.S. Whoever boxed this did a good job cause I turned it all types of ways trying to put it back in the box lol.
5,This product is not only sturdy but it is flexible rugged and incredibly versatile. It allows you to attach to all different depths or thicknesses. This product is excellent !!!
5,Easy to install. Easy to move around but also sturdy. Gentle but secure. I like how easy it is to open the mouth for phone insert but it’s secure enough to keep it in its place. Yes!!
4,The thing I like about this is that I can put it almost anywhere and its flexible long and height/position can be adjusted. Also it got a strong grip and can fit almost any modern cell phone I would say. There are just 2 things that just bother me a bit.1. It's that it shakes a lot so it's a bit unstable if you are frequently touching the screen. It's ideal to watch something for hours but not for games.2. The grip make it a bit hard to be able to touch the edges of the screen. (top/bottom)But in General it's nice and good for the price.
5,This product is very versatile and functional.  It bends every direction you might want and seems to stay secure even when you twist it around.  Overall I do like it but I'm using it mostly in my bedroom to use my phone at night and I have to say even thought it quite functional its not terribly attractive clamped to my night stand.  It just looks kinda ugly if your going for a nicer look in your bedroom.  The only other thing is my night stand doesn't have hardly any lip to clamp it to so I had to open the drawer of the stand and clamp it to the inside of of the the drawer and the top of the stand.  Now the drawer has to always be open about 3 or 4 inches to allow for the clamp device.  Its kinda big and clunky.  Still deciding if the look is more important or the function.
5,My sister had a stroke and cannot use the left side now she can FaceTime people without holding her phone. and I find that very awesome.
5,Works perfect for our purpose. I can’t sleep with tv on and hubby can’t sleep without it. Now he can put his phone in the holder and watch it with his headphones
5,It's just ok.
5,Just received this and so far am loving it! The neck is nice and stiff but not so stiff that you can't move it which is great so your phone doesn't slowly sag down and ruin an otherwise perfect video. This is absolutely FANTASTIC for recording piano videos! This was my intended use but now that I have it I can imagine a whole ton of uses for it: Photography videography long-exposure photos time-lapse videos watching videos without having to hold the device reading sheet music or music lesson videos as you play your instrument... the list goes on and on. I'm extremely satisfied with this and can't wait to put it to use! I especially like that the ball socket joint that your device rests on makes it extremely easy for minor adjustments without having to twist and bend the entire gooseneck. The clamp has soft rubber so it doesn't damage your phone too. Honestly this is one of the best things I've purchased on Amazon! Thanks to the creators for making such a great product!!
5,I have a desk next to my bed that I use to latch the phone holder. It makes for a great way to fall asleep to an episode of my favorite show. Just remember to have auto-play off. :)
4,This is a good upgrade from the prior model (which I also have) as this one has a better casing around the bendy arm and the arm is longer. Just like its older counterpart it is not very stable. If you bump it or bump whatever it is clamped to it will shake for awhile. If you're videochatting or otherwise just need your phone held so you can use it that way it's not a big deal but if you're trying to use it as a sort of tripod it's imperative you wait til it is stable and done shaking before you record and be sure not to nudge it.Very useful for what it is and good value for the price. I'm able to use it for video calls and to hold phones to record performances as long as it doesn't get jostled.
4,Bought to play my switch and watch videos on my phone in bed. Works fine be careful not to over tighten.
4,I bought this for my daughter and she had it on her bead head. She mainly used it so that she could watch movies hands free. She used it every night and eventually after 3 month of bending and twisting the wire inside snapped in half.
4,I had a different phone stand that broke so I decided to switch up the style and settled on this one. This product is limited in where you can place it and in its transportability. I can’t just pick it up from the table and put it on the couch (like I was able to with my other holder). I have to unscrew the bottom part each time I want to move it-which I do. It’s sturdy though so that’s nice. If you want to keep this holder in one spot where you can clamp it onto something it’s probably a good option for you. If you want something mobile to easily bring with you as you move I recommend you look at a different product. But if you can have multiple options I would definitely add this product to the collection.
5,Perfect on my phone and super flexible to reach hights or the perfect angle.
3,It bends a lot more easily than previous items like this. Clamps firmly and will definitely hold a phone with a pop socket on the back. My Samsung Galaxy held fine. Only issue is the arm bounces and shakes a little if you touch the screen. Bit of an issue if you're on a Zoom call or FaceTiming with someone. Solid 3 stars.
5,No threaded adapter.
5,Awesome!(examples of uses & features’ benefits below)✅Super easy to use and fast adjustment!✅Extremely sturdy/well built...feels substantial and will hold even after heavy use and bending in many different ways!〰️ I bought 3 of these for the hubs and my step kiddos for Christmas and will be buying one for myself (maybe a couple of them...lol). 〰️✅We are finding WAY more uses for this than I expected.✅ Great for when working in the garage✅ Both kiddos have theirs clamped on their beds so they don’t have to strain their little necks while they are glued to their phones...all day...everyday 🤳🤦‍♀️🧘‍♀️.✅ I’ve also used them in the kitchen for looking at recipes and watching shows while doing the dishes✅They clamp on pretty well too.  It doesn’t matter if it is a metal or slick surface or an upholstered surface either this thing isn’t slipping or going anywhere.
2,I'm on my second one of these. And while it's working it does work. However both have broken within the first 4-5 months. If this is something you are going to be moving around a lot. I would look somewhere else.
4,Super cool
3,This is very hard to bend and I'm not weak. It also only clamps on to things that have a sturdy underbase otherwise it flops off. Also whe touching the screen it moves which gives a bit of motion sickness. I'm on the fence about returning this.
3,I wanted to love this item. I owned 2 now and they both failed at the same point. Weak materials give up after a month or so. I'll be looking for an alternative product.*UPDATE*Lamicall support reached out to me noting that I may have received a defunct product. Not only did they refund my purchase but also offered a free replacement. Which I have received and am using now. I have bought many products using Amazon and so few are willing to make things right for a poor service or product. Lamicall seems to really stand behind their product and reached out to make things right. And on top of that! Never once asked for me to change my review or leave a review. For that I am revising my review. 5 star service from Lamicall on this one. Revision reflects company service.*Final update*While lasting a little longer the replacement just failed today in the exact same way as all of them. Unfortunately I can't recommend this product for long lasting use. However  if you don't mind replacing every few months give it a try.
3,It was good while it lasted. But after about 3 months of normal use it is now unusable.  The gooseneck attachment to the clamp broke so it is just flopping to the side. Disappointed with the lack of longevity.
5,As a children's piano teacher it's taken me a while to find the perfect setup for virtual teaching. This stand for my phone is the best solution. The clamp is wide enough to fit on the left side of the piano's music stand and the sturdy gooseneck can be pre-adjusted to sit at a comfortable angle in front of me so I can switch views between my face and the music. A second stand on the right gives a perfect view of my hands so I can demonstrate technique and it only takes a moment to shift my phone from one stand to the other (they stay sturdily in place so I don't waste precious time adjusting the view). This setup is superior to a far-away computer camera--I've found that children need to see my face up close the way they would in in-person lessons. I'm so happy with this solution. I highly recommend it!
5,Working remote made this a must have! I mounted it to my desk and it was perfect for about 6 months.  The only issue I am having is the holder is not as steady as it was and I find myself having to stabilize the phone with a pen holder.  To better describe this:  the pole is sturdy. The holder clamps the iPhone perfectly but the holder is no longer keeping the phone upright. My phone sags and this would be great if im sitting on the floor but Im not. Maybe I need to tighten a screw. I will check that soon.
3,This is a very great product for the price my only real negative feedback would be that it is still wobbly once your phone is clipped in and takes a second for it to stop shaking.
5,Fantastic product! I was so tired of having to find a place to set my phone to watch anything while I was busy doing things. This has been a game changer! It holds the phone perfectly and can move in almost any direction or form you desire. Definitely recommend.
5,I bought ten of these as gifts and everyone loved them.  I don't even have one for myself.
5,A sturdy phone holder. It holds my phone steadily without swaying. Easy to set up and use
3,This is a very sturdy well built product it's just not quite long enough to attach to my headboard and not be right in my face. It's just too close by the time you bend it around and clip it onto the phone. Unfortunately I will be returning.
4,Sturdy. However it is safest in landscape mode. Have not figured to make sure it holds in portrait mode. Rubber sheet?
3,I have had two of these break this one is the newer version I like How it’s a 360° pivot.I’m not a fan of the new texture they used on the gooseneck it just looks weird and I feel like the previous ones looked cleaner and felt more durable.
5,Works exactly as described.
5,I bought this to watch tiktok lives and it’s really nice lying in bed and tuning in to my favorite creators do their thing! I like how I can move the neck of it to any position I desire and it stays put!!! Nice grips on the bottom to hold it in place as well
5,I loved this so much! Then it snapped at the base on the inside so I can’t repair it. Now it won’t stand up anymore. Maybe I’ll contact customer service to see if there’s a warranty? 🤷🏼‍♀️
5,...like a charm.
5,This cell phone holder worked great for my project.  I wanted to attach a laser beam for straight line sewing and embroidery design placement to my sewing machine.  As my sewing machine vibrates a bit when sewing I could not attach a laser light to the machine housing.  To solve this issue I was able to easily clamp the phone holder onto the edge of my sewing desk behind my sewing machine extend the long flexible arm over my machine then tilt the laser beam directly above the sewing bed to create the laser line I need.  No wobbling arm holds securely/firmly tilts anyway I need it to.  PERFECT!
4,The whole reason for getting this was because it was one of the longest one I found but after I received it and measured it it was off by 3 and some change inches short.After reaching out to customer servicethey refunded me my money.Other than the length not being what is stated it is very sturdy and a nice phone holder.
5,My husband is handicapped.. the phone holder attached perfectly to his bedside rolling tray for easy access.  This is actually our second oneFirst one lasted a year plus with daily use.Great product…
5,When scrolling use one finger to hold still and the other to move screen.
5,My hands are thanking me for getting this device.  Easy to use better to install.  Regret not buying it before it holds the phone well. The best part is that you could rotate the phone in a portrait or landscape position. Will buy it again highly recommend it.
5,It was definitely better than I expected except I wish they offered one that was 48 inches long also
5,I've had many holders and this will be my last even if I life to be 100.  I really love it.  Ed
5,It's sturdy good-looking and high quality. I'm glad I purchased it it's perfect for streaming TV in bed on a phone. I've used it for 5 months before writing this review. I was skeptical before I bought it but it's great.
5,Lo que mas me gusta es que ahora mis manos no se me cansan puedo trabajar con el celuar sin la necesidad de tenerlo en mis manos este articulo es como un ayudante para mi
3,Well–constructedMajor bends can take a bit of effort until you get the hang of it but its stitched faux leather covering makes it much easier to grip than bare plasticThe phone clamp’s strong but easy to use. The rubber "I" strip stretching between those jaws instead of just padding them to keep phone scratch-free is a clever touch that also keeps devices (especially bigger ones) held with extra securityPadded fixed clamp on other end is comfortable to tighten stays put doesn’t mar surfacesCON:  It does grip the phone well but it takes too long for it to hold it steady which makes it unusable for me for filming.Depending on use some people won’t mind but EVERY minor re-adjustment of phone’s camera angle though easy causes a slight tremble for up to 10 seconds which is too bad. Now I have to return it and get a different style I just wish I had known about that point before I ordered it.
5,I love this cell phone holder. It is really easy to attach to bed side tables and many other things.  It is versatile sturdy has a great grip and is easy to maneuver. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Would buy again. Highly recommend. Would love to test future products.
2,This new version has the ball around the holder the problem is there's no way to loosen it or tighten it and over time I imagine it will get quite loose!Also the metal arm tends to snap at the base over time.  This just isn't made to last.
5,My hand gets tired holding my iPhone 12 Plus while reclining the Lamicall gooseneck phone holder grips my big phone and holds it in place.  Great for weaklings like me.
5,This holder is easy to use without reading instructions.  It can hold cell phone horizontal or vertical.Delivery was quick. Ordered a second one for partner to hang on bedpost.
4,Haven't had this long enough to be completely confident in its quality but so far so good.  I've mounted it on the edge of a bookshelf over my desk (mounting is VERY simple) and adjusted the arm/phone holder.  have tried it out on one call and it seems to do the job.  I purchased it so I would not have to hold my phone while on Zoom calls; I find the neck to be flexible but VERY stiff; a little difficult to maneuver it w/ great precision but at least so far it seems to do what it advertised.
5,I luv luv luv it
4,It is sturdy. But I'd recommend you purchase mount that supports both iPad & iPhone for better versatility.
4,Arrived quickly and is very handy to use. It tends to giggle if it is clamped to the table you are working on and trying to get a video so clamp it to something that won’t be disturbed while filming. I really like how easy it is to take too our phone in and out of it
5,It works well it’s kind of hard to bend but it stays in place so maybe if it was easy to bend it wouldn’t stay in place
2,I bought this in January at the start of the year. It was a great product as it stayed well connected to my bed post easy to manipulate and maneuver. I like to watch movies shows or youtube on my phone before I go to sleep (I know bad habit. Sue me) and it worked great as I used this daily. So at the end of the night I would move this arm out of the way so that when I wake up I'm not smacking my head into the phone. Well after 2 months the arm snapped where the arm met the locking mechanism. I guess daily use of the arm cause ware to the point the arm snapped. I don't have a pic as I threw it away same day it broke and just noticed that amazon asked for a review in my email. TLDR: great if you are not moving the arm daily.
5,The stand is very stiff stays in place and holds my phone well.
5,I have two of them hooked to my headboard. My hands are arthritic and they are a God send to me.
5,This made my social media content so much easier to film/photograph! It really let me up my game and get more creative.
5,When my family video chats with my mom  the cnas just put her phone on the stand  set it up and can walk away while my mom visits.  It's wonderful and easily and safely adheres to her table tray
5,it saves me from having to hold my phone while on conference calls or other video chats with friends or family but also want to multi-task or take notes. i no longer have to put my phone down. product was easy to install on my desk or even on my kitchen counter while i'm cooking and want to talk with someone or follow along with a recipe.
2,It worked great at first but after a handful of uses it began to have problems adjusting. It eventually snapped. Not worth the money in my opinion.
5,This product truly makes life much more easier
4,Honestly great product but the part that holds the just broke on me one night despite me never putting extra weight besides my phone.
5,Overall this is a sturdy design.  The clams are strong.  It holds well to a table and the cell phone is secure in the clamp.  The flexible arm holds a shape pretty well but not firmly.  The slightest nudge will make the arm wobble--a lot.  I was hoping to use this to take pictures but it moves too easily.  Also it can start moving if your bed or table shakes and takes awhile to stabilize.  If you're reading it can be a bit frustrating.I still gave it 5 stars for what it is but buyers should know this isn't the best option for taking pictures.
5,Very easy to use  can attach almost anywhere.  I've clamped it to shelves fences trees countertop the edge of my truck bed etc.  Allows me to put my phone camera almost anywhere any height without a tripod.  Can also use it as a selfy stick (without controls of course.)  It is bouncer than a tripod as expected but that's easy to deal with.
4,Good but shakes a little if you touch your phone while it's being held
5,I’m buying 2 more just to have one at home and one at the office and one for a friend. It’s awesome!
5,As others have said it is very stiff to bend particularly at an axuteacute angle but otherwise performs well.
2,I was hoping this would last more than a couple years because of all the high ratings and reviews of this product but unfortunately it snapped. I only readjusted the position of the gooseneck maybe 1-2 times a month and it still broke.
5,I have tried many of these. In a short amount of time they have all ended up in the trash can. This one is very strong. I have found it is important to not bend it from the holder.This holder has allowed me to take pretty fun pictures while utilizing time delay on my phone!! It also can hold my USB webcam in different areas when I am using an extension cable.
5,This one has an updated holder and seems better it’s the third one I’ve purchased.  I can’t live without it anymore lol.  I have to have this next to the bed !
5,Like it so much bought a second 1
2,Purchased back in April of 2022 was working perfectly until today where the phone holder just broke and I pretty much use this everyday. If you are to get one make sure you get the protection plan.
5,It was a great buy  would recommend it to everyone
5,Versatile usability
5,Works well. Hard to position but stays in place.
2,It's stiff and stubborn like an unyielding donkey. That long neck can't be maneuvered with ease at all. Also the phone holder clip doesn't rotate enough it has a very limited rotation circle.
5,This is so amazing my husband asked me to order one for him!Easy to use...sturdy...excellent I highly recommend.
4,It’s sturdy and won’t wobble. I knew in advance from reviews it was pretty stiff so it’s ok
5,This device allows a user to secure their phone to a table edge securely without tools.  It easily grips and holds wide phones like my Samsung Note 9 which I maintain in a Otter Box Defender case. The flexible rod is very stiff and takes some muscle to adjust to the position you desire but it stays in place.
5,It holds your phone securely and will attach to just about anything. It bends and adjusts well to so you can easily view and use your phone. Perfect for long video calls for using your phone to film or to watch videos. Not super mobile as it takes time to set up and take down but I guess if you hold it you could sort of use it like a selfie stick sort of thing if needed.
5,I’ve been looking for something that  I was able to use during my video conferences for work and/or video chats with friends that would hold my phone in the location and angle that I chose; not from below on a mount or in my hand. This is super adjustable and the clamp is sturdy and the best part is is that you can adjust the clamp as it is not a one size fits all. I definitely recommend if you are contemplating!
5,Excellent product. My daughter loves it for holding her phone while she's talking with friends and doing other things.
4,I bought this device to hold my phone while demonstrating crafts in my studio. I clamped it on a shelf over the work surface. While it is a very secure holder both at the clamp end and the phone end the gooseneck part is very stiff making it hard to change its position. Once it is adjusted to one position it does hold it however.
5,It's very sturdy I use it all the time. Highly  recommend it
3,Not very sturdy. The holder part kept pressing the buttons on my phone. Wasn’t awful but I’m sure there’s better on the market
5,Strong clamp can accommodate any size phone. I attached to my headboard. I can move to ant position. Product is better than I expected. Thank You!
5,Never used this type of product before but after the past two days I'm pleased enough to write a rare review.  Better than I expected very sturdy holds my phone securely and I like the leather covering the gooseneck arm.  Not cheap or tacky looking.  One of my favorite "non-essential" purchases.
5,Bought another one from a different manufacturer that didn't have the swivel head so I'd need to adjust the whole thing. Lasted about 3 months bending the metal but this product with the swivel allows me to move just the swivel head putting less wear and tear on the metal rod.Recommend!
5,This thing is sweet. Had a smaller cheaper one before. The crap plastic clamp was compromised before too long. Great price point and very hardy. I really appreciate the quality. This thing feels like it will last a lot longer.I use it to copy notes from phone to computer. Same eye level as monitor which my neck is grateful for. I also use it to sometimes shoot small videos while drumming. Really allows a lot of creative opportunity. Amazing how handy it is!
4,I recently broke my left arm and I needed lots of help but being on my own really sucks . I purchased this phone holder and other than trying to get the phone in the clamp with one hand I was very impressed. Sturdy maneuverable and easily able to adjust without it falling out of place . Great buy I’m happy with my new left arm .
5,This is PERFECT for bedtime reading on my cell phone late into the night! And no more cricking my neck keeping my hands raised over my head finding a comfortable position on my side and holding the phone awkwardly or hurting my shoulder while propped up on one arm. This was an answer to prayer!This item is super sturdy the clamp is TIGHT so there's no slippage while you adjust the long neck the clamp is also very sturdy and not hard to open and close on your phone. I'm super happy with this and will totally gift one to anyone I think needs one! Excellent!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It works !
5,This Lamicall Gooseneck cell phone holder is exactly what I needed when my oy tv got hit by a lightning strike. I used it for about 3 days to watch TV with Gooseneck attached to bed. It held the phone about a foot from my face and the picture was Great. Now I'm using it on my computer desk to show information. Very sturdy and holds phone securely.
4,Nicely made and easy to clip onto my nightstand with a durable flexible arm.  My only negative feedback is that I have to adjust the placement of my phone so that I still have access to the volume buttons but that’s likely due to the iPhone 7 being smaller.  There are indents within the clamp to hold different size phones so that issue may not be a problem for larger phones.
4,Works as intended but gets a little shaky when the neck gets extended lol
5,Bought this to replace another one I accidentally left behind at a family members house. This one is much sturdier and stiffer. The old one did the job but this definitely higher quality and doesn't wobble as much as the old one did. Because it is a stiffer neck it's a little more effort to position the neck just how you want it. But overall it's still extremely easy to position and will fit any phone. Not big enough to fit a tablet but definitely any phone.
4,I love it bit its a little shaky.
5,Best buy in a long time! I use my phone for everything and this stand couldn't be better. It can clamp easily onto almost anything withoht leaving any damage behind and you can float your phone about anywhere.UPDATE: Several months later and I still use this every day. I keep it clamped to my bedside table and use it to watch videos in bed. Still works just as great as the day it arrives.
1,I am incredibly disappointed. I LOVED this thing. For the past 6 months I've used it nearly every night to hold my phone by my bedside so I can stream a movie on my phone before going to bed. It appears to have a very sturdy construction and for a long time I truly thought this was going to be an item I'd have for years. Well I just past the six-month mark it and broke. Look at the picture. The section that comes out of the base has weakened to the point that it's about to snap. This seemed to happen without warning. I was just about to use it now and I put my phone in it and it just flopped right over. I paid almost $20 for this and now the price is even higher and you don't even get a few years out of it before it gives out?? That's ridiculous. If it were $5 I could see it giving out after this long but not for what they're asking for. Go elsewhere for this kind of product.
2,I liked the versatility of this phone holder. The neck did not droop and the clamp that held onto my desk was strong and didn't fall or fail. However the phone clamp failed after 9 months of daily use. I watched movies texted and took calls on this item. It was great until it broke. Didn't even last 1 year.
4,If you attach this to the table you're working on you will see it vibrate a lot. If you're looking for stability I recommend attaching it to something other than your workspace. Also I wish the head articulated a little bit more but that's a small complaint compared to the shakiness. That said it's a very durable and heavy duty stand. I still use it often.
3,I purchased another arm from Lamicall before and that had the same issue as I just experienced with this one. The joint between the mounting clamp and the bending arm is weak and failed. Now the arm droops down too much and doesn't stay where I want it to. This occurred with normal use and I guess is a flaw with their designs in general since this happened on two different models. I contacted Lamicall's support. I hope I hear back.
5,I purchased this item to attach my phone to while I do live videos for my home business.  It works great and does just what I need for it to do!  There’s a rubbery piece that helps grasp your phone so that it won’t slip out of the holder but one side of it keeps coming off for some reason.  But I just keep putting it back on abs keep going!
5,Easy to attach and adjust. This thing is an arm and neck saver.
5,holds my phone and is easy to adjust good for video pictures or facetime for a hands free experience. Good purchase
5,This was my second purchase of this phone holder.  I've had mine for about a year and liked it so much I got one for my mother.  I use it for my Zoom meetings.  It's nice to be hands free.  She was about to be in a Zoom call at the holiday for the first time and I wanted her to have a good experience.  She loves it as much as I do.  Easy to use.  The clamp still holds the phone firmly after a year of regular use.
4,This is overall a good option for the price. It’s sturdy as long as you don’t bump it. It’s very hard to move and get into position. My husband has to move it for me but maybe that’ll get better with time. I don’t love the limitations of the top. It needs a better rotation. But depending on your needs it’s a good little product for the price.
4,Does what it claims. Very thick to the point where it is difficult to bend. I use my leg to help bend into S shape. I wouldn’t recommend bending while it is clamped down bc it feels like it could break off at the base so I always bend into shape before I clamp it down.  Since it’s so stiff ball socket is nice feature.
5,This newer version is amazing! So much stronger and sturdier! I finally broke my last one cause I used it so much (literally everyday). I have it attached to my head board so I can watch stuff on my phone or play games before bed (bad habit I know) but I don’t have to worry about dropping my phone on my face when I fall asleep or losing it. It’s amazing! I even use it in the shower/bath to read/watch/play/listen whatever. The upgraded version is 1000% worth it!
5,I used the Lamicall Gooseneck to hold my phone while I'm teaching my online cooking courses. It gives students the perfect birds eye view of what I'm doing. It is easily adjustable however use both hands to manuevre it how you want. However when I turned it vertical with my phone in the clip my phone slipped out. Fortunately it was not above a hardwood floor because of the risk of cracking my phone. I don't see how to keep it from slipping out in this mode.
5,My husband loves this! He bought some cheap-o one from the store which I have now inherited even though I didn't even want one now I'm totally jealous of his. The one I have can't even hold up my phone and is really hard to pry open to get the phone in. This one is easy to move easy to get the phone in the claw-like grasp and stays in place regardless of the phone's weight. Now I'm thinking of getting one of these. ;)
5,This product works exactly as promised.  Perfect for creating videos when you need the phone camera to point straight down on your workspace.  Easy to manipulate but strong enough to stay put when you have your phone in the grip.
5,This item was perfect for my spouse  who has a hard time grabbing and holding her phone in bed. Perfect length and flexibility.
5,I ordered this because I wanted a stand for my Nintendo Switch that would hold it from top to bottom allowing me to leave the Joy-Cons connected. Most stands either are too small to hold it that way (designed for smaller phones) or too large to hold it that way but not large enough to fit it from side-to-side with the Joy-Cons attached (designed for tablets but only allowing for clamping around the narrower dimension of the tablet). This does the trick! It will also easily hold my phone.
5,Very easy to install and has been very stable so far. Even has room to account for the popsocket on my phone.
5,I absolutely love this gooseneck iPhone holder. It is very strong yet easy to manipulate. Stays where I set it. Clamp is perfect for my iPhone 12
5,Used couple of times never removed from my desk just noticed a big crack is expanding. I feel sad now. My return window just closed don’t know if I will loose the holder soon :(Update: Happy news for me Seller is sending me the replacement 😍😍😍😍😍Thank you so much. For the level of customer service they provide I give 5 stars.
3,I was physically unable to manipulate the coils on this item to easily change the positioning. The seller contacted me and was extremely helpful in steering me to another model of theirs which worked great! I would say this is an A+ seller who one can purchase from without fear. Also I need to start working out.
5,The gooseneck is very ridged which is a good thing since it holds its position without sagging even after hours holding the phone at an odd angle.Also the sturdy design means no shakes. The bracket that attaches to the desk is also highly adjustable and very well built.The length of the neck is more than sufficient and in fact is generous making it easy to extend over a large monitor (or in my case a 27" iMac) and position exactly as desired.Superb product!
5,Perfect!
5,Bought this as a gift for my niece who is in college.  She used it right away and loved it!
5,Bought this for a Christmas gift.  Another family member has one and the person this is for was really liking it!
5,Hooks to my wrought iron bed headboard to watch on my phone at nights. Solid build and holds its shape perfectly.
5,I use this in my home studio and it's awesome. I'm thinking of buying more for when I have guests and other artists over because I don't let anyone use mine 😂😂
5,Been using this every day for over two weeks and it has been clamped and unclamped from room to room. The gooseneck has been twisted in many directions and is holding up very well. At this time the product seems to be well made. I am thinking about purchasing another one for someone else. I do see that there are other gooseneck phone holders that cost less but I am actually worried that they won't be as sturdy as this one since I haven't had any issues yet.
5,Good quality and good length on the mount. It feels strong and stays in place. The price was a little higher than similar products though that is likely due to the slightly longer arm than comparable items have.
5,Love using this to watch TV on my phone while laying in bed.  The clip is very strong and stays in place even when bending the neck in the right position. Works perfectly!
3,It started out as one of the greats until three months in. By month four it refused to stay adjusted. Now I have to physically hold it in place if I wish to use it. That's a total bummer considering it's entire existence is to hold your phone for you. Money wasted.
4,It’s very durable unless you bump it or the surface that it’s on. Then it jiggles.
5,I had bought two of these and it works great with any phone I put on. It's built really well and remains in any position I set it at.As for the second one I purchased (picture included) I ended up using it as a microphone stand for my PC. even when it really isn't meant to be used for that it just shows that this product can be versatile
4,I’m using this to broadcast demos over zoom of me drawing for a college course. It works brilliantly overall though can sometimes get shaky.Word of warning on an iPhone if you accidentally clamp the power and volume buttons at the same time it will call 911. Learned that the hard way.
5,Mileage may vary depending on the side buttons of your phone
4,It works well but it is a thick heavy device. I had to put some padding in the clamp so it wouldn’t shift around. But it does work. You just need a non-beveled desk edge to attach the base.
4,It was great until the base of the hose part became unstable and it now flops around
4,I ordered 2.  Mainly because my wife keeps losing hers in the bedding!  Put mine by my desk to free up some real estate.  A little shaky but not too bad.  Their suggestion about bending the stem in a Z pattern or something does help.
5,I bought this to view sports and movies on my Iphone while I used my NordicTrack. Mounting the holder to the machine itself resulted in too much movement of the phone whichever shape I turned the neck. I grabbed a chair set it next to the machine clamped the holder to the chair back and easily adjusted my phone for comfortable viewing as I worked out.  Both the neck and the ball joint of the holder remained firm and readjusted with ease.
5,The arm is strong and rather hard to bend which is good. The phone clamp is easy to release. It takes a little bit of time to secure the bottom clamp that supports the unit. I prefer that to my previous device that clamped to a table of cupboard which didn't hold as tight. I read somewhere that it is best to bend the arm of the unit to an S or W shape. Happy with my purchase.
5,I love ❤️ this product.  I had major surgery and was in the hospital for a month.  OK I couldn’t bring it into the operating room 😎 but it worked great in ICU and a regular room.  Now I am home I move it from my bed 🛌 to a table on the patio.  I could have sold a ton of these to all my nurses and doctors!
5,While I usually multi task and have don't have alot of space this is saving my life right now. Helps me even more when it's time for bed and I can place this in the claw and it can hold it over me without falling out and hitting me as I usually would have done it.Excellent product the claw is very study the length could be a LITTLE longer but it's still very good. Also VERY easy to set up.
5,Perfect for his purpose (my husband). Unable to hold the phone for video chat or scroll through social media  but can watch video and speak to the family.  Since he is bed bound the facility staff or family set up and leave the room to give him privacy. He really likes it.
5,Hard to adjust sometimes
3,I like the looks of it and I like the mount but the gooseneck is very stiff and very hard to manipulate. I don’t recommend it
4,Hefty and sturdy low wobble can be repeatedly formed as needed good grip on my iPhone. I’ve had others of this general design and this is the one I would recommend to friends.
5,I brought this phone holder for my husband as a gift because I always caught him holding the phone while watching TV!  He absolutely loves it and I have to admit that I use it also.  Don't hesitate to buy it the length quality and sturdiness is amazing!
5,absolutely love this phone holder. very sturdy and easy to adjust. holds my phone in tight I have an iPhone 10 plus.also obviously works great as a phone holder but I actually love using it to hold my son’s baby monitor at night. It’s much easier to see him when it’s elevated and tipped downward towards me than when it’s on the nightstand at an upward angle that distorts the colors.
5,Purchased for Grandkids (ages 9 11 13 14).  They loved them.
4,It is very sturdy and easy to set up. However I wished that it had a light attached to it too since I use this with my phone to record my painting videos.. I might look for another option or keep using this with a desk lamp.
3,Not long enough. Could be another foot or so
2,I have the first model the clip broke but that was my bad. So I was like hey let’s do the upgraded new one…. well it’s horrible unfortunately will be returning and getting older model it is 100% sturdier!! Ok so if your looking to have your eyes bouncing up and down buy the first model I also hate the swivel thing bc it’s less sturdy idk get the other one and it’s cheap 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
5,Love it. We used it to hold camera in place for video recording in our drum booth. We were able to position the camera and easily flip to the shot when needed. I highly recommend this device for anyone that needs to get a stead picture or video as its flexibility provides endless options!
5,rígido para su costo para podero grabar con gran comodidad
5,This stand is super sturdy and allows for a variety of angles and heights. Great for face-time calls. I’d definitely recommend it!
2,Great product except for cheap plastic that holds phone. Would like the same product with more durable plastic holder.  I used it properly and take pride in what I own. No excuse for not using more durable plastic.  Other than that product great except it now can't hold my phone.  My phone is standard size.
5,Just what I needed works very well.
5,I like it
3,It was great before it decided to snap.  With normal use it looks like the rod snapped after about 6 months.
4,The flexible feature of this item is great and it does what I needed to do. When you touch the phone however it does shake for about 10 seconds before stopping unless you stop it with your hand. Still totally worth it and really like it
5,Very nice...I read A LOT on Kindle on my phone.I started getting pain in my left hand from holding my phone too much. This device has solved that problem I am very happy with it. The clamp at the base of the light adapts to many different shapes it clamps solidly. The arm on the device is flexible yet strong... It stays where you put it yet it is easy to move.
4,I use it for my treadmill. It works well holds the phone but is difficult to get it morphed into how o like it. However if you don’t need to adjust it often it would work great.
5,I really liked this product It was much sturdier than the other gooseneck phone mounts I've used in the past the only downside I did find to it was that it was relatively harder to bend which is an upside because that also means that it's a lot harder to actually damage.
5,Works as described helpful accessory.
5,Attached to headboard and neck long and stiff enough to hold nicely where desired.  Clamp is large enough to hold iPhone plus with Otterbox case.  Works very nicely for what I wanted.  Other's did not.
5,It is very sturdy and attaches tightly to my patio folding tray next to my recliner.  I use it mainly for reading various items on my iPhone. I wouldn’t recommend it for typing much due to wobbling. But great for viewing and reading. It takes a strong hand for adjusting the arm.  You must have solid lip on the thing you attach it too.
4,This phone holder has been a godsend for all the FaceTime I am blessed to have with loved ones far away. Sturdy and thick neck keep arm in place. The arm is easily mobile with the twist lock gripper. Would buy again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Used it for the overhead shots in this video. I'm shocked aaa how much I like it.
4,It's very sturdy and will probably last a long time.  I bought for my 10 year old grandson that's into making YouTube and tiktok videos.  It's really stiff and hard to maneuver. I right the flexibility would be easier.
4,The clamp for the device side is very strong although the rubber grip seems a bit flimsy I haven't had any trouble with it. The anchor side clamp is also very strong and seems versatile for most applications.
4,Due to the sturdiness and durability of this product I believe is worth its price. However versatility...hmm it's not for the weak. You will need some muscle.
5,Love this! Not the most sophisticated looking item but work very well to have phone in right place for Zoom meetings and video calls or watching shows. I don't touch the neck much just the swivel behind the clamp as others have said. And when not in use clamp upside down beneath my desk to be less intrusive. Recommend!
5,Used it for the past week. Entire product seems very well put together honestly. It’s large and seems like it’s worth 60$.Con: and I know this isn’t the worst thing but it is something the phone/arm wobbles constantly when bumped or moved by a breath. So if your watching videos it could be distracting if your fan is blowing toward you! Other than that it’s amazing.
5,I mounted this to my bed's headboard and use it to hold my phone while I'm laying down. It's perfect for watching movies or playing my games with a bluetooth controller. The clip that holds the phone is very sturdy and I don't have to worry about my phone falling out and landing on my face. The cushioned grip protects the phone from scratches. I'm very satisfied with this product.
3,Have a broken wrist so needed something to hold my phone so I could use itWorked great for the first 3 weeks but after that it won't hold it anymore the clamp works but art that goes between the clamps and the phone has diedWish it still worked because my wrist isn't healed yet
5,This holder is so good I bought another one. Frees your hands up. This one is constructed with me in mind. I read a lot on my phone and this holder is perfect
5,You can bend it around in the many different positions so it sits by itself on the counter and attach it to your curtains to your cats air any place you want your phone is going to stay there most of the time
5,I drive a garbage truck for a living and my normal workday is very bumpy. I've used a few different phone holders in the past and most break from all the shaking and bumping. this has held sturdy so far and works great at holding the phone in place while i drive. the suction cup works great too just need to wet it a little bit before i stick it on.
5,I like the simplicity of the phone holder for using the phone for long periods of time when sitting in my sofa or in bed. I bought two of these this year
4,Easy to use. However please hold the base when moving and be care when placing phone into holder. This is my third one but first one with the new generation. I like the use of ease and new materials.
5,I needed a second camera for cooking videos. My tripod and extension arm was too heavy too clunky to move around. Got this. Love it. Three best features: 1. the alligator-mouth clip holds firm but protects phone. 2. the easy to operate clamp that you can screw open or shut using your whole hand 3. the ball swivel joint is essential for getting the angle you want.
3,Bought this to watch NETFLIX or Prime while in bed. I get tires of holding the phone. Window sill isn't quite deep enough to attach so I use the night stand. It's nice but isn't quite long enough. I think it's about 34 inches long but it needs another 12 to 16 inches in length because the arm is so stiff it has a medium size arc to it and it only gives me the ability to watch while laying on one side.
5,I bought Lamicall Gooseneck device holderfor my son who due to illness found it most comfortable to lie in his bed on his back. So he was holding his phone up. I surprised him with this holder and he loves it! It’s very sturdy versatile and is made extremely well. I’m pretty sure this thing is durable and may outlive me! Would buy again!
5,I bought two of these and they have worked wonderfully.  My wife attached hers to her craft table and I attached mine to my work bench.  One recommendation for anyone purchasing when you adjust the mount keep one hand on the rod where it exits the clamp.  It looks like it could crack the clamp mount.  Overall we are more than satisfied.
5,Got this after another brand broke after minimal use in 3 months. This gooseneck is really sturdy and my favorite part is the phone holder part because it rotates. You don’t need to rotate the entire gooseneck to get the orientation that you want. It’s a little difficult to bend but that’s what makes it sturdy. I liked it so much I got a second one.
5,The intended recipient of this item hasn’t seen it yet as it is a Christmas gift. I did get it out of the package and check it out before I wrapped it though and am pretty impressed. It held my phone (which probably isn’t impressive since it’s an iPhone 12 mini) well and attached to my side table firmly and with ease.I’m hoping my son likes it.
5,I use this in my pick up truck for when I need a GPS. I clamp it down on the emergency brake handle so it's not in the way and I can still use the E- brake when necessary. I prefer to use this over a traditional car mount because they are either on the window or dashboard and are in the way.
5,I love this phone holder. It will fit just about any piece of furniture and holds the cell phone tight without it falling out. It will hold the phone vertical or horizontal depending on your preference. I am definitely glad I made this purchase. Makes FaceTime so much easier than holding your phone for long periods or propping it up just to have it slide or fall down.
5,The product is well constructed and sturdy. The adjustable clip mounts easily to a variety of surfaces but does require a lip it can grab from both sides. It can be a little difficult to manipulate the arm into exactly the right place but fine adjustments are easy with the swivel head. The range of motion afforded by the arm is extremely long.
4,Very versatile and holds my phone well.  It could be more sturdy as the smallest bump will make it wobble however the wobble is able to stop reasonably well with a light touch.
4,This product is pretty damn awesome.  Just what I was looking for. The arm for it is super strong could probably hold a 5 pound with the arm.Love it!!!
5,I had surgery on my left hand and found it difficult using my phone comfortably with one hand! This thing is amazing. Solidly build strong and sturdy! I have it attached to a small breakfast table next to the couch...phone is always within reach and stable to use as it is so solidly made. Will use even when hand heals...
4,This thing is almost too stiff. The sturdiness and thickness of the rod is very good and will hold up an iPad  it for a light phone it’s a bit much to move it.
5,I love this product!! I suffer with severe neck pain and constant muscle spasms that never go away. I was looking for something like this that was flexible so I could use it in many situations to avoid additional neck strain and help with my pain. If you have EDS and are looking for a helpful tool this will work.
5,Flexible and so convenient! I usually look at my phone before bed and watch a movie. I was very worried about falling to sleep on top of my phone. WHAT if phone over heated or broke..I set up the phone holder on my bed headboard and no more worries..
5,I like the way this allows hands free use of my phone!
4,Made for beds but the base needs something like a between mattress and head or foot board to mount to it.
4,Strong and easy to use. I will recommend to anyone
5,I love
3,You can not place an iPhone max on a portrait stand. Should be informed of that before purchase
5,This item is AWEsome!! I've only had for a few days but I've put it through a pretty tough gauntlet. It is sturdy and the most versatile of any device I've had prior. Since it has been only a few days I couldn't rate the durability yet but here's hoping it's a 5 star!
5,It’s helpful with zoom group and makeup classes
5,The phone holder has a very long strong gooseneck. The base connection method looks to be well made and may prove to be a longer lasting system than the typical clip-on systems. For the price it seems like a good value.
5,I ordered the Lamicall Gooseneck holder for my phone to make keep my phone in a steady position to make videos for YouTube.  It's easy to set up very well constructed looks good and keeps the camera steady - plus I can easily put the phone in the exact same position if I need to do another take.  Excellent product!
5,I am SO happy I bought this! This thing is brilliant. I use it to film time lapse painting with- it attaches to the legs of my tripod (in the field) or my easel (in the studio) no sagging or slipping. I have a lumee back on an 8plus and it fits and holds sturdy no problem. Couldn’t be happier!
5,It works great for holding my phone and it is very heavy duty. If you are moving at all in your bed your phone will shake a little bit but it’s no big deal all you have to do is touch it to stop shaking. I found it works best if you’re watching TV.
5,The phone holder was very steady. Before my purchase I was a bit concerned about the photo moving or shifting down during the shooting of the video (I used it with the phone faced down on a book laying flat on my desk) but it held up during an entire 10 minutes of shooting at least.
5,I bought this for zoom meetings because it allows perfect adjustment for camera height and positioning while keeping my desk surface free for notes and paperwork.  It works perfectly and is strong enough to hold the weight of my phone even when fully extended.  Great for watching video too.
4,I was looking forward to this item. I’m mostly happy with it. It’s definitely sturdy but the slightest move makes the whole arm shake and it has to be steadied.
5,Fits my phone perfectly (Samsung galaxy s20) with its case on. It's a bit stiff making it somewhat hard to adjust but that stiffness tells me it's not going to sudly give out and send my phone crashing to the ground. Overall it does exactly what it says it does and is a good price.
5,Worked exactly as described and held the phone very securely.  I ended up not liking how my phone was working for the videos and bought a GoPro so no longer needed it.
5,Impressed with the item's quality
5,Es firme para anclarlo a una mesa el cuello es firme y flexible  no se cambia por el peso del celular  y el sistema de agarre es perfecto.
5,Iuse this for surfing the internet watching movies and when my hands are tired from holding the phone.  it is extremely sturdy and flexible to move to any angle. Very easy to clip on any surface you chose.  I clipped it to the headboard of my bed (about 1 inch thick) then twist to tighten.
5,This was a gift for my teenage daughter. She has it attached to her bed and will FaceTime her friends while they play video games. It allows her to see her phone and her friends can see her instead of the ceiling. She can bend it any which way and it stays where she puts it.
5,I use this to hold my phone by my bed and one next to my recliner. It’s great for hands free FaceTime!This is the fourth holder I tried and finally I found one that works. I highly recommend it. Do not hesitate to buy.
3,Was okay over all but wish it would be able to stay on any surface
5,I got it for my husband for his birthday. He likes it.
5,Ver sturdy and versatile! Helps with cooking and watching stuff while eating ..
5,A close friend with an injured neck is able to read without straining. This product is great!
4,It’s ok if you want something simple. Not the best quality but It definitely works for me and I’m glad I made this purchase.
5,We originally purchased this to watch movies in bed without anyone having to hold the phone. We have found that it has been useful all over the house. I’ve used it in the kitchen clipped to the edge of the counter to read recipes or watch how to videos while cooking.
4,Really like the product. Stability is lacking a little when trying to use my phone while mounted but everything else works perfect.
4,This thing is a little bigger than I expected and it tends to wiggle a bit but overall it gets the job done.
4,Versátil
5,Its very sturdy. I love the clip it's not difficult to open to clip your phone. The design of the clip enables me to see and click on the screen when I'm filming something. So far so good. Hope it doesn't break on me.
5,I absolutely love this. I ordered one for my rv and then ordered one for my car . It is the only thing that has worked for me and held my phone which has a heavy case
3,The gooseneck is quite robust which is great if you don't want to adjust it much. But make sure it's attached to something rock solid because any vibration or slight tap on it will have your phone swaying to and fro.
5,This has been such a great investment! I absolutely love the easy on and off twisty thing! It’s sooo much more user friendly than others that I’ve tried. The gooseneck is pretty sturdy too. The only con is that it does shake a little bit but it’s not terrible.
5,The last gooseneck holder I bought was too wide for an iPhone unless I turned it lengthways and then I couldn’t plug in the charger so my phone would die after 2 hrs of ZOOM meetings. This one fits my needs perfectly!
5,I absolutely love this. It makes chatting on zoom videos so much easier as I can look up instead of down and be hands free. Everything is sturdy and the clamp is secure.  Seriously a game changer with the amount of screen time we are forced to do in quarantine!!!
5,N/A
4,Its definitely more sturdy and versatile.
5,This is the best thing that I've ever bought on Amazon
5,This holder is very sturdy and feels well made. The ball joint on the clamp is a nice addition allowing for versatility in positioning options. The goose neck portion is layered in a faux leather material which gives it a nice clean look. Overall a good value for the money.
3,I ordered this product in March- 2 of them. Loved them. One of the biggest reasons I picked this brand was the added length.I just ordered two more in the white/grey. They are clearly 1” shorter than the previously ordered black pair.Disappointed.
1,This review is for two of these that I've purchased in the last year. The first one cracked where the holder attaches to the arm. That kept it from staying in position to hold my iPhone. I chalked it up to one bad apple.Well the barrel seems to only have bad ones. The second started cracking within 3 weeks. (I was extra careful to handle it gently.) I added electrical tape around the plastic components that held the ball and socket intended to keep the holder in place. That did not work. I then put pipe repair clamps on them to hold the plastic together.What a fool I was. The holding arms themselves then cracked when I opened them to put my phone in place.*Cheap plastic* is the issue. In normal use this unit will fail far too soon. It is not worth the money. It would not be worth getting for free. Don't buy it.
5,It’s well made .
5,Got it use with a cell phone when laying on a couch it allows viewing without holding the phone let's you fall asleep without dropping the phone. Make sure you get the latest model the earlier model had a thinner arm which failed the newest model have improvements which eliminate the failure points.
5,Ordered this for my husband who is semi disabled and spends 90% of his time in his recliner chair . Lots of neck and back pain from holding his phone and playing on it all day . Absolutely loves this ! No more pain !
5,I was skeptical when my husband first bought this item but turns out that it’s really handy. We keep it in our kitchen and I use it when following a recipe online. My husband does the same as well as when he’s playing/searching for music on his phone.
4,The gooseneck is hard to bend.
5,It's perfect for using my phone in bed. I don't get a crick in my neck anymore from looking down at my phone. I wish I would have found this sooner. Very sturdy holds my phone so I don't have to. Thanks for a great product!!
5,Easy to relocate to different spots depending on what you’re doing.
5,Purchased to hold a Digital Display Meter  at a workstation. This item is solid and the flex is strong and holds items in place even when vibration is present. Swivel Clamp on the flex arm is a big plus for getting the right angle for viewing. Would Recommend!
5,This works great for taking my painting classes on zoom. My iPad has the general class so I can see the instructor and my classmates work but my phone is over my left shoulder so the instructor can see my painting and watch me work. Love it!
5,100% recomendó!
5,Every recommendation I got when I asked for a projector stand always was over $120. I was iffy on this purchase but pleasantly surprised with this stand! It hold up well. Very sturdy. It doesn't lean with the weight of my projector. Absolutely would recommend.
4,Excelente herramienta puedo relajarme sin necesidad de estar sosteniendo mi celular muy firme y al mismo tiempo puedo trabajar en mi escritorio.
4,Holds phone quite well.  Only issue is that it is so long it shakes when attached to the treadmill.
5,used for holding my phone beside my bed
1,I have bought 6 of these in total because I loved the idea and use. They break within 3 months from pretty light use as I don't move them (I bought one the 3 rooms I use them in) and every single one has done this. Plus buying a second. Save your money and look at a stand that isn't going to snap at the bottom unless you want to weld it.
5,I needed something to hold my phone whether I use my desk in a seated or standing position. This gooseneck lamp is perfect. it’s sturdy doesn’t shake and is flexible enough to move in lots of different positions. Definitely one to look at and purchase!
4,It makes it very enjoyable to watch instructional videos and have my hands free to move right along with the videos!!
4,It is great for hands free viewing of any movie or show on your smartphone. Built well!
5,This was the best purchase I am glad I got this one than others it is very stiff and sturdy. It is not for the weak but o can still move it in any direction and the grip is secure I really like this stand.
5,Very unique tool for a unique job. Stays attached well. I wouldn't use it if it had to be attached to anything that moves tho. It'd be too shaky then. But if it's mounted to something with static works great
5,I just love this thing. Had a different one as a gift not as sturdy.  Replaced it with this one . So handy goes anywhere you want it . Puts the phone right were you want it hands free. Great gift idea.
5,this phone holder is amazing i have it my kitchen and i do my live videos and i use for my granddaughter to watch cocomelon and it holds my phone just right i love it.. order yours now☺️
5,Very durable
4,I bought it to keep the phone in one place while sitting on the couch.  It does the job.
5,I have enjoyed this product being sick with fibromyalgia I can't hold my phone very much because of the pain this helps me to use my phone without having to hold my phone I give it a five-star.
4,Works as advertised so far I have only had it for a couple of days
4,Can be a little wobbly but works well if you coil up the gooseneck
5,Using this for the baby room while our son eats or is getting ready to sleep. Much sturdier than the old one we had and the clamp mechanism to hold the phone is more versatile if you case has any bulk to it.
4,So far so good. Much sturdier than low budget one that can’t hold the phone weight.
5,My brother has MS and have little use of his arms and hands and fingers. This item has been excellent for him to hold his phone and talk on his phone!  This phone holder is a miracle for him and life/changing!!!
4,Good sturdy light for the  cost. Kids like it to hold their phone to watch movies in bed.
5,I really loved how thick sturdy and easy to use this item is. I paint miniatures on stream and I use this to mount my phone as a camera. I love how easy it is to move exactly where I need it to look.
4,Strong flexible holds phone plus it’s case. Phone has fallen out but overall very pleased.
4,Works well! It’s a bit difficult to maneuver but keeps steady once adjusted.
5,Seeing how long this phone holder was I was a little weary at first but then was surpassed at the durability and sturdiness of the entire unit. Given I can use it for many different phone sizes the versatility is fantastic.
4,Product is of high quality. The arm is thick and sturdy enough. The clamp is good.
4,Works great when sitting at my desk and need to use my iPhone for video conference.
4,This is a very versatile mount for your phone.  Does exactly what is described
5,Bending too many times will break it. It last me for several months but I did avoid to bend it too much. It will hold it shape very well. Worked well with my phone and switch.
5,Nice solid grip on the base. I like this style of clamp for the phone side. It leaves my volume buttons accessible. I also like the ball and socket joint on the top end for adjusting the phone screen for the perfect viewing angle.
5,Very excited I am able to clip onto so much. Nice foam feet to grasp my counter and dresser. Stays in place just like I need it too. I'm going to use this to take videos for my social media platforms. Also great help while  breastfeeding.
5,I use it for my class demo
4,The phone holder is a little bit pricey but the quality is excellent.
5,The holder was very easy and convenient to install. Very good quality.
5,I bought one for my husband to video chat while quarantined. Perfect to view videos or video chat while gaming. We liked to do much we bought 2. It’s sturdy and it even holds a Nintendo switch. I definitely recommend it
4,simple and effective....does the job!  Would buy again.
5,Very durable. Works perfect for what we need it for. The part that clamps onto does have to be a big edge. It claps on (adjustable) any size edge. Great product!
5,This is perfect for holding my phone when in bed. I have a daybed so I have something to attach it to. It's a good length sturdy when attached and moves smoothly.
5,I ran into this at my new fire station a colleague had one in the bunk I was using.  I think this thing is great I now own three as my kids keep borrowing them.  Would recommend.
5,My son love it 😍
3,This does not work well if you’re actually texting web searching etc.  WHY ?  Because it bounces all over the place.  You have to use both hands to hold the phone still to perform any task.  If you’re using it only for reading or watching a show then it’s fine.  It just didn’t work for my purpose.
5,Great product I used at the hospital for a week while recovering it help out to keep me distracted and I didn’t have to use my hands.
2,It's heavy and hard to bend or move not long enough to get around in front of you in bed.  Then it constantly jiggles with every movement of whatever it's connected to.  The bending arm part is very firm too firm. Very wide bending radius.  But the part that connects to the bed or table is plastic that seems like it could break easily.
5,I've told everyone about this product it works great. It's very sturdy but shakes when using it you need to hold it while using it but not carry it which is what I needed.
5,She teaches watercolor on zoom. This device helps her to prevent back pain while she demonstrates various painting techniques.
5,Good
5,We use it for zoom classes and it’s perfect for our purposes. It’s easy to adjust and it is strong. We leave it in a permanent position and so far we had not need to adjust it.
4,Got it for a gift works fine
5,Used this for a camera during my online classes and it worked great! Used both for zoom camera and doc can. It did exactly what I hoped and was easy to use. I have recommended to my teacher friends!!!
5,This is ideal for broadcasting meetings via teams. Swivels every direction and is so versatile. People constantly ask me where I got it.
5,I really like this phone holder it is very sturdy although moves a tad when you bump it the thickness is great makes the sturdiness more sturdy and super easy to use you could literally stick it anywhere!
5,I bought this for a friend. She has found just what I have she was looking for. Fits on the bedhead and enables the placement of the phone just where it is required.
5,Perfect to use when you don’t wanna hold your phone and fall asleep easily with it hanging over you face. Best purchase for me especially when I’m always watching videos to fall asleep every night.
5,This was recommended by a professional I know and will help tremendously in my production video efforts good price/value
5,The mount works well on my phone with no sign of falling or the mount going loose.
5,My favorite cell phone clamp yet (I’ve tried about 4-5). It clips onto my table and actually stays in place when you shape it where you want it. It fits my iPhone 12 but would probably hold any size phone.

5,Muy bueno en calidad  es bastante fuerte
5,It is a very stable phone holder. I would recommend it.
5,This holder is awesome. Now with Covid and having to do more video calls this device helps me to hold my phone so I can continue doing other productive things while on a video call.
5,Husband uses this everyday. It is easy to position holds his phone securely and is good quality. We ended up giving as stocking stuffers because it is such a great thing to have.
5,The grip is great on the clip and the holder. It's sturdy. It's a little hard too bend at times. It's still a good product for me.
5,This is perfect! It's easy to reposition and holds my phone very securely. I also love how easy it is to get my phone in and out of the clip.
2,The part that clamps to table is great. Part that holds phone very flimsy. Broke in middle on both sides. They sent me a new on and so far so good.
5,I’ve had no problems or complaints so far with this product. It articulates very easily the mounting clamp is sturdy and the phone clamp does a great job holding my phone.
5,Very sturdy and thick. Impressed

5,Tiene todo súper práctico me encantó. Coge mi tel súper bien..Es un poco duro para moverlo cuando lo coges por primera vez pero a los días ya sabes cómo moverlo..va súper bien.
5,I purchased this item for an individual whose trembling hands would not permit navigation of the cell phone. This solved the problem.

5,exactly what i wanted plain and simple installation great for everyday use. worth the money if you're looking for an easy phone holder
5,Does exactly what it says and is very stable. I wouldn’t expect any assembly and there isn’t which is a relief after having to build so many other kinds of mounts.
5,They gone above and beyond to resolve any issues and make customers feel like they care. I received a very sturdy holder within days. Thanks a lot.
5,I like to post Instagram Reels of art I draw. This works perfect. Easy to use and clips on to any size of desk. Neck is flexible to put in any position you want.

5,I’m very glad and surprised with it it’s the sturdiest that I expected it.And the quality of the materials is supreme.I'm glad that I bought this version.
5,Very good product
5,This is so perfect if you shop for Instacart or just like to have your phone handy while you're shopping or would work with a stroller.
5,I have tried others they would not hold up against this one. The price is right; it will not turn into an expendable item.
5,Needed something that would support my phone so I could show people during Zoom calls what papers I was working on.  This works as advertised and securely holds the phone.
5,Exactly what I needed and as described.
5,The Sturdiest and Thickness are good. No complaints. I have issues with the use of my right hand so Ease of Use in setting up phone holder is compromised slightly.
1,I had high hopes for this product since I bought one and I gifted one to my partner and not even a few months later it snapped at the base even though I hardly ever adjust it at the base it seemingly just snapped on its own. :( I’m not sure if they changed the quality since my last purchase because that gooseneck has been very reliable so far. Very disappointed in the decrease of quality in this product
5,This is a pretty decent product. It is pretty shaky if you swipe on the phone and stuff so be mindful of that.
2,The clamp isn't great it wobbles like crazy it's too short too stiff this thing doesn't work for holding your phone up to fall asleep to YouTube while lying down
5,I love this thing! I use it to watch TV from my phone when my husband is sleeping.
4,Like a charm

5,It’s easy to use and great for cooking zoom calls filming recipes for friends and watching the game or a show while doing the dishes- haha! Definitely  recommend!
5,I use this for making embroixery vlog. It needs to be adjusted for convenient angle/position. But it was not a big problem for me though.
5,Super comfortable to lay in bed and use this without having to hold it in a weird position. Simply sit back relax and enjoy the view
5,I use this to record overhead videos of my artmaking and it works great! Recommend it to anyone looking to use it for that purpose.
4,Sturdiness
4,Works great

5,Works great. This one is sturdy and is holding up well. I love the clamp that holds your phone. It’s easy to use.
5,Very sturdy & durable. I really wish it was a bit longer though. Otherwise definitely worth the money!
2,Phone holder too loose... my phone fell out twice.The clamp is good. But the actual gooseneck is so so hard I'm unbale to flex it without muscle power.  So makes it difficult to set up.Returning this !
5,Great for watching videos at night. Hands don't get tired.Very durable but flexible design.Fits any phone size.I recommend it.

5,it's very sturdy and the wire that holds the stand up is extremely strong. it fits on my bedpost easily.
5,Love this connected to my adjustable bed frame.  Helps shoulder and wrist pain from holding large phones for extended periods of time.

5,I got this to use for a virtual family game night over zoom and it was perfect!
5,This is the best tripod ever so easy to get different camera angles.. Thank you
2,We liked the concept. Getting the screens further and hands free is nice. Worked well for a while but the claw plastic should be made more durable. It just couldn’t hold up to family life.

1,This item was used for 13 months then the base of the stem broke and it's useless now.  So very disappointing that this item was not durable.  It was not worth the money and I wouldn't buy again.  I would also like to have my money refunded.
5,This thing is great
5,I got it to watch vids at night. Super lazy but it works.
5,Lovely way to avoid the neck pain of looking down at your phone.

5,Very Sturdy Versatile & Durable
5,Outstanding product! Going to order another one for my living room.
5,Strong and great love this item!
5,Very sturdy and doesn’t move around a lot which was my main concern
1,The Lamical Gooseneck phone holder is not recommended for recording videos or for people who want to start posting on YT.  The stability of this Phone Holder is rather simple its an "OK" for the price; if you don't plan on doing anything huge with it. Which would be viewing videos or speaking with people with a facecam with little to no movement.  For the Durability? Pretty standard haven't gotten any scratches; but its different for everyone on how some might use it.  For versatility? Its very limited to what it can do. I recommend a "Metal Arm Phone Holder". Most are extremely reliable especially if you plan on doing much more than what this product could do."Hope you all found this review helpful spare your money."
5,Great quality product strong durable and at a reasonable price.
5,Awesome product while my wife does her make up
5,Works great!! My new favorite tripod
2,Good ONLY IF you don’t touch the phone to type scroll swipe or whatever you do to tap the screen; otherwise the whole thing would move and wobble like crazy with every little tap. If you need something to hold your phone in a stationary position then get it. For everything else expect to be irritated by the wobbly phone every time you ever so slightly touch the screen.
5,Super durable and convenient
5,Best.
5,Great versatility!! Love this thing use it daily.
5,I mpressive. I'm buying 1 more!!!

5,Super nifty to have at my bed side.
5,Great for propping phone anywhere
5,Nothing
5,Good
1,Limited severely by the “clamp” and kids can’t bend the thing neither can wife. The all cheap plastic clamp will indeed break as soon as it’s twisted too hard or pulled on by the device. Avoid.
5,Easy to clamp on.
5,It’s very versatile and sturdy
5,Very sturdy...! Happy I bought it ...!!
5,Excellent

5,Very sturdy no problem using.
5,Works great. Its super sturdy.
5,I does a great job
5,Great product very sturdy
5,Love it!
1,The tightening nut that is threaded onto the shaft can cause a failure of the threaded support piece. Which causes the threaded piece yo crack and makes the arm useless. Suggest a stronger piece with the threads on it. maybe aluminum.
5,So easy! Love it!
5,Very easy to use
1,I've had this mounted in exactly one place for the past 6 months... And a few days ago it stopped holding the phone up... It would just twist to one side... So I unscrewed them out to look and see if there was something I could tighten down. And nope it just broke at the base.
5,Sturdiness
5,Great for lazyness 😂
5,Easy to use
5,Works great
5,Nicer than expected.
5,It is very sturdy
5,Wow!
5,Works great
5,Awesome
5,Works great!
3,It works fine very stiff.
1,Broke at the end after 4 months of normal use. Regret buying this.
5,Perfect
1,Worked great at first but now it has been rendered useless as the arm will not stay upright. Complete waste of money.
1,Concept is stellar but it does not withstand twisting and bending. There is a metal bar towards the base/clamp that literally snapped.
2,I loved this thing until it crapped out a month after getting it. It was super sweet and right after the return window was up so was it's ability to remain upright. Now it just flops down like a flaccid member just disappointing😞.
2,We had just gotten our new iPhone 12 and it didn’t fit. We accidentally called 911 emergency while trying to put the phone on the stand and scared us to death. They called us and we had to clear up the problem. It looks too noticeable on our island.
1,I use a product on a nightly basis and after only 5 months it broke and now it does not hold up my phone. Maybe they should have thought of better design.
1,The goose neck portion is very sturdy to the point it is hard to adjust.  The clamp unscrews and then you get phone phone holder and phone stand  right in the face.  As you adjust it is loud and you really need to put it far away from your face.
1,This product is too unstable when touching or typing:  August 14 2021.  I am adding an addendum to my review.  Customer Service emailed and offered me a refund without having to return the product.  I accepted.  They then contacted me again and offered to send me a desktop phone/tablet holder free of charge.  I did not accept the second offer but did appreciate the gesture.  This demonstrated the highest level of customer service.
2,Wobbles around for 15 seconds after you touch the screen. Looks like it will last maybe six months before it breaks.
1,Poor quality!!! Broke on the first day!!
1,The phone holder was very good untill it broke. It took only a couple days of days of use to break.Edit: Lmao I found out that you can just clamp the broken part of the wire to fix it. If you had the same problem I did just follow the second picture.
1,Arm broke after 3 months of use not worth the price
2,Bought it in January and its April and the flexible metal inside has snapped and broke. This is great if you don't plan on moving it around a lot like I did.
4,I bought this product after I had surgery to repair a fractured leg. The clamp is excellent and very easy and quick to operate and all cellphone buttons as well as the touchscreen area is easily accessible. I used this product heavily for six months before the gooseneck broke (see pictures). I went to the Andobil website at which there is a link to inform the company about any problems with a product including an option to send photos. I was promptly contacted by a representative who informed me that the product was under warranty and that it would be replaced free of charge including shipping with arrival within a week. Excellent customer service experience!
1,Only worked for 5 months now it is loose at the base of the bottom clamp. The clamp is okay but it’s above that part that lost it’s strength does not stay in position anymore!! Now it is useless
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Well this sure sucks. I bought this a few months back and it broke at the end.
2,The gooseneck was so stiff that I couldn’t adjust it to arrange the camera.  I am returning it.
1,Stayed connected to my desk perfectly BUT anytime i touched my phone even to just lightly touch the screen i would have to readjust the entire arm & clip.I did purchase a different desktop phone holder from this same company because i like their products.The idea of this product was good BUT it just doesn’t meet continuous satisfaction.
1,So stiff - hard to move and trust I am strong. A\nd trying to move the gooseneck right out of the box to set up the tighten bolt damaged the faux leather wrap on the gooseneck. SO I have this difficult to use product and immediately gets damaged trying to set it up.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Do not buy this product if you have any type of motion sickness. The whole unit wobbles excessively at the slightest touch. If you plan on using your phone (ie. you need to touch the screen) the whole unit will shake around for minutes. Unusable for me.
1,Flexibility was sturdy for first few uses then the flexible shaft broke few from the mount and is now useless
1,Worked great for 4 months then the cable broke and it’s now worthless. I used it with a iPhone 6 almost every day. Was good design heavy long cable and stayed in place. I wish it was stronger.
1,The snake portion is very sturdy rigid difficult to move both the clamp and the phone holding assemblies are cheap plastic.If you need to adjust this device often move it by the middle snake area only not by the phone clamp portion
1,I was very impressed when I first got it. Today I tried to tighten it on my desk and it snapped. If possible I’d like them to replace it because it should not break that easily.
2,Needs to be a foot longer to ideally reach.
1,Used it for several months and one day the metal pole broke. Otherwise this would have been a great product if only it was durable.
1,Was nice until it broke within a month
1,Not easy to install made marks despite the padding plus the handle not easily bendable even to make it look like the advertised picture too stiff the clapping part for the phone is one size fits all and had to put extra paper towel just to help with grabbing the phone. Look elsewhere if you really need a decent one!
2,It worked great then it tore.
1,Broke within 6 months.
1,It worked great for a while but after only 2 months it broke where the arm attaches to the clamp.
1,Me agrado el propósito y la gran utilidad pero el material de la abrasadera es plástico frágil y se quiebra.
1,It only lasted me five months if you use it dearly don’t buy this one I feel I deserve a credit thank you one of your loyal customers
1,Neck broke after minimal use. The product was great until I went to use it one night and the neck had lost all flexibility. Don’t waste your money.
1,Barely used the holder and in less than a month it broke. Also loudly creaked when I moved it. Garbage!
1,Ised only few timea and it Brock ... I need my MONEY back ot replacement at least with different one.... Very disappointed .
1,Brakes easily poorly build
1,After loving this product for six months the wire inside broke. It's garbage. How disappointing.
1,Too stiff to use hook is not versatileReturned it
1,Product broke after less than 2 months
1,The base broke.......
1,The gooseneck was so rigid it made adjusting it virtually impossible. Returned.
1,It shakes and can not be used for filming.
1,Should make the actual neck Material  stronger
3,This worked well for the short time I had it until it broke…i just need a replacement clip everything else is fine. I’m hoping future clips are upgraded to be unbreakable (you know like them hair combs???)If not replaced I’d be hard pressed to buy another.Edit: Contacted the manufacturer & they sent me another one. I hope the clamp doesn’t break again.
1,Wobbly and hard to adjust. Quite a disappointment.
3,Got this holder as a gift.  Easily attaches to just about anything. Makes reading or streaming better as don't have to hold phone. It started drooping at the ball joint so it points downward so it's become useless.  Love the product but would like to have this fixed. I have read that the company offers a 12-month warranty. I emailed the order information to the email listed however was never given any information on how to file for warranty. Too bad because I really liked this item and I feel it should have lasted longer.
1,Garbage
1,Too bouncy
5,Be reasonable with this in terms of longevity. I’m on my 3rd one and it’s funny. I looked through my order history and the orders were exactly 6 9 and then again 6 months apart. So this means that with my CONSTANT use in bed twisting and contorting the things every night with the change of my head and body positioning it DID last for some time! The materials give way and no more resistance happens—one day the rod just falls straight down with 100% gravity takeover. All of a sudden too. No “warning” lol or slow decline.
2,Bought this a little over a year ago and the clamp that hold the phone in place broke. Now I need a new one.
1,Did not meet my needs.  PLEASE INSTRUCT HOW TO RETURN
1,The metal part is thin and will fatigue with use. Mine broke within 3 months. Metal part is relatively thin and it is long and therefore will shake alot if touched.
2,The cable arm is shorter than expected and it wobbles some needing to be steadied to stop vibrating when first attached to the phone or after touching it to utilize phone functions.  That can be tolerated.It is now broken at the phone attachment end.  I've owned it for more than 30 days and there does not appear to be any way to return it for a refund now.  That makes me think twice about Amazon also.I'm 75 and a careful old guy.  I'm not rough with appliances.  Just not a tough guy.The reason I am careful with things is to prevent breaking or damaging them.Nonetheless this is broken -- and way too soon -- long before it should wear out from normal use.No return.  No refund.  No repair / replacement parts available.  $26 down the drain.  No help from Amazon.If you insist on purchasing this phone holder be extremely careful with it -- even if you're a cautions gentle old Geezer.
2,First time setting it up my phone fell out as I adjusted the angle. Operator error? I'd say it's a design flaw --- much too easy for the phone to drop out of the clamshell grip.
5,A much better product than I had expected!I had bought another phone holder from this company that was very similar yet a much different experience. That holder was very rigid and not very reliable. It would not grip to surfaces well and always slipped out of grip. This one however is fantastic! It’s sturdy yet flexible. It feels secure in grip and doesn’t move an inch! Especially when moving it around and adjusting to the weird angles I sleep in.  It even has a leather wrap that adds a stylish look. I definitely believe this product is a much needed improvement on the original design and I can confidently recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient and stylish way to hold your device in any way you need.
5,I have the older model which is good but the ball joint on this model makes it better. I use mine attached to an overhead shelf to read in bed.
5,Very durable
5,This replaced one I got for Christmas and broke within 24 hours. The ratchet clamping device on the base is significantly better than the cheaper models and the bendable cable is much sturdier.
1,This product lasted 11 months until the metal fatigued.  Apparently there are only so many times a person can bend it before the metal fatigues and it is useless.
1,wasting money
5,So after reading many reviews on products similar to this item and customers complaining about how difficult it was to twist and bend their item... I took a chance on this updated model. So far I love it. I've had it for a few months now and used it a few times(not everyday). I use it to video myself creating artwork. I love the leather-like material and the twist handle that loosens and tightens it to the desk. The neck is definitely sturdy enough and won't fall over! The neck is STRONG and it does take a little effort to carefully bend and twist it to the shape you desire. BUT I have health issues which have made me weaker than average So this issue was a big concern for me when choosing a product however this one is just fine! If someone has arthritic issues or something like that then  you might need some assistance especially on a flare day. I also like the way the top portion holds my large phone. Hope this all helps!
5,It wasn't until my fingers were hurting from holding my cellphone while in bed that I decided to look for a solution.  I searched on Amazon and found this excellent holder from Lamicall! it is great quality which allows the flexible gooseneck holder to be steady and strong enough to hold the cellphone.  The price is very reasonable and worth every penny.  I highly recommend it
5,Great product. Will buy more soon!
5,This is a must have to mount your cell phone at bedtime! When you fall asleep you don’t have to worry about dropping your phone anymore!! Lol it’s really sturdy and very easy setup too! Everyone needs one! It’s not only good to mount on your headboard but also you can use it for many things too! In the kitchen office while soaking in the tub too! It’s great for kids too! Connect it to a stroller or car seat and no more worries of them dropping your phone. Extremely Versatile! A great gift for anyone!
5,It's sturdy grips everything  so you can actually put it wherever you need it great item for a solo musician for recording videos
4,I bought this to help with recording my graphic design/drawing process videos and unboxing videos. This is probably the most sturdy stand I have purchased. It may be a little hard to bend to the way you want but I definitely love using it.
4,Upon opening the box. I was impressed with the quality of packaging. The cable & clamps at both ends are sturdily built!  A very good quality is my overall impression.
5,Works great with my kindle. Very stable and secure on my headboard
4,Overall this thing is pretty cool and useful for most. I wanted something a little longer but I realize that would also come at the cost of sturdiness. If you plan on having this be a bedside convenience make sure you do the measurements first and don't expect it to stretch out all that much. Material quality is great though.
5,So far it’s lived up to its expectations (after having it for 3 weeks).
5,This clip is good. The wire is thick and durable. The main problem that I have is finding a good place to attach it to. I attached it to bed headboard but if your headboard moves the clip also moves and wobbles giving motion sickness. If it is a leather fabric headboard it leaves an indent. It is pretty heavy so I also tried attaching it to glass nightstand but I am afraid the clip will break the nightstand. So I do not actually use it.
5,I bought this to watch videos on my phone. So far it works great. The clamp is solid and doesn't move around when tightened. The arm is sturdy and can hold my phone's weight without sagging. I clamped it to my bed's headboard and the arm's plenty long to extend downward close to my face. This mount does everything I expected it to do.
2,This product can be used normally to watch the screen but if you want to play with your phone this product will move.Not stable at all. Keeps shaking while using  Not even one stable shot. and needs to be longer  it’s too short .  not worth the price.
1,It bounced when you try to play a game
5,If you going number 2 for 10+ minutes this helps keep your sitting upright instead of leaned over watching endless YouTube videos. It’s perfect for me.
5,I love this product this is one of the products that I don’t regret buying and loved the minute I used it
1,Too stiff to bend easily too bulky. Too big in size.
5,Amazing product to make videos for anywhere.Solid quality100% recommended.
5,This product has saved me!! After having surgery I needed something that could hold my cell phone at eye level and this has been perfect!! It is great from all aspects!! I definitely recommend!!
5,I would recommend for anyone to buy!
5,Amazing. You will not regret it
5,I use it 3 nights a week to watch tv while my husband is asleep. He has to get up early 4:45am. I’m busy doing something else the other 4 😜. I seriously love it.
5,I like others used to hold my phone in front of me and having my hands getting really tired. then I got this and I absolutely love it. I mounted this on my nightstand and put my phone in it and do all but texting on it that way.
5,I can't believe how sturdiness this gooseneck is. Where ever I put it is where it stays! Very well made. Thicker than any other ones I've seen. Happy with me order.Unfortunately a UPDATE: Yes it looks and feels very well made. But 2 month later it snapped at the bottom end. The inside is made of a strong aluminum rod and that was the reason for it to snap. Once you start to adjusting it constantly back and forward that's it snap! Sucks would've liked to gotten my money back. To late i guess!
5,This is great!  My son loves to watch his videos while laying in bed but he’s always holding his phone over his head.  I got him this so he can just play music or watch videos with a quick tap.  View from the bed attached. Clamp is perfect.
4,Super flexible and portable and will work in so many spaces for these reasons I love this product.  But I’ve bought two.  First one broke after a year that felt like wear and tear so I bought a new one at the end of March that broke yesterday.  It’s inexpensive and I use it A LOT so I’m going to invest in one more and see if lasts the full year or longer.  I still recommend but be gentle 😅
5,Aloha~^^
4,Worked well for watching not for recording wiggles too much
5,Bought this holder as I needed something to hold my phone over the piano for the kids online music lessons. The different angles possible with the holder are very convenient and the holder is quite sturdy as well and holding up nicely.
5,My phone is sort of big (6.9 in) but it still fits perfectly on the clip. I will say that if your phone has a popsocket you probably won't be able to use it properly though. I had to remove mine. But the reach and sturdiness are incredible.
5,I use it on my kenworth to hold my iphone 12 max and it is great!
5,Exactly as advertised; strong but flexible arm and clamp
5,It’s all the above and more and the shipment time was greatThanks for your product
5,Very happy that I bought this! I bought it for my dad who has Parkinson's which causes him to have difficulties holding his cell phone to talk or video chat. This is a great tool very sturdy yet can be moved easily. The large clamp for his phone makes it very easy for him to use. Would definitely recommend!
5,Great Product!Excellent Service!Many thanks to Amazon and the Seller!
5,I have a Note 10 Plus with an outter box case and it holds my phone well. Good product.
5,I really like how easily this adjusts. It doesn’t feel flimsy at all. I love using this for catching up on my videos while I get ready for work.
5,Works well. Clamps tight fits phone snuggly
5,Well made
5,Two thumbs up for this product!!
4,Wasn't long enough
5,Super sturdy does not sag under the weight of my phone which is 194 grams (6.84 oz). Bends well and is easy to get phone in and out.
5,My daughter is always laying in bed watching videos and shows on her phone.  Now she doesn't have to worry about being comfortable and holding her phone.  Clipped this to her nightstand and securely holds her phone for her.
4,It is very useful. It does not fit on headboard. It fits on my nightstand.
5,Bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. She loves it. It has saved our relationship and it earned me some sweet lovin! Also it is so sturdy and easy to use I'm going tobget one for myself.
4,Husband likes it. Says it works great.
5,Bought this for my daughter in law. She absolutely loved it!
5,- Easy to use- Keeps desk area nice neat and free from excess clutter
5,This is a great product because the neck is covered with the leather. Also looks great. Makes it more sturdy and keeps it from falling or lowering. Durability is great. Great find! Thanks Amazon!
5,Solid built and easy to use
5,I have nothing bad to say about it!
4,Good sturdy hands free easy to use!
5,SturdyDurableGreat product
5,Works well
4,Very sturdy
5,Really enjoy using it for a number of devices and purposes
5,Great product to hold cell phone when you read in bed.
5,Very sturdy attached easily to.my bed frame and thicker grip than other similar models
5,To hold cp
5,Very useful for me
5,It is perfect I'd like all the different way it moves it hold my phone perfectly very good equipment thank you so much
5,This is so perfect for anything you really need it for. I use it to record my clients services and also to hold my phone when I want to watch something while I work on clients. It’s super sturdy and won’t budge
1,I don’t know how I managed to live so long without this purchase.  I loved it until it broke and is completely useless it flops and can no  longer hold my phone in an ergonomic position.  Don’t buy this unless you gave money to burn on a low quality product.
5,couldnt be happier. does exactly what its supposed to do
5,Works perfectly and as expected
5,Very sturdy.  Holds phone well.  Easy to use.
5,Sturdy tough to bend but I would rather it be this way versus cheaply made.
5,It’s doing a great job staying attached to the headboard is really sturdy hasn’t dropped the phone on me and I’m pretty impressed with it. 👍👍
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Extremely easy to use. Stays where you put it. Bends in any direction. Clamps onto the table with these.
5,As a hairstylist I take videos while I am working. The gooseneck works perfectly.  It allows me to get close hands free! This particular product is sturdy and well made.🥰love this product!
5,This seems to be very well-made and is as advertised. It allows me to use my phone as a document camera so that my students can see my writing rather than using a mouse to try to draw mathematical figures when I teach them remotely.Their customer service is also fantastic. When I had trouble registering I let them know and they got back to me within a few hours and made it right.Bravo!
5,Love it works fine and no more switching hands
5,Great to attach to dorm bed to watch movies from phone. Very sturdy.
5,We bought this for my son that had a stroke and is bed ridden the last few months. When he goes to turn and can’t reach the rail he reaches over and grabs the phone holder and pulls his body over and he weighs 200 lbs. I don’t normally do reviews but he said I had to on this one.
5,Product is good...sadly does not work for my husband. He has the use of only one arm and I hoped it would help him with holding his phone to make a call. It is good if someone calls him but he has to push too hard on the keypad to make a call. The product clamps well and does hold his phone.
5,I used the model before this one for over a year and just replaced it with this updated one. I absolutely love it! The improvements are significant with the gooseneck swivel and leather covered arm. I use this item daily to hold my phone as it provides relief for my neck arm and shoulder pain.
2,Not stable at all. Keeps shaking while taking pics. I threw the package box else would hace returned this item. Not even one stable shot.
5,I love this thing! My husband is out of the country so to avoid holding a phone for hours I can just clamp my phone in this thing and it’s going NOWHERE! It hasn’t damaged my bed the clamp is very easy to open for your phone and the cord thing feels really sturdy so it’s not going to fall down at all.
4,After about two months of use it broke so I don’t think I can rate it high on sturdiness or durability. Although it was great while it worked the base could use some work.edit: their CS has reached out to provide a replacement so i will add an extra star for CS experience
5,Perfect phone holder. You can clip it to just about anything. Holds phone well.
4,I found out it is hard to manipulate or in more details hard to bend. I liked the length of it which is the longest one across all products that searched. It is durable so far. I am always don't keep an item that is not five stars for me.
5,I use this to quickly scanned photos etc. and the way it’s designed I can operate my phone controls while it’s in the grip.
5,I *love* this thing!! I had an interviews coming up and I had to get something to hold my phone up since I don't have a PC.I rushed and came across the older version of this and almost grabbed it but then saw the updated one. Hey the way it can swivel around is AMAZING I thought that would be a huge problem with the older one so really glad I sprung for this one.This thing is going to be so useful in my life - oh and hey I got the job! They provide a computer but you better believe I am still going to use this for talking to clients while I take notes on the computer.
5,Luv that u can move it around very sturdy Clamps great stays where you Clamp it
5,I enjoy using this while I am online doing work or doing zoom calls. It’s a lifesaver and a great price for the quality.
5,Quality device. Flexible gooseneck stand for phone attaches very securely. Great for using phone without having to constantly hold it or prop it up!
5,My son and I have been watching Disney+ movies on my phone.  This gooseneck holder is awesome.  We can adjust it for distance and can now watch movies hands free.  Coolest clamp ever.
5,nice
5,Excelente
5,Great product
5,We’ve had other less sturdy phone holders that do not last more than a year. It can be tough to maneuver but I would choose that over others I’ve had. Also the actual phone clip is much better made. Very satisfied!
5,Using to video hands free while drawing in procreate works exactly as I had hoped.Perfect!
5,Sturdy design and excellent quality. The only negative part I could find is the base clamp has a tendency to slip on certain types of material. The clamp could use a bit more grip but overall it is worth the price!
5,This has become a necessity.
5,Bought it so my husband who had a stroke can check his phone without a struggle.  Very useful he is very happy with it.
5,I have a neck problem and looking down at my phone was painful and making it worse. This has changed all of that because I’m able to move my phone to the right height without straining my neck when using it on the bed or the couch.  I’m very happy with this product.
5,good
5,It fit.. it seems strong so far.  ( 1 month).If something goes wrong I will revise.
5,I got this so I could watch movies in bed on my iPhone.  My hands were getting sore holding my phone and I wanted a way to hold it up. This did the job.
5,Excelente producto
4,I had originally purchased this model a year ago. It lasted all that time until one day one of the arms of the holder snapped in half. This is the replacement and it has been improved. I like it a lot better! More manueverable flexible and easier to deal with. Super easy to attach to my bed so I can read my Kindle books before going to sleep.
4,***UPDATE**Well it's lasted 15 months... So I guess that's at least a little more than double what I got last time.. but now it's constantly trying to fall and the at the ball joint is even loose and dropping pretty easily so I guess it's time to start looking again for a new one...**Original review**I received this as a replacement after the previous version I had loved broke after almost a perfect 6 months... so far this seems more sturdy.. I will update if anything changes but I love how steady it is and how the clamp holds my phone! much more convenient than the ones that are more like the tablet holders..
5,I had a stroke when I had Covid-19 and I’m lost use of my right hand (I right handed) SOoooo this product works amazingly well being able to have my iPhone held with it. It allowed me to watch videos text with my left hand..... Thanks for selling this great product ‼️😍🤩💫
5,Holds tightly.
5,I wanted this to watch a sappy movie while taking a bubble bath and it’s perfect! Maybe a little of a long arm for the space I’m using it for. But it’s perfect!
5,Quite sturdy the kids haven't broken it yet. Does what its intended to do very nicely.
5,This just made my life!!! I use it for Instacart. Helps me keep my hands free.
5,Very convinient. Charges all apple products at once. No cluttered wires. 5 stars!
5,IMO the neck on this could be a little longer for cell phone use.
5,I was wondering what I might use in bed and with the use of one arm. Found this Lamicall GP 03 Gooseneck iPhone holder. Long name but this thing is great! It makes life a little easier!
5,Exactly what I wanted Exactly what I needed;  Exactly what Was advertised; Exactly what I received. Great seller great product! Love both!! Best of all I needed seller support and received fantastic support.
5,This is really stable very strong.. I am surprised.
5,Good
5,Worked greatFor 6 monthJust broke at the mountReady to trash it
5,Versatility stability and sturdy. Great! buy. love it.
5,Great
5,I am using this to record agility trials.  The clamp wasn't wide enough for the first place I planned on putting it but I readily adjusted and used my chair.  It worked PERFECTLY!
5,Well made. Actually holds things in one place without failing after a few seconds. I've tried so many different kinds  and this is the only one that actually.holds my phone IN the otterbox case.
5,Good quality worth the money. I get a lot of use out of this. I needed one sightly longer than the first one I bought. This product does not disappoint.
5,Used for communication while driving
5,Very strong.
2,I have had this gooseneck for four months and it is already broken
5,We use this for our Art Studio while recording videos- great purchase and very versatile
5,Vary good adaptive tool for one handed use. The gooseneck is tough to maneuver with one hand but that's a direct result of its very positive sturdiness.
5,Does what it’s supposed to. Very sturdy. Worth the price.
4,Update: This company stand by their product!  They refunded my purchase and sent me a new one to try. The new one has a good clamp and works well. I recommend!**********The clamp was loose so if you add a phone it just tips over. It’s useless. And I’m super bummed because I needed to use this today.  While I hope this problem is a fluke with just mine I won’t be exchanging it for the same item. I’m returning mine and will purchase a more heavy duty one!
5,Use it while watching media on my phone. Very functional phone holder!!! Great product!
5,My OT suggested this since I have carpal tunnel in both wrists and I am constantly dropping my phone and iPad. I also have low vision issues so being able to use my phone with this product I can use the magnifier within my phone and not have to worry about shaking my phone when I am trying to read something or even dropping my phone doing similar activities. I am more than happy with this purchase.
3,Good but could be better.  The swivel head is plastic and snap off
5,I purchased this after seeing this at a relative's house. It is very sturdy and doesn't take up much space to film my work on a table. I felt as though my tripod this extend to move the way I wanted it to. This moves exactly how I wanted my other 3 tripods to move. I have not used this in an upright position yet but it will hold your phone while in a bulk case (Samasung in a Otterbox).Overall  worth the money spent and works exactly as it should.
5,Awesome!
5,Love the flexibility and sturdiness
5,It’s very convenient and easy to assemble and it’s sturdy and stays in place
5,I have it setup semi-permanently so I can make videos on a project I am working on. My son uses his in his sound studio for studying online and for face-time calls. Very solid base anchoring. Lots of angles possible for neck.
5,Excellent item  I'll buy another
5,It’s sturdy and holds up an iPhone 13pro max with ease.
5,I needed a phone holder while in bed. Very sturdy easy to set up right out of box stiff flexible neck holds positions . It’s attached to a bed side table no problems or issues to report. Highly recommend.
5,Good
4,It is sturdy and places well but really hard to bend around
5,it's so hard
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great everything from the upper clamp to the neck lower clamp made cheap.
5,This is a great gadget!  Even better is the fact that my son actually uses  it!  That’s agreat thing right there!!
5,I don't generally write reviews for products but felt compelled to do so for this.  This is a superb gooseneck phone holder and I now have three of them.  I use it in my office (on desk) and for songwriting (on pianos - - both electric and console).  It is very versatile strong and durable yet flexible.  I highly recommend.
5,She's 17 and likes it a lot!
5,Great product.... it is useful to now that any/all adjustments to the neck for distance angle etc should be done BEFORE you set it in place with the clamp......other wise you will blame the product for stiffness but it is meant to be stiff and sturdy so common sense is useful.
5,The mount is fantastic - the only drawback is that the articulated bendable arm is very stiff to manipulate but this is exactly why I bought it because it is very sturdy and stable and can hold the largest and heaviest of phones with ease. The clamp mount that secures the base of the device is made of plastic and is the only area of concern regarding durability and longevity. Though the plastic isn't the best quality it is thick and I don't have any reservations about it. I'm just careful not to over crank the threaded locking handle more than I need to when I twist it into place.
5,La longueur était parfaite. Bien construit et a rendu la lecture le visionnage d'un film relaxant ou simple utilisation du téléphone. Il n'a pas à s'inquiéter de s'endormir et d'endommager le téléphone. Fonctionne certainement comme annoncé !
5,The length was perfect. Well constructed and has made reading or watching a movie relaxing and not have to worry about falling asleep and potentially damaging the phone. Works certainly as advertised!
5,Como se ha mencionado los materiales son muy buenos y esto hace que sea muy rígido lo ideal es dejarlo en el lugar que se ocupará ya que estar moviendolo y luego ajustándolo irrita...
5,Es un producto bastante rígido en el soporte.Debes tener cuidado al manipular loTambién se mueve y tambalea el celular. Por lo que genera dificultad  al grabar.Pero es mejor que muchos otros productos del mercado
5,Es muy resistente y estable. Es difícil de torcer el cable pero una vez que logras ponerlo en la posición que deseas ya no se mueve.
5,Très solide reste en place tient très bien. C'est numéro 1.
5,i use this alot
5,Material resistente . Estable . Fácil de operar . Se ajusta a mis necesidades .
5,Muy buen producto cumple a la perfección.
5,This works very well  very sturdy and adjustable
5,todo bien
2,Great product with limited use. We use it daily and have gone through 2 units in less than 1 year. The first one broke at the grip/hand tension turner and the 2nd one popped out of socket and we can't get it back in.
2,I don't find it flexible enough to move or adjust. Too hard for my liking.
1,Product arrived Jan 03 2022.  I only setup the Gooseneck phone holder for the third time while clamping it the base broke.BUYER BEWARE:  This product only has a 30 day warranty!  Save your monies!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This phone holder has been sooo useful. Being able to adjust the gooseneck at any position you want is super handy (bendable squiggly . There's a gyro between the adjustable gooseneck and clamp so you can tweak the screen of your phone if you want it face level horizontally diagonally however you prefer. I've been mainly using it for when i need a second screen while on my PC desktop. Also been able to use it around my bed to just lie down and watch instead of holding your phone bed side. Literally hands free. Luckily i have a bed frame that has a flat side that's mountable. Of course not everyone has that type of bed but an alternative is mounting it on your bed headboard. If you don't have both of that then i guess the only option is your desk. It's also able to clamp a Nintendo Switch screen as well so that's a plus. That's probably the largest device i can clamp it on (See picture). Anything bigger than a Nintendo Switch screen won't fit. Other than that I would recommend it if you are a mobile user.
5,Put it on my bed headboard to watch videos or play music at night. I know the longer the arm the more wobbly it's going to be but you do lose about 3-5 inches twisting the head back around to face so this is only just long enough for my usage. Less of a problem when I sleep on my side plus a great upgrade from having to hold it myself. The clamp part is plastic however so don't tighten it too much be careful not to break it.Overall would definitely recommend this version with the ball head to easier adjust angles without having to re-position the arm.
5,I bought this to use with a mini projector for cookie decorating. It works great! It's quite sturdy... it doesn't slowly start to droop or anything. I attached it very easily to my island counter top and it works wonderfully. It's not 100% still but thats not for the fault of the actual item its shakey because I bumped my island but even then it didnt impact my decorating. It's also nice to use while facetiming with my phone or if you needed to look at a recipe on your phone while cooking - having it off the counter is really handy.
5,After looking at many gooseneck phone holders I decided on this one and glad I did.Very sturdy gooseneck securing clamp firmly attaches to any surface at varying thickness phone clamp holds my Samsung S20 ultra without coming loose even while adjusting angle or gooseneck yet easy to remove and place it in it's hold.The clamp doesn't impeded on the volume other buttons nor charge port.Will definitely reccomend to others!
1,The arm has been adjusted for regular use for three month's and the wire inside has broken.
5,This thing is more stiff than teenage me in the morning. I've had it mounted with a tablet for about a week now and no drooping. This is exactly what I wanted.You can rotate for quick changes to vertical/landscape display. It does bounce while touching your screen but just hold the bottom to stop it quickly. The only slight negative is that you can't really adjust the neck well while your phone/tablet is in there. You can make subtle adjustments easily though and knowing it won't droop makes it a slight problem worth having.Great product!
5,Tt works great while it last: it's fixed on the table easily and steady and it's strong enough to hold the phone without bending down. Unfortunately the part that holds the ball cracked within the first 3 months.Update:I was contacted by their customer support and they sent me a replacement holder.  Awesome support.
5,It is working well. I do however find that it loses its stiffness after holding my phone for a few hours in an extended position.
3,I use it for LG phone. It's very sturdy and difficult to bent/adjust and very chaky when you touch a phone.
5,Very sturdy and holds various items iPhoneiPadKobo my only issue might be that when you touch device it takes a few seconds to stop shaking.  But my bet is all corded holders are the same. And you’re touch gets smoother with practice
5,
5,Overall build is sturdy I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 with a dbrand grip case with a pop socket so my phone is heavier than most phones so it shakes quite a bit but the product holds up well.If you have a lighter phone then you should be fine when it comes to stability.
5,Muy útil versatil y con excelente sujeción
1,I had moved it to the garbage I  mounted it on the deck to take the picture.
5,Its a nice phone holder. Does exactly what it says. Good quality but neck is just too stiff to move around.
5,I bought this item after I had a bad experience with another phone holder (cheaper). This is worth every penny. The holder clamp is unconventional but it works wonderfully no matter the size of your phone. It holds it firmly it also holds phones with cases as well. My only complaint would be the length of the "gooseneck" could be a bit longer but it is a very minor inconvenience. Good build quality and very sturdy. ALSO - it clamps onto cylindrical surfaces and doesn't move an inch! Very satisfied. Spend a bit more and get this item your phone deserves it.
1,Really liked this product since June but today it just broke at the base. Started flopping around at the point where it attaches to the clamp.
5,This phone holder is absolutely perfect! Extremely sturdy doesn't move when I move around keeps the image in shot and is really amazing for overhead tarot videos. So glad I finally found one that isn't cheaply made.
5,I use this to hold my phone to record nail videos! I love it so far. The clamp for the table is super secure and doesn't move too much when you adjust the neck. The clamp for your phone is also super easy to attach and detach your phone as well. I also love how easy it is to change around the phone position too. Worth the purchase
5,Cumplió totalmente con su objetivo y vaya que me ha resuelto muchas complicaciones a la hora de trabajar solamente si es algo complicado doblar el cuello xD! Necesitas aplicar algo de fuerza… pero es parte de que sea tan resistente.
5,I have a I phone se i have tried various stands with it and it always falls out.  This one not only keeps my phone held securely and place but is super flexible. I recommend it.
5,Great Product. I use it religiously. It is as advertised! Thank you David
4,I really like it  however the clamp that attaches to table could open wider and the arm is a little hard to bend but im assuming that's so its not like the rest you find that bounce around or shake when you move around. Overall best one ive found
5,I use it in bed at night when I want to read. It's very sturdy. When you're reading an eBook it does shake slightly when you turn the page but stops immediately when you you steady it.
5,the phone and mount do sway around a bit but if you're using it for recording or to view hands free it works pretty darn good. the base is hella sturdy too
5,Valió totalmente la pena. Por lo largo que es tiende a bailar un poco si tocas mucho la pantalla pero si piensas ponerlo y casi no tocarlo es lo suficientemente macizo para no moverse. Se siente muy resistente y duradero.
5,It is stiff!!! Exactly what I wanted. It doesn't sag and will hold a secure position for hours. Yet it is very malleable and the ball joint makes it easy to put in any position. The clamp is easy to attach.
5,Really nice product  sturdy Durable and can be used on tables backs of chairs  office..nice quality and looks nice.Its a long device and so it becomes of great utility ...  Worth all the money spent
2,My husband loves to watch shows on his phone in bed and this is perfect for that he’s obsessed! But sadly it broke after 5 months which is super disappointing
5,Semble très bien conçu et de qualité.
5,Resistente buena estabilidad y funcional
4,Very easy to manipulate.
5,The sturdiness of this unit is superb I have a cheaper version and there is no comparison this one holds my phone and stays in place no problem.  Worth the money
5,I like it highly recommended.
5,This holder is strong very flexible and provides a firm grip on my phone.
5,Lamicall gen 1 or gen 2 equally good. Be happy with either.
1,Where I had it placed I only needed it for slight changes in angles but it managed to still break.
5,Exactly as described and girlfriend loves it. Uses it for all parts of the home to ensure hands free use of her phone. Recommend!!
5,La resistencia es muy buena y el agarre al teléfono ya sea horizontal o vertical no se resbala.
5,This new model has a rotating grip that the original didn’t have and it makes a huge difference. And it’s more sturdy than the old model as well
5,Rigid design good ball joint and strong grip on table and phone. Couldn't ask for much better. I would definitely recommend this product to others
5,Está súper bien hecho se puede poner donde sea tiene buena resistencia este soporte a diferencia de otros que he comprado.
5,Très bonne qualité de produit!
5,There is nothing about this I don’t like
5,I'm using a smart phone as a web cam. Thanks to this support I can set the phone exactly where it needs to be. It's stable enough for this job.
5,NOW I CAN FREE MY HAND :)
5,Sturdy and the quality is really good! I'm very happy with this purchase
5,estoy contento con el producto cumple con todo lo que publica es fuerte no se le escapa el telefono.  Es muy funcional.
3,I thought it would be a great product it felt sturdy but only lasted a bit over 7 months. It doesn't hold my phone steady anymore instead it tumbles around.
5,Works amazing!!!
5,Awesome product
5,
5,Very sturdy

3,Versatile and flexible phone holder  the leather wrapped material using few times it peel off
4,Needs to be longer. That said it is of excellent quality

5,Good product
5,I like the sturdiness love the clamp to hold my phone!Great buy !Worth every penny!
5,Lo uso para grabar videos cortos y tiene estabilidad y me permite acomodar el celular de una forma que pueda manipularlo.
5,Bought this to record some cooking videos and it's perfect
5,Love it
5,buy it! if you’ve been second guessing you don’t have to. it’s a good buy! ❤️
5,Love it
5,Bought this to record some cooking videos and it's perfect
4,Se mueve mucho si está con el ventilador o empieza a bailar mucho si quieres tocar la pantalla. Pero en si es muy bueno.
5,Lo uso para ponerle videos a mi hija en la carreola… practico
5,Quede convencido positivamente de esta compra. Cumple todas mis expectativas.
5,Very stable and easy to install and release phone. The rubberized holder has a great quality to it.
1,SE ME ROMPIO A LOS 2 MESES Y MEDIO DE USO DIARIO
5,Excelente calidad
5,Wasn't entirely sure this thing would be all that useful but I'll admit it's actually pretty good. VERY sturdy even though it can sometimes be a bit of a wrestling match to get it into the position you want .. but I'd rather it be tough .. than weak and flimsy which it certainly isn't.
5,We used it quite a bit this summer and it has held up.
5,Je l'utilise pour filmer mes mains lorsque je joue du piano.
5,Nice quality
3,Muy duro para manipular y el sujetador del celular no es muy bueno ya que equipos como un iphone 8 no los sujeta con fuerza y se resbalan facilmente. Los equipos como galaxy A11 o A52 si los sujeta bien por ser mas grandes
5,I have an iPhone plus and this works perfectly to hold it.
3,The spot just after the base got loose and cannot hold anything now. I will get a replacement under a 12 months warranty.I suggest anyone to use the "snake" carefully by not changing its position everyday. The position can be changed sometimes only I would say and also unfortunately. But clearly the material will break one day as the very position that is under the most stress.
5,El producto llegó bien empacado y es de muy buena calidad el brazo está bastante estabilidad no se cuelga ni se mueve con el peso del teléfono. La pinza tiene buena apertura y agarre. Excelente producto!!!
5,Me gustó mucho el producto lo único negativo que le veo es que se mueve por el aire del ventilador pero de ahí en fuera está todo bien
4,it's very easy to use
5,Justo lo que necesitaba 👌
5,Si buscas calidad y estabilidad compra este producto. Es la mejor opción.

5,Pour regarder des films sur le lit
4,It lost all of its stiffness and is unusable  now for me
5,Si je pouvais je mettrai 20 étoiles
5,Très robuste
5,I spend a lot of time in bed and with this clip on phone holder it saves me from getting hand pain! It’s very sturdy and bends how I need it! I highly recommend this product.
1,Before the six-month mark the arm could no longer hold my phone's weight rendering this product useless.  I purchased another one (The Devil You Know) and then realized that the original one may be under warranty?  If this is the case please let me know if it's replaceable.Thank you.
5,Looks like a drive inn movie screen in the dark.  Love it.  Sure beats holding your phone through movies and TV series.  Great invention!
5,The neck is quite sturdy and will not go depressingly limp even with a phone attached to the business end. It's quite susceptible to shaking but not a major annoyance. The clamp holds my phone no problem but is slightly too small to hold my Kobo Glo (I'd have to force it in and it'd be under an uncomfortable amount of pressure). Overall quite happy with the product.
5,I bought this for my brother to attach to his wheel chair It works extremely well  very happy with the purchase.

5,Utilisation en marchant dehors et dans la voiture.
5,Great product.
5,This phone mount is great. The clamp is very sturdy I mounted it to my bed frame which is pipe shaped and it still holds up well. It would probably be even better if I mounted to something flat but I have no problems with how it's mounted right now. The arm is also great and will not bend with weight of your phone arm feels great to the touch too. The ball swivel near the phone clamp is very convenient as it allows minor ajustments to the viewing angle. Great option for anyone looking for an all purpose phone mount.
1,The product worked OK until it broke less than a year after I bought it! Specifically the base is weak and cannot support my phone anymore I have to rest the “neck” on something. If you’re looking for something that you’re not going to fiddle with it might be fine but it defeats the purpose.
5,J’adore il est solide et tien bien le téléphone en place je vous le conseil
5,El mejor stand para poner tu telefono. Lo compre porque queria que mi mama dejara de sostener su cel cuando veia Netflix en su cuarto jaja y lo agarramos a la cabecera de la cama y LISTO! El cuello es super resistente fuerte y nada facil de caerse. Aguanta el celular perfectamente. Tenia miedo que no lo aguantara porque muchos de los soportes que luego venden por el peso se caen facilmente. Pero este? NOP. La agarradera para que pongas el cel de lo mas comodo y sencillo no daña el telefono. Es como una garrita super suave pero agarra el telefono muy bien. Puede mover este soporte como tu quieras y se va a sostener de esa manera!
5,I use this clamped to my easel to record painting videos and tutorials. Works great!
5,I love it as it attaches to arm of armchair. Hold phone saving not only my hand but also my neck.
5,The switch fits perfectly and securely. I don't think a switch with a case or anything bigger would fit though.
5,Easy to install. Easy to position. Does the job.
5,La relación calidad precio es muy buena.
5,I found this item perfect for what I needed I use it in the office as I prefer video conferences using my phone. The quality is good and it feels strong and sturdy and does not move around at all once you set to your preferred position.
5,hace bien su función resistente y práctica
5,Works just as I expected. Some shaking if it is attached to an active work surface.I would recommend this product.
5,utile
4,Je l'utilise pour écouter des films dans mon lit. Semble fragile mais je le manipule avec douceur et je n'ai eu aucun problème jusqu'à maintenant.
5,Produit qui semble résistant et de qualité
4,Our older RV does not have GPS so we bought this item for using our phone. Even over bumpy roads it very secure.
5,This arm is very articulate. It allows me to manipulate it in many ways to suit my needs. It grips my phone securely. I am very happy with my purchase!

5,There’s nothing to dislike it’s a solidly built phone holder with good aesthetics..
1,Yep. Three months that's all it took. And it's very difficult to take appart if your going to try to fix it.
5,It’s exactly what I expected
5,This is a solid piece of equipment that provides a tremendous asset for overhead videos of my work.
4,Je l’utilise principalement au lit pour faire des appels vidéo visionner des séries télévisées ou des films sur mon iPhone.Je pensais l’utiliser également pour lire mes courriels mais ce n’est pas suffisamment stable pour cela sans stabiliser l’appareil de l’autre main.
5,Se ve resistente esta un poco rigido pero es mejor asi para que se quede en el lugar que lo pongo. Sostiene el celular perfecto (un Hawei P30 Lite) puedo usar cualquiera de las dos cámaras con facilidad. Lo uso para dar clases de dibujo y creo que vale la pena el precio. Muy recomendado
5,This is honestly the best. Perfect for watching  a movie in bed.
5,Love it!
4,Como lo dice el titulo es ideal para recostarse o ponerlo en una mesa y ver videos pero no lo recomiendo para navegar o chatear porque se mueve demasiado y la tenaza complican el acceso a las teclas de extrema derecha e izquierda por lo demas esta bien
5,Es práctico y resistente. 👍
4,es bueno me gusta que se fija bien hasta el momento ya que lo cambio de lugar al menos dos veces al día.Espero que en el futuro no se afloje el fijador.La estabilidad no es la mejor tiembla mucho pero prefiero eso a dañar mi muñeca en las noches acostada revisando el celular.
1,This thing is heavy and no easy to change position once you have it set up. Difficult to change the twist and to adjust.
1,Las prensas  que sujetan el articulo son muy reciclables truenan al solo acomodar el aparato a la altura  lo mismo que la garra el aro que sostiene es muy delicado tanto que no tengo ni 1 mes y ya se rompió  desde hace una semana
5,Great
5,easy to use
4,I bought this because I was using my phone lots for work ( lots of calling/ texting ) and wanted this to help with neck pain / reduce constantly looking down.  With that being said even in the position you want it if you tap the screen lots it’s quite bouncy so I wouldn’t recommend it for that purpose. If you use it to watch videos on your phone then it’s perfect because it’s sturdy when you leave it alone. Now  regarding adjusting it it’s quite difficult to adjust the position while it’s clamped onto a surface. What you should do is take it off the surface and adjust it when it’s free otherwise it will just frustrate you. Overall great quality and it is quite sturdy if you use it to simply hold up your phone with minimal touching.
5,I have this clamped horizontally to the side of my headboard to hold my phone and it does an amazing job. I was hesitant that the ball and socket joint would be weak and not actually hold but the whole thing has a great feel to it and the clamp is a twist-to-tighten mechanism. It's definitely still a two-handed operation though.
5,Works great!
