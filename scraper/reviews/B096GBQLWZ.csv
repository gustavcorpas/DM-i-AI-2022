4,I love this keyboard and mouse combo for the most part and works for what my needs are. The keyboard overall does really well for being on my lap when couch gaming and the mouse really does an awesome job when it comes to my games. Being both wireless and Bluetooth does allow me the ability to use this setup for both my laptop and my PS4.The Pros of it all:1) The keyboard lights are nice and bright while being aesthetical pleasing and calming.2) More basic functions when switching to various modes of pulsing lights and solid light colors with the press of a few keys.3) Ability to use for both Bluetooth and wireless though on the PS4 this is not as seamless as I thought it would be.4) The wrist rest can be removed if necessary but since I couch game most of the time it does make it easier to use the keyboard without having to find a lapboard to use and is much more comfortable for me to use.5) The mouse speed is perfect and the flow of the mouse movement seems very seamless to me when I play my FPS games. While I would have preferred more buttons on my mouse for other key bindings it works for what I need right now.The Cons that I found:1) To use the keyboard with my PS4 I need to have it wired and turned off and then press the "S" and "B" keys to work with it. I find this a flaw in the PS4 system itself rather than the Corsair's fault as this lies in the software rather than the hardware itself.2) Uses internal batteries rather than removable ones. I find that rechargeable batteries tend to last longer easier to replace when needed and are much more convenient in that replacing them is just more functional than internal batteries.3) The keyboard can be noisy when typing really fast as I do. This can be a Positive at times since I utilize more of my hearing when I type and looking for keys by sound and touch rather than sight. Still though they are a loud when I type and can hear them through my headset. This can be distracting when I am playing my FPS and need to concentrate more on the enemy than the key presses.4) The instruction manual is weak and difficult to read. It is much smaller than anticipated and they need to redesign the entire manual without me having to find either a magnifying glass or run to the internet to be able read a simple item as the manual. Also there should be instructions on how to enable keyboard function clearly in the manual as well. It took me awhile to find what I needed online.5) While the keyboard/mouse combo is what I am looking for and what I need I wish there were more functionality with consoles than there is now. This is more of both software and hardware designs and issues. Sony should fully invest in this idea as well as Corsair to both improve the functionality and software/hardware designs to match PC gaming. Consoles are just basic PCs on a smaller scale and design and both Corsair and Sony could benefit from a mutual cooperative narrative when it comes to considering the needs of gamers and how they want to play. This goes to game design companies such Electronic Arts and should follow those games that allow for full keyboard and mouse support.I had been looking into a Logitech brand of gaming peripherals but the price had been a little too steep in what I wanted and didn't have the functional RGB design I was looking for. While Corsair had the RGB design and functionality that is very impressive to me it does lack in the two areas I had expected to be able to utilize when I game. That said though the Corsair K57 keyboard and Harpoon mouse are still superior to the Logitech keyboards and mice in my opinion and has a more pleasing and ergonomic style and design that ultimately made the choice definitive for me. This is someone that has used always preferred and bought Logitech peripherals than anything else.I have looked into other peripherals companies such as Razer but found that either price was above what I could afford or didn't offer the functionality that I was looking for. It boiled down to Logitech and Corsair. In the end Corsair won and Logitech lost.
5,I work from home part time and I wanted a nicer mouse than the one I had. So I got the Harpoon Wireless.  I liked the Bluetooth/dongle combo as it gave me a way to switch between my desktop (low latency dongle) and work laptop (Bluetooth).  Later I applied the same logic when looking for a keyboard upgrade.When I finally had to return to the company office part time the standard mouse keyboard combo drove me insane so I found this bundle that mirrors my equipment from home.In summary the mouse is a bit small but feels good and has pretty good life in the rechargeable battery.  The keyboard does have some flex to the chassis but again feels good with a nice tactile (almost clicky) feedback.  The keyboards rechargeable battery life is really good too if you don't go crazy with the led lighting which looks great BTW.  For my lighting options I used ICue (Corsair's software) to set the keys to glow blue for about 2 sec when I press them (that saves on the battery).As for the Icue software I quite like it. It's a major part of why I buy Corsaor products.  It's easy to use and provides good functionality. I bought headphones which caused me to get Icue.  Because of Icue I opted for rgb ram mouse keyboard and PC enclosure and the software controls it all.  It's official I'm a Corsair fan.
4,The colors are vibrant! The feel is quality! Good amount of time between charges! Only had for a couple of weeks but so far everything seems very possitive!
4,The board itself is amazing those Micro keys are amazing for artworks just program it and you are done it's easy to program it to it just iCUE sucks at times very high quilty except for the armrest the prices that holds it just snapped off after a month. also the lights are amazing sooooo many options for wired and wireless very responsive wireless tech.
1,The keyboard feels ok but its a bit on the cheap side. That's typically not an issue however... The windows key lock on my keyboard appears to function since it turns on the light but when pressing the windows key while in a game my start menu appears so its not actually locking the button like its supposed to. This was one of the first things I noticed and such a simple feature not working really screams "cheap" to me.The biggest downfall to this keyboard is really its sleep mode. The keyboard will go into sleep mode to save battery and will not wake itself up until you press a button. For me I like to use this keyboard wirelessly so I keep the lights off to help extend battery life (I get about 20 hours of battery with no lights even though Corsair claims 35 with RGB lights on). So every now and then unbeknownst to me the keyboard goes into sleep mode. When I try typing again it misses the first several letters I type as its waking up. So if you try to type "Hello World!" you'll only see "orld!" and you'll have to go back and correct what you typed all the while you will not be expecting it so its a real nuisance. I don't think this timer works properly because its set at 15 minutes in iCUE and I've had the keyboard enter sleep mode within a minute on many occasions.Logitech has a similar keyboard that doesn't do this (the G613). Corsair should take note and update this model with a new version that eliminates this headache. Its possible a software fix can accomplish this as well and there's a decent chance a firmware update could fix this too but its hard to say.This is a $100 keyboard that feels more like a $50 keyboard. I do really enjoy my Corsair products I have many including a custom water loop on my desktop PC (I use this keyboard with my laptop) but this product I don't think lives up to what we've come to expect from Corsair. The software isn't fully working with the keyboard the windows lock key doesn't do its job it feels a bit cheap sleep mode takes a second to turn on so you lose what you are typing while that's happening and the color options on the keyboard while not plugged in are a bit on the pathetic side.If this product was $50 i could easily recommend it. At $75 i could recommend it to some people but at $100 i cannot recommend this at all. Get the Logitech G613 instead its significantly better! It just doesnt have any backlighting. If you want backlighting use the money you saved to buy a laptop light that you clip onto your keyboard or buy a wired keyboard. $30 can get you a better keyboard if you go with wired.----------------------------------------------------------Update 3/30/2022I've had the keyboard for a month and earlier today i left a review for it... A few hours later dead... I was playing a game and after something ridiculous happened i held my hands up like "What the?!" and then dropped them on the keyboard like i've done so many times with every keyboard i've ever had... Its my thing i guess!Anyway that broke it... A few keys came off and wouldnt go back on right never seen a keyboard break so easily! I would expect this from one of those cheap chinese brands that also offer a free mouse and the whole thing only costs $25 but this is a $100 keyboard from a very reputable company!I decided to give it a test... Since it was broken i didnt mind breaking it more so i put it under my knee and pulled to see how much force it would take to break the whole thing in half. I think i'd have a harder time with a loaf of bread! This thing snapped with almost no resistance! I'm in utter shock at how badly this thing was built. This is the type of keyboard that corsair paid $10 for the materials and manufacturing costs and is selling it for insane profits because no other reputable keyboard manufacturer is selling a wireless RGB gaming keyboard.Please dont buy this... It might work fine for you if you're gentle but buying this tells Corsair that ripping off its customers with cheap products sold for ridiculously expensive prices is a working formula to make them a ton of money therefor we will continue to get cheap garbage from Corsair. That garbage should be left to the Chinese not a good company like Corsair.Im seriously disappointed in you Corsair this keyboard is bad! I've replaced it with a Logitech keyboard the G613 i mentioned above. The build quality on it is massively superior in every way and its cheaper with no missing characters when typing after the time out. I have the Corsair K95 on my desktop upstairs im considering upgrading that to Logitech as well. I need to investigate more Corsair keyboards before i make that decision because i love my K95 but this K57 is just a kick in the teeth.
4,keyboard works awesome and is exactly what you want in a keyboard but the mouse unfortunately has to be plugged in or the mouse lags across the screen which is very frustrating ..
3,Overall this is a solid keyboard. I'm not a big fan of the very "clicky" mechanical keyboards which is why I went with this style. I like the overall feel and layout. The keys are responsive and I can feel the keys engage but they're relatively quiet compared to a mechanical keyboard. And I like that.Here's my one complaint. I purchased a WIRELESS keyboard. I expect that ALL the features should work when the keyboard is in wireless mode. One of the features that I like in an RGB gaming keyboard is the ability to setup custom lighting effects. Otherwise why bother to spend the money on an RGB keyboard? Unfortunately none of the custom lighting effects work when the keyboard is in wireless mode. Why would I want a wireless RGB keyboard that I have to use in wired mode to get access to all the features? At least one competitor has this part right so it's clearly a solved problem.
5,I like that it keeps my grandson active inside the house and very happy.
4,Overall really happy with my purchase however have a couple issues to be aware of.I bought this product yes to game but also to be functional while I work from home. For gaming I love it could not be happier however for work I have a slight issue. I sometimes type faster then the board can handle and numbers on the num pad are missed. This has happened on numerous occasions and most of the time it's the 8.The second issue I have run into is that one of  the palm rests pins where it connects to the keyboard has broken after only being removed a couple of times. I am by no means rough on the pins however one still broke.I will say I have been in contact with Corsair and am in the process of getting the palm rest replaced with no hassle so A+ to corsair support just wish the palm rest quality was a little better.
5,Been using corsair products for years  this keyboard is of high quality and user freindly  very nice backlighting many options of settings and light patterns  plugged in the usb doggle and the keyboard worked instantly no driver install or pairing up   if you looking for a affordable keyboard that will last go buy this one
4,I bought this as a replacement for a "value" mouse and keyboard when I first built my computer.  I really liked that cordless aspect because I hate having cords run all over my desk.  The problem is the keyboard battery life advertised is certainly not true.  The mouse battery last longer than the keyboard so I am charging about twice a week.  The other thing is at times while gaming the keyboard does not have the best response.  Since I am not a competitive gamer it isn't too much of an issue but if you want something that won't have an input delay I would suggest you look elsewhere.
4,Love that it is lightweight and types smoothly.  Great color change options for the keyboard.  One complaint.  For no known reason the dongle would not detect my keyboard.  It will not stay synched.  I uninstalled all iQ software and reinstalled plus followed a tip on how to force sync the keyboard back to my computer.  Hopeing after turning off my system tonight I won't have to re-synch after each shutdown. Addition:  I did need to force synch one more time. However this morning when it looked like I needed to force synch again I pulled out the dongle and re-inserted it.  It's  possible the iQ software update is causing issues on my comp.  Still recommend this keyboard.
5,This keyboard is amazing and is exactly what I was looking for. Having the wireless capability is great!
5,But also has wired connection to shave off a few more milliseconds.The software is not intuitive though it takes a lot of time to figure out custom downloaded light settings or to make your own
5,I bought this bundle hoping to clean up my desk from all the cables so naturally it made sense to get a bundle that could kill two birds with one stone. I own a ton of Corsair products (this bundle in fact is replacing my 3 year old setup by Corsair) so it's nice to finally upgrade.This is a non-mechanical keyboard so if you're looking for one of those this is not it. Otherwise it's a sleek look and  the battery lasts decently long. I maybe recharge mine once a week.
4,They work flawlessly with icue uninstalled with icue installed every USB device I have drops connection intermittently and the mouse and keyboard stutter like crazy. What I did was set my dpi settings on the mouse through icue and my keyboard settings as well. I then uninstalled icue and it kept the profiles saved on the devices but it won't remember the RGB profile but that can be set by pressing the fn key and 1 through 0 to choose the effects. They've been working great since
5,This is an Awesome keyboard . I did not necessarily need all the lights flashing but I figured out how to turn that off. I really like ergonomic keyboards but they seam very expensive right now. And the keyboard with matching mouse work perfect together. I have to give credit to my son who is a gamer and suggested this set. It is awesome for my everyday work and a little dad game tine now and again. Lol
5,I have been using it on regular basis 40 Hours a week for the past 6-7 months.  Working great so far! Very happy for my purchase.
3,Only a year old and with very light use already having key registration drops and left click mouse drops. Can’t imagine this would hold up if I used it consistently of for any real fam g situation
5,The keyboard and mouse came fully charged (only had to charge the mouse once in well over a week of use). Both came clean undamaged and with all chargers working. I can’t count how many times I added and removed this set from my cart but I was SO happy that I finally pulled the trigger on it. No buyer’s remorse here! If it ever breaks I don’t think I could go back to anything less that a similar model. It’s an essential now.
4,I do not have experience with mechanical keyboards but for the past 20 years I generally used higher end membrane ones. I used it for office work and gaming but not competitive FPS stuff.Pros:1. Key press feel is superb. Just enough force not to make it tiring. Very tight as in not wobbly at all. Just love typing or gaming on this.2. Long battery life with backlight on. You can probably go a week or so without recharges. Definitely better than the few other backlit wireless keyboards out there.3. Quiet keys. Quiet enough not to be heard on a speakerphone conference.4. Solid construction. There is no flex to it and it feels very well made.5. Bright backlight.6. It's designed in a way that will not trap crumbs other trash below the key caps.Cons.1. It loses the first key press when waking up from sleep. This is very annoying and TBH a stone age level in keyboards of this price. Logitech figured out how to preserve the first key press on wake somewhere in mid 2000s and I have no name $20 boards from Ali Express that don't have this problem.2. The extra macro key row can be disruptive if you are not used to it. I keep pressing the top macro key instead of Esc all the time. This is a matter of personal preference but I'd have preferred a traditional layout.Overall for the price if you are not a mechanical switch snob I think this is a very good keyboard. I was able to kind of get used to the macro keys getting in the way. However I am just not willing to put up with lost key presses in any keyboard much less in one that is pushing $100. I really wanted to love it but will be returning it because of this issue. If you think this will not bother you (as in you type non stop for hours so waking up frequently is not an issue) you should definitely consider it.
4,I'm a software engineer so I spend more time using a keyboard than any human should have to. I recently bought this keyboard because I built a new system. The one I had felt like I was putting hub caps on a Maserati.Key features: - It's programmable. You can create macros to automate tasks you do repetitively. - Awesome 'snap'. My nerd homies out there will know what I'm talking about here. The keyboard is solid and the  keys have a good 'snap back' feel as you type.- Profiles. You can change the LED settings (I used an above mentioned macro). This is handy for night /vs day  etc..- It's wireless.Other bonus features:- It looks neat. I find the animations a bit much when I'm working but it's sorta cool and people always ask me  about it.- The software to configure it is pretty easy on Windows although I only use Win when I have to.Complaints - Minor. I find you have to wake the thing up by pressing a key when the system boots or in my case switch  output with KVM switch or USB switch. Not a big deal.-  Bigger deal for me and the reason I didn't go 5 start there isn't any official Linux support (that I know of).  There are however some open source projects that allow you to gain some of the same functionality you find  on Windows. I get that Windows has the market share when it comes to gamers and I suspect that's why Corsair  doesn't provide native Linux drivers. Disappointing for us Linux users but like with a lot of things in Linux we  work around it or build our own.
3,PROS: Custom Colors; Choose Brightness; Multiple Color Schemes; Individual Key Colors; Battery Life; Response Time; Battery Life in Windows System Tray; Typing ComfortCONS: Micro USB; Must be plugged into your computer via the charge cable to take full advantage of individual custom key colors (huge negative for me as this is supposed to be a wireless keyboard)Details below.Overall this keyboard is great and I would highly recommend it. This keyboard is comfortable to type with and I love that it can double as a typing keyboard. I'm a casual gamer that hasn't taken advantage of the macro functionality but I enjoy that you can choose any color brightness and lighting style that's available with the software. The battery life is pretty amazing - I only use the dimmest of the brightness settings single solid color - and I can game for a week or so without needing a recharge (sessions range from 4 to 10 hours). The response time for me isn't any different than a wired keyboard which is a welcome surprise. It's cool that you can see the battery life of the keyboard in the windows task tray. Probably the COOLEST part is that you can assign custom colors to ANY keys on the board through the software while the keyboard is connected. Want WASD keys lit up a different color? Sure. Want the J F2 and num pad 5 keys different colors? Absolutely. And you can save profiles for each one meaning you can create custom lighting schemes for each game you play. Only caveat is that you have to have the board connected to the computer via the charge cable (Really guys? On a wireless gaming keyboard?)Reason for three stars overall - I have two issues with this product directly related to the way it's advertised and its price point. This product is titled as a gaming keyboard costs up near $100 and isn't truly mechanical. I was hoping they'd go USB-C with this as it's becoming a standard and is easy to use but they're still on Micro USB.  It still works of course but I feel it's an unnecessary downgrade at this price. My biggest issue (and some might call me crazy) is that in order to take advantage of the full custom key lighting you MUST have your keyboard plugged into your computer. I verified this by submitting a ticket to the company's support team and they confirmed it has to be plugged in. Huge letdown considering this is supposed to be a wireless device for gaming and you would want custom lit keys for that purpose. If they manage to make changes with a future firmware/software update I'll easily switch this to 5 stars. Don't be lazy with your higher end products.
3,Mouse takes forever to charge sometimes it doesn't charge and you can't tell the charge percentage. I prefer my razer for charging looks ergonomics everything.
4,Wireless gaming keyboards where to start? This appealed to me for a very specific reason and purpose and I will admit it is not for everyone. But what I can say is for the price this is a solid board if you can get past using membranes. There isn't much competition in this space from the big box brands until you start spending $200+ for a high quality mechanical board and even then you're options are generally limited to maybe 3 high end boards right now one of which is low profile.This is pretty much what you would expect from a membrane board the keys have that tactile response when you get over the hump but they bottom out into complete mush which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It really depends on what your requirements are for a board. For me I am okay with it for now until a wireless board from Corsair comes out with MX Browns on them for the office setup. RGB is nice and bright battery life is fantastic we have macro keys and well every feature you could want on a gaming board honestly. Build quality feels like it's the price I paid for it at around $75. Would I pay full price for this board at $100? Reluctantly yes for my specific purposes. If I didn't need a Corsair specific full sized wireless gaming keyboard then I would have chosen the Coresair wireless TKL or the K95 Platinum XT.The short: Solid keyboard if it fits your use case. Would I buy it as my primary gaming board? No there are to many better options out there for cheaper. If you're hooked on the Corsair eco-system then I would suggest looking into one of their mechanicals. But if you absolutely need a full sized WIRELESS RGB Gaming keyboard from Corsair? This is your only option at the moment.
5,Esta chido para gaming.
5,It was hard to find a wireless keyboard with macro keys and numpad that doesn't have a 2 inch wrist rest built in.  Luckily I came across this and it's pretty much exactly what I was looking for.  It's a standard size so you don't have to worry about it taking up half your desk or anything.  Nearly every key is rebindable so you can have even more macro keys than just the 6 on the side.  While not mechanical the keys do have a nice tactile feel to them.  Has a total of 4 connection types (Receiver Bluetooth1 Bluetooth2 and wired micro USB) so you have many ways to connect it to your devices.The only two small downsides for me are that it runs off an internal rechargeable battery instead of replaceable batteries and (as someone else has stated) some of the lighting features require more direct connections with your PC.  For example you can change to any of the preset RGB patterns while connected over Bluetooth but you can't customize the colors at all.  You need to connect with included wireless receiver dongle or be wired through USB for that.  But even then with wireless receiver you can't customize individual key colors; you have to be connected via USB for that.  These aren't major flaws but they are worth knowing about before hand if you have a specific scenario in mind.Overall it's a keyboard that's comfortable with great functionality for mixed use that won't kill your wallet.
5,I've been using this for a while now. Feels good with a fast response.
4,Works great and the lights look good. My only gripe is that the mouse looses connection briefly from time to time.
4,In my review of the Corsair Ironclaw mouse I gave my reason for using wireless it that I can run two devices from one USB port through the dongle they use. Since the Ironclaw died and the iCue application is geared more for wired devices than wireless devices I decided not to see if another Corsair wireless mouse would work. I am not even sure it is possible to pair two wireless devices to one dongle using iCue. But I digress. I would like to write a glowing review of this keyboard. It seems to have a solid build. and though the keys are not mechanical they had a good feel operated smoothly and were quiet. It is a lot easier to figure out since a keyboard is a keyboard. You just need to know what special features it has. This one had dedicated media controls volume mute play pause which is one of the reasons I chose it. I hate having to press fn+ a function key just to change volume. And I am a sucker for the changing rgb back lighting. Not necessarily evidence of quality but I like color. It has 6 macro keys on the side but no indication on how to program them other than that is done through the mysterious impenetrable iCue application. In fact from my brief exposure I have found the iCue application to be a hindrance for Corsair's wireless devices. I gave it a 4 mostly because I had only a little time using it. If I was able to figure out how to unpair a device from a dongle and to pair two devices to one dongle I would likely give it a 5.
5,Don’t know why people are hating on the keyboard. Membrane or not. I’ve had this for 3 years and nothing has happened. No failures or bad keys. Everything works as it should and it’s not annoying. for whatever reason having a super loud and annoying keyboard is an aesthetic that is completely necessary in pc culture. Dumb. I haven’t gotten wireless to work but I don’t really care about that. Just adds latency anyways.Would recommend.
1,I recently bought a new computer and with it a new set of peripherals. I had previously disliked using multiple software programs to manage my devices and so I decided to purchase all my devices through one company. I also wanted to transition to wireless so that was important too. I decided to exclusively buy Corsair products as I had perceived them in the past to be a sort-of luxury brand. In the end I bought the “MM30” mouse pad the “K63” wireless keyboard the “Harpoon RGB” wireless mouse and the “HS70” wireless headset. Within a few days I began to experience issues. The K57 frequently lost connection and my Harpoon mouse constantly registered one click as two. Because I specifically set out to find a wireless mechanical ten-keyless keyboard I was initially ecstatic to find out that Corsair seemed to make the only one – so I later decided to return my broken K63 for the same model. The same can be said of the Harpoon which fit perfectly in my hand. I received new keyboard and mouse not too long after only to encounter the same set of performance issues. For my second attempt I decided to trade my K63 for the K57. The K57 has so far worked out great although I’m still very disappointed that I could get my wireless mechanical ten-keyless K63 to work properly. My Harpoon on the other hand happened to be just outside Amazon’s return window and so I was forced to seek assistance through Corsair directly. After several weeks of waiting for responses being asked the same questions over and over and feeling a profound sense of disappointment for my purchase decisions I lost my patience and called Corsair’s phone service line. Luckily I was helped quickly and effectively over the phone and although I was asked to pay the shipping costs myself I found myself relieved that my new mouse would be mailed in no time. I was being sent the Ironclaw a more expensive (albeit bigger) model of wireless mouse. When I received my THIRD mouse I was initially shocked to find that the rubber portion of the palm rest seemed to be loose. I forgot about said issue in due time and was more or less satisfied. But then the unthinkable happened - my Ironclaw lost the ability to charge! I was absolutely stunned. The port on the mouse appears to be loose and no cable seems to fit correctly. For what I hoped was the last time I called Corsair and reported the issue. Long story short i repeated the shipping process (they covered the shipping costs this time) and received my new Ironclaw after what i remember to be two weeks or so. The new Ironclaw is fine although if it's used for too long it begins to act funny. It also constantly interferes with my other corsair devices and so i must separate them as much as possible. Here's the latest update: my 57 Keyboard is apparentlypossessed by the devil. On occasions that occur more and more often as the days pass my k57 will do the most unholiest of deeds. It types and on its own loses connection briefly but repeatedly and just all around acts completely insane whenever it wants to. This unfortunately is not a minor issue. The computer itself will often become unusable as a result of the keyboard. It's absolutely inconceivable that this could happen again!!!So after all of this I am at a loss for words. I will not being trading my keyboard for another. I am completely and utterly defeated. I can’t express to you enough my profound sense of disappointment. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t waste anymore time. I can't talk to another agent. I can't wait for another keyboard to arrive.I will just move on. I would be insane to peruse this  further.To sum up don't buy Corsair peripherals. I can't speak to the quality of their internal components but i am without a doubt confident in saying that everything else  they sell is just a scam.
5,let me start off with this It is NOT mechanical.That said it is a very solid keyboard I like the fact that it is Bluetooth. I would not Bluetooth for gaming. I use it primarily for writing on my laptop It is very nice. It primarily allows me to free up much-needed USB ports. As a writer (moderate to heavy use.) it is very nice to write on not as clicky as a mechanical keyboard but it sounds nice and feels very well when typing. I forgot how good a nice keyboard feels.The thing I probably like the most is it is very solid. It flexes a little but far less than my $40 Logitech keyboard.the second thing I like about it is its battery life it is really nice. I got it on 12/29 I charged it and its 1/7 and it's still at 49%. I am guessing that the battery life rating is for constant use. It is a huge perk. I use RGB setting 5 which is the keys light up after being pressed.  It isn't the most RBG but I use it on the brightest setting.The thing I am mixed about. Is the keyboard goes to stand by mode. It takes a few seconds to wake up. depending on your typing speed I'd say 4-10 keystrokes. It saves on the battery I just wish it woke up faster.The big drawback is that fully customizable RGB settings only work when it is plugged in which doesn't work for me while I am in bed the main reason I got it.I can't tell you how the lightspeed adapter works but I am sure it is fine because it is a corsair product.Five Stars hands down definitely recommend.
4,There’s a slight issue with it where the Bluetooth will sometimes cut out and not be accurate or responsive to where you’re moving the mouse. I purchased this for work purposes because I prefer the feel of a gaming keyboard and it serves it’s purpose great. I personally would never use a wireless keyboard and mouse for gaming since connectivity issues could always be likely.If you are looking for a gaming keyboard that is wireless I say go ahead and give this a try at least. The feel of the keyboard is on par with every top gaming keyboard out there.
5,It’s so good I have two of them.  One for work and one for home.  Corsair is absolutely top notch.  Software is perfect.  Always connects.  And the battery life is out of this world.  I may have to charge maybe once a week if that.
5,Pro: I've been using this keyboard for a couple of months and it is making me ask myself whether it is possible for switches to be better than popular mechanical switches? It *looks* like a mechanical keyboard. The switches are tall and blocky and widely separated like the old IBM keyboards that inspired the current trend of mechanical keyboards.The switch action is linear; not clicky. They have long travel and you *can* hear them although they are quiet. The keystroke is stiff enough that you have to apply distinct pressure in order to activate the key and the key activates reliably when the threshold is overcome.For me the experience is overall more satisfying than brown switches (my favorites of mechanical switches).Pro: The backlighting is terrific once you read the manual and override the default settings. Press Fn+0 until you get the color that you want (I chose light blue) and press the brightness key until you get minimum (for longest battery life). The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard sleeps if you don't use it for ten minutes which is long enough to not be annoying.A Pro That May Also Be A Con?: The only thing that I have had trouble adapting to is the programmable macro "G" keys on the left side. These are a handy feature if you want/need them but my fingers simply are not accustomed to finding the corrects keys on this keyboard. Maybe custom caps for WASD keys might help?EDIT: After using for a few weeks my fingers find the right keys quickly.
5,This keyboard is amazing for gaming and for programming! I received it in the mail on April 10th gave it a full charge that day disconnected it and I havent had to charge it or gotten a low battery notification until today. It is May 28th.... Amazing battery life
5,For overall feel this keyboard is great. I have a lot of corsair stuff so it works well with icue and is easy to control. They keys give you that mechanical feel but aren't too loud. I accidentally dropped the keyboard in the first week and the wrist attachment broke off. I just sits there now but isn't attached anymore so be gentle with it (the little prongs broke that attach it to the keyboard). The only thing I truly dislike with this keyboard is the input delay when you first touch a key. I googled it and it's not something you can turn off. For instance when I start my computer I type in a pin. The first key input I make is waking up the keyboard and doesn't count. I have to type twice. If I'm watching Netflix and want to pause the first time I hit the space bar doesnt register I have to hit it a second time. I've started typing having been idle for a minute or so and it doesn't pick up the first few words. It's a really annoying feature. I'm sure it saves battery etc. but I wish I could at least toggle it as an option and decide for myself. Next time around I'll probably go logitech instead just for that feature alone. It is very irritating.
5,I've bought quite a few different setups looking for something comfy. This is perfect. Nice charging cables come with the setup for when batteries get low.
3,If you plan to use this keyboard on a single computer and have the software running all the time then this review may not apply to you.The K57 isn't too bad for a wireless keyboard at the basic level but any of the special listed features are held back by the software.  I use the keyboard on a KVM and wanted to make sure I could store macros in the keyboard memory which can be done via the MR + G keys on the keyboard.  However the instructions for iCUE software says you must connect the keyboard via USB to push macros to the keyboard memory but that never worked.  When I did manually set the G keys via MR+G on the keyboard the iCUE software would just wipe them out of memory each time I rebooted and the software started.Additionally the keyboard I got has a few defective LED's and they always have different colors from the other LEDs which is not that noticeable with the default rainbow swirling pattern but with static colors they really stick out.  Since I’m not running the lights at all mostly because the rainbow pattern can't be permanently change I guess I don’t care about bad lights.Pros:* Fairly Quiet compared to mechanical keyboards* Keys feel responsive to me* G keys can be set directly on the keyboard and stored in memory without softwareCons:* Software is still buggy and wipes keyboard memory on startup* Keyboard lighting profile doesn't want to stick even when set in the software (guess it gets wiped as well)* Unlike the G keys there is no manual way to control the lighting without the software running* Bad LEDs* This happens rarely but I have noticed some dropped keystrokes when I’m typing at around 50-60 wpm and my wireless Logitech never had that issue so I don’t think it is distance to receiver.I may yet return this keyboard and I for sure will not be replacing my current mouse with theirs.
3,Enjoyed the product for about 2 months with light use. Not much of a gamer. Then randomly the shift and control keys on BOTH sides stopped sending input to my computer. Cleaned the keyboard. Reset drivers. Nothing worked. I’m tired. Back to old fashion keyboards I guess. Mouse is great though.
4,Why on earth would you bother to make a keyboard with individually back lit keys and then NOT back light the media keys!!!!!!! WHYYY!!!!UGGG!!!!Very irritating.Such a nice keyboard. The keys feel nice. Tactile but quiet. The software is nice and also lets me control the lighting in the PC as it recognized the mobo.Almost willing to send the keyboard back for not having the media keys backlit. I'm just lazy and it will do.
5,I got this in tandem with a new RGB wireless mouse to update my gaming setup and it is great! I have been using a Logitech wireless keyboard mouse combo for years and I love it but I wanted something with the RGB feature and specifically the dedicated media buttons. It compliments my gaming PC and new mouse very well.I love the feel of the keys. It isn't mechanical but I actually prefer a quieter keyboard. The lighting effects are great. There are 10 different preset ones with an option to turn them off entirely along with brightness adjustment. These can also be customized to adjust the speed duration and direction of the patterns. It is also rechargeable which is a nice feature. I like that it comes with a wrist rest although it isn't quite as "rubbery" as I was expecting but it is still comfortable. The programmable macro keys are a nice touch too. I haven't used them yet but I think they will be pretty useful for gaming. The keys are raised too so they should be easier to clean under.I have bought Corsair products before and they have yet to disappoint. So after spending hours browsing on here I opted to go with this one and I am definitely happy I did! Great product!
4,very useful
3,This is generally a decent keyboard with a couple of exceptions. I was hoping since it's a gaming keyboard that more keys could be programmed for macros and whatnot. Also since I use this for audio/video editing in a darkened room that individual keys could be color coded but it's all one color or none.On the downside the charging/USB port is poor quality. I began having troubles with it about 6 months after purchase where you had to have it juuust right or it wouldn't charge. Now it's gotten so bad that I have to put some weight on it just to get it to charge at all -- including and especially getting it juuuuust right. Worse still it says it's been charged but overnight I come back and unplug and it's still at red level. Nada. No charge at all.I expect the port to die on me at any time and will need to order a new one of these. They should last much longer than 16 months.
5,Just what I needed.  Unfortunately the reception of the wireless is not what I expected but works great at my workstation. (Not the recliner though)Still loving it...
4,Great Keyboard HOWEVER they do not tell you anywhere that the custom RGB lighting ONLY works when PLUGGED INTO the USB port. As soon as you use wireless mode the only options you have for backlighting the keys are the basic ones they have pre-programmed into the memory (Rainbow One Solid Color Pulsing etc). Completely defeats the purpose of it being advertised as “Custom RGB Wireless” huh? Other than that the G-Keys are a little weird at the left edge (I’m so used to that edge being Esc down to Left Control) but I’m sure I’ll get used to that in time. The keys are very silent while still having that Mechanical look (they are NOT Mechanical clicky keys just to clarify) which is exactly what I wanted. The Corsair iCUE software is relatively easy to navigate once you download it. Overall it’s a great gaming keyboard I just wish custom lighting profiles worked during wireless mode and if not at least be sure to mention that somewhere on the website/description so as not to seemingly false advertise.
5,My keyboard that i originally had crapped out on me so i decided to invest in a good one. my buddy found this one and sent it to me and i have no regrets on buying it. the color customization is probably my favorite part. i've seen multiple reviews that say you have to have it plugged in to use the customization on it but i did mine wireless and it works completely fine. overall its a very nice keyboard. the keys are smooth and aren't too loud and obnoxious like most gaming keyboards. 10/10 highly recommend.
5,I have two K95 models of this keyboard and bought this one for a friend who was tired of replacing non-functioning $20 keyboards. She loves this just like I love mine. What a difference it makes in your computer usage.
3,Keyboard:Keyboard works wellShortcut keys backlighting responsiveness are all greatHolds a charge wellBoth dongle and wired connection work without issueMouse:It worked from purchase until the first week of March.It still lights upIt doesn't work via cable wireless or dongleWhen it was working it was great and being able to change the response speeds was great.
5,I don't always write product reviews but I thought it would be very important to write this one.  I bought this keyboard the other day.  I was a little uncertain that it would work on my Mac OS X computer since the documentation was not clear about this in the product description and it was a little unclear in the question and answer section as well.  It worked perfectly on my computer.  I connected to it at first using the bluetooth connection.  Then I tried USB and the USB wireless dongle.  It worked well under all of them though of course it wasn't configured so the macro buttons did nothing yet.  Then I decided to see if I could get the software to control it to work.  I found that on the corsair website they have the Mac OS X version of their software on there and it works very well.  I have very much enjoyed playing around with the colors and the macro buttons.  I highly recommend it.  Oh and the keyboard is pretty great for typing too it has a great feel. . . ;-).
4,I like that the keys are pushed out a little bit an more substantial when I press each key.What I do not like I so far do not have anything negative to say about this product. I will have to wait until at min. 90 days having passed or a year having passed.
2,I need a combo for my personal laptop and my work from home laptop. The mouse is dreadfully slow unless you install the software and I cannot install it on my work laptop. I also found the extra row of keys on the left of the key board to get in the way.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this keyboard. I wanted a wireless and clean setup and it suits my needs just fine.Updated: 4-27-21After buying 2 of these keyboards one for myself and one for my girlfriend. We used these for over a year. My keyboard for daily use gaming and working was interesting. By that I mean my keys were pretty stiff and while writing emails or documents some of the key strokes would get stuck.My girlfriends keyboard worked flawless and never missed any key strokes.I recently purchased the k100 which is a $200+ keyboard (make sure to get it on sale).It’s night and day difference between the k57.The k100 is incredibly sensitive and does not take any pressure to register your keystrokes while the k57 really wants you to push the buttons down harder.The noise level on the k57 is minimal compared to the k100.For an entry level keyboard the k57 is a good starting point just make sure to test out the keystrokes when working.If you have a higher budget I’d recommend Razers keyboards or higher tier Corsair keyboards.
3,I love the look and feel of the keyboard; the ability to program the color patterns is really great... though you can only fully use that function while it is plugged in because the ICue software doesn't seem to recognize the device at all when it's in bluetooth mode and only functions partially in wireless mode as you can only pick a single preset pattern and can't program more elaborate ones. When plugged in you can make complex displays with one preset leading into another and then another ect and make new patterns of your own. I don't understand why that functionality disappears when the keyboard is in wireless mode nor why the entire device vanishes from iCue altogether when in bluetooth mode. That said it is pretty easy to change between modes though changes made while in wired mode go away as soon as you switch to the other modes.My only other gripe is that despite looking like mechanical switches the keycaps are not Cherry MX and the keyboard is not compatible with Corsair's own custom keycaps so I can't find any keycaps that work with it at all.If Corsair would fix iCue to work in all modes and offer compatible gaming keycaps for it I'd give it a 5 star rating.
5,Pretty good wish Icue was on XboxIf you want rgb and wireless this is the way to go. Having a blast
4,This is one of the best keyboards I have had.  I don't use it for gaming.  The full travel keys and tactile and audio feedback are great.  The keyboard has a multitude of lights that may be fun for gamers but unused by myself.  Battery life is excellent and fair warning is given when the batteries need recharging.One little annoying thing is the keyboard "shuts down" after some time of non use (to save battery life).  Thus when one returns to the computer the first key hit turns the keyboard on and may be missed.  It is something to check when you return to the computer after a while.  With that exception it is a great keyboard.
5,One of the best wireless keyboard And mouse I've had so far
5,I got this gaming keyboard as my first ever gaming keyboard and it has never stopped working. I only switched for this to a 60% because I wanted a larger work desk area as well as more clicks keys. The keys in this keyboard (the one I’m writing the review for) does not have very clicks keys at all but they do the trick and will not make you a “bad” gamer. Everyone starts somewhere and this is not a bad option at all. Try to get one on sale or a newer model.
5,The keyboard and mouse combo is a great way to increase productivity in the office while at the same time also amazing to utilize it for gaming. The option to have the set wired or wireless also allows for better accessibility and productivity.
4,Amazon sent me a Spanish one and it said I have to pay for shipping if I want to return it. The keyboard feels nice though.
5,Nice clicky keys and bright lights!
2,It's a nice keyboard but the charging port is poorly soldered. Mine started to get loose pretty early on and finally broke. Since the battery is internal there's now way to use AAs or any other battery. So now it's an expensive paper weight. I'm going back to Logitech.
4,Very bright and responsive. Came a week early and I'm very happy about that. The only downside i have is that while it did come early packaging suffered. The box was damaged but luckily the keyboard itself wasn't. There is also an update for the firmware of the keyboard and I can't update it and without the update I have to restart my PC for it to work again. There are also times where the keyboard will get disconnected for a short time both on the web and in game and it gets rather annoying. This keyboard did come with a cable to make it wired so that's an easy fix. 8.5/10 I recommend this.
4,Okay I'll say it right off the keyboard itself isn't bad. My main gripes are battery life and the wireless.It tears through the battery life even on the lowest brighteness.  After charging overnight about 8 hours it burns through the battery in a about 3 or 4 hours.Wireless is okay mostly but at this time every single Corsair device requires a separate dongle.  Don't expect anything like Logitech's Unifying receivers...yet.  They are working on a universal solution but at the moment it is very buggy and requires a dongle like the one that comes with the Virtuoso headset.Corsair make great products but I just cannot recommend this wireless keyboard.
4,Would be five stars but the software won’t sync with my Corsair PC. IT is stand alone. No light link capacity. Hopefully they fix this soon. MAYBE this was intentional but the keyboard also lacks a lot of lighting effects that the other parts of my pc have. Such as light stacking. Rotary. Equalizer.I have4z Corsair Dominator Platinums1x Corsair H100icue1x Corsair RGB Wireless Mouse with icue1x Corsair EGB wireless keyboard with icueEverything links up except this keyboard. Sooooooo what’s up with that?
2,I bought this because Corsair has a reputation for making quality products but this is simply not such product. The first set I bought broke after a month with some keys typing inputs when other keys were pressed. I was sent a new one about 2 months ago which does not accept firmware updates. All troubleshooting methods were followed per Corsair but it still does not do what it should. I'll ride this out until it is no longer functional and look for another manufacture to purchase equipment from.
5,Great for gaming but it's a little on the expensive side
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just got this keyboard and now I’m 1hr in. Will say the keys are a bit big but you get used to it. Was extremely easy to connect to my PC In a matter of seconds. Love that you can adjust the brightness on the LED. It is a bit clicky when you type so I wouldn’t say this is quiet but it doesn’t bother anyone. I already got compliments around the office so that’s a plus. I’ve tested this working in the dark with minimum lights and my god...... this keyboard is magnificent lol absolutely love this keyboard and would definitely recommend to people.
5,Great starter kit with good battery life for a valuable price.
2,This is the worst wireless experience I've ever had with a PC component... The keyboard is constantly missing key strokes freezing up or putting multiplying one keystroke by 20. Also I bought this in March and already 3 months later the space bar is junk and wobbles to where you have it hit it precisely in the middle to detect the keystroke. I have no complaints about the RGB functions.
5,Solid keyboard. So far the only knock I (and everyone else) have is the price. I swallowed my pride for the sake of streamlining all my perifs through iCue.The keys feel great the brightness is great and the battery lasted almost two weeks before needing to be recharged - most of this might have to do with me turning it off when I'm not using it.I would've liked it to be mechanical but the feel is a nice in-between of a standard feel and a mech feel.Glad I bought this and will buy another once this ultimately dies. Unless it dies within the next year or two.
1,Purchased this for my Steam Deck and when the box arrived it was late. Upon opening the box the original packing had some damage on it and a sticker that this was a refurbished keyboard.Great.. but ok.Keyboard and Mouse are missing the Wireless DongleKeyboard only has one standing leg (missing)The keyboard works if it's plugged in but I purchased this specifically because it was wireless and now I have to go through the Return Process taking time out of my day to pack it up drop it off at a UPS store and wait for it to be received to get my replacement/refund sent.Such a disappointment.
5,Works great good battery life and the RGB is very helpful for office work shortcuts
3,Everything works as expected.  Downloaded and installed the iCUE software.  Installed the latest firmware. It feels and looks great but the DPI button on the mouse is unresponsive.  Would give it five stars if the mouse wasn't defective.
5,So first things first i used this keyboard for typing only. i have it connected to my laptop & my xbox. Thats the best thing about this keyboard! i can easily switch between the two at a click of a button. the keys feel great its not a mechanical keyboard but if thats what your looking for then you should customize your own & its ganna be more expensive then this. but if your looking for a clean wireless RGB keyboard that wont break the bank then i believe this is the best one out there. its worth the price by far in my opinion. the LED are bright and its got different modes. the more i use this keyboard the more i love it.
4,Battery life like whoa with no lights on. Battery drains the more lights that you have going constantly. Comes with a charging wire that I just keep plugged into a USB outlit with my other computer equipment. The typing is smooth. Extra buttons for stop and playback as well as volume. But not to much more special about it. It comes with a plastic removable wrist guard. Its a hard plastic so I recommend the usual gel wrist guard. Would buy again as its within price range had the effects I was looking for. Types nicely.
1,For whatever reason on the middle part of the keyboard so letters “u I b n m” you can only press 2 at a time. Everywhere else you can press like up to 8 keys but not here. Insanely frustrating being a fast typer. For $80?? Yeah I’m going to be shopping for a replacement. Colors and patterns are beautiful but how are you going to make a terrible keyboard? That’s it’s ONLY function! What’s more frustrating is learning about this new term “anti-ghosting” and seeing every thread online say “don’t buy a crappy keyboard and you won’t deal with this issue.” Well I guess this is a crappy keyboard.I’ll add that I reached out directly to Corsair to confirm that the keyboard limits were accurate and not a defect and the solution ladies and gentlemen get this. TYPE SLOWER. I type 70wpm and the solution for this KEYBOARD is to type slower. Garbage dump keyboard.Another series of issues is one key will be pressed and it will act like it’s being held which happens at least once a day and requires you to have to turn it off and on at least 3 times for it to stop. Then it will randomly not detect any input or even lose connection to the USB altogether. It’s baffling to have a $15 wireless keyboard from Target able to work fine for over 2 years better than this “high end” keyboard which I’ve had for merely 2 weeks
5,I been using it for a week and at first it was not working right but the manual doesn't not say what you need to download the corsair ICUE once you download it everything work so for people having problemsDownload the ICUE softwareUpdate the dongle and appOn the App you can change color and way lighting works no need to be on cable make a profile for wire and wirelesscharge it until fullmake sure that you dont have a Logitech device close to it and you should be okother then that the keyboard is good its not mechanical but for people that want to sit to couch and have a good time go a head very happy
3,The K57 RGB Wireless is a beautiful keyboard with many useful features but it's dongle failure issue is a huge negative to the product. My dongle suddenly stopped working and I haven't been able to get it to reconnect; I am not the only one affected by this issue. For users without onboard blue tooth they are wasting their money on this keyboard. Fortunately my motherboard has on-board blue tooth so I can still connect to the keyboard wireless. People looking to buy this wireless keyboard should be aware there is a chance for the wireless dongle to malfunction.Another thing about the keyboard - You can customize your RGB light effects with iCue by layering them on top of each other. Unfortunately only 1 RGB light effect works on wireless mode.
4,I have had this product for over a year and I'm very happy with it. I have a noticed a little loss in battery life. But it still lasts me about a month with lights on all the time.
5,I really like this keyboard. The tactile feel of the keys has just enough resistance the LEDs are bright.  The only downside is that you can't use dynamic scenes via the iCUE software when the keyboard is in wireless mode however this is easily worked around by plugging in the charging cable.  It takes away the point of the wireless keyboard so that's why I took a star off of my review.
5,I love this keyboard.  The colors are very bright.  You can adjust the brightness as well but I always leave it on full brightness.  So far I have had this keyboard for a a few weeks.  The charge lasts me about 4 days before I have to charge it again.  After about 10 minutes of you not using it it automatically turns off by itself.  One thing I did notice was that I never turned it off.  There is a button to turn it off to save the battery.  Every since I started doing that I noticed that the charge lasts a bit longer.  Overall I love it :)
4,Nothing bad to say. It really is meaty it doesn’t feel cheap or weak. The only thing is that I wish it could sync with my computer via ICUE but it only has 5 or 6 light settings. But I knew that when I bought it. Definitely recommend it.
5,the mouse and keyboard work great and has made gaming on my laptop so much more fun
3,I bought this based on the dimensions in the details of the listing. It is not 12.09 inches long. It is actually 19" long. (18"and 15/16ths to be exact).
5,im on my first pc build ever and this keyboard/ mouse combo is absolutely gorgeous. you can program all the leds in the icue program and set up to 5 different mouse speed.my only complaint is that the button to change the mouse speed on the fly is in a position where most ppl will always hit it.
5,Love the keyboard.  Quiet bright and can be used wireless or usb for the most part.  Haven't had any problems and have had it over a year.
5,I'm a network engineer at a local ISP. I bought this keyboard on a whim because I knew I liked Corsair keyboards and simply wanted a wireless one at work because I hate wires!Fast forward a month to isolation at home:The macro functions on this have been a life saver. We're being inundated with orders related directly to Covid. I'm using all six macro buttons for different repetitive tasks. This saves me literally tens of thousands of types a day.It's also great I can use BT to connect to my work laptop and click a button to slide over to my home PC.Thanks Corsair!
1,Within 6-8 months this keyboard had stopped working wirelessly altogether and even when I had it plugged in it never lit up except for three flashing lights on top of the keyboard. I tried the whole "press ESC" thing to try and reset it and it never worked.I tried updating the software for it and it never successfully updated either!The connection between the cord and the keyboard was awful too. The part that is supposed to go into the slot on the keyboard was too small and unstable and would slip out of the slot constantly which would disconnect my keyboard from my computer since it doesn't work wirelessly.It also says that it can last for so many hours wirelessly without charging but when it did actually work wirelessly in the beginning it never lasted very long without having to plug it back in to recharge it. It also would randomly turn on in the middle of the night even after sending my computer to sleep.Here's a hint that a product is crap: when you search about an issue you're having with the product and there are THOUSANDS of results from other people also having the same or similar issues. This product is apparently riddled with problems because I was not alone in trying to figure out why it stopped working properly within months of purchasing it.What an absolute disappointment and a waste of money. I'm typing this review on a much cheaper and easier to use keyboard that has lasted for years and has never given me issues.Save your money and DO NOT BUY this keyboard!
4,I love the keyboard in most ways but the one thing that makes me kinda hate it is that i cannot individually color each button to my liking. I was hoping to color my F buttons 1 color while making my number keys another and my WASD keys another but you cant with this keyboard for some reason so that's why im not 100% satisfied with the price of $80
1,It's pretty but the mouse had all manner of connection issues. 2.4Ghz worked occasionally but Bluetooth was completely useless. Constant stuttering. I manually turned both the mouse and keyboard off when I shut down my pc but still the battery life was terrible. 1-2 hours of use and the mouse would be at half power. Another thing to note is the charger for the mouse is a proprietary cable so if you do get this be aware of that. The wrist support is cheap hard plastic and isn't easy to take on and of. I have a ton of Corsair gear and all of it is awesome except this set. I would definitely pass on this one.
4,Overall great keyboard but gave 4/5 because the iCue RGB software for Corsair products only works on this when it is directly plugged in which is kind of redundant when it’s a wireless keyboard unlike other wireless Corsair products that the iCue still works.
2,The slipstream technology is pure garbage.  This as advertised as a gaming keyboard but it's solely because of the RGB colors not performance.  Far too many lost keystrokes to be any good for games that require hitting keys somewhat frequently.It looks pretty it feels nice it's just a bad keyboard.  If you want to use this keyboard for any level of fast paced games you'll be unhappy.  I used it for less than a day before I realized it was a significant downgrade from my old Logitech G105 and already processed the return.
4,Using split stream with another Corsair product made the keyboard and mouse act very weird
3,I really needed a keyboard to work in the dark and I really liked the idea of having control over the color of the lighted keys. I also liked how quiet the keystrokes were too. The problems ran from minor to frustrating. The fact that it is not ergonomically designed was a minor problem since I knew that before I ordered. Still it got in my way and I was always mis-keying. The other real problem was it frequently did not record the first key strike. I researched the problem on line and found that it was a common one and atleast in my case unresolvable. I have not returned it but have not and will not use it.
5,I bought this for LANs as it can run plugged in or unplugged. Unplugged I got about 48 hours of play time out of the battery.
5,Im in about a week with this keyboard and am loving it so far. The only problem i can see people having is that the keys do have some push back to them but if thats not something that bothers you then this keyboard is amazing. I might be a little bias since this is my first keyboard on the more premium side but i love how easy it was to setup and start playing. The icue software was easy for me to use and the keyboard has plenty of room for customization. Battery life is suprisingly better than i thought:)
4,Husband just bought for my birthday and I am really liking it so far! Love how he can program to change colors. I sometimes have issues with carpal tunnel from typing but the feel on this keyboard is very nice. I don't feel like my hands are at an awkward angle at all. The sound isn't too loud (you know those annoyingly loud keyboards y'all). Very happy with this product! Would highly recommend!
4,The keyboard is nice there’s no denying that. It feels nice the keys feel slightly clicky kind of between a membrane and red switch.My only complain is that you cannot use custom lighting effects unless the keyboard is plugged into your PC which defeats the point of a wireless keyboard & I did not see this mentioned anywhere or I would not have bought this keyboard & would have saved $50 and bought the wired version.
5,Awesome product
3,PROS:Typing was greatColor was amazingBattery life is amazing too.NO LAG WHATS SO EVER on 2.4 – Played Overwatch streaming on Nvidia shield TV worked great(Did not try Bluetooth)PRICE IS RIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CONS:Not USB-C (but that’s not a major issue for me)A bit on the larger size (but that did not bother me to much)Keys/Frame collect lots of FINGER PRINTS (also a lot of users have reported frame scratches)Only CON that made me RETURN this:This is NOT a mechanical keyboardThis IS a Membrane keyboardBut it is the BEST Membrane ever made. If you like/want Membrane then BUY THIS you will love it. I always been a brown switch mechanical keyboard guy and I can confirm that this Membrane keyboard is VERY CLOSE to a brown switch but all in all this is 100% MembraneCorsair should have made this with mechanical switches and charged $150-$180 mayyyyybeeee 200.
2,Oh my god this keyboard is bad. Any words I could use to describe how bad would be an understatement.Where do I begin?Let’s get the good out of the cause it’s a short list. It’s rechargeable (though no usb c) has backlighting detachable palm rest and dedicated media keys.Alrighty then so don’t buy this thing.The keys! Oh my god the keys aren’t just bad. It takes a special kind of stupid to put these switches out to market with the raised layout. It makes typing so bad you won’t even want to use your computer just like I was. Micro usb charging (its not acceptable) god I can’t get over how horible those mushy keys are the icue software is confusing to use the macro keys were impossible to program because the software was confusing the keys are mushy and horrible and all this would be somewhat forgivable if they’d use mechanical switches and usb c charging. At least the rest is just annoying
2,I returned this keyboard for the following reasons:- Keys are ridiculously tall. Even if you use wrist rest to keep your arm higher then you'd need to put far too much effort to press any key which also affects typing speed.- They added "G" keys column on the side of the keyboard "shifting" the other keys to the right noticeably. And this appeared to be an issue as I am used to standardized keyboard layout. I type in blind and expect the standard layout under my fingers.  I seem to use left edge of the keyboard as reference to key location so having all the keys shifted that far from the left edge in this layout made me type slow and with many typos. I think in my case this wouldn't (possibly) be much of a problem if these keys were placed horizontally (above F-keys) or (perhaps too) on the right side.- The LED colors were ok but as there is no official support for Linux and I didn't bother checking 3rd party apps.I formerly tried to write this review using K57 and the amount of typos I managed to make was just absurd.Also the plastic on the right side had sharp edges. Not that you get hurt but that's not nice to have.
1,- Requires multiple dongles for multiple Corsair products (unlike Logitech) and if the dongles are next to each other: they will constantly turn the devices off.- Battery life is atrocious. Every 4~ days my Corsair keyboard and mouse have to be plugged in despite lowered brightness for their party fun time colors and vigorous use of the sleep functionality. How long are these devices going to last two years from now?!- Came out the box scratched everywhere at the top and boy howdy does that area above the function keys get dirty ultra fast somehow. I'm a neat freak so I'm constantly cleaning that specific area and even then it's a chore.- I've had an extremely odd problem with the keyboard where typing certain words at my typing speed consistently results in letters lost. It only happens with certain words and if I type those words back-to-back: I consistently see rows of misspelled words. Tried working with Corsair support and I would describe them as condescending at best. Imagine typing out one of the most common words we use and you will forever have to revise it for years to come.I am just so floored that a keyboard has been this much of a hassle. I wanted to go outside my usual box of Logitech products but this has been a train wreck from start to finish and this is supposed to be a reliant brand of pc products!
5,I need tactile feedback to teach my brain when the key has been properly struck.  I have been happy so far.  Time will tell.
4,Keyboard is sturdy adequate configuration options for both key function and lighting. Significant fall in battery life with the use of integral lighting but fully charged overnight with 2m long cable. Response time to keystroke is quite good with keyboard at 2m from the receiver (I haven't tried at greater distance)ICUE software is instinctive and clever.All in all I'm happy with the purchase.
4,Pretty good not gonna lie. I bought it to plug into my Xbox and it’s great if u want a cheap gaming keyboard. My only promblem with it is that the keys are kinda thicc which I’m not used to so it’s kinda weird but regardless this is actually a really good keyboard.
5,I love all the different RGB color schemes! Lighting can be customized using iCUE *but these only work when the charging cable is plugged in*. They key caps are very comfortable they almost have a rubberized finish (does show fingerprints when hands are moist.) It is not mechanical but I think it types similar to Cherry MX Clear switches. The membrane really helps to diffuse the RGB lighting and gives more intense color. Great wireless keyboard!
5,great keyboard
3,I really wanted to like this keyboard. It would have completed my new office suite the exact way I wanted but the iCue software is an absolute nightmare on MacOS. Both the keyboard and mouse would randomly lose connectivity at any and every point. It would show that the device(s) were "Unavailable" or lagged so incredibly bad that as I finished this review it would just input "I really wanted". If plugged in they worked phenomenally but on wireless? Pssh. Not a good pair for MacOS.
3,Looks pretty but after just a few days mouse doesn't connect. Have to hard wire it regularly in order for my computer to recognize it."N" key works 50% of the time.
2,I got this keyboard to set up as a new gaming keyboard for the price I assumed it was a mechanical keyboard it is NOT. I was okay to try and gave it a week of trial some keys were crisp but some were mushy. And I could not connect this device to the iCUE software.I reached out to Corsair about both of my issues mushy keys and software not detecting. They completely ignored my mushy key issue and told me the equivalent of turning it off and back on again for the software issue.The mouse is extremely non descript and meh it's not very comfortable to hold if you have a medium sized hand and are used to ergonomic mice.
5,I have only 1 problem and it would be all the little crumbs that get inside of it but other than that I've been using this keyboard with the bottom arm rest off for over half a year and it still is working great cudos to Corsair for making such a great keyboard. I believe that if you had an easier way to program the G keys it would make this keyboard even better.
5,It works. It works wirelessly.The buttons feel fine to not be mechanical and aren't too loud.The wrist rest could be a smidge wider or the keyboard could have slightly more options regarding the height it can be tilted at.  Otherwise it's a solid keyboard... I only wish it was free too then it would be perfect!
5,I like this product a lot great and has lasted no drawbacks I recommend this keyboard.One drawback though is that on my keyboard the space key will make a popping noise when I use it. Don't notice when gaming but doing every day tasks can be bothering.
5,I got this to use in my bed because I'm lazy like that. Very good quality. Works great. Battery lasts a good deal of time. No complaints.I use this keyboard for gaming and the response time is great. The keys feel nice. The lights are bright!
2,Okay so I just got my keyboard.  I spent a good 20 minutes customizing the RGB to report temperature and other things (plugged in to top off the battery).  As soon as I unplug the keyboard to have it be in wireless mode like a wireless keyboard should be.... All that time I spent customizing...gone.  Apparently while the keyboard is in wireless mode you can only use their presets!!??  I'm not a fan of rainbow puke while I game I do like having colors actually tell me information which is the point of the customizing using iCUE.  But for some reason corsair doesn't let you have custom rgb settings while the keyboard is being used wirelessly.  This is extremely frustrating and I'll be returning this keyboard.Also if you research this (which I did immediately after thinking I did something wrong) people have been complaining about this for 2 years (at least) and there are plenty of people who were bait and switched like I was.  And all they've said is they'll look into it.
5,Excelente teclado para jugar con RGB inalámbrico para los que le gusta el equilibrio entre precio/beneficio/calidad jugar sin cables es una autentica maravilla y con baja latencia mucho mas
5,Despite some YouTube reviews dissing the non mechanical aspect it’s actually quite nicely built and feels durable and sturdy. Pretty decent customizable options. Great BT signal and the dongle has a nice little cubby on the keyboard. Worth the purchase. I only wish they opted for a steel frame option instead of plastic ( I would happily pay extra for steel) but good quality plastics non the less.
5,One Of The BEST Keyboards Worth Buying For Gamers And For People With Multiple Devices. I Can Connect Up To 3 Devices & The Battery Life Is Good.Wish It Was Not Plastic. Else It Would Have Been The Best.
5,Everything and more than I was expecting a great keyboard for the price and customization is perfect for gaming and hot keys
3,Unfortunately this KB is slow to wake from sleep mode so the first 1 or 2 keystrokes don't register so if you are typing the word ... Lame ... it will be ... ame which is very annoying because you are never sure if it's coming out of Sleep Mode.I've resorted to hitting the Shift key a few times to make sure it's "awake" before I start to type.This is not a problem when gaming because it doesn't have time to Sleep.I've owned two other wireless KB's and neither had this problem...they weren't Corsair.
4,Works really good I just don’t like how easy the keys come off
5,Shipping was extremely fast just take it out the box insert the dongle and that's it! Brightness and color adjustments are extremely well made and MR functions for macros is excellent. Even when I changed from WIndows OS to Linux I didn't lose a single functionality. Great product in my opinion.
5,Works great! Wife's previous K70 had a key break. Sadly Corair keyboards aren't like the ancient IBMs. She wanted cordless so I ordered this. She connected it herself and is pleased. No gaming but she can type and appreciates the response and no rollover.
1,Upon receiving this keyboard I was excited. I liked the feel of the keys (though it's a membrane keyboard) the lighting was cool enough (even though it was really only available when plugged in as otherwise it would drain the battery very quickly) and it had all the features I was looking for.Unfortunately I soon realized the product has a fatal flaw (that I wouldn’t normally miss): the battery is NOT user replaceable. This means that once the lithium ion cell located in the keyboard dies in approximately 2 years the board is essentially garbage. After researching further I found this is an issue with all the wireless keyboards that Corsair sells a fact of which they should be ashamed. When asked on their forums what to do when the battery dies for good the only suggestion was to use it plugged in which obviously defeats the purpose of a WIRELESS keyboard.I’m tired of companies manufacturing products that are essentially disposable. A keyboard should last at least 10 years if not far longer. Companies: stop abusing our wallets-and our planet-for your gain.P.S. There is a competitor who makes a board with replaceable batteries. I’m typing on it right now and it’s great.
5,This looks to keyboard is amazing
3,The keyboard I received works good. Be aware of this seller [Anderson Cutting Global] they are deceiving. They send a spanish keyboard instead of english keyboard. Because I  live outside the US returning it will be too expensive to pay for the return shipment. I was also trying to find replaceble english keycaps but I could not find them online.
2,It's a mixed bag this keyboard. If you're looking for rainbow puke it's solid except you can't keep your preset lighting when wireless. Corsair won't fix it. Figures.Next the USB cable. Looks pretty solid I like it! Oh now a week after return period ended disconnects randomly. Very poor micro USB connector leaves too much play when it should hold the connection more snug.Lastly the keys. Look I know it's a membrane keyboard. I don't expect a mechanical experience. But holy god if these had any more travel on them I'd assume I was using a typewriter. I've never had my hands get tired until this keyboard.Oh almost forgot to mention the wrist rest squeaks too. Come on Corsair you can do better than this.
5,Ah this keyboard is great. Having moved from an older heavier Corsair this keyboard is a breath of fresh air. Lightweight sturdy long-lasting battery. The color customization is cool and the program to control it and set different profiles is a bit barebones but is honestly perfect for what it is. Definitely a must buy.
3,I really loved the appeal of the lights while also being a wireless keyboard. However about a month of normal use no smashing or raging like kids do these days my space bar is absolutely horrible. it wobbles on one side and has some sort of resistance/defect going on with it. It is actually annoying because it is a very used button whether it be for typing or gaming the space bar key is very important. I think its a great product but not mine individual keyboard.
5,i’m a big fan of corsair keyboards. from someone who also owns a k95 i can confidently tell you this is a solid keyboard. however the body of this is plastic and not brushed aluminum like the k95 like i had originally expected.
5,This is blasphemy in the world of keyboards buuuut I liked this one so much I replaced my mechanical keyboard with it. Its great quiet and responsive.
5,A really good price for a quality product I highly recommend this RGB wireless keyboard.
5,Un teclado bastante útil para los que trabajamos en empresas americanasademas por los key blinds que permite configurar.
2,At first I liked this keyboard. Previous keyboard wasn't lighted and this one provided a nice touch for that aspect in games particularly at night/lights out.  However after a couple of months I noticed the cord won't stay connected to charge it. It's constantly connecting/disconnecting if the cord moves at all or is touched by anything. I have/have had a lot of components from Corsair: gigs & gigs of RAM 3 separate water coolers cases and a nice wireless headset. This is my first keyboard. It won't necessarily be my last from them but it will definitely be my last wireless keyboard from them.Now it's time to research a wired one and to pitch this one in the trash.
5,Para diseño lo utilizo espectacular... recomendado
5,I love this keyboard the lighting is beautiful adjustable and the keys are pretty quiet yet feel good. Not a huge fan of the little pad it comes with but it's detachable and I'm on a couch using my TV as a Monitor lol. I love that it can be both wired and Wireless. Holds a charge amazingly well too. Definitely recommend.
1,So I bought this keyboard because it does have some rather enticing features in fact of there was a way to replace my now defective model with one that worked just like it did yesterday I would in a heartbeat. Unfortunately though I feel cheated again by corporations that specifically makes return policies synchronize with when they crappy products they use are going to break just to save money.All so right when your warranty runs out your only option is to buy another $100 KEYBOARD. No thanks your usb cord never worked from the get go and I'll stick with my glitchy but actually operable keyboard that cost me $20 and you (the buyer) should too. Least if that breaks you're out $20 isntead of desperately trying to order another keyboard when all the keys you press just end up spurting out "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdaadadsdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" and I'm not kidding it would type when I wasnt I literally couldn't get anything from a single key that was useful.Some keys just don't work anymore strangely the arrow keys do but most everything but the keys around WASD are the ones that activate the endless string of letters. I didn't spill anything on it I'm dumbfounded really again it was working normally yesterday but hopefully this review will help someone.So in my frustration I hope I stayed coherent enough to get my point across stay away unless they change their customer service policies
4,K57 model does work with PS4 needs to be plugged in and you turn the KB off hold B and S and turn it on tech support sent me the info Ty Corsair 😊
5,So far this keyboard has exceeded my expectations. The switches are much quieter than my razor keyboard. RGB is very customizable and lighting effects are smooth. With three different brightness levels you have alot of flexibility.My only complaint is in regards to the detacheable palm rest. It would be nice to have it lock into position. When picking up the keyboard the palm rest flaps around.
1,Immediately out of the gate I knew that this keyboard wasn't right. "u"s hardly register and require typing multiple times to get the letter output. Same thing with N.At first it felt like... maybe I was typing wrong? But no after more testing and given that I type all day every day the issue is the product. I should have returned it when I had the return window because now the seller won't honor the issue and return / refund the purchase.Recently the windows key has stopped registering meaning I can no longer copy paste or use most hot keys on my Mac. The seller's advice was to wait for firmware from Apple to reset the memory on the keyboard... pass. Or to contact corsair for warranty.. which as you all know takes weeks of time and what am I supposed to do to type in the interim?Don't buy this keyboard. It will fail on you and you'll realize that Corsair keyboards are not reliable.
5,love the ways the keys press and the rbg justvon point only charged it once since i got it and still have charge it
5,i have poor eye sight and i am able to clearly see the keys in the complete dark.can be used wired or wireless. color array is easy to change. A+++
2,If your intended use is with blue tooth do not buy.  Must be within 12 inches for the keyboard to respond.  BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!Works great if tethered to computer with USB cord.Would not recomend  this item  because of blue tooth performance.
1,Mouse came missing the receiver (as shown) and the charging cable also does not actually slide fully into the port and can't charge. The port access is so small I can't get another charger into it. I paid too much to be this disappointed.
3,It’s a little meh for 80 bucksIt’s a membrane keyboard so it’s squishy.. and quiet. The keystroke feels long so that’s not bad for gaming.RGB is nice. Feels a little run if the mill for the price. But I guess 80 isn’t enough for a premium feeling keyboard anymore.Spend a 100 or more if you’re considering this board and just get the keyboard you always wanted.I wouldn’t recommend this board
5,I’ve used quite a few wireless keyboards and this is one of the best. You don’t have to play the keyboard pick and move around game to find a connection. Response is great there’s always a good connection and had never lagged in the few months I’ve used it.
5,I don't use it for gaming. I am in the process of building a home recording studio. Looks great more presets than I thought with LED lighting. Feels great comfortable. Fast delivery as well
4,functionally it is fine but with backlight on it drains the battery within a day of use.
3,I like the look of the keyboard feels nice lighting functions are great. Only issue I have and dislike is the fact that my 'U' key often doesn't work about 90% of the time especially when typing quickly.  Other than that battery life is really nice. Would easily be a 4 or 5 star if my keys properly worked.
3,For the price compared to other name brand wireless run keyboards it’s a good value.Only complaint is the space bar does not function properly if you press it off center and can get stuck. This can be frustrating while gaming and more so while typing.
2,Love how it feels to type on the color and settings have a ton of potential but the software constantly loses the ability to do full customization of each key so stuck with ALL keys for color options. Corsair support took 3 days to ask follow up questions once I provided requested info (screen shots of firmware and such) they have ceased all communication.
1,My first keyboard began to stutter after only a few months adding extra letters or holding down this key or that until I was able to turn it off. I received a replacement figuring it was a lemon. I've had this replacement for just about the same amount of time as the first and it is doing the same thing. It has nothing to do with the charge or the battery the charge is full and it will do this at random intervals. I am a PC Gamer and a writer and this is unacceptable. Missing an ult in the middle of a critical match because one key decides not to respond is unacceptable for a keyboard that is advertised for gaming. Will not be buying another corsair keyboard and will warn people against it.
4,Keeps loosing connection at close distance with blue tooth.
5,Got it for my nvidia shield. Connects very well with the dongle. The backlight is nice and the keys are quiet and tactile.
2,I am not a gamer...Im disabled and bought this in the hope that it would make my life easier thanks to the macros and the per-key rgb lights to help me remember the shortcuts for all the software that I use. etc.Writing my own individual profiles is a pain; The issue software is clunky and cpu intensive...which is something i could live with but only after a few months the usb port for the keyboard has now failed meaning that I can no longer use the per key RGB features which only works if plugged in via usb. considering its not a mecanical keyboard its an avarage deal when fully working....but poor build quality means this keyboard is best avoided.
5,Wow you can tell the difference between this and a cheaper similar keyboard in terms of quality. Awesome product. Worth the $$$
4,good
5,I looked all over for this keyboard. I couldn't find it in stock anywhere and now I know why. It's amazing! I love how quiet and smooth it is. I couldnt be happier.
1,The keyboard is nice as well as the lighting but the battery sucks! I let my keyboard go completely dead before I charge it and it stays alive for two days and that's with me using the keyboard for an hour a day at the most maybe less.Anyone who types for a living and wants to use this keyboard for a full day good luck to you before the battery dies on you!The mouse battery life is better but just a little bit better.
3,I have had this maybe 3 months and in that time i have seen the battery life depreciate nearly 50%. This thing is pushing 17 hours of use when they say 35. That is a big difference considering batteries last for a really long time. I find it really annoying to have to plug this back in every 3rd day.
5,Great keyboard.Gives you the perfect click sound of the mechanical keys.Easy on the fingers.Not too bright you will need a small light if you look at keys when you type
3,Looks good but after only a few days of use it has started with high latency and connection issues. Basically typical wireless garbage. Unrelable missed key strokes. Going back to wired.
2,If you are using this for fast response don't.  There is a lag.  My computer is such that the usb port (3.0) is literally less than a foot from the keyboard and it responds slow still.  The keys are high and stiff making it slower to switch key strikes when gaming.  Battery life is wicked short although slightly better than the mouse (see my review of that as I bought them as a pair) with limited use I still can't go a two or three days at best before it suddenly loses charge and I have to scramble and plug it in to charge.I literally stated the similar things about the Corsair mouse I bought as well although the battery life even worse.
2,Day 1 fully charged before use.  Battery went dead in 5 hours.  Day 2 fully charged but stopped responding to the dongle randomly.  Returned.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard! I play WoW pretty regularly and this keyboard is a huge upgrade from my Logitech keyboard. Not to mention it changes color and looks absolutely stunning. It's perfect  and honestly a lot cooler than I was expecting it to be.
4,This full-size keyboard that lights up is just plain cool
1,Purchased a few months ago for remote work from home. Barely holds a charge for a whole day already keys (spacebar) are failing. Keys making loud clicking noise when pressed. Sleep setting prevents first few keystrokes every time you use it. My generic chinese knockoff from ebay was way better will go back to it.Avoid this keyboard mouse at all costs you can do better.
4,Good
1,I bought these because it will sync with my iCue LED lights and that's pretty cool.However the battery life for both the keyboard and the mouse is horrible. They only lasts a few days before needing to be recharged. I use a 15 minute time out so the lights aren't on all the time. I know LED's draw power but you would think at this price point that they were put enough battery power in there to last a few weeks between charges.Programable keys keep losing memory and I have to constantly reload the program.Shift key quit working after 3 weeks. JUNK.If I had to do it over again I would not have purchased this item.
1,Bought this Jan of 2021 and really enjoyed the product. My biggest complaint was that the wrist rest is just a flimsy attachment and not a sturdy attachment one can use on the couch. Now my biggest complaint is that after one year of light use the charging port is broken. It will only charge if I hold the cable at just the right angle essentially turning it into a paper weight. What a waste of money I will stick to Logitech going forward (I had to resort to using my 12 year old Logitech wireless keyboard still working strong...).
4,bought for one of our estimators to use and he likes it
3,¿Para qué un teclado tan costoso si NO es mecánico? Es confuso para los clientes que digan que es un teclado para juegos si no es mecánico. Es muy lindo pero no para juegos.
5,i love this keyboard! its battery life is crazy long and isn't too loud i don't have to worry about waking my boyfriend now with my late night gaming sessions!
5,Great responsiveness. I never miss keystrokes with this. Quieter than a regular mechanical keyboard but still a noticeable sound. Beautiful LEDs very programmable many ways to connect to your devices.
2,I like the quiet feel and ability to toggle led on/off.  However after about a year it stopped holding a charge or taking power - feels like the USB connector is just cheap.
3,My U and my N key consistently do not work if I type fast. I removed the key caps to see if there was any gunk and there wasn't any. This couples with my corsair middle mouse button braking after 4 months I will no longer be purchasing their products.
4,Overall great keyboard but the Bluetooth doesn’t work for certain devices after time.
3,Received the box opened and the keyboard without the SlipStream receiver. Summing it up as amazon reselling returns. Pisses me off because I don't want to go through the RMA process and wait longer to receive my fully working product. But I suppose there's no other choice since I can't get a receiver on its own.
5,Perfect
5,I really like this Keyboard. It works great and I really love the RGB Lighting. In order to change the colors you have to download the iCUE software from Corsair. The keyboard has held up great so far and I really really enjoy it!
1,While this has an impressive feature list for a wireless keyboard most of the features only work when it's plugged in. They're so obsessed with goofy animated lighting effects and low-latency key response that you can't even set a custom solid color for it to use while it's operating wirelessly. The macro facility which is quite powerful once you get past the awful iCUE UI allows you to emulate mouse actions and almost anything else... but it also only works when the keyboard is plugged into USB.The wireless also disconnects about once an hour and takes longer than any keyboard I've ever used to reconnect after a disconnect or going to sleep--up to 10 seconds. Lots of fun when it disconnects with a key stuck down.
2,I bought it so I could use it wirelessly and I just have to say that Corsair has really bad wireless functionality. The keyboard wireless disconnects and reconnects like I'm using it across the room when in reality I'm only about 3-4 ft away. It gets a really inconsistent connection. It's only good for use if you keep it plugged it into the pc which is counter productive to the use of the product. A big waste of my money and makes me regret not getting Razer instead.
4,Good quality non-mechanical software can be improved. Should be USB Type C.
5,Got this for my mother for work she loves the way the keys feel and the custom color options I set up with the ICUE system which was very easy to use a great wireless keyboard
5,Pretty good keyboard.  Bought it with the RGB iromclaw wireless and a virtuoso headset so I could use it with 3:1 slipstream.  Works perfectly.  Hiccups here and there with the firmware but still works pretty good
1,What is the point of a wireless RGB keyboard if you have to use it with a cable and not the dongle? Researched my symptoms online and this is unfortunately very very common. I can't believe that at this price point this is such a bad experience. This is my second failed Corsair product lately and I am what some would consider a Corsair fan Boy.The topping on the ill-tasting frosting of this cake is that in order to get a refund I have to pay for the shipping back to Adorama. Please don't commit my mistake head the warning and if you decide to buy because you think this may not happen to you do not do so from Adorama. I will never purchase anything from that site ever again.You have been warned brethren now the choice to take the risk is totally up to you. Good luck
1,After 3 weeks of usage the Ctrl Shift and Alt keys on both sides stopped working.  Tried software update firmware update and hardware reset.  No luck.  None of the keys are sticky.  It's like they just don't do anything.  It seems to be some sort of weird logic or electrical problem since it's the Shift Ctrl and Alt keys on both sides.  The cat barfed on the section that's the Home and End keys a few days ago; maybe that was a factor in spite of cleaning it up very well.  I'm still reluctantly giving it 1 star because it's just not very durable.  I got this as a gift for my poor wife's birthday and it was her favorite gift until it broke.  She's gone back to using her old trusty mechanical IBM PS2 keyboard from the early 90's a keyboard that has held up for nearly 30 years because her new keyboard didn't hold up for 3 weeks.  For shame Corsair.  This experience tarnished my otherwise high respect for Corsair products.
5,This is a solid keyboard with a great feel. The battery lasts a really long time and I haven't had any issues with the wireless connection.
4,For the price I would have liked better quality build and materials
5,Pleased with the purchase kind of pricy but it's worth it. Corsair doesn't really disappoint except maybe for their AIO but that's another discussion for a different time. ;)
5,Great feel and look!  Really enjoy this keyboard and would recommend to anyone.  Types relatively quiet and can barely be heard outside of a room.
5,My first gaming keyboard and I have had zero issues so far. great battery life and the iQue software is not nearly as bad as people make it seem. Feels great to type on
4,Decent quality but the instructions that come with it are crap. They should make the keyboard mechanical too
2,You can hardly type words like "found" because pressing O+U+N simultaneously (as fast typers tend to do) will only type O+U. This seems to happen with multiple Corsair keyboard models (at least the two I've bought).
5,battery life seems great last about 3 weeks for me so far before charging.  Looks great  macros  & all that good stuff you expect from software.
5,I love this keyboard I only wish it was mechanical but thats a lot more money.
5,Excellent for gaming. Great quality of material and good brightness of the lights.
2,Original was purchased in November. Out of the box the RGB functions didn't work correctly. Customer support with Corsair went back and forth for a number of days before they suggested I simply return it to Amazon.The replacement work beautifully: for 5 months before it just stopped working. In the middle of typing a document the lights went out and it became completely unresponsive. No amount of troubleshooting is bringing this one back it would seem. What a shame that an $80 keyboard (wireless option) dies in 6 months.If not for reliability this would be a five-star product.
1,At first charge up i loved this keyboard. The keys were responsive and wireless backlit keys are what I need.Well after about 6 weeks (then went on a 2 month trip so didn't get to use it (yes I fully charged it and yes i turned it off before leaving) I come home recharge even though it was already full. I noticed that about 20 min later errors happened.. The a couple weeks later... 5 min or so of battery and its dead. The return window is closed so I am stuck with yet another piece of junk I can do nothing about apparently.  I bought this because of the great price point for a wireless backlit keyboard.. I love corsair but along with some ram issues they refuse to take care of I have to add this to the mix.  I think next time Logitech gets my money... buyer beware beyond a very short return window you get zero help and amazon? oh i am sorry sir.. wish we could help you out... baloney
3,This was advertised as wireless and it needs to be in extremely close proximity to the receiver.UPDATE: Buy a USB extender if you want to use this for wireless the wired mode is nice to have though as an alternative.
5,My boyfriend turned me on to this keyboard and I love it! The click is nice but not too loud. And I love all the color changing settings.
1,I receive very bad mouse and used keyboard. You can see on the picture it very old and cracked
5,Gorgeous keyboard quick response time on the keys and the battery life has been great.
5,Great feel not very loud for a mechanical keyboard which I do love that it is the way it is. Comes with an insertion point for the usb reciever. One of my favorite keyboards.
5,Works perfectly has good range on bluetooth I turn the brightness down a bit when using it wirelessly to conserve battery life but it can last 3 days or so.  Charges fast.
5,Love the wireless feature RGB is great. quality keys.
3,The rubber feet on the bottom suck for anything with an angle.
5,I like it because I can use it for church and when we have presentations I can see the keyboard has very good brightness to it.
1,Spacebar key broke already don't buy this
2,The charging cable is awful. The internal female connector on keyboard is lose. It constantly powers on and off again while typing. It is Bluetooth but if trying to charge it while working it cut on/off. It works fine otherwise.  It is Corsair's bottom of line but does just fine for casual gaming or work flow.
5,Love the long lasting battery. The color choices are cool. I love that the keys letters are lit up as well as back-lit.
5,Corsair is a brand to be trusted. This Keyboard is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned. Thank you Corsair for your quality craftmanship
5,Cool looking and works great.
5,For it being wireless it's response time is as if it were a wired keyboard amazing keyboard and perfect in every way for gaming
5,LoveVery cool many options for colors..some good for low light some just cool to watch them goEasy to play on
1,I purchased this keyboard because I have been trying to clean up my desktop and limit the number of wires that are exposed.  Upon connecting it with the USB dongle the dongle would not show the keyboard and I was stuck using bluetooth.  I tried to reset the keyboard plug it directly into the PC all to no avail.  I am so pissed off.  Going with the Logitech G915 which is what I originally should have done.
5,I really like typing on this keyboard! It is not mechanical but typing is very smooth. The wrist rest is also very comfortable.
5,Slight delay in wireless mode so not for top level gaming but colours are bright.
5,Batteries last a long time and works great
3,Works much better when plugged in through USB. My "n" key doesn't always register the first time I press it. Overall I'm happy with the keyboard.
5,Item is great 👍
4,Great feeling keyboard but would prefer the mechanical
5,This is a great gaming keyboard a little pricey though.
5,This is my 7th board in 2 years had it a week now and i love it this one is a keeper.
5,Great gaming keyboard
2,Do not buy this product if you plan on using more than one Corsair wireless product. I am using this keyboard and a harpoon wireless mouse and the keyboard is constantly disconnecting and reconnecting. After looking over their website and the internet for days there appears to be no true fix. The issue lies within the icue software needed to run the rgb and it messes up the USB controller. I have tried for over a week now to troubleshoot this issue and have had enough.
5,Quieter than any mechanical keyboard. Corsairs great color software great for macros!
2,Recently began having charging issues with this product for seemingly no reason. When I bend the USB at the perfect angle it charges again but naturally gets knocked out of that perfect position pretty often. Up until now it has worked fine and i've been using it for awhile even typing a review about it with this. However will probably have to get a new keyboard now and definitely won't be this one.
5,Excelente calidad
5,Great colors and works great for games
2,It started with a successful iCue update then the wireless and bluetooth went dead. only the usb connection would work. Then I was told to do a hard reset so I disconnected the micro usb to try and reset the keyboard but the inside of the port  crumbled. This keyboard lasted me 80 days. warranty doesn't cover that. I say this is a cheaply made product the concept was great. Definitely not the quality that Corsair is synonym to. I'm really disappointed.
5,I loved it!!! It works exactly as I was expecting!!!
2,There is a TON of issues with this keyboard and it doesn't always sink up right away to iCue.  The letters stick and will just run on typing the same letter like the key is stuck.  I am constantly turning off and on (every single use and then some).  If I need it accurate and quick I have to plug it into my PC while in use and it still has issues.
5,comfortable love the the rgb lighting and how it is wirlesss
5,Love this keyboard. Feels great and action is on point.
4,Like
2,It works fine when it works but every time I turn my computer off then back on it is a whole ordeal to get it reconnected to even log in! Super annoying and I'm gonna throw it away and buy one with a cord.
5,Long battery great looks fast connecting comfortable feel no lag :)
2,I got this keyboard around Christmas of 2019. A year and a half later the wireless receiver decides to just die. The software won't recognize the receiver when trying to initiate pairing.Very disappointed.
5,Best keyboard I have ever owned! A+++
1,My $23 Logitech keyboard works MUCH better than this POS. If you feel like wasting money this would be a good choice. Connecting this keyboard Bluetooth results in so much lag that it's practically unusable - there's about a 2 second delay between hitting a key and seeing the results. The supplied dongle is n0ot much better in that it worked fine for a couple of month then started acting up as  the batteries were low even while fully charged. The iCue software that is REQUIRED to make  changes to the lighting on this keyboard is so buggy that using it could result in  outer to the extent that you have to physically unplug the power to the computer to get it to restart. This keyboard just sucks!
5,Wireless  with multiple rgb effect and brightness just what im expecting.
5,Excellent keyboard incredible lightingAwesome soft for customisationWorth its money
5,Exactly what you pay for.
2,I had this keyboard for less than a year. It stopped working out of no where. I really loved this keyboard until it stopped working. Don't buy look for something wired.
5,Love everything
2,After a year mark of since buying the product. The internal battery just quits... not worth the money stick with wired. I have bought a $10 wireless keyboard for the TV... it has lasted x5 the length.
1,Such a piece of crap.  Totally unreliable.  Does not type until you have started a word so constantly have to go back and start over.  Randomly will stop typing at all.  I HATE IT.  I really don't know why I put up with it for so long.  If I could give it zero stars I would.
5,This is the keyboard to buy.
2,I bought this with the hopes that I would have a good wireless keyboard for gaming. After only two months it has stopped working unless it is directly connected to the computer by its cable. It was a very expensive mistake and apparently I cannot return it. 4
2,Second Wireless K57 I purchased that unpaired. Warranty process is not easy. Buy a different brand.
5,Used it for gaming in bed worked well
5,Excelente produto.
5,Is good
2,This keyboard lasted 9 months then died.  Of course no product support.  This keyboard should have lasted years.  Not a good value overall.  Very pretty keyboard however.
1,I would have given this keyboard 5 stars just a month ago but the battery has completely stopped charging and now its just a wired keyboard. It even works when its plugged into to something with power that's not my PC it just won't charge.
5,Works great.
1,If you type faster than 90 wpm don't get this keyboard. Myself and countless others have the issue of keys "skipping" (not being registered) due to the nature of how this keyboard is built. There is an 8 key rollover that prioritizes "gaming" keys so typing the word "count" will actually write "cout" unless you type intentionally slowly on those words.
1,This thing is terrible... first off the keyboard worked fine for a day then it bricked itself and was no longer able to use wireless. And apparently this has been a known issue since it has came out years ago! And it still isn't solved. And the keys input response for quick gaming is sluggish. Do yourself a solid and don't buy this. It looks cool and the lights and amazing but that's it has to offer
1,Buyer beware!  Bought this for my son for Christmas.  He loved it for the first two weeks.  Shortly after the new year it stopped working.  Even plugged into USB power press the power button and 'nothing'.  Contacted Corsair customer support and they had no advise on what to try.  Their only advise was to open a ticket for a replacement or return to the seller.  I chose to return it to Amazon (Their return process is 5 star) and my some and I have chosen to go with another (non-Corsair) product.
5,Met expectations
2,I was hoping for something updated about this other than wireless. Disappointed as it is nothing but what appears to be a '70s-type keyboard with colors and wireless. Cheap palm rest. Not worth half it's cost.
5,Me likey..
5,Excellent product
5,a tad brighter
5,Quality
1,Corsair makes a great product But I'm really upset I received a USED PRODUCT!!!!  I paid full price and its clearly used. Seals were broken and peeled off!!  Finger prints and smudges all over the keyboard!!! No wrapping or plastic on any thing!!!!  NOT HAPPY ABOUT PAYING FULL PRICE!!!!!  Hence the review.  Unhappy  customer!!!
2,Good keyboard but I got this for the wireless connectivity and the light feature but the light doesn’t seem to always work and some of the keys are not functioning properly.
1,Stopped working 2 months in. When i turn it on simply flashes top 3 white lights num lock/caps lock etc.Works wired but in that mode no colors etc.Some looking on the forums and it seems it may be a firmware issues but icue fails to update its firmware.While it worked  I loved it. Paired with a Dark Core and it mouse was a nice combo.Created a support ticket and have not heard back as of yet.
1,The cable will eventually break for no reason. Even if you have it connected by USB or bluetooth if the cable moves a little bit the entire keyboard will shut off. It's very annoying and very bad construction.
1,As a basic keyboard it works. But it does none of the fancy stuff unless it is plugged in and when you unplug it errors are common. The software is horrible - few updates work (have to totally reinstall with each update) and the software itself is not user friendly day.Don’t buy.
1,It's a great keyboard however the soldering of the usb cable attachment is poor at best. This is the fatal flaw as it is recessed and prone to torque from the positioning of the board. Over time it begins to fail and completely detaches from the board resulting in failure to charge.
1,After owning this for a little over a year it no longer holds a charge and cannot be charged. Don't bother buying it is a waste of $75 unfortunately.
1,Al escribir la letra E no funciona en ciertas palabras que llevan GR y TRENTR  AGRGAR VIENTR CATR GRCIA TRINTA ALEGR....
1,DON'T BUY THIS JUNK. the wireless dongle doesn't work at all. It isn't a wireless keyboard. Trying to get help from customer service has been a joke. They can't even send me the label to print... I won't buy any more corsair products ever again.
1,The keyboard is good. But the mouse is absolute junk worst mouse I have ever used!!! Save your money!!!
1,Ordered this twice and got the K55 wired version twice. Order from Corsair
1,Worked great outa box . Then would not connect and locked computer up didnt matter if it was pluged in USB or Wireless same result. dont waste your money here there are a lot of wireless keyboards that are built to last .. just not this one...
5,This product arrived pretty quickly! Packaging was great and the products are super sleek and they look durable!I got the product all set up! However when I looked under the mouse for the USB it wasn't there 🥺😭 After a few hours and research and almost buying a universal hub it was discovered in the keyboard! (to the right of the on/off switch!) I also discovered a few days later that I was able to connect these to my 2019 Macbook via Bluetooth! Which means no extra cords or connections!I'm not a gamer by any means I bought this for work because I was aiming to personalize my workspace and the basic keyboard and mouse wasn't cutting it. I'm constantly switching up the color scheme! One charges lasts about 3-5 days I just make sure to turn off the devices when not in use and if they are idle for too long they do go to sleep on their own.It has the mechanical feel without the loud clickety-clack (which I personally would've enjoyed but not so much my coworkers)Overall I'm extremely happy with this product and would 10/10 recommend and buy again!
1,When I first got it it seems glitchy from the start. Within 4 months it just stopped working.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!NOT IN THE LEAST!DO NOT DO IT!Customer service took forever too!
1,I wish i can give it a zero.  Withtin 3 months it broke. I get random key presses and now it just shuts down.  Waste of $100
1,After only 4 month of buying it stopped working just flashing lights. And they won't give me any support because it was only 3 month warranty for a $74 dolars keyboard worst throw away money ever
1,I ordered this and it just arrived today. However what arrived was the k55 wired version. Buyer beware. Returned immediately. Paid for the $80 keyboard got the $50 one... not happy.
1,Keyboard dosnt work unless plugged in .. nothing in program to save your profiles to keyboard.. other than that it’s a good keyboard just wish it would work wireless....
1,Keyboard were amazing for about 45 days after that it only worked wired and wouldn’t work wirelessly and it being during the COVID 19 outbreak there’s no possible help
1,loses connection all the time
1,Lighting will revert to rainbow puke as soon as you lock your PC and unless the lighting software is running at ALL times. Unacceptable. I expected more from Corsair. Returning.
1,The keyboard looked great and I didn't mind the membrane keys.  However the Macro Record button and the 11 pre-programmed light seeting didn't work.  Bummer.....return same day.
1,lights up but stopped working wirelessly after a year
1,The good: Bright and pretty colors.The Bad: Poor range and build quality.Last item I ever purchase from Corsair!
1,It worked for a while but then it just stopped working with a macbook pro.
1,The USB port fell off after a month and a half
1,Just bad. Connection battery life keys - all bad
1,It shipped with oem packaging. The macro keys did not function properly.
1,Had 2 months won’t charge?
1,It already doesn’t work 4 months later... poor quality
1,This does not work property. Its super frusterating
1,Stopped working a month after purchase
1,Not silent at all
2,It's a 'wireless' keyboard that is missing half its features unless it's plugged in. You can't even use iCUE Scenes to set it to a single static color which is mind boggling since pretty much every other piece of Corsair wireless tech can do this with a single click. Corsair wireless mice are have more features than this thing. Buy something else.
5,I am very happy with this keyboard!  I tried a different high-end wireless keyboard first and was disappointed with it but this Corsair keyboard addressed all my concerns and has left me very happy! For absolute top performance you need to plug it in but even in bluetooth wireless mode it's an excellent keyboard.Pros: - Quiet compared to mechanical keyboards but still with a good feel to it - Great backlighting with lots of options very easy to change (my 3-year-old figured it out!) - Good wireless performance even in bluetooth mode (and there's an included USB dongle for even better) - Removable wrist pad - Rechargeable battery lasts plenty long and means no buying batteries everCons: - Bluetooth wireless mode probably not ideal for truly hard-core gamers but certainly good enough for most! - Complex macros with ~15 keystrokes can miss keys when in bluetooth wireless (but work perfectly in wired mode!) - Takes a few seconds to wake up when in wireless (bluetooth) mode and not touched for 15 mins. - Very slightly lower build quality than top Logitech keyboards (esp wrist rest) but still very good materials.  Should last very well on a desk might not hold up to constant travels if you throw it in a bag or something. - Custom key-by-key backlighting options only available via software download and via USB wired connection.  I have not used them or missed them however.As a lifelong semi-hardcore gamer I am very picky about my keyboards and very HAPPY with this one!
1,I got this k57 for christmas '21.On Feb. 15th the first began to malfunction. Whenever the letter F was pushed it triggered all other letters in the vicinity except F. After an hour of messing with it updating and resetting I discovered it did this with the letters J K L: and numeric number keys 2 6 and 5.Got my replacement from Amazon and immediately found that the letter R is not functioning on my replacement.Corsair has not been helpful at all with the replacement of the gift keyboard and Amazon is apparently now shipping out faulty units.BUYER BEWARE.
3,The item looked great but didn't work out so well. The keyboard had some minor connectivity issues until it culminated into it not working out. At this point I have had it less than a month so I will be cutting my losses.
5,It’s a great keyboard. Really. I am only turned down by one thing and that is the the escape button in between some configurable keys and the number row of keys at the top. I wish it was at the absolute top left of the keyboard. Other than that it is a bright keyboard. I use it on the second brightness level out of three and I have only had to charge it once (except when I first got it too) so battery lasts for around 2 or 3 weeks easily when I only use it for gaming like 2 or 3 hrs a day. I do switch my keyboard off and I don’t use it for other tasks. It really is a great choice you can’t go wrong with a product from Corsair and this is no exception!
3,Break the cord and you're DONE the cord is really easy to break i had my keyboard plugged and accidentally dropped my keyboard because my little brothers are little boogers. The only thing support will do is send you a replacement one if you have a warranty and all you do is take/send a picture of your receipt and the p/n and serial number in order for them to send you a replacement cable. Now most people lose receipts or they don't get their email for it so literally you lose this cord... YOU ARE DONE AND WASTED $50 on a nice keyboard but can't do much with a broken cord. Some of you will read this and be like should've done... blah blah blah but some people are responsible and know how to take care of things just not when external factors come into play so why bother wasting an extra $5 when you can save it for food or pc upgrades.
3,I bought one of these at Best Buy and liked it up until the moment where it stopped charging and threatened to die on me.
5,Beautiful
2,Looked at this keyboard for about 1 yr before buying it. I really wanted lights on my keyboard because I can't see the key's later into the night and that sucks! But I really like the Logitech Wave keyboard as keyboards hurts my hands(and I'm a bass player so need my hands to not hurt)if I'm using them all day and I'm on the computer all day every day. But the Logitech Wave keyboard keys are clunky overall although it's never broken on me and I've had it for 10+years. But like I said I needed lights on my keyboard and none of the wireless Ergonomic Keyboards have lights on them! Which I find ridiculous as all keyboards should be ergonomic! It's a  scientific fact the way keyboards are laid out can damage your hands over time! But I digress...I also needed transport controls for media and programmable key's for shortcuts for work(audio recording/editing/mixing and video! On to the review= The software for programing the keyboard is very difficult to use(and I have been using computers since 1985 back when I was on DOS instead of Windows). Virtually impossible and there are no good video how to's to program it how I would need it! The ones that are on YouTube at the time of writing this review are useless and leave out a lot of info so if you've never used Corsair software before you'll be lost in no time at all! So I wanted to program the G buttons to do certain things on Windows(like open up the calculator for one of them) then on ProTools do other things. And when I use ProTools have each individual key be a different color so that it can match the ProTools shortcuts(I've been using this software for 20+yrs and still can't remember all of the keyboard shortcuts)/and or my tracks for example all of my transport control key's can be green and and my save key's can be blue etc. And on Cubase do the same so I'd have to set up a different profile for Cubase. And I wanted to program the keyboard to switch automatically so that when I opened ProTools up it switched on the keyboard to my ProTools profile keys and when I opened up Cubase Nuendo Photoshop Davinci HitFilm and Acid Video it did the same for each program. And when I minimized my screen and went to Windows to IDK look at YOUTUBE or something it would switch automatically to the Windows settings so that my calculator G shortcuts and Zoom shortcuts would work. Well none of that is possible so it's crazy to pay almost a hundo for this keyboard. The keys are very quiet as well but they don't feel very good tbh. And the layout of said key's feels cramped! The port where you charge from is BROKEN and I have to bend it down and put something heavy on it so that it will charge each night! Also it doesn't last for more than a work day for me from the get go! I've only had this keyboard for 3 months and I'm very careful with my things! My Logitech Wave Keyboard I bought in 2007 and it still works to this day....Flawlessly! Also on the keypad the - sign key is stuck down and will not come up! Why is that when this is brand new and I haven't had anything happen to the keyboard as it's mounted onto the keyboard tray with gripy clamps that clamp it in place and like I said I'm delicate with my studio things I've got gear in here that's 70+ yrs old it's temperature controlled with humidity and Hepa air filters with Ions and all that stuff! I'm very disappointed in the quality and usability of this keyboard! Also it's brighter on the outside of the keys it doesn't shine through the key's(so you can see the letters and numbers as good as it shines outside the edges of the keys)very well! And for some reason the transport key's are not illuminated! A very large oversight IMO as you can't see what the key's are at all in lower light levels in your room which in my room is that way for vibe pretty much all the time! Please fix these things Corsair and make an Ergonomic keyboard that lights up and is wireless and fix your software for crying out loud! It's terrible to use! It needs to be easy! Just click on a key have a sub-menu pull up of everything you can have the key do and click on whatever you want the key to do! Simple as that! It's not hard to make the GUI for it maybe the programming but that's why you guys are a huge company with some of the best minds in computers so have them figure it out! Oh and the key's are so close together I hit the wrong key's all the time! And I do game and I prefer the Logitech Wave to this keyboard! The buttons are easier to use even though they are really sticky and gel like on that keyboard..but the button layout and the size of each button makes more sense so it's easier to use! The 1ms response time makes no difference at all in a game like Counter Strike Doom Apex Legends Call of Duty Battlefield Crucible Star Wars etc. I've got a TOTL gaming rig and this keyboard makes it harder not easier to play IMO! The idea for this keyboard is great it's just poorly executed from quality to layout to software programming!
1,So my Amazon account got hacked and the POS was sent to me.  The box says wireless gaming bundle which it is not.  The keyboard has a USB cord and the mouse has to charge via the USB.  Plus the keys are really tall.  I don't know of anyone that would spend over $100 bucks on this when you can buy real wireless bundles for under $40 bucks.
1,I really really despise this keyboard. I bought it back in November of 2020 and not even 3 months later I am dealing with a massive occurance of phantom keystrokes or connectivity isuses. In the middle of working or gaming it'd randomly disconnect and would not resolve itself and reconnect until the dongle was unplugged and then plugged back in. Additionally it would frequently repeat my last keystroke to a point it legitimately ruined a work document by backspacing continually.Seriously this is an awful keyboard. If you're looking for something RGB just skip this one.
2,I bought this from best buy but they do not let you update your review.  I've had this keyboard just over 30 days and it stays having connectivity problems. Why should I have to turn my keyboard on and off EVERY SINGLE TIME to get it working? Corsair sucks.
2,Just google it. And also put your money elsewhere not this one. On Win10 latest drivers tried everything to get it to work as advertised but settling because it's wireless. it's currently working but no RGB lighting anymore just dark. i say again.... ugh....
1,NOT impressed at all... it's laggy and the SW is horrible. purchased with the Corsair Mouse. they're both pretty but they don't live up to the Hype. the cheap $19 Logitech Mice/KB tracks and works better. KB sometimes just won't register a key press. and the ICUE software is HORRIBLE. was supposed to be able to chain them together using a common dongle but not these. you have to purchase a diff kind of usb dongle. (wrote this review on my $19 Logitech)
5,I have had many gaming keyboards and this is by far the best. I love the keys and it works perfectly. I can say that the wireless aspect of this keyboard does not last as long as i would like but it is easy to just plug in and use. So SOLID 5/5 for me. I would get this again.
2,The micro-usb port broke or the battery is dead. It worked well for a few weeks and it just stopped charging. Frequently tried to charge it again but still no luck.Wanted to exchange it but I just missed the refund deadline.
3,Good Lights it would have been fantastic if there would have been lights in the Volume Area  so it is just good
5,Beautiful keyboard with quiet keys and stunning RGB lighting! Connectivity is super fast and fluid I’ve had no issues with anything one of the best purchases I’ve made🔥
5,more than expected
5,I'm now a true fan of Corsair
5,Although I do wish I sprung for the newest one this keyboard is great. No problems so far and unlike many I actually like the icue software. Easy to use comfortable to type on.
5,I like it
5,This product confused me for like an hour because of there not being a usb adapter in the mouse where it said it would be and the box and manual said nothing about there only being the one on the keyboard but when you plug in just the one adapter both the mouse and keyboard work perfectly because corsair paired them to the one adapter which is perfect I just wish they said that
1,I noticed that certain keys weren't always registering. It started happening more often and I reached out to CORSAIR for a replacement and had the same issue. They told me that this was how the keyboard was designed and sent me a link to a Linus Tech Tips video. CORSAIR's customer service was difficult to work with and would not issue a refund on this defective keyboard. Handling the refund through Amazon was also a challenge because of the short return window.
5,y has arrived in the same day  please if something wrong happens to your that look like the dongle is not working download Icue  go to the dongle connect the keyboard via usb and click connect to your keyboard  the battery life I rest at least 7 days without no charging  when you not using the keyboard  the keyboard have a battery life mode that keep your battery
5,Really like this keyboard has a good feel to the keys makes the right amount of noise when pressed range when wireless is really decent and battery life is very good. Only downside is when wireless any customization you do to the colors goes away and it reverts to default. Also removing the keys for cleaning is very simple without the proper tools.
3,I love Corsair. Second keyboard I bought. And it is simply perfect. It has all the features and functions that I need.
5,The rainbow effect on the brightest setting is nifty albeit a little overwhelming for someone used to a basic backlit keyboard. Fortunately it has three brightness settings or you can even turn the effect off. This is a much sturdier keyboard than any others I own. Wireless works well even several feet from source. The iCue software that you can download from Corsair is nifty and I'd recommend it if you are curious about your computer specs/performance as it monitors and reports to a dashboard (my game PC did not have any monitoring software that I was aware of so I knew nothing of the temperature and speeds prior to iCue). I'm am an intro PC gamer but my advanced PC Twitch buddies have wired versions of these and similar and like them though they say that this wireless version could be a step up for them. I got mine used - acceptable - from Amazon Warehouse for an excellent price and it looks and works like new so I'm happy with this purchase. Even at full price it's a good price point for what you get. It is supposedly very fast but mostly I'm playing Minecraft and that's less important speed-wise than perhaps an FPS so I can't speak to that. I also have the Harpoon mouse that I got used from Amazon Warehouse and it works just as well as the keyboarrd and the rainbow light silliness matches.
5,Sturdy keyboard with great lighting functions I'm in correspondence with customer support right now and they are being very helpful about the keyboard not updating.
5,Best keyboard on the market. I’ve purchased about 6 different mechanical keyboard and this has the best feel and sound. Not too loud. Good warranty as well. My keyboard had broke after 1 year of heavy usage and they replaced it.
5,Easy to turn Bluetooth on and connect to pc I struggled a bit to find the usb clip to connect both keyboard and mouse it was inserted in the keyboard itself crafty slick sick great product
5,Loved the raised keys
5,Funca bien
5,I work at home and now can use one keyboard for both.It has 2 Bluetooth connections a Dongle option and wired option. good response on keys and accurate unlike a Red Dragon keyboard I bought that keys stuck. no lighting battery lasts 175 hrs. Full brightness battery is 8 hrs. O4n0e of only a new keyboards that have my must haves. lighted keyboard 3 connection types10 key num/cap lock lighted indicator palm rest (detachable). Bonus is  dedicated media buttons check 6 macro keys multiple colors. Contrary to another comment lights work regardless of connection method.I do wish it used a rechargeable replaceable battery but it will last to get value from it and will ultimately work as a wired keyboard if and when the battery won't charge years from on.
5,Now this is what I called high quality keyboard. It is beautiful well designed keys are perfect even the keyrest thingy is beautiful. It feels and looks high quality clean keyboard. I love it. You won't want any other keyboard. It is  a bit expensive but then again would you want a clean nice beautiful keyboard so you can code and play games more or would you want a cheap keyboard that ruins your experience?
5,I bought it as part as the AURA lighting system in my new desktop beast. The key action is crisp the programmable keys are convenient and the colors look cool. Glad I got it!
4,Overall it’s a good keyboard. It’s quite which is nice and it has a rechargeable battery which is also a plus. The only downside to it is that the wrist pad is low quality. I though it would be soft like their K95 keyboard. It’s just solid plastic. The wife ended up not liking the keyboard just for that reason so we returned it. If I needed a wireless keyboard I would consider this one seriously.
5,Look the look and feel of this mechanical keyboard. Great wireless use as well the charge lasts super long (2-3 weeks) although I typically have just left it plugged in.
5,I was looking for a good reliable wireless keyboard. This one was perfect. RGB is bright and vibrant. Keys feel great when pressed. It can be wired or wireless. Similar performance to my hyperx wired keyboard.
5,A lot of gamers will buy this keyboard due to the fact its one of the only good quality wireless keyboards. It is exactly that. No annoying wires. The key quality is great... the keys sound and feel great when pressing. Also I do not feel a delay between pressing and seeing the result on screen.
5,Super simple to sync using on my PC and mac mini M1.  I love the feel of the keys it’s not to overbearing mechanical wise there it’s super hard clicks.  It’s got a cushion to pad the hits.  I would recommend highly!!!!!  There’s no USB dongle just WIFI or up to 2 bluetooth stations or usb wire!!!!!
5,I got tired of having mechanical keyboards flake out on me from dog hair and other debris getting under the keys. This is sealed against spills fur and anything else that may leap across the room to frustrate you. The keys are tight give you the feel of a mechanical keyboard without the frustration. It has a large footprint which I prefer and is very nice on your fingertips.
5,Thr keyboard lights up beautifully and connects immediately to the devices i need it to. There is 0 lag on its part and the keys are super quiet when they need to be.The wrist support can be a little difficult to get use to because its hard plastic but with a little getting use to its a non issue.Battery life with it on 24/7 is roughly 2 days. It says something like 40 hours but im sure as the battery degrades it will get there. Turning off the flashing lights gets it to 4 days surprisingly so they must really suck that battery dry but it does what it says it should!The hotkeys are in a little weird position on the left if you are not use to it i didnt hotkey the bottom button yet because i keep clicking it thinking its the ctrl button but im sure with a little more practice it will be fineOverall great keyboard! Immediately installs on a myriad of different devices even a phone it took 15 seconds and was ready to use
5,Been gaming for all of my life been PC gaming for a good chunk of that.This is a membrane keyboard but I don't understand the to-do about blue/red switches. This keyboard works great its perfectly responsive and feels good to type on.Although yes for a membrane keyboard it is a bit pricey. But you have the option of wireless dongle connection or bluetooth and the battery has a substantial life going at least a week+ with ~8hrs daily use before needing to recharge.I have no problem with the iCUE app RGB cutomization is easy. Reprogramming buttons or creating macros is fairly straight forward. Although I'm not entirely fond of the macro-record button placement it isn't horrible.And I do prefer my volume controls on the left hand side but this can be worked around with the G1-6 buttons.For per-key RGB customization you will need to remain plugged in.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It has function keys to switch between Wireless and two Bluetooth channels giving you the option of using it with three computers if you wanted to.The keys feel nice. Good to type on; they're membrane keys which is totally fine for me and probably 90% of people.The RGB LEDs shine through the keys and behind the keys perfectly! I thought it would be an irritating gimmick but I actually like it a lot! iCue is easy to use and you can set macro functions from there.There must have been an update because I'm able to use the "Type" RGB function wirelessly (I left a video in this review) many people say they couldn't so that's not an issue anymore.EDIT: Keyboard Stopped responding and drops the connection. To get an RMA on the keyboard it needs to be shipped to Corsair. The shipping would be around $40 from Canada.Would I buy this keyboard again? probably not. Go for Logitech.Edit: Febuary 2021- Sent my keyboard to corsair for RMA it was an easy process while I had to pay for shipping (UPS Ground for $30) I got a new Keyboard sent back to me right away. I'm happy...so far.I still like this keyboard. I'm a bit wary about the longevity perhaps I got a lemon the first time? Hopefully my new one is better
1,I picked up a full set of Corsair wireless gaming products including this keyboard. Sadly I returned them all.The K57 has many issues which apparently is something shared by all of Corsair's wireless peripherals. The main issue is how to set up your devices. Don't bother with the instructions because they're all wrong. Here's how to properly get up and running:1) Fully charge your device before anything else. It's actually a thing with Corsair for some reason.2) Download and install Corsair's iCue program.3) Plug in the included USB dongle then update its firmware thru iCue.4) Plug in your wireless device directly to your PC via USB cable then update its firmware thru iCue.5) Unplug your device turn it on and pair thru iCue.After trying to get 3 separate devices set up that's what I concluded.Anyhow once I had it up and running I found it drops connection constantly even with the dongle not 12 inches away. Let me be clear: this was the first device I conne ted and installed; there were no other devices connected to interfere with the signal.It goes to sleep at however minutes you set it to but it takes a while to wake up and reconnect. And even with the sleep timer the battery lasts less than an hour - and that's with no gaming and the lighting down to the 2nd lowest setting!As for cosmetic issues: it's made entirely of cheap plastic; the LED bed is annoyingly exposed; the chassis is too tall to use comfortably with the wrist rest; and the cheap rubberized wrist rest connects like a hinge and swings freely. I know a few other manufacturers do this too but I'd prefer it snap on rigidly. The only thing I somewhat liked about this was the typing feel although it was a bit on the squishy side.I've used a lot of Corsair PC components over the years but this is my first time using their peripherals. I can honestly say they suck. The whole ecosystem is trash. Even their much advertised "Slipstream" is still in beta testing!! Oh and even if you can get the program (because it's so buggy Corsair took it down themselves) you can brick all your dongles! Honestly Corsair WTF??I pretty much cut and pasted this review for all 3 products I purchased. I could understand one out of the three having issues or being subpar - but all of them?!? After this whole ordeal aside from their PSUs and RAM modules I would not recommend any Corsair products.
2,I love the overall design and sensation with typing. Typing is soft and quiet and can feel a nice give-way when you press down.. However there's a major manufacturing flaw that totally ruins the experience; occasionally typed characters will be missed. This seems to occur when in some combinations two or more keys held down will result in some other keys to not respond to any presses. This has resulted in many typos due to missed characters. Ive talked to corsair support about this and they said "its just normal"... So its not even fixable...
1,Seriously this Keyboard can't think fast enough for my typing? It's always laggy missing keystrokes etc. it's constantly ghost-noting while I'm working in Pro Tools and screwing EVERYTHING up. Will not be buying ANYTHING from this company ever again. I knew it was hyped up garbage and still bought it thinking it can't be that bad.What a waste of money the most expensive 'Light Show' i've ever purchased because that's all it is good for.
4,The keys are just a bit too firm for my liking but it's still the best I've had in a keyboard in a while.  Only time will tell if this one lasts longer than most but I really don't know of a better keyboard for the price considering that it has both wireless and wired options.
5,El teclado esta en ingles la tecla "Ñ" es este caso es la del punto y coma y dos puntos. Es compatible con Bluetooth 4.0 y incluye su propio nanoreceptor con su tecnología inalámbrica patentada. Trae sus teclas macro para funciones múltiples.
4,This is a solid keyboard for the price. The per-key (individually addressable) RGB LEDs sold me. I was used to a laptop before so I'm used to a membrane keyboard. Some people have complained the keys are "mushy" but I myself didn't really experience that but they're definitely quiet which is a positive for me.
5,Très satisfait de l'éclairage durée de vie jusqu'à 170hr sans branchement (et sans lumière bien sur). Se connecte très rapidement. Pas eu besoin de rien configuré ordinateur flambant neuf et le clavier fonctionnait pendant l'installation de Windows.
5,Great keyboard overall I bought this as my computer room doesn’t have great lighting so it was hard to see the keyboard.  I mostly use it in static light mode but occasionally play around with the other modes.  Happy with my purchase probably about the best membrane RGB keyboard you can get.
5,El teclado esta bastante bien construido la señal con el Dongle USB es excelente lo uso ya que mis sesiones de juego son en la sala en mi tele grande  y la verdad es de los pocos teclados gamer inalambricos que sirven al 100%  hay otros Mecanicos pero son un poco mas caros (de Logitech y Corsair)  pero este tiene un buen tacto y sensación no soy muy fijado en si es mecanico y para mi es mas que suficiente recomendado.
5,Really enjoy using this keyboard! There are a lot of led settings and the charge lasts quite a long time. It's also a very quiet keyboard and it's comfortable to type on.
5,Ce clavier à changer mon expérience gaming PC pour le mieux rien à voir avec l'ancien Logitech de bureau que j'avais. Les touches facile d'accès l'éclairage c'est vraiment un clavier génial!
5,I absolutely love this keyboard. It feels great looks nice.. and the lighting effects are fantastic. Much brighter than your standard 50-70$ budget keyboard
5,Well it's heavier than it looks.  Why.  What eve. Feels good to touch. Feels not cheap and well made. Rgb is worth the buy.  Definitely a good buy.
1,One month of use and the USB plug on the keyboard is shot. We can no longer plug it in to charge.
5,This has a ton of color options when plugged in and you can layer them. It also has a really good response typing.
5,Très bonne qualité.  Juste en le sortant de la boîte quand tu constate le poids du clavier tu vois déjà que tu as fais le bon choix. Ca fait 1 mois que je l'ai et je suis pleinement satisfait. Beaux jeux de lumières et touches programmables. Il vaut son prix.
5,juste parfait arriver a dans les temps aucun problème boite impeccable tout fonctionne bien rien a redire dessus
4,This keyboard feels great and the response is good when I play MOBA games
5,Resulto mejor de lo que esperaba los colores son muy brillantes además de que puedes conectar el receptor wifi y bluethoot en diferentes equipos e intercalar entre cada uno
5,Muy buen teclado ninguna falla y dura mucho su carga solo un comentario deberían remarcar que no es teclado en español un poco más. Pero todo está muy bien
4,C'était pour un cadeau les couleurs sont vives et très pratique avec plusieurs options de boutons. Mon conjoint est satisfait.
1,Certain sequence of characters like "you" don't register and instead types "yo" when you type fast. This is unacceptable for a $100+ keyboard. Buyer beware.
4,Perfect for my intended use - work from home - not gaming.  Lighting and wrist support are good.  Noise is decent.  Battery life has been good so far.
5,very good
4,Corsair K57 RGB Wireless Gaming Keyboard is a good wi-fi device well built easy to use and delivery was fast!!
5,Perfect!
5,tres beau beaucoup doption avec le software icue
3,keys are too mushy. Returned the item as i did not liked it.
5,Solid response and feel. Favourite keyboard yet
5,Exactly as described. Fastest postage I've EVER experienced. So impressed ill be making future purchases.
5,The product came really fast and I am very happy with it. It was just what I wanted and of very good quality.
5,Gaming MMORPG / Utilisation courante.
5,Just an amazing keyboard and the macros usage makes life so simple.
5,Great item.  Light is great. well worth the money.
5,Easy to use nice but still makes a little sound when using the keys.
2,I tried to game with this .I feels cheap.Not worth 120.
5,Vraiment cool mon ado l'adore
5,Très bon produit
5,Works well.
5,Battery life is good for now
5,Good
5,Pour mon fils
5,Works as advertised
4,I may have to mess around with things a little but the wireless on the mouse seems to not work very well. Wired this is a fantastic keyboard and mouse set though. I will update the review once I have had a chance to try and get the wireless to work properly or not.
2,so i tried to really like  this keyboard unfortunately I couldn't get used to it. i found the keys to stiff for daily use and didn't bottom out well that's where it got mushy. I ended up getting a the gamesir GK300 which i found to be much better quality for gaming and typing. Which means i gave up RGB for only white backlit and programmable keys. which was okay for me as the key presses are much more satisfying.
2,The product is great physically. The only flaw is that each time I turn my PC back on I have to connect the keyboard via the provided wire because the Bluetooth on the keyboard fails to reconnect to my PC. This gets frustrating over time and makes me extremely disappointed with this product. However if you do not plan to use this keyboard for Bluetooth this is a great product. I will not be using this keyboard any longer.Edit: The keyboard's RGB lights are now frozen in place whenever I use the Typelight mode.
3,keys feel weird but trying to get used to it also whenever I turn off my computer completely the keyboard fully disconnects so I’m going to to try to resolve that or return it as it wouldn’t be ideal
4,Levo 1 año con el teclado y ya no funcionan las luces queria  saber cuanto dura la garantia de este teclado.Gracias
5,Perfect keyboard for work and gaming
2,Ich habe mehr Qualität erwartet. Es fühlte sich an wie eine wesentlich günstigere Tastatur.
1,me mandaron una versión que no incluía la tecla Ñ por lo que no era la versión Española procedí a la devolución.
5,For the people who thinks it is a mechanical keyboard it is not ! It is a silence membrane keyboard. I personnaly love the clicking and it doesn't make any noise and I like that. The desing is very nice with waves of RGB colors and over 16.8 million colors available and many template for lightning effect. But the price is actually too much for what it is !
4,This keyboard is an amazing wireless keyboard the only bad thing I find about it is the light while not plugged in isn't full custom only pre sets
5,Très bon produit à date.  Il est plus performant pour la batterie que les autres que j'ai essayés
5,Really liking the per key lighting macro keys battery has lasted a week and at 80% as of now. Best membrane keyboard I have owned. It’s sleek and comfortable. Plastic wrist wrest is surprisingly comfortable even with the tabs up to raise the keyboard.
5,this has all the features that i was looking for - nice solid keys removable palm-rest lots of programmable keys and great wireless performance.
2,If they are going to provide a custom USB cable can’t they design a solid connection point to the keyboard like a 90 degree angle or not at a location where the cable interferes with the laptop behind it. You need 3 inches of space behind this keyboard so as not to tweak the cable.  Doesn’t seem to charge at all now. Design flaw.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               C'est un Corsair donc ca fonctionne bien
1,Ik bestelde een "open box very good" toetsenbord beschreven als: "Kleine cosmetische onvolmaaktheid op de bovenkant voorkant of zijkanten van het item. Item wordt geleverd in de originele verpakking. De verpakking kan beschadigd zijn." en betaalde €7085. Ik kreeg een beschadigd toetsenbord zie foto's. De hele zijkant zit los. Past meer bij de beschrijving van:" ConditionGrote cosmetische imperfectie(s) aan de bovenkant voorkant of zijkanten van het item. Grote cosmetische imperfectie(s) op de onder- of achterkant van het item. Grote cosmetische imperfectie(s) op de binnenkant van het item. Accessoires hebben mogelijk cosmetische schade. Item wordt geleverd in de originele verpakking. De verpakking kan beschadigd zijn." toetsenborden van €59- Dit is onacceptabel en het toetsenbord gaat dan ook direct retour. Ik ga hem wel nieuw kopen.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,great product living it
5,cool
1,The good:The hotkeys are awesome! Easily programmable without any software just hit the Record key and make your macro!The lights are really pretty and have a variety of options very nice. :)The keys are soft & quiet enough to use in public spaces without annoying others.The bad:The 2.4GHz only connects within 2-3ft of the dongle and half of the keys do not register without it being plugged into USB.It is pretty heavy for a wireless keyboard and the material is hard on the wrists.The USB dongle stopped working two days after of the return period. Even when it was working there were many connectivity issues.Verdict: Save yourself from this and buy something more economical; the name brand isn't worth the paper weight.
4,It does what it should
1,3 dongles died in the last 2 months the product needs quality improvement in the Dongle. The application side: macro stops working after a few days. not happy with the product quality. also long wait time for product support
2,What a disappointment. The keys are pleasant to type the layout and look is fine....but why on earth would you advertise custom per-key RGB capability if you CANT have it in wireless mode?In wireless mode as far as lighting goes you are stuck with Corsair's stock lighting patterns. You can change the odd color here or there but it's a real piss-off that you buy the board expecting one thing and then finding out it's got an annoying stipulation behind it.Then... the software stopped acknowledging my keyboard being plugged in RE custom lighting. So... now I've got a keyboard that does NOT do custom RGB in wireless and does NOT do custom lighting when plugged in. HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME.
1,working 1 day then dead the next no warning no abuse and very gently usedwould not recommend
5,Best keyboard i've ever used. Super easy to type on. Very customizable and many rgb functions
5,This is litteraly the best keyboard i’ve ever had. I am a huge fan of Corsair’ products and I tried a lot of different keyboards for gaming/programming but this is just the best I’ve ever had by a mile. How I know it? This is simply a feeling. You can just type really fast without any weird mistyping that can occur for reasons you don’t really know with other keyboards. I’m just really hyped about this product. My pc setup is now litterally 100% Corsair’ products.
5,Muy buena calidad el producto es lo que promete quizá la batería pudiera durar más depende de tu uso pero inhalambrico y con el brillo al Max aguanta casi 5 días. El mouse aguanta mucho más casi las 2 semanas
5,Keyboard feels great customizable and multiple connection options. Lights go off if you don't touch it for a while which saves battery life. Only negative is that the Bluetooth takes too long to reconnect so I opted for the USB dongle connection to keep it wireless. Works great
5,Un excelente teclado cómodo de usar sensible a los dedos
5,Clavier de qualité !
3,The K57 keyboard looked promising but was more of a letdown.The keyboard is built from a cheap plastic frame which bends quite easily and will squeak if a lot of pressure is applied to it. The membrane keyboard doesn't feel any better than a 20$ Dell or HP keyboard and the keys are wobbly. The keyboard layout is really great and the macro keys are a sweet addition to it. Moreover the wireless technology is a great perk to have when you want to have a clean looking desktop. However the battery life isn't that great as I had to charge it twice a day.Paying a premium price for this quality doesn't feel justified and there are better alternatives (albeit wired) that feel and look better than this one.
5,That product was recommended to me for it can be customise and it is solid. That's why I like it.
5,I researched the hell out of this keyboard before finally buying it.  For the price point and features there is bluntly no competition.What sold me:• QUIET keyboard with good typing experience• Cool-looking RGB with lots of effects!• A wireless keyboard I could swap between my computer tablet and phone without needing multiple keyboards (has 3 wireless modes: dongle + 2 different bluetooth devices you toggle with FN key PLUS direct USB)• Volume and media controls• EXCELLENT RANGE (I stream my desktop to other screens in the house.  Never had a problem connecting)• Low latency for when I'm gamingThings to be aware of:• Hybrid mechanical/membrane - It's a little squishier/has more resistance than a pure mechanical keyboard but the typing experience is still good and far FAR better than your average membrane keyboard.• Did I mention it's QUIET?  (if you're a clacky-key fan this one is NOT for you)• Poly-carbonate body - It flexes a little but it doesn't feel flimsy• Per-Key lighting requires wired/USB mode (but works really REALLY good).  Side note: the iCue software actually works very well with the K57.  I was skeptical after my experience with other Corsair peripherals but in this case I've had zero issues with iCue.• RGB in wireless is still robust and has a lot of different options easily changed through the FN key and looks great.• I can easily get 2-3 days on a charge moderate usage all day long RGB turned on.Simply... this keyboard is GORGEOUS!  Not only that it's highly functional and won't break the bank like other wireless RGB options.  As long as you're not a clicky-key purist this keyboard should serve you well!
4,After about a month of owning this keyboard.. Battery life is good I only charge it about once a week or two with a quick connect magnetic cable for give or take and hour or so using the backlight at a pretty low setting.. No problems with wireless connection even with a Corsair Void wireless headset.. But the flimsy plastic connections that they use to attach the palm rest to the keyboard itself are horrible.. Happened to pick up the keyboard (wrong? I guess?) one day and all 4 of the connectors broke off of the palm rest.. so now I have a floating and sometimes sliding palm rest :(.. Tried contacting Corsair about a replacement palm rest for warranty or.. to purchase.. heard nothing from them and it's been days..
5,this keyboard is perfect.if you are good with membrane its good.I BEEN USING THIS KEYBOARD FOR 3 DAYS AND THE BATTERY IS STILL FULL. NO JOKES. IM ALWAYS ON COMPUTER.IM VERY impressed with the quality and duration of the battery.so every negative review on here is basically flawed. someone said its hard to type on this keyboard well it is but youll get used to it its actually hard to aim cuz the keys seem a bit smaller but its good still.no problems when you connect it it works right away. you download the ICUE software or whatever go on the official page of the k57 keyboard on corsair.com and the download is there.RGBs are nice and 3 dimmable options right off the bat on buttons i have not experienced much with the software but you can change colors and patterns im pretty sure.i didnt think i would use the wrist rest as i never needed any but its nicer with it than without it now i find..... its just plastic no rubber but its comfortable.no wireless connectivity issues.I wanted the aesthetics more than anything and its 10/10. I game 2 but not often on PC im more on xbox.
1,The battery life was short there were connectivity issues and the software is garbage
5,Je n'ai rien a dire par rapport au produit. Mon seul commentaire viens avec la photo....cet article vaut 130$ et il est plutôt fragile mais pas moyen que l'emballage sois adéquat. Une boîte beaucoup trop grosse sans bulle protectrice un peu ordinaire. MAIS LE PRODUIT magnifique!!
5,Corsair makes nice products got the RGB mouse from them to match
4,Only issue is if you want to have layered perkey or linking rgb backlighting which is half the price of the keyword it has to be plugged in to the pc/laptop. I found this misleading unless I over looked something in the advertising but I don't think I did..
5,Amazing keyboard
3,Was used for almost a year mixed gaming and word doc usage but the Left Shift stopped working randomly and just never came back. Pulled the key and nothing is stuck cant actuat it with anything. Just doesnt work.
4,Dislike- not a mechanical keyboard for that price point. Not that users friendly. No after sale support or tech support from Corsair.
1,I have been using it for a few months at it has been working fine but suddenly the keys are sticking and it is not functioning correctly.
4,Over all great! I love  the fact that i can use it on multiple devices in a click of a button as i use 2 laptops for work!Its very good for gaming too no issue there!The only heads up is that the battery life is not even close to what is advertised ( it lasts me around 24hr +/-)Not a big deal but be ware of it
1,BE AWARE! IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PS5! Don’t buy it unless you have a Bluetooth adapter!
5,Même a la noirceur on peut très bien le voir.
5,Came from a wired mechanical keyboard and was really worried that i wouldnt like the feel of the membrane but i actually like it MORE than my mechanical keyboard!Im really enjoying the light show but thats besides the point. Typing is much more smooth and comfortable with this keyboard. The battery life is decent but not amazing. I connect it every 3-4 days to charge but i used it with the brightest light setting so its still decent.I would highly recommend this to gamers and everyday users
5,Excellent produitParcontre les pieds pour relever le clavier plus haut pour l’ergonomie n’est pas asser haut
4,Keyboartd and mouse operate fine & have a good feel but the battery life isn't spectacular.
5,Ça fait 1 an que nous avons ce clavier et nous ne sommes toujours pas déçu! En plus de très bien fonctionner avec fil comme sans fil il est vraiment très beau. Il peut être programmé par l'application de Corsair afin que les LED s'allument selon nos préférences; chaque touche peut être programmée individuellement!
5,It was a gift and the user is very happy!
1,The keyboard was working very well for a few a month then the corded usb connection stopped respondind. Seller pls contact me.
5,Greatest keyboard I have ever purchased beautiful for gaming and typing.
5,I got this combo because I wanted a better keyboard/mouse to play and use to work.They functions and settings on both the mouse and keyboard are genuinely nice and can accommodate most of anyone would want.I use the keyboard/mouse around 8-10h per day but the battery life is a bit on the downside for me as the mouse needs to be recharged once a week. The keyboard hangs a bit longer but this is far from "months of use" that I was expecting.
5,Il et bien
4,Good overall keyboard but the wireless isn't as strong as It used to be DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE ICUelE SOFTWARE WILL ONLY CAUSE ISSUES
1,Gaming is mostly fine but when you type you get ghosting that’s insane to believe.Can’t type HUI in quick succession. Can’t type shift-U-Y such as BUY GUY in quick succession.Garbage.
5,I love that on the left hand side there are 6 keys you can bind to any action The RGB looks really good.
