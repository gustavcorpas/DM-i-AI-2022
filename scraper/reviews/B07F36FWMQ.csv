5,Re-read the title. It works and easy to switch for pc vs Nintendo Switch
4,This works great overall but causes my controller to constantly rumble when hooked up to the switch for super mario sunshine the whole reason I bought this.
5,Simple and easy to install and use. Just plug and play.
5,Very easy to install and works very well!
5,Worked perfectly showed up on time good value for its price. Not much else to say tbh
5,Took out the ol' GameCube and also used this to play additional games on an emulator on my laptop. Fun times
5,I really like this device and it works perfect
4,Bought this adapter because it claims wavebird wireless controller is suported but none of my two controllers works reciever shows comands are being sent but it's not recognized neither by swith wiiu or pc; tried a normal gamecube controller and even a ps2 to gamecube controller adapter and they work fine though.Tested the adapter with both usb cables connected.
5,Excellent adapter does what it advertises and is well worth the price tag.
5,Works great! Roommates and I love playing on our Switch. Good quality and cord length.
4,Does exactly as intended a bit of a noticeable delay but overall v good.
4,Make sure you plug in the black plug if you’re only using one - otherwise it doesn’t work. Working great to run Dolphin on my M1 Mac Mini!
5,It's a gamecube controller adapter it does what it's supposed to and at a really good price. But what sets this one apart from the others is the above and beyond customer service! When I finally had an issue with mine working with the rep was pleasant as can be and completely painless! They resolved it same day so I can be back at it with the Toon Link in no time! Highly recommend!
5,So i just got this thing in the mail today and I wanted to use it for PC. Well i was beginning to get worried cause it didnt work at first and I saw a couple of 1 star reviews from people saying it'd not work with PC... well i also found a comment saying that you'd need to set it to Switch/Wii U while also going to download "Zadig". I can report that after using Zadig (and youtube tutorial for Zadig) the adapter works with my PC as I wanted
5,Works well
4,Honestly it's not to bad but sometimes it messes up when I jave more the one plugged in.  I have to unplug them and replug them in and it works
5,I would like to clarify this can be used with dolphin with some setup.I used a program called zadig to Inatall the driver. When you use this program make sure wup-028 is selected and the USB Id is 057e 0337 then install or replace the driver.After this configure dolphin controller and select GameCube adapter for wii u
5,Works perfectly
5,Bought a GameCube adapter to use with Switch and WiiU. Works great and shipping was fast.
5,10/10 Exactly as expected
3,This product works for the most part but though my Wavebirds light up on the receiving end when plugged in they do not seem to function in Smash. The Switch does not react in any way to the signal they're sending out. Wired controllers do just fine.*EDIT* The seller was courteous about making things right based on feedback but there is still no Wavebird support.
4,I got this product to make it easier to play with my niece and nephew when I babysit. My nephew is obsessed with my Nintendo switch but we have a hard time playing two player with the tiny controllers that comes with it. I looked up the cost to get some controllers in the old Nintendo  or GameCube style and most of them are stupid expensive. I still have my old GameCube and controllers so when I saw this adaptor that allowed you to use them and was also cheaper I jumped at it. Very simple to hook it up to the device. I was worried that there would be some long installation process or syncing that I would have to figure out but it starts working as soon as you plug it in. You just have to go into the control settings and choose which controller to use. I give this a 4 star for only one reason and I'm not sure it's really the adaptors fault but a difference between the old and new systems. The controller buttons don't take the same actions that your accustomed to. Say you play a game that you play all the time with the switch controllers and the jump button would always be "A" but when you use the adaptor the jump button would be "Y" or something. You would have to get used to a new set of rules for the buttons. Not a big deal for me since I just need the extra controllers to babysit but I was still a little disappointed that everything didn't match up since I grew up with the old controllers and you can't use the buttons the same way you remember. Other than that I think it's a great product.
5,The product itself looks pretty standard but it works as it should. I was a bit hesitant to purchase at first because I was not too sure of the quality but after the first plug and play it did wonders. I thought there would be a lag with the controllers but I didn't experience any. overall very satisfied with my product. (Only have tested on the Nintendo Switch no turbo mode as of yet but am curious to see how that turns out).
5,Easy set up!
5,Some folks are claiming this doesn't work for PC emulation (I've tested Dolphin) with a wireless controller (wavebird style). I too was having difficulty but it's important to connect BOTH USB inputs to your PC. The gray USB when connected should allow power to your wireless dongle plugged into a port. If you only connect the black USB from the adapter the wireless controller will not work (black only works for wired controllers however). To accommodate my laptop (one USB port on left and right side only respectively) I had to cut the adapter cord to accommodate a wide split across my laptop. Once I did that and configured in Dolphin both wireless and wired would work! (for dolphin you don't need the "gamecube adapter" only the "standard controller" from the drop down).
3,The second port does not work properly. When attempting to use a GameCube controller in port 2 the left trigger button is rapidly activating making many games impossible to play. Luckily 1 3 and 4 still work so I can still play four player if one person uses the switch controller.
4,UPDATE: The seller politely messaged me to offer replacement. I had instead requested a refund and they graciously obliged. Very pleased with their customer service perhaps I was simply unlucky with particular item I received.---I had bought this to replace a broken gamecube adapter for my switch. I go to school so within the 3 months I owned it I used it relatively infrequently. It is now broken and will not register any of the inputs on my controllers.
4,just doesn't work when trying to play gamecube games on wii u you'd need mayflash
4,Steps to make this thing work:1. Leave switch in Switch/WiiU position and plug into PC with Gamecube controller in port 1.2. Make sure it comes up as WUP-028 when Windows detects it. If you move the switch over to PC it comes as a generic controller and won't work3. Download Zadig go into Options and enable List All Devices3. Select WUP-028 and then click on Reinstall driver.4. If using Dolphin go under Controllers and change Port 1 to Gamecube Adapter for WiiU. It may auto change it but not sure.5. Happy gaming!
5,This controller was a gift to my grandson. After two weeks he says it is amazing and much better than his previous controller.
5,I thought i had a defective piece at first but after searching online and following the steps so the switch can recognize the controllers it works wonderfully. Haven't had to do any additional steps or set up. Just plug in before the switch is on and you're good.
4,Probably the cheapest and functional 3rd-party adapter I've ever used for PC games and recent Nintendo consoles. I'd recommend the "Wii U" mode for accurate controller function (see screenshot) when using Dolphin.Do note that this adapter is not initially detected by Dolphin until you correct the software driver for this adapter using Zadig (available to download online) or similar methods. Thankfully a guide from Dolphin website ("How to use the Official GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U in Dolphin") will tell you how to get it working while using the "Wii U" mode on the adapter.Pros:- Controller function on-par with Nintendo and Mayflash brand.- Easy to use Turbo function for constant shooting jumping sliding etc.- "PC mode" for use with other PC games.- Vibration function when the grey USB plug is plugged-in.Cons:- "Wii U" mode doesn't work with Dolphin until driver is corrected by available software online.
4,How to install:plug the black plug in first replace the drivers with zadig set all the controller options in dolphin to "Gamecube Adapter for Wii U" and it should work from thereSome notes:-the switch on the back must be set to "Wii/Switch" even though it is connected to a pc the pc is going to pretend to be a wii-the device should appear as "WUP-028" in your pc's devices and in zadig's dropdown menu (options -> list all devices if it does not appear automatically in zadig)-use matching usb ports (example: if your pc has 2 usb2.0 ports and 1 usb3.0 port use the 2 usb2.0 ports)This took me way too much googling so hope it helps. The device is a little flimsy so it might break if dropped but otherwise it seems good.
5,I like the ease of putting it to work right out of the box. Wish it was a single usb though somehow
5,Every so often I have to replace game controllers now I don't have to worry with Nintendo systems on which one to pick.
5,Came a bit after expected but worked perfectly. Works with both old actual GameCube controllers and modern GameCube lookalike controllers.
5,I bought this not knowing what to expect considering it's only 16 bucks. I had previously configured the dolphin emulator to work with the genuine Nintendo adapter at an overclocked polling rate. I plugged this thing in its place and without even installing any driver it worked perfectly instantly. 1000hz polling rate. Perfectly responsive played using it for an hour with no issues. Make sure to have it set to Wii U mode not PC mode when using the dolphin emulator.I was playing Super smash bros. Melee.
5,para todo jugador de Smash rivals of aether brawlhala y cualquier juego similar es altamente recomendado.Sin contar su conectividad con la Pc y sus 1000 usos que le podes dar en la PC ;)
4,Good product for its intended purpose but if somebody walks by and gives you a static shock it shorts out and you have to unplug it and plug it back in.
5,One of the best adapters i have purchased on a long time i use it for competitive smash and its just like the original but at such a low price thats just a banger a must buy 🙌
5,Cumple con su objetivo buena compra me funciono sin problemas para conectar controles de gamecube al pc y a una Nintendo switch.
5,GreatWorks well
5,Works well I have no complaints I enjoy the product
5,Easy to setup and worked as described. I bought it to be able to add more players in Mario maker 2 and the controller adapter gave use two additional GameCube controller inputs to play 4 player games! See pic for all you need to play 4 players with Mario Maker 2!
3,Cheep and low quality. I would recommend the official one or mayflash but this one does technically get the job done.
4,I had no problems with it when I used it to play Smash Ultimate on my Switch.With Dolphin on the other hand I had to do a lot of digging through the internet to get it working properly. I know Zadig works for a lot of people but I didn’t have to use it when I figured out what to do. Kept it on the PC switch chose “Standard Controller” and configured controls as necessary. Triggers were iffy at first with Super Mario Sunshine but all I had to do was set the analog triggers (soft press on the L and R) and lower the threshold to get it working.It’s not exactly plug and play on the PC but again it may be different for everyone. I haven’t ran into any problems afterwards though.
5,Item was of the most elevated quality! Very swift dispatch. Quality of the wrapping was outstanding.
4,This adapter is sturdy with very good cable length. I've got it plugged into my rear USB ports and it reaches the front with plenty of room to spare. The ports are a bit tight but  it don't regularly plug/unplug controllers from my PC so I don't mind. Latency was impercievable if not non-existent.I exclusively use a pc so I don't know about the Switch/Wii-U compatibility but on pc mode my controller was instantly recognized as a dinput device which made it easy to set up on the Dolphin Emulator but not much good for other games. However I could not get it to natively work with Dolphin in console mode. For those confused there's a way to allow gamecube controllers to natively (with the adapter set to Wii-u/Switch) work with the emulator the largest benefit being rumble support. While the adapter has the right device ID and properly goes through the driver modification process it does not properly communicate with the emulator in this mode. So of you don't care about rumble this adapter is perfect for you.
5,Works very well with pc wiiu and switch
5,It's easy to use and it's aesthetically pleasing.  This product helps me connect my Nintendo Switch to my game cube controller.
4,Está excelente pero no se puede usar en PC en Switch no he tenido problemas.
5,I haven't had much of a chance to try it out but I believe it will work great when the time comes.
5,As title says this worked with my macbook using dolphin emulator perfectly!! I have both legit and knockoff gamecube controllers and theu both worked. It has 2 usb plugs so you might need an adapter if you have a newer computer. No complaints !!
4,I was able to make this work with Dolphin. When I first plugged it into the USB 3 ports in the back of my computer with 1 Original GC controller plugged into it Windows (10) did not detect any of it. Reading a review by someone else that said it works they had 2 controllers plugged into it so I plugged another GC controller into it and replugged in the USB ports (which I hadn't tried originally either tbh...). At that point Windows detected 4 GC controller ports. I loaded up Dolphin went and configured the controller as a Standard Controller chose DInput/0/GameCube Controller Adapter mapped and calibrated Eureka!
5,Works great it gives all features to the controller.
5,Haven’t tried this bad boy with my Switch yet but it work on the Wii U like a charm! The seller reached out to me a couple weeks after my purchase with some tips on how to use it and a reminder that if I have any questions they’ll respond to me directly. I always appreciate a genuine follow up like that! Definitely the adapter to buy if you want to put your GameCube controllers to good use
2,After 2 years of owning this product it finally died. I have been having issues with it for a while before it died too.1. The value for money is good here; it might last you 2 years and it's only $13 as of this writing.2. You don't know which USB plug is for it to work vs which one is for the vibration3. The electrical connections where the gamecube controllers plug in can get undone easily meaning that the controllers will 'disconnect' if not in the EXACT position needed.I really wish it was a more high quality product but it's not. If you need something for a year or two then this should work.
5,I don't have much else to say. It is what it is. Works good.It has a slider letting you adjust its intent so that it can communicate with a Switch or a PC. Switching is painless and easy you just flick a binary slider switch.
5,Purchased 2 of these for use with my Nintendo Switch and they worked perfectly. I would recommend using some sort of USB outlet besides the Switch dock with these if you use 2 due to the Switch only having 3 USB ports.
2,Worked fine using wired controllers but only the signal receive light works with wireless controller.  Doesn't seem to support wavebird controllers.  Wish they mentioned that in the description.  Build quality is really poor connections are loose and easily pull out.  Should have spent the extra money and got a Mayflash GameCube Controller Adapter.
4,Unsure of any latency due to a lack of tools for testing. Works for Smash Ultimate just fine.
4,I bought this adapter and works fine. I’ve only tried it for a couple of days and so far it’s fine. Only one time I’ve had to unplug and plug my GameCube controllers (which are third party controllers) to make them connect to my Nintendo Switch. It wasn’t that big of a deal because I simple unplugged and plugged the controls back to the adaptor and worked as if nothing had ever happened. I don’t know if this only issue I ever had was due to my controllers or the adapter but definitely doesn’t lag mid game. This happened to me when I plugged the controller for the first time in a gaming session. Again this has only happened to me once but so far it does the job. The price is great for the adaptor and and it’s nice that it has multiple options. I would give this product 5 stars but I don’t know if this one issue was because of my fault of not connecting well the controls or has to do with the adaptor or my control. Overall it’s great and does the job
3,Works amazing on Switch and I can use it for games like Smash Ultimate with no problems at all.However on PC it had difficulty detecting it (with the device toggled for PC input and both USBs in) and when it finally was put in none of my programs detected it as either a gamecube controller (I had an official one plugged into the adapter) or a Gamecube USB Adapter. Even after manually binding all the buttons (I had to didn't detect the buttons otherwise) the joystick and C-stick had issues with input.This was not a problem with my gamecube controller- as it worked perfectly fine for my switch and gamecube. This was a problem with the pc side of the adapter itself.
4,I was very worried when i saw the many reviews stating this "ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK WITH DOLPHIN" and "LITERALLY BROKE MY CONTROLLER WHEN I TRIED TO PULL IT OUT!!"To my surprise inserting and pulling out controllers was very easy even has a satisfying click and sound of the port going in/out almost like a high quality product and getting it to work with dolphin took all of 2 minutes worth of driver setup as per *their* instructions. So far this blows away mayflash for a portion of the price. But will it last as long is my concern. That's the main reason i haven't dropped the $25 on a mayflash because *everyone* i know has broken ports on theirs by now and they've been through two at minimum. For $25 i think that's unacceptable. So far i'm getting a bargain.
5,I bought this a bit too early so my return window closed right when the new Smash Bros Ultimate GameCube controllers shipped out today (Nov. 2 2018) which is the main reason I bought this.Thankfully I wouldn't have to worry about that because from my all-day-long testing it works perfectly with the Nintendo Switch without issue. For reference I tested it with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Super Mario Odyssey and even Okami HD.I also should add that I did not test this on my Windows PC so I can't vouch for the performance on that platform.The adapter itself has a long thick cable that feels durable. The body itself feels a bit more cheap than the official adapter but it doesn't feel flimsy whatsoever.You just need to plug in the black USB in order for the adapter to work but the gray USB is for the rumble feature if that suits your style.The controllers plug into all ports of the adapter and fit snugly no risk of it falling out during play.There isn't any severe input lag which I noticed during my tests.Overall: It's a wonderful well-made and budget option if you can't afford the official adapter. I highly suggest this but I highly suggest dishing out the extra cash for an official controller.**Freely skimp on the adapter not the controller.**
4,I bought these to use with DDR dance mats on PC using dolphin. They were able to be connected setup and detect button presses but seem to have a bad low pass filter or something because it would keep showing button presses/ no button presses when a direction arrow was held down (basically could tell when it was pressed but kept getting false negatives that it was no longer held down) so was unusable.I tested it with a game cube controller(3rd party) and it did work fine.I ended up trying out the 'Mayflash' brand one instead and it didn't have that issue/ worked great with the dance mats.If you just want to use game cube controllers this does work but for dance mats- it was super glitchy/ couldn't accurately detect directional arrow presses.
5,Works right out the box with no crazy setup
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Now we can all play Super Smash Bros. with our old GameCube controllers.
5,Exactly as described and great for older game emulation on a modded setup
5,Works for Smash Bros on Wii U works as a standard controller when plugged into a PC. Works on Linux too. Haven't tested it on a Switch but I assume it works there too. Only potential downside is that it doesn't seem to work with Wii U homebrew applications but this is to be expected as homebrew generally only supports the official Nintendo adapter so the adapter can't really be blamed for that but be aware if that's what you're buying it for.
5,It came right on time now I can play SSBU competitively.
5,Must have if you are trying to play like Super smash on the switch or something. This is one of the best items to get
4,This works with Dolphin emulator but it is not as plug and play as it seems. How I got it to work (Windows 10)1. Plug controller into first slot of adapter2. Turn adapter to Switch/Wii U Mode3. Plug adapter into usb ports4. Use zadig software to install driver5. In Dolphin use gamecube adapter for wii u optionYou have to keep the adapter in Wii U mode for it to work for me I couldn't get Dolphin to recognize this when it is in PC mode but with it in switch mode it is detected and has full rumble support. Can't feel any lag so so far so good.
5,This is working well for Dolphin on PC. There is a lot of discussion about whether or not it works for Dolphin.Here is what I did that worked on Dolphin build 5.0-12247:1. Set the switch to "PC"2. I plugged two OEM GameCube controllers into port 1 and port 2 on the switch.3. Attach both grey and black cables from the switch to my USB3 ports.4. I did not install any drivers like Zadig or other5. Go into Dolphin / Controllers set Port 1 and Port 2 to "Standard Controller"6. Configure the controllers in Dolphin In the Device drop-down I set the first controller to: Device to "Dinput/0/Gamecube..."7. Configure all the buttons in Dolphin8. For the 2nd controller also configure in Dolphin and set the Device to "DInput/1/Gamecube" and configure all the buttons.After this it's working perfectly.
5,Got this to play Smash on WiiU it works flawlessly!
5,The description telssit all. Good buy. 👍
4,Fast shipping. Sturdy product so far.Not as easy to use for PC as you'd expect. If you are using Dolphin you must use Zadig which is not easy to use for a normal user. I had zero problems using it however it isn't the first time I've used it either.So if you are using Dolphin with this emulator you need to put it on the "WiiU/Switch" option and use Zadig.
5,I got this for my Switch and PC and it works with Dolphin emulator! You just have to make sure you configure it right and that you disable the first two controller spots on Dolphin at least that’s how I got it to work. I set it to the 3rd spot in Dolphin and configured the buttons from there. I used to own the official Nintendo adapter and this CLOUDREAM one is every bit as good for less money spent.
4,At first I thought it was just a jank product because I could not get it to work even trying to troubleshoot and watch videos of others using similar products did not help BUT it does work well and is a good product. For those who had issues all I did was disconnect all wireless remotes and use a gamecube controller plugged in to the adapter after going to change grip/order of the remote options of the home screen on switch it seems to recognize the remote if other devices are not connected at least in my case.
5,This is cool and way better than the other adapter I had before. It works well for the Switch I haven't used it for PC yet but that's pretty much it about it a good product and the length of the wire has a good length.
5,I had some difficulty finding a USB-connected GameCube controller that didn’t have problems with stick drift. After a couple of bad purchases I decided to buy a model with better reviews that used the traditional connector and so needed a way to bridge that to my laptop. This adaptor from Cloudream worked great - plug and play controllers recognized immediately no problems with lag or sudden disconnections and no issues handling input from multiple controllers at the same time. My only annoyance is that it takes up two USB ports on your computer even when you’re only using one controller but figure that’s a small price to pay for an otherwise seamless experience. Can’t speak to the turbo function as I don’t use it but would happily recommend for all other advertised purposes.
5,Works as advertised. Don't even have to think about it just plug it into the switch plug controllers into it and it will start working. Game stuff gets banged around at my house but it is still doing its job!
5,I’m old and slow. And even I could figure it out
5,Though I don’t like to use the word perfect in this case the product has a slight lesser quality plastic to it the device has been perfect in its reliability and ease of use. It does come with instructions and the box it comes in is quite durable. I was surprised about the box. For cost it’s absolutely worth it.
5,Serves it's purpose. I think it's a bit too big but still works perfectly.
4,Thanks for prompt delivery.
5,Saw other users saying it’s not working for all star brawl on pc. It’s working make sure you remove ps4/other controllers from the steam controller configurator and select “generic controller support”. Mine didn’t work until I unchecked “ps4 controller support” despite not having a ps4 controller plugged in. I could see this causing confusion.
4,Item arrived in the most mangled packaging I've ever seen. It was bad enough that I just went straight to support chat then after they said to go ahead and open the bag it was in so we could test it to see if it worked I took photos first then opened it to test it.Thankfully it seems to work fine and hopefully it continues to. The c.s. rep was helpful and even issued a partial credit which while not expected was nice.
2,I have only used this adapter twice and on the second time the controller hooked to the second port was incorrectly reading that the controller was pressing the right trigger button repeatedly and did so with every controller we tested it with and no unplugging replugging resetting restarting fixed the issue. I don't recommend this adapter!
4,It does the job of more expensive alternatives.
5,Product functions exactly as advertised; bought the japanese import smash gc controllers and it works fantastically with this adapter. The design on the adapter looks dope too 10/10 product.
5,Works great!
4,Pros:- plug and play- use GameCube controllers on switch as describedCons:- occasionally buttons or analog stick doesn't respond or has a terrible delay unplugging and replugging controller and/or the 2 USB plus do not reset issue. I had to flip the switch from PC to Wii U (switch) then it would respond normally.Other thoughts:- I bought this because my switch pro controller had drifting issues. Using GameCube controller helped my SSBU gameplay surprisingly. The wavebird design is better than pro controller for playing Smash in my opinion after using it.
5,Plug and Play! Took 2 seconds to get it set up on my Switch just plug and play and works great  and turbo button also works. So far I’ve tested the GameCube controller on Mario Kart 8 Animal Crossing Super Mario 35 3D all stars (super Mario sunshine) and of course Smash Brothers. Every Game worked perfect as long as you don’t need to press “ - “ button.For PC mode I had a little more trouble. Did some troubleshooting in my emulator settings but was eventually able to get it working and it also works great with Dolphin emulator. (I use a MacBook might be easier with a regular PC)
2,The cloudream adapter worked fine from July 2021 to January 2022. When it was working it had an issue where sometimes the vibration would get stuck on until you made something vibrate in game. Other than that the turbo function worked all four ports were functional and it worked on the switch and pc.Last week I unplugged the adapter and plugged it back in and it suddenly stopped working. I tried using zadig to reinstall the correct drivers for dolphin and that didn't work. I also tried using it on my switch and it doesn't work there now. Switch modes from pc to switch doesn't yield any results.I'm at a loss for how to fix this. I'm going to buy a mayflash adapter because I don't want to deal with this anymore.
4,This adapter is great for Wii U users who play Super Smash Bros on Wii U or Super Smash Bros Ultimate on Nintendo Switch. The adapter is responsive and I had no lag while playing Smash on either Wii U or Switch. It works on PC nicely but you might have to make some adjustments on what you play to get the most out of it. Otherwise this is great for Smash players who want to use their Gamecube Controllers!
5,1. Plug both USB inPC MAKE SURE IT'S IN SWITCH/WII U MODE ON THE BACK (make sure its recognized in control panel if not replug)2. Download Zadig  (Adaptor software to make work look it up on youtube) and download/replace the driver it should NOT read as "controller adaptor" but WUP-028 if not you did not switch the switch on the back.3. On dolphin make sure under "controllers" that "gamecube adaptor for wii u" is selected and it'll work.
5,This made my gaming experience very enjoyable and gave me a use for my controllers. Been dying to use them since I got back into Gamecube games and honestly It's been a joy ride. I suggest it for others looking for a blast while reliving their childhood.
5,This works great with my switch and probably works great with other emulators but it doesn't work with dolphin as far as I can tell. So if you plan on using this with dolphin I'd recommend a different one like a mayflash adapter.
2,I got a defective product where there are some issues with inputs on the second port. I tested it with multiple configuration in smash ultimate but for some reason the system thinks the controller on the second port is repetitively pressing L or R (shield in smash ultimate) when I have 2-4 controllers connected through the adapter with port 2 being used.
5,Works!
5,Playing games such as Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart on the Switch it was somewhat difficult to provide 4-8 players an adequate controller without paying lots of money for extra pro-controllers/joycons (especially knowing some controllers tend to experience stick drifting). Owning some old GameCube controllers I decided to buy this adapter in order to make use of them. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase! The installation was super simple and quick. The connectivity between the GameCube controller and the adapter is also amazing with no issues of lag or connection errors present. This one-time purchase immediately resolved my limited controller problem allowing a more enjoyable gaming experience!
5,I used this to play smash bros on my Wii U with GameCube controllers and it works so good. No controller lag and works so great!
4,Switch worked perfectly plug and play no issues. PC will absolutely not work out the box. To save you some trouble look up zadig gamecube tutorial.You do NOT need the grey cable for vibrate on Switch it works perfectly with just the black cable.Side note this will NOT work for Nintendon't on WiiU or WiiU games other than smash.
5,The adapter is incredibly easy to use and isn't too large that it takes up lots of space. I did some cable management on mine for visual appeal since the cord that plugs into your Switch/PC is a little long for an easy spot right next to your system. If you've got a bit of space between you & your system though this thing could reach.  I've had mine for almost 3 months now never had any real problems with it during travel. For the price you're getting a pretty good deal I was a little skeptical at first admittedly. It's well worth it trust me I'm on the internet.
5,Have been using it for a couple of weeks now. Can confirm that it works for Wii U PC and Switch. For those planning to play Slippi using this adapter you don’t have to switch it to the PC option on the adapter the 3rd party software used to map the controller will recognize the adapter in Wii U/Switch mode. Great deal I love it!
5,It’s easy to use. Works out of the box and has a decently long cord that dovetails into two USB adapters for whatever platform you’re on. What more do you need.EDIT: This morning my GC controllers don’t register on my Switch anymore. I know it’s not the dock because the pro controllers still show up. I’m fairly certain both my new controllers didn’t crap out and it is indeed the adapter that has failed. I’m gunna seek IT support from the vendor and report back.As an aside I’m having no luck with this switch. 3 pro controllers developed drifts. The joys cons came with a drift and now my adapter quit. RIP
5,Works with Smash Mario Deluxe etc. love it.
5,loved it it worked like a charm out of the box on my switch and my pc
3,Only worked with my wired wavebird controllers not the wireless ones.  The wireless "dongles" light up when plugged in whenever buttons are pressed but controllers can't be used. disappointing.
4,Works just fine for my Switch and my PC. I returned it and bought a Mayflash brand because this one wasn't recognized properly by the Dolphin emulator if you just want to use it for your Switch or as a generic controller on your PC it works fine.
5,Love playing Mario Kart with my old Game Cube controllers
5,Had 3 working Gamecube controllers and didn't want to buy 3 pro controllers for multiplayer games. Bought this instead and worked with every game I tried it on.
5,I bought this specifically so I could use my GameCube controller on my switch to play Mario kart and it works perfectly! Been playing for several hours and had no problems during. Totally worth it.
5,Threw this on the switch to use the gamecube controller for Super Mario Sunshine.  Theres lots of fine movement needed for this game and the sensitive switch controller will put you into a full out sprint off of a cliff.
5,I really like these. I had a pair of Mayflash adapters that I've used for eight player smash since the Wii U days. However one of the Mayflash adapters had issues with some of the ports and the other seemed to work OK but had something broken rattling inside the case.So I decided to buy two of these to replace them. I'm very happy with them so far. They are more compact than the Mayflash still have the PC vs WiiU/Switch selector. They didn't seem to have any lag when I was testing them in Smash earlier.I can't comment on durability having just gotten them and I can't comment on the turbo button because I don't really have any use case for that. But these seem like good quality and I recommend them for use with Nintendo Switch and Smash Ultimate which is the main thing I've tested them with so far.
4,I bought this product to play smash bros and either the product is laggy or my new controller is. I even tried it without the product on my wii and there wasn't any lag in the controller. I personally don't use mine at all. So not a good buy but it's an okay product.
4,This product works fine and it's great to have to play Super Smash Bros with on my Wii U. However the other 50% of the reason I bought this was because I read a review that said they were able to use their DDR mats as well. This turned out not to be accurate in my case. To anybody that was hoping to get a solution to play DDR on their Wii U this isn't it. If you're looking just to play Super Smash Bros Brawl then this is perfect.
5,Purchased this to use a GameCube controller on my WiiU and it works like a charm.  Consider this your first option if you’re looking to use an old school GameCube controller on Wii or WiiU.  Definitely recommended!
4,I enjoyed this simple product. It does exactly what I bought it for. It allowed me to play with my siblings and father when I went over. It was actually why I bought it in the first place.
5,I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I'd been struggling with the thinness and breakable quality of the Nintendo Switch joycons and needed controllers that could stand up to the constant button mashing from more intense gaming. I got this adapter to use my GameCube controllers with my Switch and it worked perfectly! Super easy to connect and use for play. Keep in mind that GameCube controllers cannot be remapped but several games already have compatibility. At least for the games I intended to use the adapter for I'm more than satisfied with this! Highly recommend as it's a significant chunk cheaper than the official WiiU adapter.
5,It works feels pretty solid and the company emailed me on some tips on how to use it. Highly recommend
5,I’m surprised at how well this thing is holding up. I bought one from Walmart but after a week it would spaz out and not recognize our controllers. And so far inputs have worked awesome. Highly recommend
4,It's a controller adapter what else can I say. The only bad thing is that it takes up 2 of the three usb ports but I mean it adds up to 4 controllers. I haven't seen any latency on it yet so yeah. If u like gamecube controllers and already have one or two then buy it if u have the money to spare.
4,Works great with Smash Wii U and official Gamecube Controller. That is what it said it would do and that is what it does.It cannot however be used in other situations that the Gamecube adapter normally can. It does not work with the Dolphin or Nintendont emulators in Wii mode and doesn't work with Nintendont in PC mode.Plugging in a third-party controller failed to work and the controller subsequently failed to work with my old Wii. I do not know if the adapter killed it or if it simply chose that moment to die naturally. Neither would surprise me.
5,Id heard about some other types of gamecube switch adapters being of bad quality this one is not one of those. It works well and has next to no input lag. Highly recommend this one.
5,The only issues I have are that the turbo button included is a hold button and on the back of the adapter so it's not really usable and also it moves around way too much due to having no weight. As long as you won't use the turbo button it's pretty much perfect. (It even works as 4 individual generic joysticks in Linux which is a massive plus!)
5,Until there's more of the original adapters up for sale this will have to do.
5,I bought a different adapter before this one that really sucked. The adapter works great and the seller contacted me to confirm that I received it! Great service 👍
5,Thanks for making my son's Christmas! Now we can play Super Smash Brothers together!
4,Bought this in anticipation for Smash Ultimate on Switch. I can confirm it works great. There is the tiniest bit of lag but that is to be expected even for the official Nintendo adapter. Any adapter that converts GameCube controllers to USB will have a tiny bit of lag. It does not make it unplayable or even noticeable in most cases.  Ive used this with 4 GameCube controllers on ultimate and it works like a charm. It does come with a black USB and grey USB. The black USB is the only one you need to have it work. The grey USB is just for vibration rumble. I don't like that so I only plug in the black one. This also works with Wii U and PC. It works great with Dolphin emulator on PC as well!
5,Super easy to set up and great quality in material. Definitely worth the purchase so more people can play with more controllers.
2,Two inputs don’t recognize bumper inputs properly
4,Was simple to set up. Does not work for some of the games I want to play but that may not necessarily be an issue with this adapter. But playing old Nintendo games on my PC using a gamecube controller is peak nostalgia
3,sometimes the ports dont work or i cant click a button
5,This was the cheaper of the adapters I looked at so I got it. My boyfriend loves it and is very happy to be able to use his game cube controllers. It works very well and haven't had any problems with it.
4,This is great adapter and works well with the switch (which is its intended use). It does not however work with the Dolphin Emulator as there is a known bug (with Dolphin not this adapter). Other than that it's a great item and works well with the switch. I can use it on my switch and use my GB controller without issue.
5,Works as advertised
5,I still had 3 remaining Gamecube controllers and wanted to put them to good use on a newer console the Switch. It turned out to be a great investment.The item arrived completely new. It looks sturdy but it is also made with a very light plastic. I'm not sure how durable the adapter is so I'd advised to handle it with care. Like other reviews stated the black USB allows the adapter to be functional and the gray USB is an optional cable to access the rumble feature. There is a half-second delay to movements when playing Smash Ultimate but that is to be expected with any adapter.Overall I'm able to use my Gamecube controllers once again on a more relevant device. That's all I could have hoped for!
4,Works great with the Switch and the ability to connect to a PC is also a great bonus.I've had the adapter for several months now and it's holding up fine even after falling off our coffee table onto the hardwood floor.**If having issues on Switch or PC be sure to pay attention to which USB plug(s) you have connected.**
5,Works just as advertised very easy and simple
4,This thing makes it easier on me when I’m playing games like Smash Bros. Ultimate. I wish I knew what other games I could use this for. I occasionally experience some controller disconnection issues. But I’m not sure if that’s a result of the product or my own actions.
4,On amazon it is branded "CLOUDREAM." When it arrives to my house it's branded "pdobq." You can search "pdobq" on amazon and buy this exact same product for a few bucks less. They just edited out the pdobq on the device in their pictures.Feels more than a bit scummy.
3,I have purchased 2 separate adapters. Both have fallen victim to making the controllers clicking random buttons. The first one hits start every 8 seconds. The second one hits R every 12 seconds.
5,Works great.
4,Product works! There are just a few things to note. When plugging in the controllers you really have to push it into the adapter. Every now and the. The second player outlet does not work but aside from that it works great
4,It works perfectly for my switch the features on it all work well besides it won't work with my Wii-U. It's exactly exactly I expected plug in 2 cables and the controller and you're done
5,I bought this for use on my PC and can confirm that it works as advertised. My computer registers a gamecube controller as a generic usb controller that I can use in any compatible game. The one downside is that the rumble feature of the controller is disabled. Supposedly there's something you can download from the company for the adapter that will enable it but there's no URL on the paper instructions the adapter comes with from which to do so.
4,Don't use the native WiiU mode Dolphin's internal support for adapters doesn't pick this up correctly. It'll read as connected but once you launch a game it will bug out and not read correctly. Instead use the PC mode with "Standard Controller" and manually bind the controls yourself. Works wonderfully when set up properly!
5,I got this for the Nintendo Switch because the GameCube controllers  staring at me in the game room had no other use and 80 bucks for two Joy-Cons is a little overpriced or what they are. I got this for a cheap reason not to sell the controllers in the first place and it did the job. The built in turbo is ok but you have to hold the button down to use it and there’s no mode to let it run automatically. Besides that though there was one issue. No matter how hard I tried it wouldn’t work with my laptop which I was really looking forward to using it for as well. Besides that it worked.
5,Works great awsome response time.love it
3,Perfect choice IF you only have a Wii U or Switch. If you want to use an emulator (like Dolphin) you cannot use the GameCube Adaptor mode it will not work. You will have to manually set up each button AND you don't get rumble.If you don't use emulators it does work on the Switch and WiiU with rumble but your mileage may vary.
2,The 2nd port doesn’t work. I’d like to return/refund but by the time I realized the malfunction the return window was closed.
3,Tried all 4 of my Wavebird controllers none worked. Works with my two wired ones though. Being the newer version hopefully that works.
5,Works perfectly
4,I also purchased a "wired Game Cube Style controller" (Separately) and that controller is modernized and has a USB extension. Unfortunately I do NOT OWN any Original Game cube controllers so this adapter I purchased is essentially useless. I suppose it is a good adapter just to have.
5,It is very easy to use and set up and I haven’t had a singe problem with it
4,If you’re looking for an alternative this works great. It’s multi-platform so it works on the PC Wii U and Nintendo Switch. If you have a Gamecube controller and want to play supported games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate this is the perfect buy.
5,Great quality and works perfectly. I’ve used it on switch and pc without a hitch! Highly recommend!
4,Good but not if you want rumble. On most devices rumble works but with dolphin the rumble driver does not work. Did alot of work to try and make it happen but it didnt work out. If your buying this to use on your wii u or switch its great but for PC i wouldnt recomend it.
5,Easy to use just have to make sure you switch it the the Switch/WiiU option instead of PC when playing on well a PC. A bit counter intuitive but it works well when everything is set up.
5,Works with Linux Ubuntu in 2020. I restarted my computer installed all the necessary prerequisites and dependencies rebuilt the binary  and then I was able to get @ToadKing's wii-u-gc-adapter to work with a 3rd party adapter.Settings on the hardware are: Set adapter to Wii Remote mode (You might set it to PC mode doesn't work)Dolphin/Slippi: detects Gamecube adapter (not standard controller) poll rate is between 120 and 125 hz nothing else to do - just works.
4,It's a plug'n'play GameCube controller adapter. There is no lag as far as I can tell and the added Turbo function and PC compatibility switch are nice touches. Build quality is not the greatest but since this unit will be sitting on a table for the majority of it's life I can't imagine anything will wear out anytime soon. Will update this review if the product breaks.
4,Works great.  Only issue being that the controller would get stuck in the 3rd port.
4,The product is great especially considering it's a quarter of the cost of the name brand Nintendo product. However the only disadvantage (as is usually the case with not getting approved/namedbrand products) is that the product randomly disconnects. it does so very rarely but when you're playing a ranked smash game this can be the tipping edge you need to go into full rage. If you're more serious about your rank and willing to cough up $45 dollars extra for the Nintendo adaptor go with that. If not get this. Next best thing
3,Do not get this for use in Dolphin emulator get the OEM or Mayflash adapter for vibration and DK Bongo support. While you can technically use Gamecube controllers on the Dolphin emulator for PC on the PC mode it's only converting the input as Dinput which doesn't support vibration and DK Bongos. Compare this to the OEM and Mayflash where when you set the mode to Wii U/Switch and download the WinUSB drivers through Zadig as recommended on the Dolphin Wiki and you get perfect direct Gamecube input without having to manually map all the inputs. I just wish someone would've said something about this as this is one of the most bought Gamecube controller USB adapters on Amazon.
4,Took a bit of effort to get dolphin so support it natively like the mayflash but it worked with Zadig. I feel no input lag whatsoever. It's pretty good for the switch but for PC I'd just get a mayflash.
5,IT Is A CHRISTMAS present for my grandson
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I don't want to brake my controller cause got stuck in this thing. Test all ports with an old controller before use. I don't see any release button either.
5,It works as it should with my nintendo switch and super smash bros. Check if your TV has a "game mode" in case you get input lag
4,Great product overall. My main purpose for purchasing this adapter was to play emulated Gamecube games on Dolphin for PC. The setup is a little tedious and confusing but that is not the fault of the adapter more-so the program.
5,Very nice and easy to use. I got it for the switch and it works perfectly. Couldn't be happier.
5,I recently had purchased Super Mario 3D Allstars for my Switch. Remembering how much fun I had growing up playing Super Mario 64 I almost forgotten how sensitive and frustrating the joystick movement was. I found out you could use old Gamecube controllers to play with just needed the adapter. This one came up and i'm definately happy I got it. So easy to connect and get that older controller gameplay.
5,Works with Wavebird on Dolphin
5,Used  it a Nintendo switch
4,This GameCube adapter arrived in perfect shape! Little did I know it’s only compatible with 1 game on the WiiU and it wasn’t the game I wanted to play.
4,TL;DR - I have no problems plug&play even supports pc.Used it to play smash bros and mario kart on my switch with ancient gamecube controllers. Takes up the two front USB's but thats fine since most of the adapters looked like they did the same. There does seem to be some small input delay but I cant say if thats just an old controller the adapter or even just the TV. Apparently this also works with Wii U's and PC (guess for emulation or if you wanna try remapping steam games to it).
5,Easy to use and works well
5,This works great and allows me to use my gamecube controllers with my switch. It allows me to play smash and other four player games without the need to but all new switch equipment. A must have for people who want to do local multiplayer. I don't love the text and stuff on outside I think it looks bad. But it's cheap and does the job well.
5,Very good
5,Product came in fast nothing wrong with the product works with original and third party GameCube controllers. Easy to use.
4,I got this for my Nintendo Switch in order to play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and I am very pleased. I have had absolutely no issues so far. One thing that's a little concerning is the overall build quality. It feels like it's made of some fairly cheap plastic and the USB cables are a little low quality so I don't know how long it will last if you're someone who has a lot of people over. Overall very pleased with the purchase!
4,I bought this adapter the same time I bought a GameCube controller. I honestly didn’t know what to expect but when it came in and when I plugged it in it worked like a charm. By having rumble and a medium range cable it was pretty easy to place it next to the switch dock. It’s also worth your money
5,it works perfectly. i use with my PC toplay melee online and with an original gamecube controller. i’m sure it works with other controllers and on wii u no problem
5,It works as intended and has plenty of cord if you have to sit pretty far away from the screen.
5,I bought this adapter to use my GameCube controllers to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch. It does the job beautifully. I have not experienced any lag and it was extremely easy to set up and start using. Very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others.
5,Was kind of sketched out about buying since I don't usually buy after market stuff for consoles but the adapter that Nintendo was selling was way to expensive so decided to try this out and let me tell you it was the better the decision. Worked right out of the box plugged it in and started playing mario kart 8 on switch and haven't had any problems with it since. Very easy to use and looks like it can take a couple drops.
4,The product was easy to use and simple to install didn’t need to spend on the big name brand adapter either
4,It works if you need/want GameCube controllers for your Nintendo Switch or WiiU to work. Is not compatible with Dolphin Emulator on PC and doesn't work super well for my purposes on PC. If you are getting this for Switch or WiiU it will work fine. For PC and specifically Dolphin emulator get something else.
4,I did run into some issues pairing this with the Dolphin emulator but it will work with it for sure.
5,I was able to play Super Smash Bros on the Wii U with Gamecube controllers which was exactly what I wanted. Thumbs up
4,This took awhile to get set up. And ports 1 and 2 were switched for me when I tried using this for the dolphin emulator. But eventually it worked and at such a low price it’s definitely worth it
5,This GameCube adapter for the Nintendo Switch really is easy to use. The sheerness that it connects with is quite the value for money. We have an old Wavebird controller and adapter and a regular corded GameCube controller and both worked wonderfully when we played Super Smash Brothers! Great purchase!
4,Works well in windows. It automatically recognizes 4 controller inputs. Just make sure to set the switch on the pack to "PC"Tried it with official gamecube controllers. Worked perfectly. But the controller ports are a pretty tight fit you really have to make sure they go in correctly.
5,It work well on the switch and on the Wii u but on the dolphin emulator I couldn't get it to work in the Wii u/ switch mode like how the mayflash can. You can switch it to pc mode and set it up as a standard controller and it feels alright as far as I have tested just a shame that it couldn't work like the mayflash in that regard.
5,For the $16 I paid I am impressed! I was expecting some sort of input delay when playing smash ultimate...nope! This works perfectly! For those wondering I use Jigglypuff and hitting rests with a gamecube controller plus this works a LOT better than a PDP gamecube controller (what I used previously but cracked when I forward smashed)! Do yourself a favor and get this along with a gamecube controller! I guarantee you that you won't regret it :)
5,It worked fine
4,Didn’t work as I expected.  Analog sticks would not work.  No was to adjust no software.
4,This is useful because you can connect your gamecube to the switch without any issues. The only problem is that even though it says it's compatible with PC it actually isn't and it doesn't work with Dolphin. For that the Mayflash adapter is the one to go for but for Switch this is a good product.
5,I use mainly this GC adapter for my switch and pc and it has worked flawlessly. I didn’t noticed any lag or anything major about the unit but I would recommend it for the value and Nostalgia play smash and other GC games with the Original control. I also use the adapter with some original and 3rd party controllers. 10/10
5,I've had this for awhile now it's holding up very well I haven't had any issues with it!
5,Works perfectly just plug it in and you're ready to go. Honestly it's way better than buying a usb controller that only semi works.
5,This product is surprisingly durable. I have accidentally left laundry baskets full of clothes sitting on its cord overnight and it still works perfectly. There is a cool switch on the side that lets you switch from console to PC connection and both work amazing for me. I was skeptical of buying a product like this because I have purchased other brands for other consoles before but this one works like a charm. I recommend this product to anyone who is even considering to get this.
4,Very easy to use and has given my family hours of classic fun on the switch!
5,Cheap price does what i need. no complaints yet.
5,Feels well-built works flawlessly (no obvious latency or dropped inputs using 4 controllers on Super Smash) and the cord length is long enough to extend from our entertainment center to our coffee table where gamers'll hook up to the adapter. Some rubber grips on the bottom would be a welcome addition (would prevent sliding around) but it's cheap and excellent.
4,Definitely easy to use. Great Price and excellent mechanics behind the reaction time with the buttons. Haven't had a problem yet with this practical device. I would highly recommend this to gamers whether for PC or Nintendo Switch
5,I exclusively bought this to connect my original Nintend-licensed DK Bongos to my computer. The bongos work flawlessly including with the microphone. Getting the settings right was difficult but once set I never had issues since. Worth it to recapture the DK Bongo experience.
3,It was plug and play with Slippi on my Mac and it worked fine for Smash Ultimate on the Switch but the main reason I bought it was for using to play GameCube games on my Wii U which it unfortunately cannot do. I returned it and bought the Mayflash instead and have had no issues.
5,This worked great! I wanted to be able to use GameCube controllers for playing smash bros on the Nintendo switch and the product did the job. I read a few reviews about connection delay but I didn’t seem to run across that problem at all. I would say this is a safe bet for your money.
4,Does not work for Linux computers. Seems to work fine on Wii U and Switch.
4,Plain and simple a adapter for the gamecube works perfectly fine aswell love it.
5,Excelente
4,Was extremely difficult to get zadig up recognize this adapter to setup  slippi. Through sheer luck i was able to get it to work.+1  for low cost
5,Works exactly as advertised and arrived quickly
5,I lost my Nintendo adapter while traveling and got this as a replacement and it works just as well as it for way cheaper. If you want to play smash or whatever game that supports Gamecube controllers it works like a dream.
5,Great for using GameCube controllers (super smash)
4,Works well and fairly straight forward out the box.
4,Pretty straightforward. Works everywhere I’ve tried it too. Raspberry Pi 3 & 4 Switch PC. One plug for the power one is for the controller support itself FYI.
5,Works great do not hesitate to buy. Company even reached out to me to check if It was working correctly.
4,Overall a good adapter for the Switch and Wii U (but who is still playing Sm4sh anyways). Only complaint is that it feels that the controller can get a little stuck making it slightly difficult to remove from the adapter but its not a deal breaker.
4,It works great! The only downfall is that it had two USB plugs and it’s confusing sometimes which one to use. But overall worth the price!
5,I’m using it for my switch. I have no issues so far. I was kinda worried it wouldn’t work or it would break easily but nothing so far. I know reviews seem fake sometimes but this is actually a good buy
4,Simple to install and works immediately. No special setup or configuration. Cable is long enough to support gaming from a distance.
5,I like its simplicity. Though it would be nice if the Switch could provide a way for it to use only one USB rather than two USBs (not sure if that is the accessory manufacturer constraint or the switch constraint).NOTE:  You will have to check the games for compatibility regarding if it can be used along with rumble features potentially being lost. (I knew this in advance but not every game is suited for a GameCube controller).
5,My boys love it - they are 17 and 19 so not ‘boys.’  But they say it works well.
5,While the pro controller for the switch is good Super smash brother is best when played on GameCube controllers.This adapter worked instantly with no need to set up on configure with the switch.The cable is long enough that I didn’t have to move the switch closer for a wall mounted tv.
4,Great adapter if you need it for switch. Worked plug and play. Did not work for dolphin on PC. Would recommend a mayflash adapter for that instead.
5,At first built quality was questionable as with all things from Amazon these day. I used it with Switch and emulator playing Mario Cart. It work great. If you play any multiplayer GameCube Games you need to have this one.
5,It’s works much better than expected. would buy again. and again. as long as the price is right. i really wanted the official one but this is just as good. no doubt. Works just like the Nintendo one.
5,Works perfectlyI have used cube controller for a ton of switch games with no issues. Of course great for Mario Sunshine. Package says rumble is not supported but this also works perfectly so far (rumble feels good/ correct in games)
5,I purchased this roughly a month ago and had it delivered that same month and I have to say it was frustrating to setup for my PC at first. Product did not come with instructions for PC but lucky there’s tutorials online for this. The PC switch doesn’t work with the Dolphin emulator. To fix this switch it too the WiiU option and then use a third party program called Zadig to change the driver to winUSB all while the adapter is plugged in to your computer ports and it will work. I’m very pleased with this product works with Wavebirds as well as third party GameCube controllers. I recommend this product!
5,I actually have nothing bad to say about this product it does exactly what it says I’ve been using this for a while now and I haven’t had any delay issues compared to a regular pro controller would recommend for those wanting the most optimal play for a low price
2,Adapter worked for a couple of days. After that it would disconnect the controller and reconnect randomly.It didn’t work for me it might work for you.
3,Now if you are getting this to work on a Wii u or Switch this is pretty good but if you plan on getting it for pc just don't. When I got it I wanted so I can play Gamecube games on an emulator with the actual controller but when I plugged it in nothing worked. I did everything everyone else said but it just didn't work for me. So I returned it and got one from someone else and it works perfectly.
5,Bought this to play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. In training mode on the slowest setting and with a video camera I compared the frame lag to using a USB controller and the lag is negligible - 8 frames of lag with the adapter and 7.x frames with a USB controller.The setup is easy and the adapter comes with clear instructions if you are confused. The cable that comes with it is as long as the cables on GameCube controllers so it doubles the distance you can sit from your console.Excellent product. Highly recommend it!
4,This adapter is a bang for your buck.
5,An honest to goodness plug and play solution. Worked flawlessly. I would definitely recommend this especially since it’s at such a great price point.
2,It worked well for 3 months then it stopped responding to the controllers.
4,Works fine in HID mode with Linux. Works with the Switch as expected. Not sure why it has two USB plugs. Power when using 4 controllers maybe? Cable is a little obnoxiously long but some might find that a plus I suppose depending on their living room size.
2,Well I can confirm it does work with Dolphin.  Bad news is the 1st port was only semi-functional twice.  When I received my first adaptor I realized the C stick was "sticking" in the calibration.  Did the usual reading tried different drivers messed with deadzone.  And then tried the other ports and they were fine.  Contacted the seller and they send me a second one.  SAME PROBLEM!So being bored and having a soldering iron I cracked open the first one having verified that ports 234 worked fine and moved port 4 to port 1.  Same issue.  Port 1 C stick still goes full right unless you go right and then left to recenter.  Back to port 4 (old port 1) and everything works as it should.Bottom line - if you want to play with 3 people this will be fine.  If you want 4 player action try something else.
4,Tried to use this to connect a wii/gamecube dance pad to the Nintendo switch. Found out the pad was primarily the issue and not the adapter itself. Connection into the adapter didn't feel super firm but might be fine with further testing.
5,Works like a charm.  Only thing to note there are two colored USB plugs and as someone who didn't read the instructions I deduced from trial and error that one USB plug is for PCs the other is for the switch (I think it's the grey one).  Just a heads up
4,Arrived quickly works fine
5,Works with version of dolphin as of 7/21/21.Works with both OEM and third party controllers. Would recommend.
5,Works well. No lag.
5,My adapter came in super fast and works great! So happy with my purchase! We initially bought it for the switch but use it for the computer too. It’s easy to use. It only has a switch to change mode when connecting it to your pcswitch and Wii U.
5,Got this for my 3 boys who play smash bros and like to use their Gamecube controllers on the switch. They love that the cord is so long and they can all connect together and play.
5,This is exactly what we needed to hook up our controllers to the Nintendo switch. Fast service.
5,1st party didn't need a switch to tell it work on pc wii/wiiu etc.Although Works just fine. I won't be using it unless company is over. Just nice to have some stuff around for get togethers and such.
5,My family has always held onto the game cube remotes as Nintendo thankfully allows its systems to continue to use them with every updated or upgraded game console so I’m so happy to have a product like this to connect to the switch that allows the GameCube remote to be used.
5,Was good my emulator couldnt read it but thats to no fault of the product. Nonetheless i didn't read before hand that Dolphin emulators dont work with third party adapters and now i have an adapter but nothing to do with it xD
5,It's very easy works perfectly except for one VERY SMALL flaw. Every now and then I just have to unplug it and plug it back in to have it work. It never disconnects while actually playing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great value and easy to use adapter for 4 controllers. Only requires one simple plug and is a nice compact and sleek black box that blends in with my entertainment system. It works just as expected no problems at all and makes gaming fun and easy for the family.
4,I personally have not been able to get this to work with my computer setup but for the Switch it does exactly what you think it'd do. Enjoy Smash Brothers!
5,Overall I really like how simple it is to use however I don’t know what to use the turbo button for and it doesn’t state it anywhere as far as I know the cables are long but if they were shorter it wouldn’t matter since h connect it to switch or Wii U or your pc overall it does what it says and does it well
4,Unfortunately it doesn't work for laptop  only. I Don't doubt it works fine.
4,Works well on wii u for super smash brothers but doesn't work on vwii with usb loader gx.
4,It works ad easy as advertised my only issue is the rumble function doesn't work with the Switch.
5,Easy to use works fine with our gamecube controllers and the switch had no problems detecting the controllers. Instructions could have been more specific to the switch as I think they were more for the wii U but end result was good.
5,I've been using this to play Smash Bros with a gamecube controller. Works great! It's long enough where I can still sit comfortably on the couch and not risk someone tripping over it if they walk in front of the TV.
5,So in order to use this device you have to tell the Switch to search for new controller then it should show a USB controller then press the left and right buttons and it will then be in plugging in other controllers press the left and right buttons and they should show up. Exit it out and go Game. We are using this with Smash Brothers Ultimate with our old Game Cube controllers and this is a works great no lag and if you plug up both USB plugs into the Switch you get the rubble. I really like it. Good value for the money.
4,Took a bit of time to make it work for dolphin emulator but it worked out in the end.
5,My sister and I use it to play Game Cube games on our computers. My sister has not reported any problems with installation or after many hours of use. It took me some time to figure out how to configure it with my software but after that I had no problems. Would recommend. 9/10
4,Works very well with Windows 10 and both original and repro controllers.Small niggle in that it takes two usb slots.
4,Plug and play.
4,Easy to use
3,overall it's fine for casual use but I had a lot of trouble dashing in dolphin melee.
5,It's small and light-weight easy to use. I use it with my laptop. At first I was concerned by the two USB cords as I don't have many ports on my laptop but only the black USB cord is necessary for the adapter to work.
5,Got this to use with a Switch works so good! Love being able to use old GamCube controllers again brings me back to my childhood
4,It sometimes doesn’t work but usually does.
5,Works as intended for my Switch's docking station and has been working these last few weeks. A good alternative if you prefer the original ports instead of today's Gamecube controllers with USB ports.
1,If anyone is wondering this does not get recognized in Dolphin on PC. I also couldn't get it working on Wii U either even though Wavebird light is on. Buttons wouldn't work.Also the turbo button looks much different than the product photos. I'm guessing I was sent an older model.
4,I love the product but it is too tight and worries about it breaking my GC controlled
5,I liked that it was super easy to set up! It’s not too lightweight which I also like because it makes it seem a little more higher end. I use this on my Mac to play gamecube games and it works great! No complaints
5,This is an excellent tool for using your old gamecube controllers on your switch.  5-stars.  Only downside is there are no home or +/ - buttons on your gamecube controllers.  Keep that in kind when purchasing this.  Great for same screen multiplayer!
4,Works great with wired GC controllers and Wireless Wavebirds. I even got it to work for an off brand wireless gamecube controller. Definitely reccomend as an alternative to the expensive Nintendo licensed adapter.
4,Came in a timely manner easy to use. Exactly what we were looking for
5,Great but there are two usb plugs one for switch and one for wii. Well one is grey and one is black but there’s no way to know until you try them. Minor nitpicking but fantastic otherwise
4,It’s good now I can play with all my friends on the Nintendo switch
5,Works great. I didnt want to spend money on the newer GC controller models when I had 4 original ones in good condition. I’m glad I decided to go with this rather than new remotes good for parties lol
3,It works mostly fine with my Nintendo Switch however it sometimes would not get input from individual buttons on my controller. This issue was fixed just by unplugging and plugging back in. However when I tried to use my gamecube controller with Dolphin my PC would not recognize the adapter whether it was in PC mode or Wii U/Switch mode. I'm going to try returning this and going with a Mayflash adapter which I hear works better on PC.
4,Easy to use - Essentially plug and play.  No hassle does what it advertises and is reasonably priced.
4,Works great all four of the ports work and I can play smash with my friends and I haven’t had very much input lag!
5,It takes a small bit of setup if you want to use it on Dolphin (the correct drivers aren't included; you have to look them up yourself) but works flawlessly afterwards.
5,I got this to play oot on my laptop. Honestly it works just like an official nintendo adapter I havent had a problem with them yet. I couldn't recommend them more!
5,Awesome product worked right out of the box and I didn’t have to download anything else. If you use this just know you don’t have to remove the drivers for the device it already comes with it.
4,It was a great fit for the original gamecube controllers I had but not the no name cheaper gamecube controller it just wouldn't push in to stay in place but overall a good product for the price
4,You plug it in then plug more stuff in.
5,Works identically to the official gamecube adapter.  There are functionally no differences.  Rumble works no lag even works with my wavebird.  Great to save a few bucks.
5,Thought I was having controller issues but my adapter (different model) was malfunctioning.This new adapter plugged right in and controllers worked perfectly.
4,Works well on the Switch and PC (but if you're wanting it for a modded Wii U for stuff like Nintendont and stuff it won't work. Only works for Smash 4)
5,Very easy to use. Very easy setup. It works perfectly for the Nintendo Switch (and PC). It is a bang for your buck!
4,Took a bit to get driver's right but after that's works great. Thanks
5,Super nice! Just plug in play on the Switch dock. If you're like me and have a ton of Gamecube controllers (4 of them for me) from playing Super Smash Bros Melee in the past this is a must!
3,This ended up working well for me to be able to use multiple gamecube controllers on my gaming PC but it did not work in native mode even after following multiple guides on different websites. When putting in in PC mode it works fine but I would have preferred the setup-free native method. I'd order another one though just for the fact I can have 4 controllers sharing a single USB port.
4,Great product. Works well for Super Smash Bros Ultimate on Switch.
5,Works great for the Switch. No lag between the controller and the buttons and sticks feel just like the original Controllers that came with the Gamecube.
4,We got this for my granddaughter wii it works great
4,The adapter I originally got didn't work. However I was able to get it replaced with a new one free of charge and the new one worked right out of the box. A worker from Cloudream reached out to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I can happily play Smash Ultimate. I'm giving it 4 stars because the first adapter didn't work.
5,I was a bit skeptical about it since The Nintendo brand is nearly 50 dollars more but I’m glad I bought it. I have old GameCube controllers that still work and they worked with this adapter. This saved me from buying switch controllers and saved me from dishing out money on the more expensive adapter!
5,Exactly what I wanted. Works perfect got here quick and was a very reasonable price. 10/10 order right here.
5,I honestly didn't expect this adaptor to work as well as it did. Very impressed. It's made gaming for our Switch much more family friendly
4,Works for Switch and PC. Can finally use my Gamecube controller
4,This worked perfect when having multiple players. Easy to setup & use.
4,it wasn't working right away but i was able to get it to work after a bit
4,Easy to use
4,Its works decent
5,I know nothing about this product however after my sons9 & 13 cracked their Wii U gamepad this was a dream come true! My 9 year old researched it with his older brother and they said it would work...I was skeptical but thought it was a reasonable chance to take it was!! Works great and they are happy and so was I to find an outcome to a problem for such a good price!
5,The adapter is plug and play and works flawlessly I mainly use it for my switch so the long cable it has is great so I can move it around my TV setup closer to my couch.
5,I wanted to add that the adapter works amazingly for the MacBook Air 2020 with M1 Chip!
5,It was perfect for what I bought it for. I have had it for a few months and still performs like I just got it.
5,Extremely affordable and does exactly as it should. Much better than spending $45+ for the Nintendo one when you can just save money.
4,Functions the way you expect for a fair price.
5,Works amazingly. I was truly skeched out whether this product before since its not official nintendo but its worked with every official and non-official gamecube controller with no problem.
5,Great for emulating GameCube games on PC! I plugged mine in and it worked right away. It’s either pay $200 for Paper Mario on GameCube or buy this for like $15 and play on my computer. Easy decision
5,Works nice rumble is good works well with third party controllers. I used ciphon gamecube controllers with it if you're curious but overall a great product. It works great with the switch and pc as well no complaints.
5,It works I wanted to play super monkey ball on my laptop and it lets me do that. No complaints
5,My son loves it! He uses it for Smash bros
5,I always want to see if this thing will work with a wireless GameCube controller. And guess what it does. This thing makes me very happy when I got it thank you
5,Super simple to use. Works perfect so far(a few weeks). Long cord but does take 2 usb slots(switch has 3 so not really an issue).
1,Tested 1 port and it worked with the controllers. Then I added the second controller in the second slot and the right trigger kept inputting in its own. Causing many wrong moves and  early dodges.
5,Love this adapter! Let’s us play 3-4 players with the game cube controllers we already owned!! Awesome product!
5,I've only used one controller port so far but it works great with my computer.
1,This item does NOT work with the wavebird.  The description is false.
5,Item worked great when connected to a PC. Windows 10 recognized it right away. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I cannot comment on how it works in consoles. Overall a great adapter and at a great price.
5,Easy to use and works well. Plug it in to the side of the Switch dock plug in the controllers and play.
5,I got this adapter for my son's Gamecube remote since I ordered the wrong type--wired and needed an adapter. This arrived quickly and it's been working great.
4,It’s hard to unplug the controllers from the housing.
5,This product is super user friendly and works great. I’ve been using it for about 4 months now and all the ports still work with no issues.
5,Works perfectly. Also the old GameCube WaveBird receivers work on this too if you have them. The plugs allow enough space to plug in multiple WaveBird receivers.
5,This works great! I have had it for over a month now with no problems. There is no need to get the expensive Nintendo one. Definitely buy this if you like Super Smash Bros.
5,Easy fix to use my gamecube controller to play Smash the way it was meant to be played.Same for the Mario 3D remasters.
4,Good product at great price.Does not work worth curved gamecube wireless adapters.  Make sure your using right regular controllers or a flat faced wireless adapter before purchase.Even with my issue the product arrived swiftly and I recieved a free return from this seller so highly recommended.
4,Works well enough
5,after my last adapter finally gave out that I got 5 years ago when smash 4 came out (man those 5 years went by fast) looked around for a new one and picked this one out and it works about like I would expect it to haven't tried the turbo mode but it switches between pc and switch/wii u modes just fine and really what more could you ask for?
2,Works with Win7 64 Prof. out of the box. Automatically Creates 4 controllers.No website listed in the instructions to download drivers. No official website even with Google searching.Did not work with WiiU fully updated to system 5.5.5. Did not work with front USB ports. Front USB ports switched. Back USB ports. Back USB ports switched. Tested even in PC mode switch. Tested with Super Mario 3D World Captain Toad Treasure Tracker Xenoblade Chronicals X. Tested in Wii mode: the Munchables Muramasa Demon Blade Arc Rise Fantasia Dokapon Kingdom Kirby's Epic Yarn e.g. several games that have native Gamecube Adapter Support.
5,The product worked as expected! For a thrid party item it does it's job with no flaws whatsoever! No inpur lag and the quality is good!
5,This is an excellent Chinese accessory.  It performs its basic function of connecting Gamecube style controllers to the Nintendo Switch or PC.  The PC functions include a "turbo" function as well that might be fun for some party games but the usefulness is probably limited where software could be more helpful.
5,It was one of the cheapest I could fine works perfectly and is completely easy to use. Great product!
3,I bought this for the use of both the Switch and PC GameCube emulation it works wonderful for the Switch but for PC not so much I've tried everything so much guides and they've all lead me to even more disappointment. But I guess 3rd parties are very unreliable I don't know if anyone's got this thing to work but so far I'm half regretting buying this cause I can't use it for the PC least it works great for Switch but that's like a small time use because I don't play just Switch.
5,I bought this for the Nintendo Switch and it works perfectly!
4,It does exactly what I want it to do. Only problem is that the right stick sometimes doesn't register but I might be pressing on it too hard. Feels almost like a real gamecube controller. I am not upset with this purchase at all.
5,I ordered this for my kid and it works wonderfully. He is so happy. Thank you!
5,Very easy to connect and use just set to pc or switch and plug in USB port can connect up to 4 controllers. I was not expecting my son to use this on his computer games as well that was a major plus
4,I usually run my PC on Linux but this controller adapter was not recognized by Linux even after I found some external software. It was recognized no problem on Windows but this is inconvenient as I have to dual-boot to Windows. On Windows the product works well with my GC controller.
5,Works great with all of our GameCube controllers (old and new). Such a better option than buying all new wireless controllers.
5,I wanted to play super smash bro’s using my old GameCube controller and this did the job perfectly! I haven’t run into any problems.
3,Was able to use this adapter for other games on steam like Sonic Adventure 2 but was unable to get the controller to work with dolphin. Even though the controller setup will say "adapter detected" once you start up a game the controller won't work. Don't bother if you want this for melee/netplay or anything related to dolphin.
5,This did exactly what it’s supposed! Super easy to use works great with the controllers👌🏽 10/10
4,Very functional. Make sure you get controllers that have vibration capability or you won’t get the full use out of this device.
5,It worked exactly as described.Took it apart to make my Nintendo Switch GameCube dock adapter. I used madmorda’s 3D model and got it printed at treatstock .com. Look her up.
5,I absolutely love this adapter and it worked perfectly the gamecube controllers I had. Its solid and easy to use. Jusy plug and play.
5,This product works great. Easy connection to use GameCube controllers on the Nintendo switch. Shipped quickly. Great value. Very practical.
4,Easy to hook up
5,Perfect for my Nintendo switch. Playing the new smash bro’s with a GameCube controller brings me back to smash bro’s melee! Very easy to use as well which is a huge bonus.
5,Its exactly what i needed to play smash ultimate on my Nintendo switch. nice long wires so I can sit at a comfortable distance. Literally just plug it in and it works. Tested on a few other multiplayer games and works well!
4,It works!
5,Useful and convenient price
5,Easy to use and set up. It just works with full control and feature functionality of the original controllers. Exactly what we needed. Works great with Super Smash Bros for example.
5,This works great! My kids wanted to use Nintendo Game Cube controllers to play Mario Party Games on the Switch. It’s so easy just plug and play! Pretty smart gadget.
2,I felt somewhat falsely advertised to after hooking up this adapter to my Switch and connecting the controller to find out it does not work with my WaveBird. The receiver is getting power and the indicator light comes on when I make inputs on the controller but the Switch does not see it. If I connect my wired GameCube controller it works just fine. I even checked my WB on the GameCube to make sure it was functioning properly. This doesn't make much sense to me as this adapter was advertised to support WaveBird controllers and I've seen several reviews for it showing that it does in fact support them. I did contact the seller and they were able to promptly refund my money for the defective unit.
5,Simple device to use on my Nintendo switch and use my GameCube controllers without having to purchase 3rd party switch controllers or Nintendo’s drifting controls.Only con would be that it’s not recognized on PC
5,Works great just plug and play with our favorite gamecube controllers and 4 of us can play together. Easy to use.
4,This product was as described but unfortunately I couldn't get it to work for my needs.  It may be more User error than product issues.
5,Product is great for allowing more players to play without buying additional joycons. It allows you to use up to 4 gamecube controllers with the switch. Great for smash bros.
5,Easy to use and good quality.
5,Perfect solution at a great price point - works great - it’s nice that it gives you some extra chord length too
4,Controllers connected to the adapter are not recognized under Linux in any of the for controller ports.That's okay but if you're buying this with Linux in mind (you might be - who knows) then look elsewhere.That being said I was happy with the adapter. It works well with my Wavebird under Windows.
5,it does its job well. Little over priced in my opinion but it works fine
5,Plug and play easy to set up!
3,if you are buying this to play gamecube games on dolphin emulator DO NOT BUY!!! works perfectly fine with nintendo switch but will not work in dolphin which is what i bought it for unfortunately. offical nintendo wii u gamecube adapter is recommended for emulators
5,Did not try on wii U/switch but worked fine on PC.  I'm not sure what I did special but it was detected on my PC without issues...
5,My son wanted it to be able to play his games. Works great. Very easy to use.
5,Great product for the price
5,Everything I asked for in an adapter. Haven't tested it on a Wii U but it works perfect for the Switch with up to 4 controllers connected. I don't use rumble but that works as well. Haven't had it very long but it seems sturdy and durable while also being pretty light and portable. Also I can NOT see any input lag which is fantastic for games like smash.
5,The adapter works as expected. It was easy to use. Just plug n play. Great for smash bros and mario kart!
5,Conectamos el adaptador al nintendo y luego los controles originales de gamecube y todo funcionó genial. El cable es largo por que lo es aún mejor.-We plugged the adapto to the nintendo and then the original gamecube controllers and everything worked great. The cable is long so that's even better.
5,This is a very good product. Since the Nintendo Switch doesn't have a GameCube controller port i needed to buy an adapter and this was the cheapest one I found. And man I'm glad I bought it here because to my surprise I ended up getting it earlier than expected almost a day sooner! So I give this product 5 stars for how great the adapter is and especially for how fast I received it.
5,Much more affordable than the on brand gamecube controller thingy and works just the same :)
5,Product works and is reliable. Used all ports and had no faults at all. Only mention would be cable quality (I tend to move around a lot with it and it’s a bit frail) and the plastic housing. Definitely bang for your buck though. Works as expected.
5,Quick delivery works great and can even be used on my PC! Good price as well.
5,This was so easy to use and worked great with our new consoles!
5,Could find this for less than $10 if you have a lot of store options open near u. Paying for the convenience haha. But work great on my switch. No lagging or issues at all so far.
4,It was perfect for the price. Highly recommend. Only draw back was no Home button for the Switch.
3,Now I used to give this 5 stars because it was amazing for the price but after a few months of usage I noticed some input lag problem. So I tried to do this combo on Ultimate that almost everyone knows about and i cant do it because the opponent always has time to get out of the combo but whenever i try the combo with my pro controller it works??? I tried using a different port but it was noticeably still input laggy so i tried a new gamecube controller adapter and i could do the combo without problem.
4,Good product
5,The only things is that it takes up both external USB ports of the Switch dock. But if you’re only using GameCube controllers it’ll be fine.
5,Almost no input lag and works as advertised. I’m using this with Dolphin for Smash bros and Zelda and haven’t had any issues with it.
4,Worked like a charm!
5,Plugs right in and works perfect for dolphin (PC EMU) and Switch!
5,IT WORKS GREAT
5,Works really well. Just plug it in & play. Perfect for Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Cheaper than the official Nintendo gamecube controller adapter & works as well
5,It does what its supposed to made playing mariokart with the family a breeze definitely worth the money payed for it
5,Really easy to use! All we had to do was plug it into our Nintendo switch and it worked!
5,Does what it’s supposed to. Easily use your GameCube controllers on your switch. Kids use it use the switch with the adapter exclusively now. Great buy.
5,works Great thank you
4,Sometimes will not connect or will make my controls glitch but besides that cheap very easy to use would recommend
5,Perfect for my son to play his switch with a gamecube controller. Great customer service.
5,Works great and easy setup
5,Works perfectly. Arrived quickly.  Would buy again or recommend to anyone who needed it.
5,get zadig have the switch set to wiiu not pc download windows drivers through zadig then dolphin should detect it
5,Use this often to play Super Smash on the Nintendo Switch. Works well as intended!
5,I had another brand before this one and it gave out quick. This one looks like it's better material and I don't know if it's just me but the controller seems to be faster to react then the other one.
5,Works perfect and is incredibly simple to setup. Made Smash Bros. brawl so much better!
5,I’m happy with the purchase it works well.  I’m using it with the switch and the controllers don’t have all of the same buttons as GameCube so it isn’t flawless.
4,This product does what it was intended to do perfectly. The case is a little bit light and flimsy feeling but I've had no issues with it. Nintendo itself has issues with overpricing its products and false scarcity so this is a good alternative.
5,Bought for my retro gamer son and works perfectly to make his controller work on the PC
5,Easy to use. Exactly what my son needed to connect old GameCube controllers to the Switch console.
5,Works great. Use it for playing games on my switch with my gamecube controllers.
5,This product is everything I needed it to be. Works amazingly well while also being easy on the wallet. 10/10 would recommend.
5,Bought this adapter to play super smash bros melee through Slippi and can't say I have any complaints. Worked flawlessly right out of the box.
1,The product has mixed reviews and I couldn’t find anything on YouTube about it but it would not work at all. I ended getting an authentic Nintendo one and it worked on the first . Cheaper but definitely not better or worth it in my experience.
4,We got it for the switch and works fine.....But did notice that I only had Rumble on Smash Bros. and not Mario Kart 8...the only games I have to Test on...... Overall very happy....only writing a review because the reviews i read helped me out!!!!!
5,We were very happy with the product. It arrived very quickly and works great. Would order from this seller again in the future.
5,Convenient and easy to use. Just plug and play for your PC or switch
5,Works well for its purpose. I bought this for my brother after his Joycons broke and He uses it everyday
5,This looks and works the same as the more expensive 1st party models. I have had no issue using this for the switch OR for PC/Mac/Emulators. Great value.
2,I purchased this specifically to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch. My friends and I are pretty competitive when it comes to the game. A friend of mine has an official Nintendo GameCube controller adapter so I purchased this because I was curious if a cheaper 3rd party version would do the trick. The game is playable but in comparison there is a very noticeable input lag that takes away the responsiveness of the game. I'm going to have to purchase a different brand.
5,Works great. My friend gave me some original GC controllers and this device works perfectly with them. Excellent value for the money.
5,Does the job. You can use it on PC or switch. What more do you need?
4,Almost a streamline experience. Assuming someone was using it for a Dolphin Wii Emulator like myself it is not as simple as "plug and play". However the proper driver can be found with a quick google search. Turns out you also need to leave it in the "switch/wiiU mode on the back of it.
4,The only real issue I have is that it has very slight input lag but that's expected (especially with the current state of Smash Ultimate online). Other than that this adapter works nearly the same as Nintendo's Official Adapter.
5,Okay so there’s a lot of adapters out there and let me just say.. this adapter does the job! The quality the fast shipping and the response I receive from this adapter...not the monetion the affordability! This is absolutely a steal! I used it on melee net play and it works just fine! Had to purchase another since my original adapter was stolen. With this adapter you cannot go wrong!
5,super good for smash bros ultimate on the switch no problems at all
5,Used this to play melee on dolphin (note: you’ll want to configure your controls and calibrate your sticks beforehand on the application).Also works good for the switch. Its plug and play there and little different from my friend’s official wii u adapter.
1,Plugged it in several different ways read the good reviews and tried troubleshooting for almost an hour. Could not get anything with my switch. Getting a refund
5,I used this product for the Nintendo switch. I wanted some extra controllers without having to break the bank and still had GC controllers so this was a great solution. Setup is a breeze and the switch then recognizes the GC controllers without issue.
5,Worked perfectly with my two Wavebird controllers. My only complaint is that it’s not plain black like the picture shows it had some white branding on the top which looked lame.
5,Does what it's supposed to. Works so I have no complaints at all.. catch these hands out on smash bros boys :)
5,I ordered this for a smash bros party on release day and it got here in time for me to use it! I was worried that it wouldn't work on the switch or that my oldschool gamecube controllers might not hook up to it but everything works perfectly. It's so great to be able to use my 10 year old controllers on new games.Would totally recommend this!
5,I plugged the device into my N. Switch and Gamecube controller and was immediately able to use it in Smash Bros. with no extra latency. That's all I needed it for and I'm happy with the result. I may use it on PC in the future but I don't have any comments regarding that currently
5,Great product and is easy to use. I find this to be a good value for your money. Highly recommend
5,A great addition for any Smash Ultimate fan that prefer the GameCube controller over the joycon or pro-controller. Easy to use just plug and go.
4,My kids found it easy to hook up to game system and use.
5,Works great. Quality product. Just plug in and use with my Ninetendo Switch.
5,Works great. Allows the use of the old style GameCube controllers with the Switch. Easy to set up.
5,Great product works for some but not all games. Make sure you check before you buy! Otherwise it works great!
4,Not quite but I expected but worked totally fine not at all upset.
5,Plug and play for Nintendo Switch. First 3 slots worked like a charm. I only have 3 GameCube controllers so I don't know if the 4th slot works. Great way to expand the number of players in Smash Bros. without buying $70 Joy-cons or pro controllers. I plan to see if it cam be used with Dolphin Emulator at some point and hopefully update on usage.
3,It’s a hit or miss with this adapter the first one that came in didn’t work but I got an exchange and the second one worked it’s working so far but idk how long it’s got
5,Did exactly what it’s supposed to.
4,Very good quality and easy to use
3,PC:Before I bought this item I looked into how to make WiiU adapters work on pc. Plug in the Adapter keep it on Switch/WiiU mode and follow the dolphin instructions for the official WiiU.Switch:What it lacks compared to other adapters however is the lack of support for the switch's missing buttons. Friend has a different Hub for his switch and it supported the missing buttons by using the Z key as a hotkey for said missing buttons. Besides the missing feature the controller is as easy to use as just plugging in & playing.
4,This works most of the time. Occasionally I will have to unplug it and plug it back into my switch.
5,I used this for super smash bros for nintendo switch works flawlessly
5,Works exactly as needed. Great for hooking up multiple game cube controller’s to Nintendo switch. A fully customizable controller experience for games like Smash Brothers
5,This isn't anything too special it's really just an adapter that would've cost a lot more being purchased directly from Nintendo. Haven't tried on PC yet but works excellent for Switch specifically SSBU.
5,Feels cheap but does a good job on my WiiU.  Good cable length
5,Worked on my wii u perfect.  Used 3 old school gamecube controllers with no issues.
5,Pretty serviceable. Used it for 3d all stars on switch and had no problems
5,Great product!
5,Just what I needed for Smash Bros Ultimate. No issues and works as expected!
5,I've had a Gamecube controller for a while but I haven't had the adapter to play with it. So far I've had a good experience with it. No noticeable input lag and really easy to just plug in and play. I use it with my Switch and laptop and it works great on both. Arrived quickly too.
5,Bought this for my kid who wants everything. Used it for about two days and this is now another closet/drawer ornament since he’s moved on to something different.
5,Purchased this in order to play Smash Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch. Arrived in perfect working order does everything it says it does and I don't notice any delay like I have with other adapters. Used as well with my computer perfectly working to play Melee with the same results. Highly recommended.
5,Product works like it should. Was able to use original GameCube controllers on my PC to play old favorites.
5,Works great easy to plug in and has virtually no lag.
1,I ordered this back in July so that I could play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Switch with some people and because of the pandemic we ended up not getting together until a couple days ago. So I pulled this out excited to use our WaveBirds but it just doesn't work. It's not like it's a complicated device so there's not much room for human error but regardless of which combination of USB cables I had plugged in and the setting I had the device's toggle set to it did nothing.The WaveBird receivers light up though when buttons on the controller are pressed so I know that the controllers work and that their receivers are at least getting power. But the Switch just acts as if there aren't any controllers plugged in at all.Kind of disappointing since I'm well past the return window but it's possible I just got a dud and I guess I should have tested it when it first arrived. Oh well. At least it wasn't too expensive.
5,It works pretty well on my switch and my gamecube controllers
5,Very easy to use used it every day for a week so far and no complaints.
2,Works but don’t buy if you are a slippi (SSBM) player. Not overclockable buy may flash. If you don’t know what this means then you’ll like this product
5,Funciona bien llevo usándolo varios meses y no ha tenido fallas.
5,Got the job done perfectly. Can’t complain.
5,Works great wish it didn't need two usb slots
5,It’s been good for a while and no issues with speed co pared to the original wii connector I had.
5,I am so glad i grabbed this before the new Smash came out on the Nintendo Switch.  It works great on that system but I have yet to test it on my Wii-U or PC yet. It gave me no issues whatsoever with the switch an was just plug and play. felt really great using a classic GC controller for the new Smash
5,I was about to spend the money on the Nintendo and I'm glad I didn't for the price this product is just as good as the one Nintendo put out. So if your looking for an adapter that won't burn a hole in your wallet and works just as good then this is the product for you!!
5,It does as expected and is priced fairly works fine with GameCube controllers and is what you’re looking for
5,Pretty idiot proof... plug and play.  Confirmed to work on Nintendo Switch.
4,works for switch doesn’t work for pc
5,Works just as good as any adapter I’ve used before. Great for melee or other GameCube games on the PC
5,I've wanted a game cube adaptor for quite some time since I got my switch and this one has no issues after a few months of use and there is no lag that I've noticed
5,No issues so far works great for the after school programs i got it for. It gets a lot of use and certainly gets handled a bit roughly at times. Overall still great though holding up well
5,Worked great for using my GC controller with my emulator on my PC
5,Works great for GameCube controllers on the Switch. No lag and no issues!
5,Super easy to use! Perfect for smash bros and Mario 3D all stars!
5,I got this for my switch to use some older Gamecube controlers with and its perfect
5,Worth it for the price. No issues as of yet.
4,Has some issues with button registry after being plugged in very long. If you do not unplug it and replug it will have some buttons that don't map correctly.
4,Good product!!
5,Been using for about 3 weeks now. Great product.
5,It was straight forward and simple works great on PC and switch with almost no input lag. Great overall just no rumble on pc
4,This is good adaptor for the wii u
5,Works great on my switch and pc. I've been using it for about a month or so with no issues.
5,If you want to feel like a kid again definitely get game cube controllers and THIS adapter
5,Works for both slippi on my pc and ultimate for switch good product.
5,Works with little to no problems if you know your way around Dolphin and your computer set up.
5,Solid product. Works on switch as intended.
5,It worked well for smash bro’s on the Wii U.
5,Plugged into the switch and instantly worked with our old gamecube controllers. I ordered a different brand originally and couldn't get it to work thought I was doing something wrong but this was so easy to plug in and play!
5,Very happy
5,Its great for its value and just straight up great
5,Works as expected no problems and was worth the money
5,Works as expected
5,This device was easy to setup and works great! I can now connect multiple GameCube controllers to my Switch to play Smash Bros!
2,I didn't check if it was good on the switch or Wii U so I wouldn't know how it performs (that's why it's a 2 star) I had planned to use this on my PC but it didn't work and I tried doing everything I could to get it to work but no such luck so if you plan on using this for something like dolphin then DO NOT BUY.
5,Very easy to use no issues with compatibility and it is as small as your average controller. Worth it!
5,I was thinking about getting the official one but it was really expensive. So I got this one IT WAS GREAT it was long it wasn’t the easiest to connect but once I got it to work then it worked great
5,Fantastic 3rd party product that is above everyone else! Works perfectly fine with up to 4 players and got it just in time for my Emerald Blue controller! Would highly recommend to friends and already got one of them to buy one as well! S+ job on the adapter!
5,Easy to use no complaints- I would buy again
5,Works great to use my old GameCube controls on my Switch!
5,It works really well with the GameCube controllers I currently have right now. It works well with Smash ultimate on the switch. Nice Product!
5,Works good on switch haven’t used on PC yet
5,Very easy to use with the switch. Just plug and play.
4,This product works as expected but it takes a bit of research to get the drivers working to use it.  This isn't a fault of the product but just comes with the territory.
5,My go-to for connecting my GameCube controllers for Smash
5,It works. Linux did not have a driver for it but it works well on Windows and Mac. Otherwise works quite well.
5,Excellent product works well for smash Brothers on switch.
3,Great price for what it is. Be very careful though I dropped mine from a coffee table and it broke immediately.
5,Works great is great product for a great price
5,Buen producto y versátil lo puedo usar en la computadora tambien
5,Worked as advertised. No complaints.
1,This was easy to setup and plug in for the Dolphin Emulator. It worked fine for the first week but I suddenly had input issues. My thumbstick wouldn't register tilting up and when playing Ultimate would move all the way right on its own. Consistent input lag made timing inaccurate. I thought I had a problem with my GameCube controller at first but it was actually this adapter. These issues happened not only on my Switch but also my PC.I returned this and bought the MayFlash GameCube adapter instead which works much better and hasn't had any of these issues. Purchase the official one if you solely want to use it for the Switch/Wii U but the MayFlash works on PC and is essential for Smash Melee/Slippi/Dolphin.
3,It's not literally plug and play but it seems to work like all the other adapters
3,We bought these for a friend for her birthday. All but one of the ports work really well. One port didn't connect very well and the controller in that port didn't have full usability. The other three are great but it was frustrating that one of the ports didn't work.
5,Works as described. Makes using GameCube controllers for the switch easy!
2,Contacted the retailer with no response. Tried two different WaveBird controllers in the adapter on two different (and current updated) switch consoles but no combination would sync. Lights show the signal is being received but console not recognizing any input.May work great for wired controllers based on other reviews but if you only have wireless look elsewhere.
5,Adapter is very easy to hook up played smash for hours with friends
5,Works as advertised. I appreciate the longer cable.
5,The only reason this thing isn't five stars across the board is because nowhere in this product's instructions does it let you know how to test if it's working (after plugging it in you press a button on your Switch to activate the controller and then it should work fine). A minor nitpick for an overall great product.
5,Works great just as expected and in description.
5,Works as described out of the box for our Nintendo switch.  No issues it’s great getting to use GameCube controllers again.
5,This adapter does exactly what it's supposed to do without any problems. We just plugged everything in and it was ready to go. No muss no fuss. Works great!
3,It works on the Switch (as long as your Switch is in good condition; mine isn't). If it doesn't work on Switch you need a new Switch tbh. However there are some issues with this and Dolphin. Input is detected until you start the game. I would like someone to explain how to make it work on Dolphin. Then I'll rate 5 stars.
5,This is exactly what I needed for playing multiplayer games on the switch without paying a premium on new switch controllers (and frankly I like the GC controllers more). Immediately could play 4+ players on the new smash and I like that it's compatible with my mac as well. No more / no less than what I wanted.
2,This would be a 5 out of 5 if Wavebird controllers worked as it advertises.  My wired GameCube controllers have an unnoticeable amount of lag which is amazing.  However the Wavebird Controllers don't connect at all.  If you only have wired controllers this is a great buy but if you have Wavebird don't waste your money.
5,very good
5,Easy to set up and use!
3,It was difficult to configure and ultimately didn’t work with my emulator so I got a mayflash one instead. If you can get it to work it could save you a couple bucks.
5,I've loved Smash since Melee and have gathered GC controllers since. These adaptors don't come from Nintendo but they work great and are as easy as plugging into the USB ports of your console. I've had no issues so far and have been able to play Smash with friends much more easily since.
5,Very good cheaper alternative to the official adapter. I’m pretty sure the rumble works without having both ports in at the same time( I may be wrong) Very good deal for the price
4,very good.
5,Works well with ssb for the wii u.
5,Works perfectly with my Switch. Worth the buy.
3,If your just gonna use it on the Switch and nothing else then it's perfect. However the problem is it feels cheap and it doesn't work right on PC's the way other adapters work. The analog sticks don't read correctly when using Dolphin which keeps the games from being fun.
5,It works perfectly on my switch!
5,This was a gift for my son. It was easy to use and set up.
5,Works as intended.
5,It is exactly what I needed. The adapter was delivered as promised and in new condition.
5,Worked great  use older gamecube contrillers
5,Was searching for a wavebird after getting a switch but at this price the old wired gamecube controllers work great for mario kart 8 and im sure any other games too.
5,Does what it’s supposed to. I haven’t checked the turbo function. I wish it didn’t take up 2 usb slots but you gain 4 controllers so not too much to complain about.
5,Perfect if you want to use a gamecube controller. I haven't tried it on pc but it works perfectly on the switch with no problems.
5,Does the job for both switch and pc. Just need to download drivers for pc. Little to no lag
5,Fast delivery and easy to use
3,Neutral review. I couldn't get this to work for PC. Don't know about switch. Returned.
1,Do not purchase this item if you are intending to use it on your PC with the Dolphin emulator. There are a lot of positive reviews of this item but I wish I had looked through the 1 star reviews and found the relevant ones which all state this does not work with PC. This wouldn't be a 1 star worthy offense as it does appear that this product works with the Switch and Wii U but the product description clearly claims to work on PC and specifically mentions the Dolphin Emulator.I wasted about 2 hours total trying to get it to work with patches command downloads new driver downloads and every trick and fix I could find. None of these work including the ones found in the product review comments on this page. So just skip it.I'll be purchasing the officially licensed more expensive product because reviews all say it works. I recommend you do the same.Also the product arrived late. So I had to wait eagerly for it only to be incredibly frustrated with its failure when it arrived.
3,Works really well I don’t have any complaints. I use it for my pc emulators
5,Easy to use. Did what it says.
5,Wires on wave birds and wired controllers
5,Great expectations easy to use great value!
5,It’s literally a plug n play. Things got heated during smash soo I’ll rate 9/10
5,Great addition to my sons gaming computer.
5,Works great. Doesn’t work when you play Wii games on the Wii U unfortunately but used it for my switch instead
5,Probado en WiiU Switch y PC funciona a la perfección.Muchas Gracias!
5,It works
5,Exactly what I wanted! It works perfectly with switch.
5,Un muy buen producto la configuración un tanto complicada debería traer un manual adjunto
5,Works perfectly! So happy with my purchase.
5,Works great to play games on PC and Nintendo Switch with original Gamecube controllers.
5,cheap and effective!!! This product is great if you want to play smash brothers for the switch. I would highly recommend to buy this GameCube adapter because it is probably the best on the market.
5,This product worked miracles for using my gamecube controller. This adapter has little to no lag input time and the Nintendo  switch picked up the controller nearly instantly. The instructions were very clear and easy to understand. and I haven't seen any issues after dropping this adapter a few times.
5,Easy and simple to use. Suck that the Wii U only lets you use it for Smash.
5,cheaper than the official gamecube adapter but works just as well. Also works with dolphin emulator which is also a huge plus. Not much more you could want from a game cube adapter.
5,I use this product for Smash Bros (duh) on the Switch. I have not tried this product with the PC or WiiU. Otherwise it's super reliable has a nice cord length of its own and works flawlessly with any old or new corded GCN controller.
1,The second I took this out of the box I was extremely excited to use it because I've always played smash at my buddies house and he had a similar adapter and I have never been able to play without a GCN controller. Less than a minute in I noticed this has extremely bad input lag moments where inputs didn't register and a spotty connection. Do not buy this
5,Work great on my switch vibration even works with just 1 usb plugged in.
5,Easy to use and works perfect!
5,Used on my Switch and PC and everything works great.
5,Simple. No issues after many uses.
5,Exactly what our son needed for his xbox.  He is happy so we are happy.
5,Works perfectly and does what it's supposed to do.
5,Functions like a champ!  Easy-connect and immediately able to use devices that require this to function properly.
5,Works like a charm great product!
5,Connected 2 controllers and played with no input lag. Perfect for super smash bro
5,Works great! We often use this with our switch and have had zero complaint!
5,Easy to use just plug it in! No hassle.
5,This is a great tool for playing with GameCube controllers on the switch. Highly recommend it.
5,I was skeptical at first due to the low price of it but after trying it out I can say that this product works pretty well. I even tried out the wireless GameCube controller and it worked lag free. I highly recommend this if you’re gonna be buying the new Smash Bros Ultimate game for the switch.
5,Muy bueno cumple con su funcionalidad
3,This will work for game cube controller’s but will not work for a DDR mat unfortunately.
5,Works like a charm. So easy to set up and use
5,Product is as advertised no issues
5,Easy to use plug and play. Not much else to say about it
5,Product works as the description said it would. A pleasant surprise was that this allows Gamecube controllers to work with Overcooked 2 on the Switch!
5,Very simple and easy to use this adapter works just as it should.
5,I've used multiple adapters but this one is pretty darn good. Almost like the official Nintendo version. But further testing atm. Thank you.
5,Easy to use  you just have to plug it in the side and my GameCube controller work perfectly.
5,It is great I can use all my old GameCube controllers and I never have problems with it
5,My son likes it he does not have any issues with it
1,I was looking for something like this so I can play lego star wars on steam since it was a full controller support game but I was greatly disappointed 😞 that this is not working at all I first I thought my controller not working or not plug in right but no its clearly the gamecube adapter not working and yes I made sure I read the instructions carefully but...R.I.P
5,Very easy to connect. Perfect for my gaming system. Very inexpensive compared to big stores
5,Works well with the Nintendo Switch. Keep in mind that this is an adapter for GameCube controllers.

5,Easy to use.

5,Works as intended
5,Works well with switch and retropie or dolphin on pc
5,Product works great!!!
4,Works great!
5,Works great! I messed up a driver with it on my laptop so I can’t use it on that but it works perfect on my desktop. I’m very happy I made the purchase.
5,Works as expected.
5,Works great exactly how you would want. Just a side note the Switch only really lets you use this on Smash Bro’s.
5,Great product
2,If you expected to use this with Dolphin or any other emulator look elsewhere. Despite being advertised as such it doesn't work on PC. Works really well with Switch/Wii U little to no latency.
2,This is my second time buying an adapter like this. The first one was a mayflash adapter and worked fine so I got complacent and decided to get a cheaper model for my second one. Dolphin will recognize the adapter until you open a game then no controllers will show up. If you open controller config while a game is open you can see it flash between the adapter being not recognized and being recognized very briefly.Edit: gave a star back as it does seem to work with a first party switch dock so it is isn’t totally nonfunctional even though it doesn’t work for my desired purpose.
5,For $20 it’s a working GameCube adapter... which is what it is meant to be. I’ve already dropped it a few times off the desk and it works perfectly fine so there’s some durability there. Had it for a couple weeks and so far no issues 👍
5,Works great easy to use. Time for Smash with gamecube  controllers
5,Simple and easy to use. Worked as expected.
5,Worked perfect straight out of the box
5,Great product easy to use
5,Easy to use
5,Arrived on time no chips or damages and works perfectly. Will upload pics soon.
5,It works!
5,Worked great
5,Why shell out 60$ for a hard to find adapter? This gets the job done and can easily play PC games as well.
5,It really does work!
5,Works great! Just as expected. Fast shipping
5,Works great!
5,Easy to use and does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Perfect for playing smash with friends
5,This adapter is really great! It's small and easy to use! I have run into no issues while using it at parties I would highly recommend it.
5,Works great
5,Works fine on both PC and Switch. Have had no problems with it thus far but also haven't used it much since I bought it in anticipation of Smash Ultimate just like 9/10 people who buy it. Will update if any problems do occur when the game is released.
5,Works great
5,Has worked perfectly on my Switch in the past two months I've had it! No issues with anything so far. Amazing product and value for money!
5,Works great!
5,This product is a good choice if you are looking for a gamecube controller adapter for the switch. The price is pretty nice and you just have to plug it into your switch and you are good to go. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

5,very nice!

5,Got it for the switch. Works perfectly with no issues.
4,It worked with GameCube controllers I bought online with my Nintendo switch and that's what I needed it to do to get ready for Smash.
5,Ordered this to play some Smash Bros. Ultimate and it works perfectly no issues as of this review. Arrived very much on time and the adapter was not damaged in any way. Very good highly recommend it!
5,Aa described works great!  Good seller.
5,Plug and play. Supports rumble feature of wired Nintendo Gamecube controllers.
5,Good design works perfectly
5,Works perfect when you have large groups of people and not enough controllers.
5,Works great and easy to use
5,Great
5,Amazing controller response with this adapter. Highly recommended. Especially with playing Super Smash Bro’s. Not a single delay!
5,Worked well for me. I used it with third party GameCube controllers on Dolphin emulator.
5,Got Smash for my birthday but I didn't want to buy four $60 controllers just to play with friends when I still have my old gamecube stuff. Easy thing to use saves you money and doesn't cost much at all.
1,Bought 3. Returned 3. All with the same issue one port having issues with one or more buttons not responding or repeating actions.
5,Does just what it was advertised.
5,Zero lag. Very easy to use
5,Easy to use
5,Easy to use
5,Muy buen producto
5,My grandson loved it!
5,Amazing product and works way better than other similar brand products I have owned which broke quickly. Highly recommend
5,Bought this to use with my Nintendo Switch- worked right out of the box.
4,Does the job but inputs on controller seem to lag slightly. Could be an issue with all adapters in general.
5,Wonderful simple product. Works as intended. Wanted to use a game cube controller to play Smash Bros and this adapter works like a charm!
5,Excellent product. Fit really well for controller to play with my Nintendo switch. Very happy 👍
5,Great buy! Easy to use with the switch. Just plug in and play!
5,Works as intended and now I can play smash bro’s the way I’m used to!
5,Works as expected
5,Was what we needed for Gamecube
5,Just what I was looking for. Works exactly as expected!
5,bought it for Mario kart on the switch. Works perfect
5,Easy to use. Straight forward
5,Long cord better than the original adapter.  Works great so far.
5,Good product
1,Being extremely excited for this to arrive would be an understatement. There is nothing like the feeling of getting the boys together on the weekend and playing some SSBM... but unfortunately the boys wont be gathering this weekend...The cheap AF couldfare adapter showed up with AWFUL packaging (an envelope) along with a gamecube controller I purchased (also BROKEN). I've tried everything to get the adapter to work on my PC and in my Wii but to no avail. It looks like I was SCAMMED.Please dont make the same mistake I did. Do not buy from this company.
5,I bought this specifically for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and I'm happy to say that it's perfect for it. My Gamecube controller was able to be plugged in without any issues and the response time and controls are perfect. Haven't tried it on PC yet however.
5,Purchased to use for Smash Ultimate. Worked with no issues. Played a lot of hours of multiplayer on it. Good price.
5,Works perfectly! Popped in an old gamecube controller to play with on the Switch and was instantly enjoying fully functional gameplay. Good stuff! Also I dropped it (butterfingers) and it still works perfectly :)
4,it does its job thats all that is needed
3,Is okay
5,Really great for playing smash and for a good price.
5,Worked exactly the way it was supposed to
3,The switch dock has 2 usb ports.  The adapter has 2 plugs you need 2 for rumble you need 2 adapters to enjoy smash. The dock needs extra usb ports 3rd party docks tend to brick switches.  Alas we where all disappointed and decided to play mario party
5,Works exactly how it is supposed to. No problems.
2,The only reason this is two stars instead of one star is because it works perfectly fine on Switch but it only worked 10% of the time on Dolphin both with and without the appropriate drivers.
1,Diddnt work
5,Took a minute to set up and started using game cube controllers for my switch right away. This was a great purchase and it does exactly what I wanted
5,Great product and price
5,Just what I needed
5,Easy to use and does the job.
5,Excellent price for people that dont want to buy a bagillion switch controllers and want to occasionally play smash with multiple people.  I had a gamecube so it was nice to be able to reuse those controllers.
5,Plug in and game on perfect gift!
5,I consider this the best option when looking for an adapter it is the best value for your money.
5,Its useful works well for the money.
5,This is great for added game pieces. Really useful for our handheld controllers.
5,Did exactly what I needed worked great.
5,Easy
5,Tired it. Works like a charm and works with both my Nintendo brand and non-Nintendo brand controllers. Great buy for such a low price!
5,It works great! I even paired it with my snes controller to gamecube adapter and n64 controller to gamecube adapter and it works perfectly on the Switch.  Did not notice any lag. I would definitely recommend this adapter. Thanks
5,Works exactly as I expected. No input delay which is very important to me. Played Smash Ultimate on Switch with 4 people all using controllers plugged into it and no one had any complaints about their controller not working properly.
5,Good value works well
5,Works as intended. Have no issues with it.
5,Easy to use product that works great. We were able to just plug it in & use it. Now we added 2 more controllers to our switch that were just sitting in storage! Great price.
5,works just like it’s supposed to
5,Great bang for your buck as Nintendo has yet to release new licensed adapters. Mixed results with PC usage but great with the Switch. Quality feels pretty legit. Owned for a few months now with zero issues!
5,Does exactly what it’s advertise for
5,Works as expected!
5,Works great and a good price
5,Works perfectly as a controller port
5,Works great with my switch for smash bros. No complaints so far
5,Does exactly what it says it does wonderful product would highly recommend
5,For the price it’s very good
5,Great product for the price.
5,easy to use and works great
1,When connected to some PCs as wii u (as some emulators require it) it shoots a driver install error. Bought a Mayflash brand adapter and it works perfectly for all my PC emulators.
3,Everything works great but it doesn’t not work with Wii U as advertised. Works well on Nintendo switch
5,This made it so much easier to play super smash bro’s playing on the GameCube controllers. Worked great.
5,Great
5,It does exactly as it states and an incredible plus for it to work on multiple Nintendo systems
5,So far it’s been working great had no issues with it and has been truly useful I really am enjoying this and it’s so easy to set up
3,Fine for just basic uses but be careful if you're trying to use it with Melee / Dolphin. Extra config is required and you won't get native inputs specifically the shoulder buttons are not perfect with this.
5,Easy to use simple packaging next day shipping what more can I say
4,I like it. Works good. Putting my old gamecube controllers to use.
5,I've only used this adapter for my Nintendo switch a few times and every time I used it it's worked perfect! There's no input lag and it does it's job! Great overall product and worth the money!
5,The title says it all. I got some cheap GC controllers from Ebay about $8 each and then played Smash Ultimate on my Switch with them. Never had a problem. Supports vibration. Works for other games too.
5,been playing Madden 2008 on Dolphin Gamecube emulator all quarantine!
5,Works perfectly
4,It does what it is suppose to do. Yay.
5,The product works as advertised. No issues
5,I’m so happy with this adapter.  I was looking for something inexpensive and functional to play GameCube games on my Mac through the Dolphin emulator and it works perfectly.  I’m even using an inexpensive 3rd party GameCube controller.
5,The adapter worked perfectly and as described it would!
5,Wonderful value exactly as described
5,You don’t have to patch the drivers! It works right out of the box. Works perfectly with dolphin.
5,Works flawlessly better than the licensed product due to being more compatible and not having to download drivers.
5,It worked right out of the box no apparent latency. In the last couple of weeks I've used it pretty frequently with no problems so far. Great Product!
5,Affordable  unlike the Nintendo version.  Works great.
5,This adapter was perfect to play Smash Bros Ultimate with. The adapter combined with the GameCube controller actually has a lower input lag co.lated to the pro controller and the joycons. Takes me back to the GameCube days.
5,Worked perfectly no issues
4,Works perfectly
3,Bought in july of 2019. Decent price for the money. Noticeable nanoseconds of input lag when using a gamecube controller. Works with switch but not the best choice for competitive smash bros. Plugs straight into the dock no hassle worked out of the box.
5,I've had no issues with this adapter and there's no random inputs either. It also works with a usb c to usb adapter which makes using a controller on the go for smash possible.
5,It’s functional no issues
5,Works well and as intended
5,I mean it definitely does what it’s supposed to do.
5,Good product works as intended
5,The adapter is easy to use you just plug it right into the side of your switch and you can play any game with a GameCube controller! This is an essential for playing smash ultimate!
5,Great product shipped fast and makes smash a 1000% easier haven't lost a online match since got this can't say enough good things about it makes multiple with 4 people super easy
5,Literally first thing I did when I got it. Plugged it in accidentally stepped on it(like actually stomped on it) and used it. Loved it.
5,Did the job well
3,Worked well with the Switch but didn’t work with dolphin emulator.
5,In anticipation for the new Super Smash Bros Ultimate game I made an impulse decision to buy this and am very pleased with my purchase! Works great no complaints and the cord is a nice length which is always a welcomed feature to me!
5,works for what i purchased it for.
5,Works great! No problems!
5,Easy to use.
5,Works perfectly for cheap!
5,Amazing got it months ago still works great!
5,I've used this product to connect my gamecube controllers to the Nintendo Switch to play SSBU and it seems to work perfectly. I haven't tried it on the pc but I'm excited to try it.
1,Great for Nintendo switch. Does not work for PC even tho it clearly says that it does. Please don’t  lie. Please fix your product. Thanks!!!
5,Simple product that works
5,Works well on Switch and pc. Haven't had any problems.
5,The adapter works great. No issues. You do need to get the right drivers for this adapter if you want to use it for PC. Also the switch needs to be on PC rather than on Wii U.
5,Easy to use
5,Not really sure what the turbo button does or if it even works but the item itself works fine.
5,Works well for Mario cart. I was able to use 2 gamecube controllers AND a joy con at the same time.  Definitely recommend if you dont want to drop $70 on a switch controller.
1,Very disappointed that this option did not work.Really enjoy using GameCube controllers to gameAnd hoped I could use them on the Nintendo Wii-U and PC.On the Wii-U the system did not recognize the controllers in any of the 4 adapter portsWhen gaming on the Wii-U or vWii (virtual Wii).On PC it seemed to be an error with the drivers out the box.Searched online to find and install updated ones...but Windows-10 was unable to recognize the device.When ever you play a PC game it would not detect the adapter.I hope the team develops a new PC-Driver for Windows-10Because the current one does not work so I will be asking for a refund.
5,Easy to use
5,Bought this to play the dolphin emulator came in on time and worked right out of the box had no issues setting it up I definitely recommend checking this adapter out.
4,Works but has lag a normal USB controller doesn't.
5,Exactly as described! Now multiple players can play on our switch. Packaged nicely and came quickly!
5,Like
3,So overall it is very good my only real complaint is that it does not work very well for pc but that us probably just operator error
5,Does its job
5,Gift for brother in law. He liked it.
5,I dig it
1,I tried it as soon as it was delivered and it didn’t work. I tried with super smash bros and Mario kart the controller didn’t work. Pretty disappointed but got a refund
5,Product came directly as described. Well packaged and adapter works well. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone looking to use gamecube controllers for emulators on their PC.
5,Wasn't sure if it was really going to work...I am so happy it did!  We are able to play some favorite games on the cube again.  Fast service great follow up.
5,Perfect adapter for all of your needs. Worked on day one for my switch with no problems and I am noe the envy of my friends being the only one using s GameCube controller.
5,Wiring was a bit confusing but it works well with my switch.
5,Easy peasy. Works perfectly.
5,Easy to use
5,Works perfectly as intended easy set up and nice long cord for long distance gaming.
5,Works like it should.
5,Would recommend this to friend. Everything worked smoothly.
5,works great. rumble feature didn’t work on PC; otherwise it is great.
5,Great accessorie piece to have for the cross over between Nintendo GameCube to Nintendo switch. For controllers must get device.
5,Works great for both wireless and wired controllers.
5,It works good for my switch and pc
5,Ok but couldn't get it to work work even with the switch on. Wii u
4,Really good quality and works like a dream.
5,Works great with my fiance switch lite worth the money!
5,Made plenty of nights fun recommend for any one playing on GC
5,Works great. Sturdily built.
5,Cheap and easy to use and setup. Not much to say but the best gamecube controller adapter you can get.
5,great Adapter have not had any problems with it so far
3,Only works with smash bros. Otherwise good.
2,It worked ONCE with my Nintendo switch then would not work again. Tried with 4 different GameCube controllers so I know it wasn't just a controller issue. It worked really well the one time I got it to work. I also feel like I got a different product than what was described as the box it came in was white and red and it came with NO instructions.
5,This product is amazing! It lets me play 4 plays on my Nintendo switch with have to buy remotes . Definitely worth your money. Its pretty cool how it can also work on my PC
5,Got it for switch to prepare for Super Smash Bros Ultimate and it works great i tried it with some nintendo games on my switch and have tried it on my PC and I love it
5,Arrived promptly and my daughter is happy she finally got the adapter for her game.
5,Worked well
4,Works good tiny lag delay but not noticeable.
5,Works great with Gamecube controllers and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. I cannot speak for anything else.
5,Works perfectly to allow the godlike Gamecibe controller to work on your favorite Switch games. This is perfect for Mario Kart Smash Bros and Marvel UA3
5,It works
5,A lot better than other brands. No latency and also all the ports work perfectly.
5,Awesome product i have one for myself and have bought it as gifts for friends!!!!
5,Had it for a few weeks now works great. Love that the cable is a bit long as it let’s me sit far enough away from my tv.
5,I've had no issues thus far with the adapter it has worked 100% as intended on my Switch no issues to be noted.
2,It worked for a month then stopped being registered on my pc only works on switch now tried everything I could.
2,This product works great for the switch but this seems to be constructed from cheap material and my switch dies way faster when this is connected. This product might have faulty wiring that might damage your system. This product is useless if you aspire to play GameCube games using the dolphin emulator on PC. The drivers must be messed or the wiring. This does not work at all on the PC. The PC setting is useless.
5,Works great for super smash bro ultimate.
5,Plug the black USB into your Switch plug your gamecube controller into the front of the adapter and you're good to go.  I have experienced no problems with this device.
5,I really like using this and the fact that it can also work on PC is cool.
5,Works as advertised
5,Works great and I haven't had problems.
5,It makes playing the swtich even better.
5,Works great on the pc.
5,I ordered this for my son and it works perfectly for his system!!
5,This product is a reasonable price and works well. I'm happy with my purchase and if anyone needs an adapter for gamecube controller this is the one you should buy.
5,Great product works extremely well !!!
5,Works great on the switch and PC instantly read my gc controller
5,Pretty good since I only use it for Smash ultimate. I recommend it.
5,Bought a Wii U in order to get some Smash practice in. This adapter worked perfectly for my Wii U. Way cheaper than most other adapters. Couldn’t have asked for a better deal.
5,Simple plug and play and definitely recommend
5,It works great.
5,Overall it's what I expected it to be. Works well with Switch cable is long enough to reach from couch to TV without issue. Worth it to use the gamecube controller.
5,Works as intended
5,My kiddos loved the option of using more controllers. This works well.
5,Plastic seemed a little on the cheaper side but it works perfectly.
1,Did not work even after looking it up online did not turn on did not even give a single indication that it was on.
5,Currently using this for Smash Ultimate on Switch. Plug it in and it just works as expected. Nothing to complain about good product.
5,Works great no perceptible lag (not that I'm a competitive player). Playing with the Switch Pro controller did not cut it for me. Now Smash is fun again.
5,Worked well easy plug and play
5,We bought this to use our GameCube controllers with the Switch and it works great.
5,I bought this so I could use GameCube controllers for the Nintendo Switch.  Works perfectly.  Buy this if you like GameCube controllers better than baby joycons.
5,Works well for what it's made for and I don't experience any lag.
5,Works exactly as intended. Great price.
5,Awesome
5,It works perfectly and has all functioning ports and has a much longer cord than I expected which is great!
5,You get exactly what you ordered and for a good value. My roommates and I have been using it for a couple months now and it still works great.
5,Good
5,Works like a charm for the Nintendo switch
5,The adapter is perfect. Came quickly and we haven't had any issues thus far. Even with a toddler in the mix it's not damaged in any way.
5,This thing works great. Awesome for Smash Bros ultimate.
5,Received it in a very fast manner from the seller the product works well and seems to be of good quality. 5/5 for this seller and their speed
5,This adapter is easy to use reliable and works wonderfully!  Now I can use my Gamecube controllers for Smash Ultimate on Switch!
1,Makes one of the triggers on 2 of the controllers useless and sometimes sends random trigger input.
5,Great product works well
5,Works perfectly as described and in excellent quality!
5,Does it’s job without a problem!
5,I don't know it was for my son
5,It just works out of the box. Nothing really to say about it.
5,Definitely would purchase again!
5,Works great on the switch
1,The pdobq gamecube adapter is a fine adapter for Wii U and Switch but it doesn't support PC as it was not intended to.If you want to have a flawless experience on all platforms just buy a Mayflash adapter or some other official adapter for GCN controllers.
5,Fantastic!
5,Works great! No problems
5,Super easy to use
5,Great product! Easy to follow instructions included and works great. They also followed up with an email to ensure my satisfaction with the product :)
2,It was possible to get a single controller working with this fine passing it through as a Joystick to the Lubuntu 19.10. However multiple controllers did not work as it was unable to register itself as a game cube usb switch adapter with the OS. The Mayflash adapter is a similar price and worked out of the box without problems; I suggest you buy that.
5,Works perfect on the switch and any other console you connect it to
5,Great product!
5,They loved it and arrived on time
5,Plugged it in plugged my GameCube controller in.  And that's the end of the story.  Everything worked as intended although I'm unsure what the turbo feature does.
5,Functions perfectly for competitive smash ultimate
5,Great product !
5,Love it
5,Worked as advertised
5,Haven't had this product long but so far we've had no issues using my old GameCube controllers to play Smash Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch
5,Great items
2,It works just fine on a switch.  Only needs one plug for rumble on one controller.  Broke a keyboard trying to get any sort of output on pc for it in dolphin.  Not even xinput works in it.
5,the product was exactly as described and arrived promptly. Excellent service. Thank you.
5,It’s very easy to use
3,Only works with smash bros.
5,Plugged into the switch and worked right awayFeels sort of cheap but i have yet to see how it will hold up
5,easy set up works like it should
5,Good quality! Worth the money!
1,When a controller is plugged into slot 1 and 2 of my unit the second controller's right trigger cannot be held down. With a controller in slot 1 and 3 or 1 and 4 this doesn't happen. I even tried setting the turbo and unsetting it to make sure it wasn't the problem and it's not.
5,Works very well satisfied with my purchase.
5,Excelente
5,Works really well!
5,It is a great item and easy to use.
5,Adapter works great!
5,It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well
1,I bought this for Super Smash Bros Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch and it works very well on there. Little to no input delay and complete ease of use. My problem comes when I tried using it on my computer.This unit comes with a switch on the back to toggle between Wii U and Switch mode and PC mode. Windows identifies it just fine but when I attempted to use them even after ~40+ minutes of fiddling with drivers it refused to work.If this only sold itself as being a GameCube controller adapter for the Switch I would have no problem with it. It works perfectly fine for that purpose. However the product advertises itself as a PC adapter as well. Claiming features on your product that your product does not have is no way to run a business.
5,Works great for Nintendo switch. Uses wired or wireless gamecube controllers with no issues.
5,I "needed" to play 4 player Mario Tennis on the Switch and this little dongle (along with 4 knockoff Gamecube controllers) made it happen.
5,works very well! would recommened
5,Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Does exactly as advertised and I couldn't be happier! My guy Tony is the man! I might buy another one as back up.
5,Chido
5,Got what I expected
5,It is definitely worth the money. I think that it does have a cheap feel to it. Other than that it works great.
5,Works just as intended.
5,Works as advertised. Plug n play. Even works well with generic GameCube controllers.
3,It has some minor input lag other than that fantastic and functional for connecting controllers
5,Works fine easy setup. No complaints. Have been using it for a couple months now.
5,Very intuitive design didn’t struggle to set it up and have had no problems with it!
5,Awesome product it works very well!
5,Quick and easy to set up
1,Don't advertise yourself as driver free if you don't mean it. It's not plug and play. I guess it doesn't matter if you don't mind the lack of rumble. Get the mayflash adapter for a budget option or the OEM model for actual plug and play
1,Doesn't work. Followed all the (poorly written) instructions that were included and it doesn't work. Connected it to a Switch and it doesn't recognize any GameCube controllers as being attached. This is obviously way cheaper than the OEM Nintendo adapter for a reason...
5,Works great.
5,Easy to use and easy to install
5,Works great!
5,Works perfect and a great price. Very pleased with gameplay.
5,Works as intended!
4,thanks I'm playing as comfortable with my GameCube control
5,It arrived as expected. Works like magic no problems none...
5,Works for us
5,feels a little cheap but works flawlessly
5,I like the product very easy to use and easy to set up
5,Great design
5,Really enjoy using this product for my switch was a bit skeptical due to price but turned out to be worth it. Would recommend to anyone
5,Arrived on time in great condition. No problem connecting to switch. Not sure why there are 2 is plugs but it's not really important for my use.
1,Bought this primarily for use with PC (Smash Melee/P+ on Dolphin emulator). Description says plug and play/no lag. Dolphin would not recognize this adapter as a WiiU GC adapter. The PC did recognize the adapter after switching to PC mode but it's common knowledge at this point that if you want to not have lag you want to run in native mode. Then I tried to switch ports and pulling the controller cable out was extremely hard. The plastic wire housing gave up before the USB adapter (see picture). Had to use pliers to take out the controller. I was going to test with my Switch but the port issue overshadows anything positive this thing might have to offer. Returned immediately.
5,I don't know how long this will last as I've only had it for a short while but so far it seems to work perfectly.
5,Worked well easy to use seems durable
5,Its functional and even though i havent had it for long has worked perfect for the switch and pc. Pretty easy to use as well.
5,It connectwd us all to play super smash :)
5,It works just as good as you’d want it too.  Satisfied customer here 👍🏼
5,It exceeded my expectations well worth the money
5,Easy to setup easy to swap between PC and Switch. Perfect for playing SSB or playing Gamecube games on PC. Really satisfied with product
5,I gave everything about this product 5 stars except for the "Easy to use" section because some drivers actually need to be installed for best performance.
5,Plugged into Nintendo Switch and everything worked as expected. Let's me hook up my knockoff wireless GameCube controllers with no issues.
5,Excelente!! Funciona con mi switch
5,Works perfectly and the long USB cable grants a lot of freedom of movement without risk of yanking the switch off the TV stand.
5,Only used it once but my gamecube controller was able to play Smash. And really isn't that all we want.
5,Arrived on time and perfect for playing Smash!
4,It works accurately and effectively
5,Exactly what I needed. Works like it should. Thanks!!
5,Started working immediately when I plugged it in.  No lag whatsoever all 4 ports work with no issues. Couldn't ask for anything else!
5,Really enjoyed the fact that it has 4 ports!
5,Works great for smash bros and Mario kart.No lag or delay that I can tell. Love using the GameCube controllers with my Switch.
5,Love it. Works so far!
2,buy a hotbox or official one
5,Its good
5,Product works really well. Easy to use. Just plug in and go. Price is also very good compared to others around.
5,So far so good. Easy to use set up and understand. I'd buy again if I needed to for the price.
5,I love that I can now play with all my old gamecube controllers!  Works great.
5,Works great!
5,2 months in and so far no problems
5,Works as expected. Easy to setup and use.
5,Great price and works great with playing Super Smash Brother on my Nintendo Switch.  I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Works great
5,We got what we expected and in a timely manner.  Very happy with product(s)
5,It was very easy to setup and very easy to use. Very much worth the purchase.  Would buy from this company again!
5,10/10 would bang
5,Works perfectly!
1,I bought this so I could play super smash bros online with my friend on PC. If you have a mind to do any emulation for games you previously owned or still own and just want to play again this is not compatible with Dolphin emulators or Slippi as far as I can tell and depending on the order you plug everything in the product will throw a bunch of driver errors which is funny because this item is “driverless”. I would recommend supporting driver software for this product as it currently isn’t particularly useable for PC like advertised.
5,Works great on the Nintendo Switch for Super Smash Brothers and the couple of extra feet you get for your controllers is very nice!
4,IT WORKED VERY NICE
5,I use this to play Smash Ultimate with a Gamecube Controller. No issues.
5,though it took me some time i got it to work. it's a great and handy tool if you want to play gamecube games overall.
5,Good value. Son loves it.
5,Exactly what i asked for not entirely sure what the turbo button is for but it works great!
3,Unfortunately did not want to work on my switch so I can't say much but it's cool that it has a turbo button and switch for PC/switch and wiiu
2,I bought it and it worked for a day then the next day when Im using it just stops working and its over heating and it smells like plastic burning and I waited a few hours and tried it again it started over heating and plastic burning bad product
5,All the gamecube adapters are really the same and this is one of the cheapest. Speedy delivery and no issues with the product.
2,I am hesitant to give this a 2 because I feel as though it is more of a 2.5.Everything about the adapter works fine (for switch at least haven’t tested on computer) but with one major problem: there is a very noticable amount of input delay.The lag is super annoying to play with at higher levels of competition but if your main goal is just to use it to play around with friends then i would say it is definitely usable.
5,It Work! But let see how long it will last.
5,Works as described
5,Works great on both PC and Switch!
5,Great value and shipped ahead of schedule.  Worked great with my Switch and had everyone using their favorite old fighting game controllers!
2,Super easy to setup and use on the Switch.About .35-.5 ms delay with inputs though. Not that reliable if you’re looking to play competitively online or in person.If you’re just using it for casual play or for a group of people who aren’t competitive minded at Smash it works just fine.
4,Arrived on time and works amazing
5,Worked with my Gamecube controller and Dance pad as I needed it to. Keep it set to Wii switch even when using with PC though.
5,It does exactly as I was hoping
5,Camera
5,Works perfectly. Build quality not too good but for the price and reliability just fine in my book
5,It does exactly what I need
5,It works great. Definitely get this.
5,Wanted an adapter for the switch to use game cube controllers. Plug and play it does exactly that.
5,Works great no input lag or anything. Easy to set up just plug and play. Overall good adapter!
5,Very pleased with this purchase. No complaints yet.
5,Bought it to use gamecube controllers while playing smash it's never failed me so far.
5,Lost my old one. Got this one. Works with my gamecube controller with no lag.Not much else to say.
5,Simple to use and working as intended!
5,It does what it's meant to do. Would recommend.
5,Works!
5,I bought this primarily for the Nintendo Switch. Thus far it works perfectly. I haven't tried it for PC yet.
5,It’s pretty good for it’s price
5,Just what I was looking for
5,Works perfectly I've tested a few of my games on the Switch and they work perfectly can't wait for Smash to come out this winter!
5,Perfect for my Wavebird controllers plugged right in and started working. Would highly recommend them!
5,Very simple to set up just plugged it in. Have not had a single problem yet
5,my son enjoys playing the games
5,Great product  works great with my Nintendo Switch
5,works just like the nintendo adapter but is significantly cheaper it's great that is works on wiiu switch and pc.
1,Broke 1.5 months after purchase. Just outside of return window
5,Haven't had issues so far
5,Bought this at the request of my kid. He said it was easy to use to works as expected.
3,Bought this for my son and it has no explanation as how to use.  One connector is gray one is black and who knows what goes where.
5,Works perfectly shipped quickly and arrived on time extremely easy to use.
5,I purchased the gamecube adapter for my Switch. Works out right out of the box and with no problems. Highly recommended.
5,Just plugged in and started playing. Make sure the switch on the adapter is in the right setting. No complaints!
5,Great product exactly as advertised. The shipping said it would take 3 weeks and it came in just over a week!
5,Works sweet
5,Works great on the Switch. Now my son can use his game cube smash controller to play Smash Ultimate.
5,It works! Feels a little bit cheap but it works and is cheap so can't complain
5,Great and easy to setup
2,The adapter doesn’t work on PC. I tried many ways to plug it in and get it to work for an emulator I was using but it doesn’t convert right.
5,Works as advertised no issues
5,Works fine for Wii U. Can't attest to the input lag or anything but it feels perfectly responsive and no issues so far.
5,Perfect! Does exactly as advertised!
5,Very nice
5,Great product.
2,It doesn't work fully. The first port doesn't work at all on my switch and I had to use the second port in order to utilize this.
5,The ports are a little stiff when plugging in the controllers and the fourth port is kind of finicky but it works well overall.
5,Great for pulling out your old GameCube controllers !! Love it
5,Works well for what I need it for.
1,I have had this product for less than a month. It has not left my entertainment center yet my switch stopped recognizing the adapter. The switch recognized other USB devices so I tested it on my computer. Nope! Failed to recognize device. Don't waste your time.
5,Worked exactly as intended. Even received an email checking up on the product. Great for the price.
5,Great
1,Didn't work in thee slightest and honestly I shouldn't've expected it too. I was excited and bought it without hesitation 'specially since Amazon suggested it. Instead got a no-brand (can't even say off-brand) product that didn't work and how I should've known it wouldn't was the fact that in the photos for the product it shows PlayStation controllers and the lovely lady who reviewed it had a branded product. Really upsetting but you can't win ever battle I suppose.
3,It's a cheap knockoff. It'll do the job for casual play but not recommended for tournament setups.
5,Works great no perceived latency easy to connect and reasonably priced.
5,Love it! Works great easy to use.
5,The item arrived promptly as described.  My son is ecstatic to be able to use the Gamecube controller on Wii U.
5,I bought this adapter to use a GameCube controller on my switch and it works perfectly.
5,Works perfectly!
5,Works like a charm
2,Works for the switch but doesn't work for PC emulators like Dolphin.  You're better off buying the actual Nintendo version
5,Worked as intended
5,The product came as advertised and works perfectly. Great value as compared to other adapters out there.
5,Kids love it. So many Smash Brothers battles have taken place because of this piece alone.
1,Lengthy process to use. First product sent did not work. Yet to try the replacement...
5,Good
5,The adapter works perfectly. I have third-party GameCube controllers and there are no issues connecting to the Switch.
5,Looks to be a high quality product can't wait to use it
5,Great for GC controllers!
5,Works great! No issues
5,It still works great and was very inexpensive.
5,Works perfect!! Thanks
5,I mean i got it on time. Thing was just fine. Easy to use.
5,Worked as it should. Shipping was fast. Thank you.
5,This product gets the job done for a fraction of the price of competitors
5,No issues at all
5,This product was exactly what I wanted. It works perfectly fine and I couldn’t be more satisfied.
5,Great product. Does what it says and does it every time.
5,Really needed this for a smash turny I was having and it works great!
5,I like how quickly I received the adapter and how easy it was to use.
5,Hi! This is a Christmas present for my son so I don't know how it is yet.Sorry
5,Great product easy to use and was delivered fast.
1,It stopped working a week after I bought it
5,great for what it is
5,Great!
5,Very good product works well with the switch a great investment for a nice price.
1,It worked fine for over a year but suddenly started disconnecting my controllers and adding drift to them for some reason. It could have been something I did but I highly doubt it considering I would never really move it from my switch. Do not recommend.
5,Got the adapter and used it right away. It's literally plug and play!
5,As described arrived as promised. Works GREAT!  Competitive price. Item used for Switch.  Thank you.
5,Great product!  Like new!  Excellent customer service!
2,It was made of a nice plastic material and immediately worked when I plugged it in but it was not screwed together. The plastic shell came apart after picking it up after one use. It would not be a problem if I had little screws.
5,Worked well no discernible lag connects instantly great cheaper adapter!
5,Connected to my Linux distro no problem. Gaming like it's 2001.
2,I bought this based on reviews and Q&A answers that verified this worked with MacOS. I tried many different things but could not get the controllers to be recognized on my Macbook with either Dolphin or OpenEmu. Watch out!
5,This works perfectly. No problems.
5,Good so far. Use it for Smash on Switch and I have had no problems thus far.
5,Dont pass on this adapter  it works with with switch  wiiu  and pc flawlessly.
5,Great item worked as it was intended to
5,This product worked exactly like I needed it to.
5,On pc you might need to download a software to play on Dolphin
5,Works very well  good price! glad I bought it.
1,I did quite a bit to try and get this device up and running on PC and it just doesn't work like all of these other reviewers said. To be honest I suspect foul play.I tried both modes available out of box and when that didn't work I proceeded to try several different drivers and launchers to get it functioning. Ultimately my conclusion is that your PC will indeed recognize the adapter however no controller ports actually function.This has been a very frustrating experience and I will probably be doing as others recommended and trying a Mayflash. Do not waste your time like I did.
5,Works great! Haven't noticed a difference with turbo button but works great anyway!
1,This item claims to work with the Dolphin emulator on PC but does not. Tried in both PC mode and in Wii U mode and while the device is recognized by the computer it is not recognized by Dolphin.Typical method is to download Zadig and install the correct drivers for the device which should be recognized by Zadig as "WUP-028". However the adapter is called "Gamecube Adapter" instead.Once opening Dolphin 5.0 the adapter simply is not recognized whether trying to use in PC mode as a Standard controller or in Wii U Mode as a Gamecube controller.
5,Does what you expect
5,Wanted to use this for SSBU as a longtime Melee player and it works perfectly!
5,I got this for my nintendo switch and it works just fine!
5,I had no problems hooking it up the price was ideal and have experienced zero input delay.
2,Didn't work tried using it on pc/wiiu/switch and plugging in multiple controllers and I couldn't use any of them on any console.
5,Perfect
5,It works with my switch for both wired GameCube controllers and wavebird. No problems.
5,I purchased it for my grandson.  Received the item in a short time. Would definitely buy again.
5,Works as intended
5,My son enjoys using the controller on his Switch very much!
5,Bought it for smash and seems to be performing just fine.
5,Its a very simple and straight forward product to use. Works well and I am very satisfied!
2,This thing worked for a bout three days and in the middle of a gaming session with my family the third port started glitching and now every time you plug any controller in it it makes your curser go to the left. The thing feels really cheaply made. Sucks but what can I do about it?
1,The adapter worked for a good 3 days before it just decided to not want to identify as a adapter on my PC anymore. I tried everything and even reinstalled windows before I just gave in and bought a offical adapter. SO PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR WALLET DONT BUY THIS FOR PC USE THEY LIE.
5,Bought this for Smash Bros Ultimate on Switch works perfectly with new and old Gamecube controllers.
5,I get to enjoy playing Smash Ultimate like how I fell in love with Melee.
5,Adapter works great no lag and has good cable length highly recommendable product.
5,My son is very happy with this product
5,Product is dope! Not entirely sure on what the turbo button does but it works.
5,Works perfectly the only setup is plugging it in and the cord is long.
5,Delivered to me just like it said. Pretty good
5,Product works great so far and for a great price
1,I had bought this for the purposes of playing smash melee on the PC. i tried everything wasting hours trying to get it to work. downloading drivers messing with the settings. looking at other reviews saying it's worked for them on PC and how they did it etc. extremely frustrating seeing how it clearly says it can work with PC when it does not.
5,Does the job and is easy to use.  The quality is perfect for the price.
1,Absolute piece of junk. Windows stopped recognizing it less than a month after I bought this. Stay FAR away from this adapter because it will die on you. I noticed other people weren't having this issue and it works for them which is fine. But mine stopped and I have to give it a 1/5. It was fine before hand and did it's job but not anymore.
5,Works as intended and arrived quickly
1,i have a wavebird wireless gamecube controller and it does not work with this. the light on the wavebird receiver lights up but the switch wont recognize my controller or even react to it being plugged in
2,The product worked perfectly for my switch with no noticeable lag. However when switched to the pc the adapter didn't work for the Dolphin Emulator although says its compatible. If you are just buying it for switch use its perfectly fine but for PC it doesn't work.
5,No issues with this product.  I use it on my PC.
5,It's an amazing product and easy to use especially since I don't use a gamecube anymore.
1,This adapter worked for 3 seconds... I followed several YouTube videos to make sure it was not an error on my part or on the controller's part. Nope. This adapter sucks for me at least. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a working one but when I attempted to connect my controllers for Smash one of them showed up for three seconds and then disappeared and never came back after multiple attempts. It feels cheap and is cheap save your money and buy a different brand. I just purchased a "Old Skool" brand adapter and it works great although a little more expensive. Good luck!
2,It is easy to use but the connection with I insert the game cube controllers into the slots is very lose and doesn’t work good. The connection isn’t consistent enough to play a game with
5,Whooooooooped Brian Nicols ass for days in smash with this adaptor.
5,As advertised
1,This didn't immediately work for me after troubleshooting for some time so I decided to give it some time maybe a driver needed to be updated or something. No this thing simply doesn't work with dolphin probably something that should be listed in the product title instead of assumed and not found out from other unsatisfied customers. You're better off buying a legit one that doesn't omit such an important feature 1 star.
1,I received the item but it didn't work. I tested all 4 slots and only slot #2 worked for a minute if the plug was kept perfectly (and unrealistically) straight. It is also made of very cheap plastic that didn't feel at all durable. Huge disappointment for me and my siblings. We were looking forward to playing together.I've requested a replacement and will update my review if the replacement is in working condition.
1,As title says I got the adapter and pluged it into my PC and pluged my controller into it and it didn't work at all tried all the ports and checked all the cables and it just didn't work DO NOT BUY
5,Works perfectly...
5,Works exactly as it should and easy to use
5,Works just as it should good price and fast shipping.
5,Good
5,Very easy to set up and so far work well!
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR PC OR DOLPHIN EMULATOR. Why even advertise it with a "PC" switch if it wont even work for PC? Even when trying to use third party drivers it still did not work. Do not recommend if you are trying to use for PC/Dolphin.
5,Works right out of the box on the switch
5,Use it to play Smash Ultimate with gamecube controllers works great
5,Works perfectly fine super worth it for the price.
5,Great for value
5,Item came on time and as expected. Works with Switch and Smash.
5,Fast turnaround time to my 🏠Works like a charm.
5,Works great on PC and Switch. Worth the buy if you plan on getting smash ultimate!
5,it is a christmas present so i just dont know much about it yet
5,Works great for smash.
5,Does just what it says no issues with it so far.
5,It works
5,Must have for any smash player. Makes those old GameCube controllers useful again
5,My son was really satisfied with the product. It arrived earlier than expected.
5,Loved it !! Now we can play smash bros on the switch
5,Left it in switch mode and it worked with Zadig like my older adapters.
5,Solid alternative to the official Nintendo GC adapter for a fraction of the price.
5,Worked as described
1,Do not purchase this product if you are using dolphin emulator it does not work it misleads you to believe it does and you can damage your original drivers by trying to make it work.
5,great
5,Works great! No issues.
5,Product shipped quickly worked properly was new and at a good price...no reason to pay more
5,Exactly what wanted
5,Works perfect
5,Works with dolphin sets up easily all is good.
5,Product shipped exactly as advertised and works like a charm. Would purchase from this group again.
5,Great for smash
5,Just as great as the Nintendo version no problems what so ever.
5,Not much else to say other than it works exactly as advertised.
5,This is a gift for my grandson who requested it. Came in perfect condition.
5,Needed it for massive play of Switch Mario Kart 8. Worked like a charm!!
5,Does just what i needed it to do great for smash ultimate
5,I love this adapter as it works perfectly on both PC and the Switch!
5,Works as intended
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ADAPTER TO USE GAMECUBE CONTROLLER ON PC. DOES NOT WORK.After attempting to install the drivers in multiple ways and on multiple websites the adapter was unable to work with my computer (Windows 10). I have read on other forums that this adapter does not work. The Mayflash adapter was the common adapter that was suggested.DO NOT BUY THIS ADAPTER TO USE GAMECUBE CONTROLLER ON PC. DOES NOT WORK.
5,does exactly what i needed it for. I have only tested it with PC.
5,Exactly what we needed
5,Just bought this. Getting ready for Smash on Switch. So far it works!
5,Fantastic!
5,Great product for a great price!
5,Works great for switch delivered pretty quick for such high demand.
5,House of four boys this is the go-to purchase
5,Bought one to use for my switch and had no issues.
5,This adapter works on WII U Switch and PC. Glad I got it!
5,Great price. Received very quickly. Works well. Good product.
5,Works perfectly
2,The product didn't work with the Wii U as advertised!!!
5,It works as intended easy to set up
5,Works great so far using for smash bros. ultimate on switch.
5,Got my fiance's valentine gift set with this! Works great!
5,It works perfectly and came on time.
5,Does exactly what description implies. Couldn't be happier!
5,Easy to use and arrived quickly!
1,Got for a time up at the mountains with some friends. After we go there had it hooked up at night time for when we relaxed on the switch to play smash. The delay this device causes between the moving the joy stick and the corresponding move on the screen was at least 1 full second. Made any game we tried with it UNPLAYABLE.0/5 would not buy again
1,Got this thinking this would be a good/ easy device to use to play games on Dolphin Emulator on PC but it will not work with Dolphin. Any reviews saying this works with Dolphin Emulator are lying straight to your face. You should spend the extra bit money on a Mayflash that will work with Dolphin Emulator on PC and not this garbage
5,Perfect adapter. Tested on Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Working great!
5,This is what everyone playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate needs!!!
5,Great product thanks!
5,Arrived quickly and only required being plugged in to work
5,It's a good buy.
5,yeah
5,Not bad definitely makes a difference in smash
5,Inexpensive shipped quickly still works a month later.
5,It works for Switch with Smash Ultimate! Everything works great!
1,"Make sure you have it plugged in!" Oh gee thanks... This thing is garbage and doesn't work as intended and has since been returned.
5,Just as good as a Nintendo product
5,I plug in the Gcube controllers they work. A+
5,Excellent!
1,when plugged into pc i get warning on boot saying it cant turn on to prevent damage
5,Works great using it with a gamecube emulator on pc.
2,Despite being advertised to work with emulators it does not function with Dolphin one of the most common and popular emulators
5,Good value for your money.
5,Arrived on time works great. Easy set up
1,It's my own fault for not reading all the reviews because several people did mention it. If you are getting this for PC then find something else. It does not work with Nick Brawl on steam
5,works just like the Nintendo product with other features
5,Functions perfectly. Good cheap replacement!
5,Is good
5,Cheap and it works
2,I should have looked at the reviews. It does not work with Dolphin emulator even after following the connection directions on Dolphin's site and putting hours into troubleshooting.
1,When I plugged my controller into the port it was hard to get in and when I pulled it out it was hard to get out. The port is so narrow that it pulled the inside end of the cord out. Luckily it snapped back in. I thought I broke my controller so I tested the controller on my Wii and it works perfectly. Thank God. It does work on the Switch but I don’t think it’s worth the risk of damaging your controller. Would not recommend.
5,Great bang for your buck
5,It works perfect!
5,Plug and ready to play. :D
5,Awesome product would buy again!
1,Tried to use this with the switch but it didn't work. When I tried using a wave bird the controller connected to the receiver as the green led lite up when i poweed on the controller. However the switch refused to see the controller.I ordered a mayflash adapter and that worked perfectly fine...tried to save money by buying the pdobq device and it didn't work out...
5,worked perfectly
5,great
5,Nothing to complain about.
5,Works as advertised. super easy to setup..
1,Product does not work with Zadig and it has input delay if you switch it to PC and use Dolphin to emulate the controller. I know a lot of people are buying adapters because of the recent edition of Rollback Netcode for Melee and you will be extremely disappointed if you buy this product for that purpose. I returned mine and went with a Mayflash. Do not recommend for anyone who wants to play Super Smash Bros. Melee!!
1,The Turbo button was not present on my adapter despite it being present in the picture and the description on the box. The adapter itself is shoddy in quality as well. The switch on the back is flimsy and the port connections feel as if they were not made to the right size. It takes more force than should be necessary to connect a controller to the port. Overall don't buy this. There's much better adapters on the market for this price point.
5,Everything works great thus far. No complaints
5,No issues. Does what it says it does.
5,RECEIVED ITEM ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED.
5,durable easy to use and a very good price!!
5,I liked that it worked just fine.
1,I bought this product for my working Gamecube controller. After a couple months the adapter stopped working on my pc and switch ive trying to fix it and tried reusing it over and over.If u want an actual adapter that will work on Switch and PC use mayflash.
5,Works as expected.
5,Our wireless gamecube controllers work great.
5,As described  great product works great.
5,Works perfectly.  No lag. Good  quality product.
5,Worked wellNice long cableNo issues
5,This one actually works
4,Found one of these in a thrift store for a few bucks so thought I'd pick it up. I can't speak for how well it works with the Wii U but it works great with computers albeit a couple small bugs. For one the unit's native driver does not appear to be very compatible with Windows; in my case 11. The connection is horribly spotty a problem however fixable by using Zadig to replace the driver with a more friendly one. The second issue is interference while using a Wavebird. The receiver must be immediately visible to the controller for buttons to input reliably; having it obstructed even a little (e.g. your legs) can cause input to fail or stutter. Besides that awesome alternative to the official product.
5,Happy with purchase no issues
5,works like a charm
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR PC. I tested on multiple pcs and simply does not work. Maybe there was a different product with some of the other reviews but as of late this product doesn't work despite many attempts and workarounds. The pictures and videos that other users posted don't look like this adapter with text on the top that isn't there with the adapter I recieved. I feel robbed and returning it isn't worth the effort. Don't get tricked.
2,After several tries downloaded files and a few hours of troubleshooting I have came to the conclusion that this adapter doesn't work with Nintendont.It does work with switch with Smash so if that's what you're looking for cheers.
1,I don’t write reviews but this thing worked fine for a week and then just stopped working for no reason. Would not recommend at all.
5,Worked as expected.
5,Works as intended for a great price
5,Easy use quick and simple
5,It works great.
5,Everything works as expected
5,This works better then I thought it would.
5,Nice and easy
5,Worked with out issue
5,Love this for the switch
1,I love this thing. I enjoy the less expensive option and works great most of the time. Sometimes when I re-plug in a controller it will stop sending the bumpers or suddenly have drift. I’m certain it’s the adapter since my friend also has an adapter and I play on that one 50% of the time. This is the only one I have issues with. I’d recommend spending the extra couple bucks to get the Nintendo adapter.
5,No problems with this product
5,Good
1,Tried on my recently purchased Switch with no signs of functionality from the Switch or Smash Bros Ultimate. Tried several ways all the ports - nothing. Thought I would try to see if my PC would recognize it but got an error message from Windows immediately after plugging it in that the USB malfunctioned. Returning it for a Mayflash.
5,Works on the Switch very well.
2,Did not work on PC despite what the product description said. Wishing I bought a different adapter.
5,Worked Great!
5,Works great right price. Thanks
5,it works! no complaints
5,I use for super smash bros
5,Great product
5,works great. thanks
5,Works great! Came packaged well.
5,Great product for your money
5,Does the job with no problems
5,Excelente
1,I bought this adapter so I could use it on my PC. I followed instructions online and used the zadig application to no avail. Total waste of time and money.
5,Does exactly what it needs to.
5,Works as expected :)
5,Item was perfect thank you
5,Love it.
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,A gift for my son
1,If you plan to use this on PC DO NOT BUY IT. TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW AND BUY A MAYFLASH ADAPTER. I have been waiting to play for days only to find out once this thing arrived that the manufacturer is straight up lying about this thing having PC functionality. It is NOT compatible with Dolphin. Highly disappointed.
1,There are no clear instructions on how to set this up.  All instructions are for the mayflash adapter (which actually works very well as opposed to this one).  Sometimes the adapter would not even be registered by the computer after installing the correct drivers.  Do yourself a favor and invest the extra money in the mayflash adapter it works very well and does the job on every computer ive tested it on.
1,Broke after a week of use of laying on the floor in my room. Only used it a few times now it doesn't work and my pc no longer detects it. Disappointing..
1,Picked this adapter bc it was cheaper than the official Nintendo one and it had good reviews. It worked fine FOR ONE DAY and then it randomly stopped working. Controllers are fine but the Switch won’t recognize my GameCube controller using this adapter. Theres no support to contact that I’ve seen probably bc it’s cheaply made in China. Garbage product. I might have gotten a defective one but buyer beware. Getting a refund and buying the official licensed Nintendo adapter.
5,Good bang for the buck
5,excelent!
5,It works great
5,Buy this. Now!
5,Exactly what i needed
5,Great product works perfectly
5,yeh
5,Works as it should
5,Thanks
5,love it
5,It works great!
5,on time and as promised
5,excellent product
5,Worked perfect for my Switch.
1,Did not work on the pc. I’m almost 100% positive too that using this and trying to set it up on my pc it ruined my drivers for my keyboard mouse and other controllers seeing as how they stopped working after trying to configure this product. I would not recommend.
5,It works well
5,Exactly what I wanted !!
5,Nothing wrong
1,I tried using this adapter for my pc. It couldn’t recognize any of my controllers even after testing on a friends adapter. Tried looking up drivers online to see if that would work but it didn’t. In the end it was too much of a hassle for what it is.
1,I have tried to use this product 4 times now it only connected 1 of the 4 times.  Turbo Button on back seems to be stuck(not ever sure what it does).  My Switch is updated I followed all trouble-shooting steps this is not a case of user error.Friends have similar products they all say it was a simple plug and play operation.  Unfortunately mine only worked once.  Bummer.
2,Product was not good with PC. Not compatible with PC
1,This does not work on PC with emulators especially with Dolphin. It took forever to find out that it was the devices problem and not me being an idiot because numerous people were having the same problems as me on reddit with brands other than original or Mayflash. I ordered a Mayflash and it instantly worked. Avoid the headache if you want to use on PC.
5,ye
5,Worth the money
5,Great item
5,Works great! No issues!
5,Works perfectly no complaints.
2,My controller would get stuck inside
5,effective
1,Once you finally get this product to work for pc it doesn't even function properly. large delays on inputs and it made slot one control ALL slots. disapointed that this is an "amazon choice". Im now buying a much more expensive alternative that I know isn't a cheap piece of garbage
2,It says it comes with a turbo button but mine did not. Other than that it work fine
5,works
5,It works
5,Works perfectly
5,Works great
2,It rarely works. Lots of effort to make it work feels cheap.
5,Thanks !
5,Works great!
5,No complaints
5,Works great.
5,It works!!
1,Just doesn't work. Won't read the controller at all won't let me make any inputs. Tried for over 2 hours and nothing we did worked. Looked at forums for another hour to find a solution but nothing worked. Just get mayflash. Same price and guaranteed to work.
5,Everything was great!
1,after an hour of trying to find drivers found a reddit page saying it has issues with Zadig and wont get the drivers to play using Dolphin but it works fine with the Switch
1,Doesn't work for pc. Waste of money. Dont buy this garbage.
1,I used it and it worked great the first day I was so happy. And then using it the next day it didn't work at all I tried two separate controllers so I know that wasn't the issue. I ordered a replacement so let's see how that goes.
5,Thanks
1,Did not work at all
5,Works great
1,This doesn’t work for me at all. I tried using it with Steam games and with non-Steam games on my computer and nothing I did could get either of my laptops to recognize or acknowledge that a controller was connected.
1,Terrible product. One of the ports was damaged already when opened package. Then the other 3 ports were so poorly sized that whenever we put the controller in the port it would be hard to push IN and hard to pull OUT. Many times loosening the controller connection itself.
1,So when i got the device i tested it and it worked the didn't really use it after 2 weeks and it started giving some troubles to be detected by the switch I have to move it around disconnect and reconnect the controller to get it to work.
1,I can’t get my controllers to connect to the switch. I tried both wired and wireless controllers. Why are their 2 usb cables?? I followed the directions which were pretty vague and had no luck.
1,This device without a doubt does NOT work for the Dolphin emulator. Do not listen do the reviews which state otherwise you'll just waste your time. Instead buy the Mayflash adaptor (known to work with Dolphin) or the official one from Nintendo.
1,This product will NOT work for NetplayThis is not suitable for a competitive smash player not even for PC.Waste of money materials and matter.I ended up smashing mine with my replica rune pickaxe from OSRS.
1,Tried all the ports and multiple controllers but none get recognized. Waste of my money.
1,It works for Wii U/Switch but does not work at all with Dolphin on the PC. The instructions inform you to download the driver on their "webtsie" but never list an actual website to go to. I will be returning mine for a Mayflash immediatly.
1,It worked great for the first couple weeks but then it just stopped. Tested my controller on a friend's adapter and it worked fine. Fine if you want to buy a new one every other week but if you're going for quality don't
1,Never buy off brand controllers.  I tried to connect to Dolphin Emulator but PC modes needs to be fully re-mapped and Wii U mode isn't recognized.  I tried it on some Xbox controller games and it wasn't recognized in either mode.
1,Complete waste of money. C-stick is inverted with the adapter and the one I recieved only even worked on 2 of the 4 ports. On pc the calibration wizard will not recognize any inputs. Please buy a Karges or official nintendo branded adapter.
1,After one use it stopped working! I’m so upset and have no idea why this thing has so many good reviews because it is garbage and I wish I would’ve spent a bit more to get something that actually worked!
1,Doesn’t work on any of the switch ports dead usb connector
1,Should be mentioned that it doesn't supply full power to the controllers just what is necessary so some add-ons and controllers won't work
1,Didn't work like we thought it would.
1,Do not buy this product. Plugged it into my computer and none of the button presses registered at all in either PC mode or WiiU/Switch mode.
1,It just stopped working after a month. So that sucks.  (It worked quite well before though...) :(  Bummer...
1,Just opened it for the first time tried using it and it didn’t work. Love waisting my money!
1,This product could not be recognized on my PC or Wii U despite hours of messing with tutorials and drivers and other junk. A waste of time and money.
1,Materials feel cheap. Windows drivers dont work despite being detected
1,It didn’t work for the game pad we ordered it for! What a waste!
1,Only can play smash bros not worth it for one game wish I saw another review that let me know
1,This is a completely trash product that does not work on PC like it is advertised. They should be shut down for the evil that they are practicing. Shame on this company DISGRACEFUL!
1,Works great with one big problem: the controller got stuck in the adapter! It took a while to wiggle it out and I worry that continuing to do so could harm the controller.
1,This is my first one star review on amazon. This device stopped working after a couple months. Total waste of money. Couldn’t get a refund because it’s outside the refund window. Don’t buy this.
1,Didn’t work properly lines appeared across my screen ruined the experience
1,Should have read the reviews I guess would have been nice to know this doesnt work with dolphin
1,It worked for about a month then my gamecube controllers wouldn't play properly through it in Super Smash Ultimate
1,Horrible product do not but if you intend to use it on PC. After 3 hours looking for many drivers tricks and looking for information nothing made it work.
1,The device that arrived had ports that were too tight for the original nintendo gamecube controller.  The controller heads would only fit in halfway due to how tight the plastic was.
1,stopped working (maybe nintendo blocked it or maybe it just died..not buying another to test)
1,Product doesn't actually input controls. The PC does recognize it as an adapter and is detected on dolphin until the game is launched thats when the adapter doesn't work
1,Bought this to use gamecube controllers on my wii u and it doesn't work at all. Works for my pc but that's not what I wanted it for!
1,Disappointed that this adapter does not support emulation or Dophin despite advertising and Q&A answers claiming it does.
1,Couldnt get it to work
1,Product was not recognized by a PC after multiple attempts to get it working on two computers. Waste of money invest in a more reliable one
1,Didn't work as advertized. PC function doesn't work even with third-party drivers that usually make these things work.
2,Doesn’t work on PC only with Switch.
1,Worked for a minute then stopped
1,This piece of junk doesn't work on PC. It work fine on Switch but the fact that they lied about PC support completely ruins the purchase for me.
1,Hopefully anyone looking to buy this to use gamecube controllers on the PC reads the 1 star comments first. It doesn't work on PC.
1,After trying it out on my pc installing all drivers and much searching came to find out this will not work on pc.
1,This DOES NOT work with Dolphin
1,It's a defective product if they claim to be an adapter for the PC. It doesn't actually work. Buy a mayflash instead.
1,Worked great for about 2 weeks then it stopped working completely. Don’t waste your money.
1,Have to send back. Defective.
1,Did not function when plugged in to PC even with suggested workarounds.
1,Day 1 just got this in the mail and it doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money on an inferior product.
1,Didn’t work on pc or Wii U only works on switch!
1,If you're gonna use an adapter for the Dolphin emulator get a Mayflash. This one can't be detected and doesn't work with it.
1,Not compatible
1,Doesn't work for the Wii U or Switch gave up trying to figure it out.
1,Works out of box for dolphin. No hacks will make this work outside of dolphin. LAAAMME
1,Does not work with Dolphin.
1,Didn't work at all I tried everything and wouldn't function had to return it  so sad :(
1,Bought this to use with dolphin emulation on PC it would never connect. Wouldn't recommend this brand.
1,Worked ONCE then stopped working... might exchange but not sure if it's going to be worth it.
1,Latency while plugged into Switch was ridiculous and unacceptable. Tried to use on Wii U as well didn’t work AT ALL.
1,This doesnt work with Dolphin emulator. Spend a few more dollars for a mayflash adapter
1,Does not actually work with dolphin emulator on pc. Buy a mayflash.
1,Doesn't work. Waste of money and waste of time. Absolute crap construction.
1,No instructions. I youtubed videos trying to make this work and it just doesn’t. I think mine was DOA.
1,Did not function correctly constantly stuck in turbo mode
1,Q/A says it works for dolphin it does not.
1,Broke immediately
1,Port was already damaged somehow when it arrived worthless.
1,It didnt work kept saying adapter not detected

1,does not work melee netplay
1,Not the same as nintendo's device. Useless.

1,Doesn’t work waste of money.
1,Came broken. Not even working
1,Noticeable input lag on switch. Would not recommend for Smash
5,En muy buen estado y fácil de usar recomendado para jugar smash
5,Works good!We use it for a Switch and PC
5,This adapter works great!  I've used this with both my Nintendo Switch and Dolphin Emulator on my PC.  As far as I can tell there is no lag as my inputs come out when I want them to just fine.FOR THOSE USING THIS WITH DOLPHIN EMULATOR:If Dolphin complains about something being wrong with the GameCube adapter put the adapter in PC mode and use "Standard Controller" settings as opposed to "GameCube Adapter for Wii U" in Dolphin's controller settings.  Make sure to manually assign each of the buttons on the physical controller to their corresponding ones by pressing "Configure" next to the appropriate Port.  Note you will need to configure for each physical port you plan to use.  For example if you plan to use ports 1 and 3 on the adapter you will need to select "Standard Controller" for Ports 1 and 3 in Dolphin's controller settings and you will need to configure them both.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.  Hope this review helped!
5,Easy to use!
5,Works as expected
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Can't ask for more than that.I will say that looking at the pictures it gave the impression of being smaller than it actually is. I was worried when I ordered it that the old Wavebird receivers might be too big to use with it which wouldn't have been the WORST thing for me I still have wired controllers too but it's bigger than I thought and there's plenty of space between the ports.
5,This worked exactly how it is described to. It has no lag and is extremely easy to set up. The company is super helpful and reached out to me in order to make sure I had received my order and was fully satisfied with it
5,The product performs just as well as  the official Nintendo adapter no drivers needed simply works right out of the box.
5,Works great for the switch.
2,Worked like a charm for a while replacing an old adapter I broke. After ~6-7 months of use it just stopped working. I tested on my switch another switch and a PC. The gamecube controllers plug in but the system won't recognize the adapter at all.
1,After buying this and using it for smash bros for some time I unplugged my controllers and tried to use them at my friends. Every single one was stripped after using this adapter and all my controllers that I used on this adapter do not work now on ANY adapter. One of my buddies is a semi-professional and plays in tournaments. He wouldn't even consider plugging his controller into this adapter. That was before I found out it stripped mine. The only adapters you should get are the official Nintendo (which is impossible to get so you aren't going to) or the Mayflash brand. Those are the only two adapters allowed at most smash tournaments. I bought a mayflash and have not had any problems whatsoever. It is great. Buy a mayflash adapter this one is crap.
1,I recently received a set of game cube controllers and this adapter for a going back to college gift and was elated to find the controllers and this adapter working great. Unfortunately for me the adapter started going haywire almost immediately. I thought it might just be the one port so I tried the other one but all at once the entire brick stopped working to connect the game cube controllers to the switch. I have 4 expensive game cube controllers now and nothing to use them with. I am extremely disappointed and hope that this issue can be resolved because when it worked it worked very well with little to no input lag from my POV.
1,This piece of garbage is a for sure waste of money. The first day I got it was good. Plugged in and worked right away. However only two days later it completely stopped working. I got this on sale and I can see why it was so cheap! It’s because this product is a disgusting piece of trash. A button that doesn’t work feels cheap breaks after one use. AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
1,Does not work! 😠Plugged it in all usb ports and have the toggle switch to the "Wii u/switch" position. I own a wireless wavebird controller and even though the port receiver lights up the controller input is not being recognized in either the menu or in game.  My system is updated to the most recent version of 10.1 or something.  Very dissatisfied and would give zero stars if possible.
2,This adapter works great with a Switch or Wii U but it absolutely does not work with Dolphin or any other program to use on your PC.
1,Don't waste your hours troubleshooting through the comments or Mayflash/official guides on the wiki Dolphin doesn't support most third party adapters.
1,Says the adapter was detected on dolphin followed instructions but none it still doesn't detect any of my buttons when I press them
4,It does function properly and if rumble on PC isn't a big deal to you then this is a nice purchase.If rumble is a big deal though... As this isn't the more mainstream adapter if you're looking to use this for emulation you'll be fine- But you won't get a single bit of rumble. It doesn't matter if the original controller itself is capable of rumble it just won't happen. Dolphin doesn't detect it as a proper Gamecube Adapter and instead calls it 'generic gamepad'.Now for the Switch functionality it's just fine. Rumble actually works there! It does have capability to translate rumble into the actual controller it just won't work in PC. Switch works wonderfully.TL;DR - Good product works as intended PC has no rumble but Switch does. Recommended if you're on a budget and can't afford MayFly.
1,So first of all I'd like to say I'm an idiot. I should have read the reviews from the get go. I did not know there was an officially licensed adapter or else I would've paid for that. So now that that's out of the way let's begin.I bought this for PC to play gamecube games on Dolphin Emulator. It does not work at all. I've wasted an hour of my time trying all different configurations listed here by other users and nothing works. I've tried other controllers in case mine were faulty nope. Debating on whether to return this or throw my $11 in the trash.
5,I bought this to use my GameCube controllers with my switch (duh...) and it's quite durable and easy to use. It's been thrown in my backpack countless times and is a great value for the money. One thing to add you don't need both wires the black wire is for controller movement and the grey is for vibration. If you have friends that want to plug in a USB controller and you run out of ports just remove the grey.
5,Works as advertised and beats the price of gamestop.
5,Works seamlessly with PC gaming. Love the plug and play aspect. Had to restart program if you plug it in after starting the program but that was a small issue.
5,If you are having issues connecting controllers on switch be sure to completely power off your switch and turn it back on. I had to do this twice and then the controllers connected. Also you have to enter find controllers and then back out. Once you've done this you can press L + R and they will connect.
5,Gift for grandson. He loves it
5,Satisfies my gamecube controller compatibility needs for my switch lite.
5,Works like a charm and is cost efficient!
4,Easy to use works with the most recent dolphin emulator update 5.0-12263 previous versions glitch out with the wii u connection.
5,Very easy to use. Used it on my switch and it worked great.
5,Does the job!  I’m able to play Super Smash Bros. Bomberman Overcooked 1 and 2 Tetris and Super Mario Bros. U on the Switch with a GameCube controller with the adapter.It just looks and feels very cheap.
5,Works great did what’s it was intended to do. Would buy again if needed to.
5,It works great! It took a bit to set up all the settings and to get my computer to register the adapter but once everything was set up it works perfectly! I can now play melee on my laptop. I would recommend this.
5,excellent
5,My son loves this. Thank you
5,This adapter works very well. I tested it out on both my PC and my Switch and it worked flawlessly. While I don’t know how to use the turbo button I still love everything else about this adapter. It’s very easy to use and is definitely a good buy
5,Works extremely well with a raspberry pi 4 for Nintendo 64 emulation. No driver installation needed. Was running Raspbian OS.
5,Its awesome
1,Don't buy only works on switch on PC it's useless
5,It works great dor the switch but for the pc it does work with dolphon emulator and some pc games it just depends if it is compatible with it.
5,Love this for the switch. Easier to use on my Nintendo switch then the switch controllers.
5,Works incredibly for playing smash bros!
5,Great product works seamlessly with Nintendo switch and GameCube controllers.
5,Great product. Makes our life easier.
1,It wouldn’t work with pc as described. I contacted customer service and they wouldn’t help me just refund. If you want one that works get the Mayflash. I would leave 5 stars for ease of return tho
5,Easy to use works great on pc and Nintendo switch. I use this for emulators on pc with a gamecube controller. Definitely recommend of that's what you're looking for.
5,Great value works as intended! I have been playing SSBU on my Switch Lite and have been having a good time.
5,This product has very long wires so you don’t have to worry about having to sit too close to the tv
5,I love it and use almost everyday
5,Works great and my kids love it!
5,Worked perfect to be able to hook up all my stuff to my gaming laptop
5,EASY TO USE
5,Came and work just like I expected. Very easy to set up and gamecube controllers can be used for almost any games despite lack of button mapping options.
5,No issues at all it’s great
5,Easy to use. Plug it in correctly and you’re good to go.
5,Works great! I have no issues with it
5,I have had no issues and would highly recommend! Great far that quick smashing.
5,Worked perfect for my sons set up.
5,Good for your money it’s simple and not that complicated. No delay in input whatsoever
4,It came in a timely manner it works very well and is easy to use. It’s just what I needed!
5,Used for Nintendo Switch. It was easy to set up and easy to use.
5,Works great built well 5 stars
5,Works great
5,I haven't tried it on Nintendo Switch yet but it works perfectly on PC (Dolphin Emulator).
5,Easy to use. Helped me play on my switch.
5,I bought mine in 2018 like many people it was to play smash. I got this one in particular because it was the cheapest.There's no input lag there's never been any issues hooking it up to my pc (though it does take a driver tool to get working) and there's certainly no sign that it's slowing down. I've used every port and the worst wear I've seen is them starting to get a little wobbly. The plastic shell is holding up fine despite being stepped on and kicked. The switches on the back don't seem to do anything though... Well I've never tried to use it with a Wii U so it doesn't have any baring on my review.Anyway if it's still the same product I have- it's the best value adapter you could ever find.
5,Works
5,i would never buy a name brand version of this now that i can just buy one of these.
5,Ordered this for my brother. Delivered fast. He absolutely loves it and uses it daily
5,Was super excited to play Smash Melee and Smash Ultimate and it works perfectly with the GameCube Controller. I've had it for a while and there hasn't been a single problem
5,Great product hooked it up to my switch right away and I was gaming uninterrupted.
5,It works. I just simply plugged it into my tv and Nintendo switch and can use GameCube controllers now
5,Not bad at all I assumed there were gonna be problems with it but no problems at all. Works fine with the gamecube controller too. It amazing. I would recommend for any of you who would like one.
5,It works great plug it in and find directions online on how to get the switch to recognize controllers it's weird. But the device it self is great I don't notice input delay playing ssbu.
5,I tried it once. Easy to use. Not much lag. Thanks Amazon for the recommendation.
5,Very budget friendly plug and play hub for my current set up. No configuration needed aside from button mapping on your controllers but all ports are already configured 1 throug 4 making device recognition on pc very easy. Doesn't matter which controller goes into which port as long as the buttons are mapped correctly they all work the same.
5,Had old game cube controllers from when I had a GameCube. Bought this so I could use them on the Nintendo switch and it works perfectly. I've had these controllers for over 10 years and now I'm using them again. Heck yes!
5,Allows you to use game cube controllers on switch.  Plugged in and works.
5,It works well with dolphin emulator.
5,Works perfectly on switch and PC!
5,My only real qualm with this item is that it requires 2 USB ports to use. Other than that this product works like a charm.
5,
5,It’s easy to use it’s a really great adapter for Nintendo switch
5,The Adapter came as described and not broken despite the packaging being slightly crushed during transit. Once I plugged the adapter into the pc updated the drivers and tested the 4 ports everything worked smoothly. Would buy again for a second computer!
5,Easy set up not manuals needed and it gets the job done. No connection issues. Cheap and reliable. Definitely worth it for being under 20 dollars
5,me gusta mi articulo y bien facil de usar
5,Great alternative to the original product. It works perfectly fine and was very easy to use (plug and play). Overall quality product!
5,Best value for the price
5,Got it for smash.
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO USE FOR PC EMULATORS. IT DOES NOT WORK FOR PC.
5,Cord length is good easy to use and connect to my switch worth the money
5,Works excellently with my switch andy 21.5 inch iMac use one wire or both it doesn't matter this brought my friends and I closer as we played Mario party Mario kart and super Mario 3d world might need to play with one person that has a supported controller as all the buttons aren't their such as screenshot home "R" ofc it'd be a disadvantage if you were playing Mario or something but other then that one of the best buys I've had
5,It was shipped and delivered in a timely manner and with no issues there’s no lag the ports for the GameCube are not tight or snug in any way. It’s definitely a good GameCube adapter and the best I’ve had so far.
5,it good
5,his shoes WACK. his hair WACK. the way that he doesn't even like to smile WACK. me?
5,If you wanna have fun with friends with old schools controllers this is perfect
5,Works amazing!
5,Arrived yesterday and works well on my switch. came in a nice little box and was easy to set up.
5,Good working product
5,Works great thank you!
4,Quality product but Wavebird controller didn't work for switch does all the other stuff didn't test for PC.
5,i purchased this so we can play mario party 7 on a trip with friends im going to take soon and didnt think about if dolphin would be able to register this being connected to my laptop and it did!
5,Quick plug in!Fast and easy!!
5,Great product! Works on all the controllers we’ve connected. No issues and super easy to use!
5,This is a great quality product. The cord on this is longer than the original nintendo adapter which works perfect for me. Really easy to set up. The seller was very helpful throughout. Thanks.
5,Works great and easy to use!
5,It does what it says! Fast inputs and low latency for Smash on the Switch.
5,My son says it works great !
3,it all works except the #1 slot
5,I’ve been trying to find an affordable one since the official nintendo one is like 3x the price of this one. I gotta say i’m super happy I tried it with my old gamecube controller from my childhood and it works great with my wii u and switch! I just need a new controller since its worn out not the products fault whatsoever!
5,It was just what I needed easy to use thanks will tell all my friends about your site
5,Works perfectly!!!
5,This was very straightforward to set up it was literally plug and play. I bought this just for Smash Ultimate and it works perfectly.
1,Straight out of the box and my pc cannot detect this USB Adapter. I tried installing additional drivers and just about everything to make it work. The Wii U and Switch both also cannot detect and use this USB adapter. Luckily I was able to return it and get my money back from the seller so that’s huge. To anyone looking to purchase a GameCube USB adapter just do yourself a favor and get Nintendo’s official USB adapter.
5,It was only 10 dollars when I bought it. and its works great. For its price its good.
5,Overall great product.
5,This adapter works just as it should and does what it's supposed to do....  Brings new life to our old gamecube controllers that we love so much....
5,Liked it
5,Pretty happy with the durability as well as the quality. I’ve had it for about a year with no issues. The cable is long and it goes across the living room.
5,Works and functions as intended. :)
5,Easy to connect  and works great.
5,My step daughters bf lives these as a Christmas gift
5,Works well! The controller response is great!
5,It works just fine and the Nintendo Switch will recognize your GameCube controller. I'm also glad how this item is cheaper than the official one.
5,Value for the money
5,If works fine
5,Product was easy to use! You’ve got to love the classic feel of a GameCube controller more than any others. This product allowed for easy usage of a great controller on a great console. Good for multiplayer usage and had low latency!
5,El adaptador es 100% funcional. Es compatible con el WII U Switch y con el emulador Dolphin para PC es facil de usar. En la parte posterior hay un interruptor para cambiar la compatibilidad entre wiiu/switch a PC.
1,No lo recomiendo no me funcionó pero como mi esposa tiro la caja y el manual ya no pedí el cambio.Me tocó mala suerte en la ruleta de los productos de bajo precio.
5,Está excelente lo puedo colocar sin que ocupe espacio hasta ahorita funciona muy bien su material se ve bien por un precio aceptable económico.
1,Tiene falla de fabrica no lee mi control a pesar de que tanto el control de gamecube y el puerto de switch funcionan perfectamente
5,Excelente producto funciona de maravilla puedo invitar a jugar a mis amigos y disfrutas de los juegos de switch con el control de GameCube
5,I can finally kick my friends bum now that I can use a GameCube controller
5,El producto es ligero y pequeño pero funciona a la perfección totalmente recomendado.
5,Llegó  bien funciona sin problema y simple de usar.
5,Works exactly how I want it to.
5,recomiendo ampliamente nos es muy útil para jugar con nuestra consola
4,Esta algo complicado de usar en lo personal no necesité de un software para poder usarlo de hecho algunos emuladores no los detecta pero con el Dolphin por el cual quería usar si me lo detecto y no tuve problemas. Recomiendo ver un tutorial de youtube para saber como usarlo y ver que emuladores son compatibles con este adaptador.
1,No es el mismo a que se muestra en las imagenesme llego otro de menor calidad pero el que espesificaba en las fotosel que me llego lo vi mas varato en otra publicacionespero puedan arreglar eso a futuro y no estar engañando a la gente con eso
3,Llegó en tiempo y el precio está accesible  sin embargo una de las entradas no funciona.
5,Buena calidad en el control además de un buen precio. Una muy buena opción y económica
5,Es práctico
2,El producto llego rapido y en su caja pero al querer darle uso al adaptador me genera un comando fantasma como si estuviera moviendo la palanca hacia abajo cuando intente usarlo en PC fue peor ya que no hay sensor de sensibilidad y los personajes se agachan completamente. Buscare mejores opciones ni modo.
5,Fue compatible con mi compu y es muy util buena calidad y buen precio
5,El plástico parece ser barato sin embargo funciona de maravilla con mis controles de Gamecube en el switch y también es compatible con PC.Excelente compra y a buen precio.
1,Solo funcionan dos puertos no lo recomiendo para nada
4,No funciona con raspberry
2,Muy bien todo pero a la semana empezó a presentar fallas
2,Llegó roto y se nota que la calidad no es la mejor
3,Me gusta el precio pero lo barato sale caro con el tiempo
5,Cumple con su función para jugar con mandos de Game cube
5,Cumple totalmente su función 10 de 10
5,Perfecto para usar los controles antiguos del game cube funciona muy bien en el nintendo switch
5,Por el precio esta muy bien cero batallas hasta ahora!Lo recomiendo!✨
3,Funciona bien e instalarlo es facilisimo. Si se experimenta un mínimo de lag casi imperceptible y lo que no me gustó nada es que no funciona con controles inalámbricos aún conectando su receptor
4,Me pareció un muy buen producto lo uso en PC y no me da ninguna clase de problema solo no le doy 5 estrellas por que en Wii U no me funciono bien.
5,Ta bueno
3,Ya lo tengo con el mas de un año y ya empieza a fallar se desconecta por si solo. Y ya no quiere conectarse.
5,SALE BUENO
2,Esta chido pero se descompuso al poco tiempo de uso y eso que compre 2 y los 2 salieron feos uno me duro un día y el otro a las 3 semanas de descompuso.Mejoren su calidad.Pds: chiflan a su mauser.Pds: pan >:(
1,Mandan un adaptador que no solo es diferente al de la foto sino que además la marca es de una comercializadora China que produce estos productos en masa y los venden como si fueran de Cloudream
5,Funciona excelente tanto en PC cómo en SwitchFue una muy buena compra por mi parte le pude dar nuevamente uso a mis viejos controles de Gamecube.Súper satisfecho con mi compra
5,Solo lo conecte a Nintendo switch y reconoció mis controles de inmediato.
3,No nos engañemos.Funciona si. Hace lo que promete si. Sin embargo es evidente que el precio debe decirnos algo y ese algo es que existe un lag que se vuelve infinitamente grande sobre todo cuando eres jugador de alto desempeño. Yo no lo hubiera comprado si me hubieran dicho que el lag estaba tan cañón. Se los paso al costo
