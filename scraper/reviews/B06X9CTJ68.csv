5,I didn‚Äôt need so many‚Ä¶ Their business model seems to be to just sell you a whole bunch so they can get your money. I would have prefers to pay half as much for 10pct as many‚Ä¶ After all I needed one.
4,They were under $5 and I get 10 of them. The keys themselves were cheaply made with more than half of them being rusty. But they still get the job done and considering how cheap they were I can't complain much about that. You get what you pay for. I would've given it a 3 star but given the price I'm giving this a 4 star
5,These little things are so nice to have. Especially if you're me and have 9 different phones then constantly change your mind about which one you want to use. Well no matter which one I pick up I always have one of these sim tools to help me switch over to it. I ordered three packs of these that means I got 30 of them laying around.They're stirdy you just poke them into the sim tray on your phone and it pops out. Handy to have.Just two things:1. They're easy to lose2. They have slightly sharp edges. Be careful out  there guys ok? Now I wouldn't want you slicing open your finger trying to get your sim out. You hear me?
5,Fits my iPhone and works
5,They give enough to last in case in is lost.  Outstanding
5,Product met my needs and I give two to a friend.
4,Those pins are the perfect replacement for someone like me who keep loosing them all the time. So now I have a big bag full of them and I know where to find it at least üòÅOn the negative side they are a little bit weaker than the original pins that comes with your phone/tablet. But they do the job just fine as long as you don't go crazy with those.
5,I like that it‚Äôs stainless steel that‚Äôs all to it even at times if lose one there is another to replace it.
3,Needed this to open the SIM card for my iPhone.  Wasn't sturdy enough bent when trying to open.
5,Spot on. Perfect
