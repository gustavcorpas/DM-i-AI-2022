5,SEE EDIT AT BOTTOM:We love this BUT only after you figure it out the finer details.  My wife wants to scan all of our old photos pre-digital so I got her this to help with that mission (we have MANY photos).  I have 3 scanners or all in ones in my house and I will say the Doxie Plus is the ONLY way to go for mass scanning images that are 8x10 or smaller.  That is all you need to know on the positive and now I will address the issues I had.  I am a techi so I assume this can be used without any reading but that is not he case.I did glance over documentation and see that it has built in memory but you can add more via the SD slot.  So I grabbed a spare 64gb card and stuck it in there.  It would not power on and stop blinking like it was supposed to.  After digging I find out that it ONLY supports special SD cards (really!!!!)  That is absolutely ridiculous but there is actually plenty of built in memory.So I removed the SD card and it powers up fine.  In the process of trying to figure out the bootup problem (having standard SD card in slot) I tried to locate a "Calibration PDF" on their website.  This is the sheet you run through the scanner to calibrate it.  Can you believe they make you buy that if you lose it! Another blunder in my opinion.  My wife had the calibration page but I am letting you know so if you buy a used one you better make sure the calibration card is in there or your will have to buy another one if the calibration is ever needed again (not sure why you would but just letting you know).Once the scanner is turned on the light is green (300 dpi scan).  If you press the button again it goes to Orange which is 600dpi.  They should have a simple sticker above the power button telling you this but they don't and they should allow you to set a default setting which they don't.We are doing photos so we did the scans at 600 dpi which still went plenty fast enough.  300dpi is REALLY fast (ie for documents).After you scan all of your photos you have to open the software to import the scanned photos.  BUT when you click on the "Import" button in top right corner it has not completed the import process.  After you select all the images on the screen you have to click on the SAVE button down below actually save them to your local drive.  Why they do not allow you to just click the import and have the save process as part of that I do not know.  It is just one extra step you have to do to save the photos.But even with these problem I still give this thing 5 stars.  My wife is having to use our Epson 7510 for the larger pictures and ones already in the scrap book.  The speed and ease of using the Doxie Plus is outstanding.  I am sure this product is like everything.  The folks who design it and package it and write the manuals etc never actually use it so they have no idea on the simple and stupid mistakes they make.Bottom line buy one you will be glad you did :)-----------------------------------------------EDIT 05-19-20151) The Doxie does allow the use of SD cards up to 32GB.  And it should be formatted in FAT32.  They are considering putting a sticker or some other means of letting customers know that 32GB is the max.  In my opinion it might be easier and more effective to update the firmware to allow for much larger SD cards since these are the norm not the exception in 2015.2) After doing some extensive scanning of not only photos but documents (ie medical records) it is evident that the saving process designed by Doxie is most ideal.  We scanned many photos and documents and the documents we saved as PDF's where the photos were saved as JPG's.  Also the photos were separated by child and year.  So I found my original thought on this to be a little misguided.3) Doxie has stated that the calibration card has to be the original printed card.  It is a heavier card stock and printing on a 8x11 sheet of paper would not work.  You can contact them about getting a Calibration card if yours is missing.I take pride in offering detailed and accurate reviews so I wanted to clarify these issues.  But nothing changes on the fact that this device is an awesome little scanner and I am sure you will be happy with it.
5,March 8 2017I always thought that Amazon customer service is the best in the world. Well there is a new kid on the block that even Amazons CS can learn something from  - Apparent!I left a 3 star review (can read below). I did not think it was a bad review. But Dan from Apparent thought that anything less than 5 stars is fail. He contacted me and suggested that maybe I had a lemon and suggested he ships me another one.  Well I live in Israel and most vendors on Amazon refuse to ship one item and here is a guy who will ship me also a replacement? But that was not all! A week before I managed to drop the scanner on its head and while it continues working the power socket broke and the electrician who fixed it could not find a proper replacement so he hard wired a cable in place. Never mind said Dan and nevertheless shipped a new scanner (and no need to ship back the broken one back). But even that is not all! One of the items I was complaining about is that the scanner will not take very old photographs that are printed on a very thick cardboard. So Dan from Apparent suggested that maybe the scanner that is more right for me is the Doxie flip. And shipped both.  I must be dreaming…So this is a revised review for the Doxie Go Plus and later on there will be a review of Doxie Flip.The battery – I complained that after 100 scans the battery was out of power. To tell the truth I did fully charge the battery but that was a few weeks before and while I thought that some power will leak out I believed that it is mostly charged. The new scanner I received scanned 360 pages and the battery was still going strong (but I was out of power….)The charger –  I complained of a need to haul a charger as it is the old kind of charger like old cell phone. However there is no need to haul it around. The USB 2 cable that is supplied with the scanner can charge the scanner just as well. It takes longer (about 4 hours) but the most important thing is no need to haul around multiple of chargers (if one has more than 360 scans to do) but only one with the ability to switch cables.The feeder – I complained that it will not feed a page that is not strait as an arrow and will try to twist it around. But even for that there is a solution: adjust the rails to the size of the page and the twisting around of the page is minimized. But there is even a better solution: Apparent shipped me a sleeve for large pages and VOILA – twisting disappeared completely!I complained that the scanner was finishing the job before the end of the page – I guess the old scanner was really a sick puppy. The new one did not have these problems at allVery old photographs on thick card board – well they still won't go thru but sometimes the supplied sleeve will help even with those.All in all an excellent scanner and an outstanding customer serviceJanuary 11 2017I really wanted to like this product but I cannot. The nice features first: it is compact and very nice looking. The scanned images can be stored in the scanner memory or on USB thumb drive or SD card. The box (that you buy separately) fits very snug and together it looks like a product that a lot of thought went into it HOWEVER1) The battery is good and you can scan a good number of scans but after about 100 scans the battery needed recharging and sure as hell the charger was left at home (why I did not have the charger with me? because the snug nice box does not have a room for it)2) The charger is the kind that has an EHX socket (like the old phones laptops and earphones do) So it is another charger that one has to haul around. Why in the world when manufacturers are moving to micro-USB (so all you need is one charger and one cable for different appliances) did they put this EHX socket.3) The feeder will not feed a page that is not strait as an arrow. If the page you are trying to scan has a little rip or was earmarked the scanner will twist it around and the scan will come unusable4) Many times the scanner decided to end the scan before the end of the page (some pages have few lines on the top and few on the bottom the scanner will scan the top and then decide the page ended and will stop the scan before it reached the bottom so I had to input the page twice: ones from the top and once from the bottom)5) If you are not hauling a computer (or device that can check the scans: tablet or phone with OTG cable) you arrive home to find that at least 20 percent of the scans are not good - would have been really nice to include a little screen on which one could see if the scan was good.6) Some old pictures (very old pictures were printed on thick paper) will not go thru properly and the scanner will twist them
5,I would highly recommend!!!I let the device sit for a year and half before finally getting around to use it. It wasn't getting any power. I contacted doxie and they quickly sent me a new battery. The battery didn't work so they quickly sent me a new device. The new device works amazingly. I've scanned a couple thousand photos so far and ha e been very impressed with how quickly I can just feed them through. Customer service were great and easy to deal with. I honestly thought they wouldn't help me since it had been so long since I bought it. They also sent labels to send the defective product back.
5,Doxie Go SE scanner makes scanning fun!  It is truly portable and does not need to be connected to a laptop to operate.  The SD card which came with the scanner stores all the data and can be read later either on a phone or a computer as long as you have a card reader.  It's fast and so easy to use.  It beats the big HP printer/scanner that I used to use.  Just love it.  It makes scanning old family photographs plus receipts/documents quick and easy.  Great value as well.
5,The Doxie line of scanners and other products are top shelf in my opinion. I absolutely love my Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi scanner & the sheets for your recite is great also. And I  recently received there scanner case and it protects it just like you would think it should. The only bad thing on the case is that it is a little bulky but thats expected to help protect the product.  The customer service is truly the best ive ever seen. They actually go out of there way to check on you and to see if there's anything that theybcan help you with. And no other company has EVER check on me like they have. I will be buying all my scanner products from them from here in for sure. And when I decide to buy a new or better one they will be my 1st and only choice so long as they have an upgrade available for me.
5,When I bought this in 2018 I never realized how useful it would be. I keep it near my desktop and use it for receipts invoices old or new photos e-file copies of letters I'm mailing or receiving e-copies of important documents family tree info and countless other items. Simple to use great software and works like a charm. Continuously saves a mega amounts of time instead of using a copier or a printer and having to deal with hard copies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5,Very surprised and pleased with this product! It was not easy to set up and we had issues with the charger but it scanned old family photos efficiently and with very good resolution for what we needed. Love how portable it is— I flew with it neatly tucked in my backpack across the county and it took up less space than my travel umbrella. Easy wifi interface etc once you figure it out.
5,After my GiiNii scanner quit I was looking for a replacement. Wasn't real sure about the Doxie scanner but it was small portable and it came with an SD card. Decided to convert all my photo albums to digital. Have now done over 1000. I was hesitant over the old Polaroids as they were not in good shape (loose ends). Went better than expected. Did the photos a year at a time. Only complaint is that some photos come out with a yellow space on the side. Easily fixed by cropping before transferring the photos to a separate thumb drive.
5,I was expecting a little challenge like confusing instructions poor user interface or crappy scans. Had none of that! Instructions were clear and easy to follow. I was able to scan perfectly from the first try! And the user interface was straight forward and intuitive. No guesswork needed. And I was surprised I received an email from the manufacturer OFFERING to help if I had any questions -- not the other way around where I have to scour the fine print looking for someone anyone to call for support. Even if the product wasn't great that made a huge difference to me and gave me confidence in what I purchased!
5,Instructions were clear and set up was easy.  The size of the scanner makes it easy to take with me for use with or without my computer. It was really nice that a 16 GB SD Card was included. It works great and I really like the Doxie app that allows me to sort the different scans so I can save them to my computer in the appropriate files.
5,I compared tons of scanners and decided to give this one a try.  I hit the jackpot!!The Doxie Go SE is quick portable and I’ve had great resolution on my pics!My mom passed last year and we wanted to share all of the family pics with me and my 4 siblings.  I looked into paying to have them digitized or buying a scanner.I didn’t think I’d have the time for a flatbed scanner so I wanted one I could feed.So many had lots of bad reviews and I saw so many issues.  This one has the best reviews so I gave it a try.I’ve scanned hundreds of pics in a hour and no issues.  I do have to crop pics every once in a while but the software is so easy that it’s quick and doesn’t decrease the resolution of the original image.I would 1000% recommend this product!Customer service has been top notch!  They really care and want you to get the most out of your experience!Thank you Doxie for helping me save memories for the next generation!  <3
5,I was initially skeptical about buying a portable scanner for $178 but I've been trying to clean up the clutter in my life and paper is one of them. I also scan all my receipts from every purchase I make and keep track of my spending in a tracker so that I have a clearer understanding of where my money is going each month. I was originally scanning everything with my HP printer but it was getting to be a real chore. I'd have to sit at my desk and put each paper through the scanner (which was LOUD and slow) then crop it name it and save it. It was mind-numbingly boring. I decided to take a chance and purchase the Doxie Go SE and I'm so happy I did!Now I can sit comfortably at my couch with Hulu or Netflix on and scan away. The scans go through the Doxie quickly and quietly and get sent to an SD card (like the ones we used to put inside digital cameras before smartphones took over) which is included in the package. Perhaps my favorite thing about the Doxie is that it auto-detects the size of what is being scanned. I'm able to go from scanning 8.5x11 papers to the small receipts from gas pumps to a standard sized receipt from Wegmans without having to crop ANY of it. It's one of those things you don't appreciate till you don't have to do it anymore!Then when I am done scanning I pop the SD card out put it in my laptop and the Doxie software imports the scans. Another one of my favorite things about the Doxie software is that after each image is imported to your computer it is automatically deleted from the SD card! So I don't have to worry about clearing the SD card myself or having the same files imported the next time I use the scanner.The Doxie software is pretty easy to use although I'm pretty good with computers so I'm not able to speak to its ease of use for those who aren't as comfortable with PCs. I use the software to name all the files crop them if I need to rotate them if necessary and "staple" pages together. I have noticed that when stapling a lot of pages together (such as the product manual for my expensive electronic toothbrush) the software can freeze sometimes but it always unfreezes eventually. It's a very small hiccup in an otherwise incredible product.You can then choose to save files to your computer as a JPEG or PDF or upload to a cloud storage service. I've been saving to my PC since I upload my receipts to my tracking software so I can't comment on the process of uploading to the cloud. Another great feature about the Doxie software is that when you save a scan to your computer a green checkmark shows up on the scan so you know it has been saved and that you can delete it from the Doxie software. (Doing so just deletes it from Doxie not from your computer.) This is nice so you avoid wasting time on trying to save scans that you've already saved to your PC but forgot about (helpful when I was scanning an entire month's receipts the other night). If you haven't already saved the scan there's no checkmark and Doxie will warn you that it isn't scanned before you delete it.Charging time was quick. Doxie comes with a USB cable but no outlet adapter to plug it in to. You can charge it by plugging it into a USB port on your computer or if you have owned a smartphone at any time odds are you have a few outlet adapters lying around anyway. You can plug the USB cable into one of those and charge Doxie through a standard outlet.I would have liked to see the Doxie available in a few colors other than white. Most of my office accessories are black and it would have been nice to have some fun color options like blue purple etc.I can't believe the longest and most passionate review I've ever written on Amazon is about a portable scanner. That should speak to A) how much I am type A and like organization and B) how easy to use and high quality this scanner is. I'm so happy I bought this scanner and believe I will be using it for years to come. And when this one dies or becomes totally outdated I'll keep buying Doxie scanners as long as the company is making them!
4,I already own a Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i which has served me well for many years. However the device has fallen out of use due to its requirement to be connected to a computer in order to scan documents. The Doxie Go SE offers computer-less document scanning and wIth its thin form factor makes it easy to transport. (To be fair the Fujitsu ScanSnap is also very portable but again requires a computer.) Images are stored onboard via a memory card which thankfully is included with your purchase.One of my other requirements is an ability to use the scanner with my ChromeOS device. As already reported in other reviews my device can connect to the scanner wirelessly via Wifi.  (I have not tested it  yet but a wired connection might also be possible but my device's interface is USB-C while the scanner uses a USB-A connection.) Images transferred over this connection from the scanner to the ChromeOS device supports only JPEG format although with some extra steps the images could be further converted to another format (e.g. PDF) using the device's native capabilities or with a third-party application.To gain the full productivity benefit of the Doxie Go SE however requires either a Windows or MacOS computer. You can of course continue to connect via Wifi (e.g. the scanner is not located conveniently near the computer) but wired connections over USB offer much faster file transfer. I own a Mac Mini and the software for importing scanned images is exceptional. When you plug in the scanner into your computer the Mac software for it automatically detects the device and begins the import process listing all of the files stored in a Finder window. This is where the software shines: You were probably scanning several unrelated documents in one session. When the scanned images are presented to you you organize them by multi-selecting the related pages of the same document and then use the "staple" feature to merge them all into one document. You then save the merged document to a format of your choosing e.g. PDF PNG or JPEG. Converted/saved documents are graphically "checked off" so you have a visual indication of individual images you have organized avoiding accidental mis-organization. For reference the Fujitsu ScanSnap software is also very good but upon first use I find the Doxie software more streamlined. Once you have organized all of your scans you are given the opportunity to delete them from the scanner's memory card.Prospective buyers should be aware of the availability of two models: One with Wifi and the other without.  Both have a built-in rechargeable battery in case you do not have an available USB-A port to plug into. I found the wireless connectivity to be rather slow and sometimes will disconnect unexpectedly. But I still like the option in case I need to transfer files while on the road and if I am without a USB cable. Additionally it took a visit the Doxie web site and a few attempts before I could figure out how to wirelessly gain access to the scan images. A couple of tips to perhaps save some of you the frustration:1. The scanner's IP address is 10.10.100.1 in case a web browser window fails to automatically open upon connection.2. If you set a password on the scanner the username is "doxie" when you get prompted to login upon connecting.What follows are indivIdual feature ratings from the perspective of first-use impressions. Eventually I will come back with a long-term review and adjust these comments as needed.
5,It did come with an SD card in the box but please keep in mind that it has an upper limit of accepting 32GB and under. Definitely not an issue since each scan takes up 2 - 3MB per high DPI scan.
5,This is a great scanner. I bought this because I started a personal digital filing system and wanted a scanner to be easily accessible so I could take care of the paper right away without having to fire up my PC. This allows me to scan things as they come in and then upload to either my iPad or windows PC at a later time. It works great and the scans look good. Multiple pages can be stapled together in the Doxie app then saved wherever you want.  I have not tried scanning old photos yet but plan to.This company is very invested in their users. I was contacted by email after the purchase asking if I needed any help with setup or use and to make sure I knew where on their website I could find information. I was also thanked with a personal email after completing a survey. Doxie Go has displayed the best customer service I have seen in a long time. Thank you!
5,The scanner works well! Light and portable! I like the Wi-Fi connection which is a plus. Would recommend!
4,I am a mobile notary. I meet with buyers and /or sellers and notarize  documents pertaining to real estate  transactions. Often I am required to email documents from the closing table. I have purchased 5 mobile scanners in the past 2 weeks trying to find a scanner that will work the way I need it to.  I use an Android smartphone and tablet. I tried one of those wands that just flat didn't work although the concept of scanning to an sd card which I can then put in my phone or tablet and convert to pdf and email out quickly was what made me want to try it. Too bad it wouldn't scan at all. Then I tried 2 other usb scanners that both worked OK but neither could be powered by my Android tablet  and I really didn't want to have to lug my laptop around when my smartphone or tablet can do everything my laptop can do EXCEPT power a usb scanner. I ordered the battery powered Xerox Mobile Scanner and found out after I got it that it could not scan a legal size document although their web site states that it does. The customer service lady I spoke to at Xerox apologized for the mistake on their web site but to date the same misinformation is there. Too bad it was almost exactly what I needed since it was powered by batteries. I returned that one. I had read about the Doxie Go and was intriqued but old information stated that the largest paper size it could scan was 8.5 x 11 and I need to scan legal size 8.5 x 14. So I paid little attention to Doxie. Until I stumbled on an article that said Doxie was upgraded and not only can it scan legal size but it also works on Android devices! Whoo Hoo! Well I ordered it. I got it today.My impression  after testing it out is that it is an outstanding  scanner and exactly what I was looking for. I paired the Eye-Fi with both my phone and my tablet. I can switch back and forth between devices depending on which one I want to use. By the time I finish scanning in the documents they have already populated to which ever device I have it set to send to in direct mode. I may have to wait 10 to 15 seconds for the final document to show up. I then use a third party application to convert the jpeg files to pdf  staple them and email them out.I thought I was going to scan to an sd card and transfer the files that way because I thought it would be faster but I haven't even tried that yet because the Eye-Fi transfer works so well and so quickly. It took a lot less time to transfer via Eye-Fi than it did to connect via usb to my computer and import the files.  That actually took a very long time.I am so thankful that my quest for the perfect scanner is finally ended. Doxie Go delivers great quality scans quickly and efficiently. It didn't take me long to set it up because I did a lot of studying the guide and reviews before it got here. I just followed the instructions and it went smoothly.I can see why there are so many positive reviews for this little scanner. It's awsome and it's cute too!Edit: I called Xerox to ask why they still have incorrect info on their web site THIS time I was told the scanner CAN scan legal size. Who knows what the real story is. Aside from that unknown I understand you can't scan with it plugged in to either usb or A/C unlike the Doxie which allows you to scan from the optional A/C adapter which I have ordered along with the case.Edit 2:I decided to give the Zerox Mobile Scanner another try since it is more suited for my business due to the fact that it can send PDF files directly to my Android Smartphone or Tablet. It does scan legal size as well. I was correct in the assumption that it would be better suited for my business needs. The PDF document files look amazing because they are scanned as documents rather than as photos. Doxie scanns everything as photos and those converted PDF files come through looking like a photo of the document you scanned. That is not necessarily a bad thing but the documents scanned with the ZMS look much more professional. I will not be returning my Doxie Go however because the photo scan quality is better than the ZMS. So for my business I will use the ZMS for my personal use I will use Doxie Go.One other plus for the XMS is that it can scann a multipage document PDF and the Eye-Fi transfer is almost immediate. Doxie Go had to send each page as a photo which I would have to use a third party app to convert to a single PDF file. The last file transmitted by Doxie seemed to hang up and take a very long time to show up on my device.If you have to choose between the two choose depending on what you need it for. Doxie Go is great for mainly photos and reciepts and misc household use. The ZMS is the best choice for business use IMHO.
5,I purchased this for my mom and she loves it. It was easy for her to learn to use and get started.  When she reached out to tech support they quickly responded and answered her question.Also after speaking with customer service they sent her a carry case & per my mother “this is sturdy and good to have when not using the machine.”Five stars
5,I can’t say enough about the Doxie employees and their business practices… this is 100% THE BEST company to purchase an item from. EVERYONE at Doxie ACTUALLY CARES about their customers opinions experiences and satisfaction with their products. They genuinely WANT you to have a great experience with their product they genuinely WANT to hear from you if there’s something they could improve upon how you find the product you purchased how you use it and they are great at helping you untangle yourself if you run into snags setting up the software or connecting to your home network… and their warranty department is bar none… I ended up with a defective battery which they replaced at zero cost to me right away received it in less than a week and boy are they thorough on their documentation! What a blessing! Do you remember the old Nordstroms and Les Schwab business models? Doxie has them beat by a nose but I’ll leave it to you to discover why… I’m so glad I took a chance on a company I didn’t know at all FOR ONCE! I feel LUCKY to have bought my DoxieGoSE! Highly impressed with this company… and yes… the scanner works great is incredibly simple to use and the software interface is also very simple user friendly and efficient… and it IS portable has a memory card so you don’t have to also tote your Mac around (or PC if that’s what you use..) charges pretty quick and the battery lasts quite awhile when not in use too… and just so you know… no… lol I’m not a paid reviewer (does that really exist?!) just one seriously happy customer. This is ONE place where I really feel I got more than I bargained for… in the best ways! Money VERY well spent! ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!
5,My mom passed away and left thousands of old photos in her basement. I wanted to share them with family spread out over several states. This scanner made it a breeze! I actually had fun! The userface is cute and so easy to use. I took a break after a few hundred photos but I'm looking forward to going another round soon. Thanks Doxie!
4,Tech support did reach out several times and understood the battery was bad.  They replaced the battery at no charge.  The scanner is working well now.It is easy to set up and scanning is quick.  The images are clean.  The only part I don't like is the process of having to import from a card.  The images are small which makes them harder to read. There is a way to enlarge them to read more easily.  If you scan only a couple items at a time this will be no big deal.  I tend to accumulate many documents before scanning and saving so for me this will be a time consumer.  I would prefer to scan directly to my computer.I had big hopes for this scanner.  I've had it 3 days and can't use it.  The battery won't charge and Tech Support is only available M - F 11 AM to 8 PM.  I'm returning it.  I really can't speak for the user interface as it is unusable at the present time.
5,I've never really needed or so I thought a personal scanner before.  I have long and short term memory loss so I've ended up with stacks and stacks of handwritten notes to help me remember things.  I also have pages and pages of handwritten diagrams/notes/tablature etc. from my weekly guitar lessons.I recently acquired a Google Nexus 7 and at the same time decided to give Evernote a try.  I love both products and knew there had to be a better way to use both these tools to become more organized.  The amount of clutter in the way of notes on my desk is overwhelming and I really wanted a way to reduce that clutter yet still be able to find the information when needed.Enter the Doxie Go!  I suspect the target market for this scanner is business users who travel quite a bit and need something portable as it's a a portable rechargeable scanner.  I don't fit that market segment but what it does is help me stay organized.  It really lets me get the most benefit from Evernote.  Most of what I've read on-line about getting the most out of Evernote is to use it frequently and don't hold back.  Dive into it and really use it.  Evernote requires a commitment one I was afraid to make for fear of making things more difficult rather than less.  With the Doxie Go utilizing Evernote to its fullest is much easier.  I can organize my stacks of paper into folders to help me find things and the OCR built into the easy to use software provided will only help.Now for more technical details.....  The scans it makes are very good in quality.  I was skeptical at first thinking I'd have to use the 600 DPI mode to get the quality I wanted.  Not so 300 DPI has been just fine so far and if I need higher quality I can have it.  When I don't I get to take advantage of the smaller file sizes of the scans.  I know this is my perception and I've not compared it to other scanners but frankly I don't feel the need to after working with the Doxie.  What's important to me is that I capture needed information can find it when I need to and can read it (especially in the case of my teachers scrawl :) .  Most of what I scan is devoid of much color so its not a thing that I pay much attention to.  I'm not commenting on the color quality at all good or bad as that is not of concern to me.  Others that have that experience/need can comment on that.Capturing the notes of my guitar teacher is of great concern and he writes lightly in pencil so I've not had much success getting a good scan from my multi-purpose printer/scanner/fax machine.  Doxie Go excels in this arena and the automatic choices it makes for level of contrast are very good. Of course you can change the suggested setting if you desire but I've found the software makes the best choice for me.  Of note is that using greyscale or color as opposed to black and white as the scan type results in much higher quality scans for notes done in pencil.The form factor is great as I've not much room on my desk and I also purchased the A/C adapter for it so that I could still scan even if the battery were dead.  It has enough power to simultaneously power the scanner and charge the battery.The ability to send my scans straight to Evernote is a huge bonus.  I've got the Eye-Fi SD card on order so I can't comment on what I'm sure is going to be an even better experience than what I've had so far which again is great.Customer support is fantastic I contacted them with a number of questions while the unit was being shipped to me.  They replied promptly and gave me the info I needed.  And I didn't feel like I was bothering them they were genuinely interested in helping me.  Apparent the maker of the Doxie Go is a company I don't mind giving my money to :)Bottom line:  Would I buy this again or shop for another unit?  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!  I'm a very satisfied customer...
5,Where do I start?!  I ordered Doxie after ordering a Brother scanner that bogged down my computer and was  not user friendly.  I returned the Brother scanner and started doing my homework.  That's when I found Doxie.  This is a high quality scanner that costs a fraction more - BUT IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!  From the moment I opened the box you can see the manufacturer tried to make this as simple as possible for the user.  Everything is well labeled in the box.  There are also additional quick start up instructions as well as a few maintenance accessories included with Doxie.  I was able to set it up in no time at all - TROUBLE FREE EXPERIENCE!  :)Upon opening the software for the first time I was prompted to register my Doxie.  I highly recommend you do this.  The Doxie team will reach out to you personally and welcome you as a customer.  If you have any questions you can email them and THEY WILL RESPOND personally .  A real person sends the email - its not a canned computer generated reply.  They will also reach out to ask your opinion of their product and they welcome any suggestions or feedback you may have.  So for these reasons technology support is definitely five stars.Doxie itself is easy to use and provides a quality scan.  You have your choice of a higher quality scan that takes a little longer to complete or a quick scan that only takes moments.  The quick scan is great for black and white documents while the high quality scan works great for photos and other color related scans.  Importing/editing scans is simple as is downloading to your computer.This is an exceptionally high quality and well made product offered to you by a top notch customer centric organization!
5,I first purchased my doxie over a year ago and I have to say it is a fantastic little scanner. I'm scanning thousands of old photos for a family project and the digital images are super crisp and clear! I'm writing this today however because it recently stopped charging. I contacted doxie's customer care team and explained what was going on and they exchanged it for me with no problems even though we are already outside the warranty date. I truly appreciate the above and beyond customer service and would recommend doxie 10/10!
4,Quality control from Doxie needs some work. First scanner arrived DOA. And you'll see that appears to have happened to many other users if you peruse reviews. Thankfully Amazon accepted the return and had a new unit out to me in under 24hrs which is jaw-droppingly fast.  Anyway here's the review for what I would ultimately call "a nice piece of kit."  DISCLAIMER: My use case is scanning photos ONLY.  Old photos from the 1960s - 2010's including damaged photos and polaroids.  I am not using this to scan documents.*hardware quality* - Minimal packaging all parts included AND an sd-card (wow)!  I wish it was a micro-sd card but its not a show-stopper.  Micro-usb cable runs from scanner to full usb-a computer-side input.  Seriously guys.  It's 2021.  This should be usb-c to usb-c and give me a usb-a dongle and a wall wart please.  Scanner seems sturdy enough and super-light.  Power-On light is not built for the color-blind. At all.  Pale red to pale green to pale amber. Ugh.  ***three stars*ease of use & documentation* - the quick-start guide is awesome. Remove the stickers slap in the sd-card plug in the scanner and start scanning! And it's really as easy as that.  Photos are stored on the sd-card in jpeg format.  So you just turn the thing on and start feeding it photos.  I scanned almost 100 photos in an hour with no trouble.  Plugged the scanner into my linux laptop and the sd-card mounted and popped up with all the photos.  I copied them into my photo management app and got ready for round 2. No issues with drivers software or any of the complaints that Windows users report on that front. *****five stars*stamina* - My only complaint here is that I wish I could feed photos FASTER but I'm not sure if that's possible.  It scanned every size shape and thickness of photo with no squawking.  Continuously.  For an hour.  Seriously that's awesome.  I got tired before the scanner did.  *****five stars*overall experience* - quibbles here and there but this scanner is great for the price if you're planning to scan photos.  As a bonus it's dead easy to use with linux.  Plug-in copy photos.  Not sure about any wifi features or anything like that. I can either plug the scanner into my laptop or plug the sd-card into my laptop.  Not sure what wifi would even be used for.  Overall experience is solid.  ****four stars
5,It saves me a lot of time with scanning all my receipts for the business.
5,What do I not like?Scanning documents.I let them pile up because I don't like it so much.  The piles taunt me to scan them.  Sometimes we argue.  It's not a good scene.Enter the Doxie Go.What do I like now?  Scanning documents.No wires no computers just turn the Doxie on and start scanning.  This model even comes with wifi.(I find that I use the SD Card more often but I like that wifi is an option.). Slip in your document and watch the Doxie magically transform your physical item into digital goodness.  How do you know  when it is done?  Well it went through and dropped out the other side didn't it?  Where is the power cord you ask?  It's got a friggin' rechargeable battery I say!This is one of the best tech purchases I have made recently.  And beyond that customer service is amazing.  I've gotten personalized emails asking how the Doxie is working out for me - not sales emails - just emails wondering how it is working.  They even sent me a survey to fill out recently and had the audacity to reward me for completing it.All in all if you're considering this device give it a go.Now I gotta go find something to scan.PS - I included a pic of my Doxie - when it is not scanning it likes to watch birds from the window.
5,My project scanning 4 generations of family photos. With the Doxie Go I completed it in very little time. Highly Recommended!
4,I like the scanner however when it goes through the feeder it is likely to wrinkle the paper. This is an okay product that is useful. I just got it so it is my first impression. I do not use the software I just scan and make digital copies.
3,This scanner is what I was looking for simple small and straight to the point. I tested it upon receiving it and it worked fine. However I don’t use it often and after about four months of purchasing it I tried to scan something and it was not working due to a bad battery. Customer service was excellent and they were able to send me a replacement quickly. Again I tested the replacement scanner and it was working fine. It’s been about one year since I’ve tested it and now that I’m trying to scan something it is not working again due to the battery. It happens at the most inconvenient times and it’s frustrating. I want a product that I know for certain will be functional when I need it. Update: They sent me a new scanner at no cost and I am very pleased with customer service especially working with Claudio; gave me instructions on how to maintain longevity of the scanner.
5,Purchased a Doxie Go Se scanner on April 2019. We love this scanner but unfortunately the battery went out & we could no longer use it. contacted Doxie Customer Support (Angello Orellana) after explaining the situation to Angello he had me try a few procedures to confirm that the battery is indeed dead. He was very courteous friendly & knowledgeable. Once we confirmed that it is the battery he indicated that he will be sending me a new scanner!!! Wowwww is that Customer Service at its BEST or what!!! It's this type of Customer Support that makes us patronize a company like Doxie!! If I could give them 10 stars I would!!
5,My main goal for this thing is to digitize boxes of old photos that I've accumulated.  I have two flatbed scanners but they take too long.  I have many hundreds of photos to deal with.I read the included quick setup guide enabled the battery and put the Doxie on a regular USB phone charger cable.  It took about 2 hours to charge then it was ready to rock.  This thing comes with an 8GB SD card and that the one I used.  It's already formatted--just plug it into the Doxie.  Everything you need to get started is in the box.  You don't need to buy anything extra.  But DO fully charge it first and DO read the quick setup card before you do anything.  The instructions are brief & simple but important.There's no software in the box.  From the Doxie website I downloaded the Windows10 .exe file for it and it works fine on my ancient HP desktop computer.  The software is a combination file importer / photo editor / organizer.  It is simple to use and doesn't require any explanation.  It is also optional.  The Doxie saves everythng as a JPG image file so you really don't need any special software.  If you scan in a document and wish to save it as a PDF file the Doxie software will convert it for you.  There are many ways to save a JPG as a PDF so again--the Doxie software is optional.  The software is for Windows10 or mac only.  If you are a Linux user it's not a problem.  Just transfer the scanned JPG images from the Doxie SD card to your computer.  I used a universal card reader with a USB-A plug on one end.  LibreOffice Draw can convert a JPG into a PDF for you even quicker than the Doxie software.Photo quality seems on-par with my Kodak and HP all-in-one desktop scanners only the scan rate is MUCH faster.  At 600dpi resolution a photo only takes about 3 seconds to scan.  I have a fat box of old photos that's been gathering dust for years.  I fed them all through the Doxie in about 10 minutes!  So 50 pictures down and a few hundred more to go.So far I'm very satisfied with the Doxie.  I'm making really good progress on my photo rescue project.  I have noticed when the Doxie needs cleaning I start seeing a line or two vertically across the image.  It's not a big problem though.  There's a cleaning cloth included in the box.I scanned the same old 35mm photo on 3 different devices for comparison.  The Kodak and HP scanners are flatbed types included with an all-in-one printer/scanner/copier.  All images are un-retouched JPG using the default settings at 600 dots-per-inch.  The scans are of comparable quality.  The difference is the Doxie will fit in my glovebox requires no computer or cable and scans a photo in about 3 seconds.Fun useful and very portable gadget.  I'm glad I bought it.
5,My living situation is a bit cramped right now but I still needed access to a scanner for my genealogy work; I looked around online and found the Doxie Go SE; the unit arrived on time and was easy to setup and operate. I've already scanned +/-100 documents and haven't had any issues. Highly recommend.
5,This allowed me to save a lot of old photos and share them with friends and family. Now in case something happens like a house fire I have 40 year old wedding photos and other memories stored on memory sticks with others and stored safely.  The device was easy to use and did a great job with different size photos.
5,scans photos quickly and easily and then super easy to edit them. i highly recommend the Doxie... i got rid of a dozen old photo albums in an afternoon.
5,It's always a pleasant surprise when you purchase an item that not only meets all your performance expectations but which also has a committed and caring team behind it.  Do yourselves a favor and buy one of these nifty little gadgets then take a moment to give these guys some favorable survey feedback and Amzn reviews.  They're so appreciative and deserving 👍🏻
5,Tech support is off the chain very responsive courteous friendly helpful and knowledgeable.Participated in a survey with a member of their team Byron Morton who answered all of my questions and concerns.He rewarded me with several items I needed for my purpose above and beyond!The scanner is a breeze to use and the software equally so!My only complaints are small and do not detract from Doxie's offerings.For portability the SE cannot be beat taking many scans on one charge of high quality with ease of edit.Can accommodate very stiff and thick stock no more than 8.5 wide no issues.Very portable use without cables easy to transfer scans through SD card/wifi/usb.Wish list:Faster scansBetter edge detection for complete scans of irregular shaped items or paper with tearsEasier to manipulate feed triggerFaster download to softwareFaster saves once on pc from software
5,I had a scanner by another manufacture that became useless when I updated Windows.  I chose Doxie because I can scan directly to an SD card without being connected to a computer.  I have been very happy with the Doxie Go their software scan quality and their customer service is wonderful.  They have reached out to me to see if I needed any help.  Wonderful product and company.
3,This will be somewhat lengthy but it may just may save you some time money and frustration.I purchased this to replace a ScanSnap iX100 scanner. I liked the idea that it could scan directly to SD card without being attached to a computer-true portability. Unfortunately beauty is only skin deep and when you peer into the inner workings of this Doxie scanner it isn't the end-all answer.Let me start by saying I scanned 379 documents directly to the included SD card and then downloaded them wirelessly into my iPad - so that system works fine. But my first issue was the size of the PDF files compared to the size of the files the ScanSnap produces. For example a multiple page photograph enriched document produced a 10.5MB size file with Doxie. That same file with ScanSnap was 3.5MB. Three times the size. And that difference continued throughout all types of scans.Another issue I found in scanning my 379 documents - what if you're in the field scan a customers invoice give it back to them and then when you get home you see the scan is crooked or not the right contrast etc. It's too late at this point to scan it again. I had 5-10 scans in my 379 that would have been unacceptable if I was in a real world and not experimenting in the office.Next the software for this scanner is pathetic. It shows you thumbnails but only lets you rotate the image - no crop no contrast not much of anything UNLESS you are connected to a laptop and using the full software package. But that defeats the portability. I want to be able to scan documents in the field download them to the iPad enhance crop rotate and then send them to the cloud storage. I can't do that with just the iPad.And if you use the full software suite to adjust the scan to "Photos" then in the field with your iPad software App you can't change that setting. So every receipt will be scanned as a photo...part of the large file sizes.And last it doesn't really save time to scan directly to the SD card. When you get home and import the documents in my case I had 379 imported documents with little thumbnails that I couldn't file quickly. Multiple page documents have to be "Stapled" together. The problem is all of the little thumbnails look the same (if your scanning the same looking invoices). You constantly have to click on the next document to see where the last document is that you want to "staple". This is very time consuming. With the Scan Snap if I scan a 5 page invoice at the end of the scan it automatically puts those 5 pages into a singe PDF file.Overall while I like the idea of scanning to an SD card this Doxie needs a much more robust app for the iPad the ability to change the settings from Photo to Document without having to be connected to a computer and a more streamlined way to group pages together other than hunting for the last page of particular series.I'm returning the Doxie and continuing to use the Scan Snap until I find a better alternative - the Doxie is not it. And I will close by saying this is my opinion with my limited 379 scans and your mileage may vary with this product.
5,I bought this to scan old family photos at first it was great. but then broke. I was able to get ahold of costumer service and they replaced it in no time. They were extremely nice and helpful. Because of them I was able to scan photos again instead of replacing/buying a new one. I have scanned impotent documents and old family photos and they look great this is a great scanner and easy to put away without taking up a lot of room I definitely recommend.
4,I cannot believe how this has changed my life. I am a paper hoarder. I always worry that one day I will need some random receipt from four years ago. So I keep them. My desk my home is insane. It doesn't help that I'm homeschooling four children who accumulate more paper trails than would seem humanly possible. I am in LOVE with this scanner! I have spent hours and hours scanning everything I have giant mounds and piles of papers. There is such freedom and sense of accomplishment when I heave these scanned papers into the recycle bin and to date I've filled three thirteen gallon garbage cans full of papers after scanning them. It's so liberating.I had a really hard time figuring out how to get papers to feed straight. It took me a day or so and then something clicked and I got the hang of it. Some days I'm off all day and can't seem to get the papers to go through straight but overall it's much better after some practice.Since I'm scanning a lot of kids' artwork and schoolwork it's often crinkly. Previously folded bent crumpled. These go through just fine once they've been pulled in correctly but it can be SO HARD to get the scanner to take them initially. I often have to take a paper cutter and chop off a half inch or so of one end in order to get it to take. Also when feeding something that has been ripped out of a notebook the little taggy edges will cause it to skew and go crooked in the middle of a scan so it's best to just cut those off before scanning.I love that it really does scan a page in about five seconds but I don't like that when you import it all to your computer it takes a very long time like a traditional scanner. So after I've done a marathon scanning night and taken care of a hundred pages or so it takes hours to import them all. There was also some sort of error that occurred with one image the first time I did an import and it was never corrected. Every time I import new things it still chirps at me and tells me that there was an error with that earlier image. I do not know how to fix it. I am not a fan of the beeping noises it makes when alerting you.Lastly the software. I am not a techy person. I know my way around the internet but that's it. This software is kind of intimidating. So far I have imported hundreds of pages to the Doxie program but I don't really know what to do with them now. When you click on a picture to enlarge and edit the image it doesn't give you the ability to keep going to the next image with that window open which would make sorting and editing a LOT easier. Instead you have to click on an image see what it is (because it's hard to tell pages apart on the main page) then edit how you wish then x out of the window and click on another image to enlarge. The only way that it lets you click next in the editing window is if you've already stapled pages together. I honestly wish I had just imported all of the pages to a folder on my computer so that I could edit and sort more easily with folders and clicking through. I haven't spent a lot of time in there and I still need to tinker more and get my pictures saved somewhere. There was a setting that automatically deleted the images off of the Doxie scanner after I imported them to the program and I wish that hadn't been checked initially because now I have to deal with the software and cannot simply import to a folder.All in all I am very happy with this scanner and I do recommend it to others.
5,This scanner is perfect! I use this scanner for my job and can't imagine not having it! I love the size. Whenever I work from home I can easily tuck it away in my desk drawer after use. Whenever I travel for work it fits nicely in my laptop bag and is so easy to transport.Setting up the scanner was super easy! I am not super tech saavy and I was able to do it without my husband's help (which is a big deal for me!). I tried a different portable scanner previous to this one. I had to keep uninstalling and re-installing the program and had issues with it time and time again. I eventually returned that scanner and tried this one.  I was slightly reluctant as I had never heard of this brand before and didn't want to spend more than I spent on the previous portable scanner. BUT this scanner was worth every penny!Their customer service is unlike any other. Seriously! I received an email asking if I would be willing to complete a 10-minute survey over the phone. They asked what I liked and didn't like about the scanner and how they could improve their product. The employee I spoke with even offered to send me a free case since I travel with my scanner so much. They also are sending a gift card just for completing the survey. They made me feel special as an individual customer. I feel confident that if I ever have a problem they'll truly do their best to help me. Could not recommend this product enough! Great product and great company!
5,I was able to digitize over 4000 prints and declutter in no time. The images are great and the Customer Service is Outstanding. I was contacted by a couple associates to make sure everything was working well. Thank you for the Stellar Service!
5,UPDATE: See original review below:I had used this scanner only a few times before the battery would no longer hold a charge. I contacted their customer service to report the issue and thinking it was going to be like almost every other company who would never respond with anything useful.  I wrote my Amazon review on the product shortly after to try and be helpful (I rely heavily on other people's good and bad experiences before purchasing anything). Shortly after I got an email from Doxie's customer service to offer advice. When they realized where the issue was they immediately shipped another replacement battery to me. Before the new battery arrived my original Amazon review posted and I received another email from Doxie. They were aware that the issue was already being addressed apologized for the inconvenience of the scanner not working and offered a full refund which they have since honored.I am honestly floored by the customer service I've received from Doxie.  I never thought that the response back would be so quick or helpful. The replacement battery was sent the day after my initial contact to them and the refund a few days after that. Everyone I talked to was extremely responsive and went above and beyond my expectations on how I was envisioning my scanner to get fixed. I would 100% recommend this scanner which does work very very well but mainly for the service I've received.Original review:I used this scanner once. It was great and did everything I was hoping it would do. It's portable easy enough to figure out and the scans turned out great. I recently got it out again to scan more items and the battery was dead. No big deal I hooked up the USB to charge it and left it alone. After a whole day of charging for 8+ hours the light will only flash red for a second before turning off. When the scanner is unplugged the light won't even turn on.
5,Updated review after 4+ years of use:Bought the original Go with WiFi in 2017 (see review below).  Have scanned thousands of documents/pictures without issue.  Recently the scanner started to jamb.  I sent a support request describing my issue.  II got a response the same day and after a few diagnostic questions they offered to send a replacement.  I got the replacement in less than 5 days!  The replacement not only worked perfectly out of the box they sent the updated SE WiFi model!  Unbelievable support for and incredible product.  This company is the best.Original review:I have to say I am impressed.  I have used it for 1 day (approx 100 scans) and it seems to be everything it was advertised to be.Right out of the box this feels like a premium product (as the cost dictated) the packaging packing and documentation are all top notch.  The device itself is solid the build quality is quite apparent (no pun intended!) just by holding it and upon close inspection.I followed the quick start guide and scanned a photo in less than 3 minutes from opening the box.The device accepts the media quite easily and quickly scans it.  I tried some mangled receipts from my wallet and it handled them well.  You do have to make sure the front edge of the document is clean for some really badly mangled receipts I just folded the top back against itself to create a clean edge and the scan worked just fine (no jamming).  The scan quality was better than that of my Epson XP-410 and certainly faster.The software setup was easy (an the online documentation is very thorough.  The software is basically a tool to pull the scanned documents from the scanner.  It provides some nice features to edit the scanned document and allow for some smart tagging (date/time).  The OCR functionality worked better than I thought even on some really faded poor quality receipts.  I guess if there was one option missing it would be the ability to automatically pull the scans from Doxie (or push from Doxie).  There is the ability to manually save the scans to cloud services I tried the Google Drive function and it worked flawlessly.WiFi setup was a bit complex if you don't use the default configuration.  By default WiFi is configured as a host at 192.168.1.100 as its own network (PC -> Doxie direct bypassing existing wireless router).  So if you have an existing wireless router and it is on the 192.168.1.x subnet you may have a conflict if another device on your network already has a 192.168.1.100 address.  If you follow the instructions it is possible to add a connection to access it over existing router network but if you follow the instructions carefully and I recommend that you have your computer connected both via wireless router WiFi and hard wired via Ethernet cable during WIFi setup.Overall this is a great product.  I will be using it every day so I will report back on reliability if it becomes an issue.Pros:Solid High quality in every aspectQuick scanning with very good qualitySimple yet elegant SW interfaceCons:WiFi Setup (relative to everything else) was a bit complex.  But this is a one time thing and it really was not bad as long as you follow instructions.Update 4/22/02 - This thing is a tank.  Powers thru scans like hot knife through butter.  Use it everyday and works like a charm.  One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.
5,Easy to use transport and perfect for scanning real estate docs or tons of family photos!!
5,My father passed away a couple weeks ago and I needed a way to easily scan all his photos and documents. I wasn’t sure to get the Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi or the Plustek Photo Scanner. I ended up getting both thinking I’d send one back. The Doxie is great for paper documents. So quick easy to collate multi-page PDFs and it’s pretty handy since it is cordless (as long as you get the Wi-Fi to connect) and a really nice small size. I was able to scan a 30 page insurance policy very quickly (would have been such a hassle on the flatbed scanner on my printer). There aren't many editing functions in the software just rotation collation and saving. And there were many PDF options (you don't just want image PDFs then it would be huge). So just what I needed. So for documents the options were fine. It’s not very good at color photos though - the colors and contrast were both a little off. It was just fine/OK but not as easy/good as the Plustek. I scanned some photos and after just a couple I would get lines across them. So not great for photos but great for documents. So I’m going to keep both actually – the Doxie is just so easy for documents and paper and the Plustek is great for photos. Love them both!
4,I bought this particularly to scan family photos. There’s lines through the photos even on the higher dpi setting so it’s not the greatest. Ease of use and portability are great though.
5,We bought this Doxie as a way to scan important documents kid art receipts etc. Overall it is very easy to set up and get working. We love that you can scan things from anywhere then transfer later by plugging into the computer. The scans are very clear (VERY - sorry about the coffee cup stain on that form I sent to the school nurse...).The first model we bought worked great for a couple of months. Then one day when I went to scan something...I just got a brief flash of red light. It wouldn't charge or anything. After trying to troubleshoot on my own through the internet I couldn't solve the problem. So I emailed Doxie technical support.Holy moly they responded within the hour - asked me a couple of questions to pinpoint the issue then let me know that yes indeed I had a rare problem that required a new unit. I just had to send them some basic info on my model and they said they would send a new unit out and a packing slip to send the old one back.I got the new model THE NEXT DAY! I couldn't even believe it when it showed up. They also emailed me to follow up that I had received it and that the new unit was working well (which it is). I packaged up the old unit with their included packing label and returned it free of charge.So yes this Doxie is a great portable scanner. But even more impressive is their customer service - so incredibly helpful and fast. How many places can you say that about when you have an issue or need to make a return? I would buy from them again in a heartbeat. Shout out to their company for making resolving issues a fast easy and pleasant experience.
5,Once my questions were answered works just like it is supposed to
4,I like the scanner for what it does well. It is fast and does a good job of copying. The one drawback that I have found is that I have to keep checking the images to make sure that they are good. I find that there are occasional scans where the images come out half yellow and half picture and I have to rescan them. That can be frustrating when you were going through a lot of pictures at one time.  I can’t just guarantee that I’m going to get a good image consistently.  i’m not sure if the picture is not fitting properly because that distortion.
5,Works great for scanning pictures.  Haven't done documents yet but I expect it to do just as well.  Small and portable at a good price.
4,I just ordered this so I could scan in the large number of family photos I’m trying to archive.  So far the scanner itself works quite well.  It quickly scans the documents and since they only go through straight there is no damage even to fragile newspaper clippings that are starting to deteriorate.Their “Amazing Software” is another issue.  I purchased this so I could use my iPad Pro for this work however I have not been able to get the software to install.  I can download it and even get an “OPEN” dialog box but after that nothing happens.  Even in the download process there is no feedback which is a sign of poor interface in my opinion.I was able to download and install the PC/Windows version on my old laptop which is extremely slow but still working even with a recent update to Windows 10.  The software installed appropriately and the wireless interface works as advertised.  I’m saving everything to the cloud anyway but it is an inconvenience to not be able to use my newer equipment to complete this project.I emailed their technical support as soon as I determined that the Mac Software wasn’t working.  I got an immediate automatic response but a promised of help within two days due to heavy volume is not really satisfying.  I understand that these are troubled times due to the virus but I assume this is a somewhat high-tech organization so they should have at least offered some suggestions for resolving my problem.  The documentation and FAQ were not helpful.So bottom line this appears to be a thoughtfully designed little scanner but if you’re buying it solely to use with Mac products you might consider my issues.  If they get back to me and I am eventually able to resolve the installation issue I will update my review.The unit is very lightweight seems sturdy and produces a very nice quality image from my old documents.  It’s gentle on fragile paper and quickly scans a large number of documents.  The Windows software seems to be intuitive enough its just past time for everyone to get on the Mac Bandwagon.  So many of us have both platforms but many don’t so they need to resolve this installation issue.
4,**Updated 4/14/2013** - The "send" feature in the software that is included with the Doxie GO allows you to export your scans to other software which makes it great. I would also say that once you've utilized the unit for a little bit (3-4 days) you will get the trick of putting the paper in evenly and thus the scans will come out looking straight.I ordered the Doxie Go because I've started going paperless back in 2012. I had so much to scan (healthcare receipts tax forms etc) that my HP AIO was a real drag to use.I utilize the Doxie Go for scanning just about any size paper receipt business card or certificate and store all my documents locally in the cloud and in Evernote.What's Great:* The form factor: It feels pretty solid and includes a usb charging port on the side for easy access* Sliding document guide: It's there it works well with business cards but not necessarily 8x11 paper or paper receipts* Battery included: the scanner charges and can be used while on the go for easy and truly portable scanning* Price: Most people would have to have their arm twisted to spend money on a scanner purely for going paperless. Doxie really makes it easy by pricing this unit competitively compared to similar equipped portable scanners.* Includes software: The software is included and lets you save in multiple formats (color PDF with OCR JPG PNG black and white etc) It integrates with cloud based storage Doxie Cloud storage local storage and even some picture storage services.What's Not-So-Great:* Length of Charge/Charging In General: The battery lasts enough that you feel the feature is justified. The charge doesn't last long enough for most travelers and this can be frustrating in a pinch. While it doesn't happen often you do have to make sure you utilize charging time while you have it. The other issue is that you cannot scan while charging. I have used a 10 amp plug powered USB and the included charger and haven't been able to get it to charge and scan at the same time. This would be a definite plus for Doxie if they can find a way to improve on that feature.* Software: I have been able to utilize the included software for fixing receipts that don't scan straight or "stapling" documents that belong together. I find myself wishing there was some integration with Neat Receipts Software. I have to import receipts as it stands but it would be great if the Doxie integrated with Quickbook/Quicken or Neat Receipts. **As a note Doxie is far superior to the Neat Receipts scanner*** Scanning Straight: I find myself wishing the sliding document guard worked a bit better. The thing is once you really start using the Doxie you begin to get a feel for how to feed it. The documents eventually get straighter receipts save crisper and business cards are aligned correctly. The included software lets you rotate crop and sharpen images you've scanned so this is low on my list of caveats.Overall the price and the build quality are far superior to comparably priced/feature units. You also find yourself wanting to pull for the 'little guy' because Doxie is a company that seems to have a real passion for their product.If you want to organize warranties receipts healthcare receipts WHATEVER ELSE...I suggest you start getting organized buy a Doxie GO and you'll get into the paperless rhythm.
2,Preface -It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow embedded pictures in product reviews.So if you are interested in seeing the review with pictures please visit my website (which I can't link to here :/)I swear I read somewhere online (I did a lot of research before buying the Doxie Go) that the initial battery charge took about 4-6 hours. My initial charge took close to 8 - 9 hours. :(After charging the battery I powered up the Doxie Go and feed it it's Calibration sheet. I can't find any documentation on how often one should calibrate their Doxie [...]Being a tech I wanted to put the Doxie Go through a number of tests. The first thing I grabbed to scan was the included 8.5 x 11″ looking poster featuring the Doxie mascot (?) (a Doxie scanner with arms and legs). This sheet was folded so I straightened it out and put it through the scanner. It got stuck when it hit the "bump fold" but then continued to pull the sheet through.Yeah my very first scan had "issues"...[photo examples unable to display via Amazon review]Okay so the first scan had a problem with a "bump fold"... I immediately wanted to scan the other side of the sheet which had what I call a "valley fold". The scanner pulled it through just fine so a close inspection of the scan would have to be done...[photo examples unable to display via Amazon review]"Valley fold" scans have a noticeable shadowing to the scans within the "valley". This is kind-of expected of sheet fed scanners but seriously it's kind-of a pain. My higher end Fujitsu scanner does a much better job at dealing with both "bump" and "valley" folds. I was hoping that the Doxie would too unfortunately it doesn't.Other "Issues":Skewing of scans - due to pulling in the sheet crooked... This is a SERIOUSLY HUGE problem for the Doxie scanners whether Apparent wants to admit it or not. The Doxie Go's sensor telling the scanner that a piece of paper is waiting to be pulled in and scanned is IMHO to [..] anxious to pull in documents often pulling in documents while I was still trying to align them up with the left side and adjusting the paper guide.I have to say that close to 95% of my scans all had some visible skewing issue to them (indicated by the tell tale sign of a BLACK negative space as part of the scan). Now believe me when I say that I got pretty good a feeding a scan in what I consider "perfectly" so that there shouldn't be any skew. But the damn thing would still pull in scans crooked or too quickly before I got them aligned tight left and with the paper guide...[photo examples unable to display via Amazon review][large photo example that you have to see unable to display via Amazon review]Score Card:Rather than continue explaining every negative I've summed up a lot of them in the "Cons" section below... So make sure you read through the extensive list. :-/Pros:+ A truly portable (PC free) simplex document scanner+ Scans at 300 DPI or 600 DPI+ Scans up to 8.5 x 15" (so US LEGAL)+ Has internal memory w/support for SDHC and USB Flash Drives+ Has a built in rechargeable battery+ Supports Eye-Fi WiFi SDHC Memory Cards+ Decent Software (with OCR capabilities) for the Mac and PC (sorry Linux users)+ Comes with a small special scanning sleeve for "old or glossy photos"Somewhere in the middle your milage may vary:± Customer support via Twitter and Email was very quick and responsiveCons:- Detailed "User Manual"  is HIDDEN under the Doxie App's "Help" menu (at least under Mac OS X)- Costly the scanner alone is around $200 other "add ons" inflate the cost even more (e.g.: power-cord=$10 case=$30 WiFi-storage=$30 etc)- Feels Cheaply Made (feels like the Doxie needs the optional $30 case just to keep it from getting banged up in a professional's bag)- SCANNER tries to grip the sheet to quickly (IMHO) often causing skewed scans- Scans are often SKEWED and/or include BLACK space because scans aren't always pulled in straight (even when using the included page guide)- Scans of pages with folds often have "issues" causing skewing shadowing or jams- Users shouldn't have to "learn" how get straight scans even when using the page guide- Software by DEFAULT deletes the scans on the Doxie SCANNER when imported into the Doxie APP- Software by DEFAULT sets PDF Image quality to "6 Medium" and JPEG image quality to "9 (High)" which IMHO should DEFAULT to the maximum- It's not apparently clear where the Doxie APP temporarily stores imported scans on the computer- Power cord is an extra purchase (~$10)- I wasn't able to get the Doxie to scan while being charged via my Mac's USB port which would make me lean towards having to use a USB power adapter or the optional $10 power cord- Has a built in rechargeable battery that can't be swapped out for AA or AAA when in a pinch- Scans are saved as JPEGS and need to be converted later to PDF/OCR-PDF or PNG with the PC software- Doxie Software sometimes makes bad decisions and tries to incorrectly "auto" correct scans (DEFAULT behavior)- Wireless (WiFi) capability is an extra purchase (~$30+)- No Linux compatible software- Included carrier sheet ("scanning sleeve") is small and is marketed for "old or glossy photos" there should at least be a FULL 8.5 x 15″ carrier sheet for odd shaped scans (think news paper clippings)Edited the "Title" of review on 02/23/2013.
3,I returned mine recently.  I was not happy with the scanner at all and wonder about the honesty of many 5 star reviews.  For one thing the software is horrendous.  I could only save one file at a time.  Whenever I tried to multi-select and save as OCR the software would always report sharing violations for some strange reason.  This made the process of savings scans extremely tedious.  The one note integration is hilarious.  I watched a few videos that gave the one note integration rave reviews but it doesn't work well at all.  It simply uploads attachments into one note which then have to be redownloaded just so that you can view the file.  The way to do it is to use the print to one note interface.  I want to see the actual document when I open one note not just an attachment to then download.  Of course I could do that by scanning saving opening in PDF editor and then printing to one note but that would take forever.  Also as others have pointed out the document feeder is difficult to figure out.  I aligned pages to the left as instructed but doxie's feeder sometimes keeps grabbing them too quickly and then the pages get destroyed.  The occasional crooked page isn't too bad but I had many documents that would not feed through correctly no matter how many times I tried.  Perhaps the scanner is just very sensitive to even minor imperfections so if you want to go paperless and have old documents to scan then good luck.  Generally the software itself doesn't do any management of anything.  It simply provides a user interface for converting the docs into the format you want and then sending them to another app.  It's very minimal and as I stated earlier is very tedious to use especially since you can't just select a bunch of scans to save.  I also do not like that you cannot see scans while scanning.  You scan a bunch of docs then have to connect to the computer only to find out that they didn't work out well.  You should be able to maintain a connection if you want and see the scans as they are happening.  They point to that as a feature but I don't see that as a feature at all.  It is a limitation.The good:I like the size of it and the simplicity of setting it up.  The WIFI was easy to figure out.  When it did scan documents correctly it seemed great.  I was excited at first but I thought that overall it fell far short of my expectations.  I will be researching some other scanners to try something else soon.Updates:Customer service does try. If you have the time to work with them some things could be figured out.  They actually sent me another scanner for free after I returned mine in order to try to work out the issues and give it another try.  I've sent them some attachments of the sharing violation that I get when trying to save some files as OCR.  It doesn't happen every time but it happens often enough to increase the amount of time that it takes to get things done.  I'll admit that going into this that I expected things to be "easier".  From all of the simple 5 star reviews I didn't expect to have any issues.  The truth is that scanning with this type of scanner takes practice.  It is tedious.  There is no way around that.  You actually have to hold the page firmly while inserting it.  The pre-feed process sometimes feels like I'm fighting with the scanner but that is just the way it is.  Hold onto it and as it starts to pre-feed it will straighten out.  If you let go to soon then the page will slide or be pulled in crooked.  That means that it is just something that takes practice and it isn't a simple thing to do while watching TV.  It requires concentration as opposed to a scanner where you can just drop them into a slot and it just works.  Sometimes the marketing of something like this makes things appear to be easier than they really are.  Going truly paperless is a lot of work even with a scanner with a multi-document feeder that also duplexes.  Going paperless with something small and portable like the Doxie seems impractical.  This is something that could assist you but you still really need to have a bigger scanner for jobs that require more than a few pages at a time.  That's just my opinion.
4,I found this so simple to activate and use for photos. I now keep it on top of my computer desk and use it to scan anything I need rather than using my printer. So convenient and easy. Recommended especially if you want to scan photos; does them really quickly.
4,If you have a lot of photos or documents to scan you can't go wrong with the Doxie Go SE.  I bought the Doxie based on its reviews even though some similar brands are much cheaper.  So far I don't regret the purchase.  The quality of scans is excellent and the color rendition is very good.  I compared some test images with those scanned on a fairly expensive HP flatbed and the Doxie did better.  It's also way faster than a flatbed.  It can scan photos almost as fast as you can feed them in.  I've only had it a week and have already scanned several hundred photos.The only reason I gave this scanner four stars instead of five is that it's a little hard to feed photos in straight.  There is an adjustable edge guide to help with that but it's not long enough to do an adequate job.  If a photo is fed in slightly askew the scanner includes a large yellow background to the right of the image. Then you either have to rescan the photo or edit out the extraneous background.When the scanner is connected to my PC via its USB cable I can view each photo immediately after it's scanned.  I have gotten in the habit of checking after each five scans or so in case I needed to rescan something because of a crooked feed.  I can't be sure this immediate viewing will work on other systems (I have a Windows 10 laptop) but I'm guessing it will work on other versions of Windows at least.Other than that I really don't have any complaints.  The scanner seems to be of good quality and the literature that comes with it makes a big point of saying how eager the company is to help with any problems.  I see that some reviewers aren't happy with the companion software (included as a free download). That's not a factor for me because I use Photoshop and other tools that are more sophisticated.  I also don't intend to use the scanner for bills and documents -- just photos.  However it does appear that the Doxie software has some nice basic tools for cropping rotating and changing such things as contrast color saturation and brightness.  One negative point is that the software imports scanned images very slowly so prepare to get coffee if you're importing lots of them.
5,Usually I don't write reviews but this time the Doxie people have gone above and beyond.  I've contacted Doxie's customer service twice and both times they were very helpful.  The first time was my bad.  I should have read their online help a little more closely but the customer service rep was very nice about it.  He helped me to pinpoint the problem right away.The second time my Doxie Go would not connect to a computer.  I tried Mac and PC.  I read the online help and it recommended formatting the memory - well I couldn't even get to that point.  So I emailed customer service again.  This time the guy told me I had a rare problem with the internal memory being corrupted.  He checked my address and immediately sent me a brand new Doxie Go.  When it arrived I sent back the old unit all for free.  I didn't have to pay shipping either direction and the unit came brand new in a brand new box with all of the extras.Actual Review:I've had my Doxie Go for about a year now and I have scanned A TON of documents of all shapes and sizes including photos photobooks letterhead printed items and notebook pages.Photos scan easily and quickly.  I recommend hitting the button so you're doing a high quality scan - it's slower but higher quality.  The Doxie comes with a sleeve you can put the pictures into to scan them but I don't recommend it.  It's easiest to scan them directly.  You will have to do some color correction afterwards if you really care about having the exact same picture you scanned but the Doxie scan is good enough.  I scanned about 600 pictures from the 80s 90s and 00s and I'm quite happy with the results.  To get the best results I held the photo flat as it fed into the scanned and flat as it exited the scanner.  When the photo bends into the scanner it can look a little off.Photobooks like the ones you purchase from sites while traveling need to be cut up first but scan very similarly to the photos.  Always scan from a precut flat edge not the edge you cut.Letterhead and regular paper are both the easiest and most difficult things to scan.  If the paper is perfectly flat it scans like a dream.  If the edge you feed into the scanner has a bent corner or edge it can be difficult.  I recommend rotating the page or trying to fold back the edge.  It also helps to push the scan slightly if you've already had trouble.  Once the scan starts though it's rare that the document will get stuck.Notebook pages work well if you cut the bad edge off.  The rest of the page and the corners are usually flat so they scan quickly and easily.The Doxie Go is very much a quick and dirty scanner which scans very well as long as you're OK with its quirks.  You have to be OK with tilted scans as it is very difficult to get a straight scan.  It also cuts off parts of the tilted edge so even if you correct the angle you may still have to cut some of the edges off.
5,I have been meaning to digitize old family photos for ages but the thought of individually scanning as many photos as I have using a flatbed scanner has always seemed so annoying.  When I heard about the Doxie Go it seemed like the perfect solution for me.  So far it has been!I've scanned two albums worth of photos so far and I'm very happy with the results.  I love that I can put it anywhere (no need to worry about outlet availability).  Scanning lots of photos still takes some time but the process feels very easy (and is easy to do while binging a show).  Some of my older thicker photos have not fed properly the first time I tried to scan them but they have all worked after I turned them around and tried to scan from a different side.  I've used the Doxie software to import and rotate my photos (where necessary) and it's worked well for me.  The Doxie Go makes the whole process so easy that I think I will actually finish my scanning project!
5,I am a mobile notary and use this scanner nearly daily.  Works great and the software is really easy to use.  Remember to insert the memory card before scanning.
5,I can pretty much echo what so many others have said about this scanner.  It's lights out!  I scan vintage matchbook covers - thousands of covers a week.  I used to use a flat bed scanner.  I'd have to put 10 on the glass at a time then scan them.  Easy.  BUT it'd then have to crop EACH MATCHBOOK COVER.  Auto cropping was a crap shoot.  Most of the time it didn't work.  The process took HOURS AND HOURS of time.  I was searching a scanner that would actually get the job dome for me and cut my time down.I stumbled upon Doxie.  Figured that it wouldn't work in my case because many of the pieces I"m dealing with are really fragile.  But for south of $200 I figured I had to give it a shot.  All I can say is WOW!!  This unit has been just what I needed!  NO DAMAGE at all!  This means no more cropping.  2.5 seconds to scan each matchbook cover.  Download to my computer.  And with a second card that I picked up I can continue to scan while the download completes.  WHAHOO!!So far I've scanned nearly 9000 matchbook covers with it and it's still going strong.  I wipe the scanning device off with the provided cloth ever hour or so and the images continue to come out fantastic.The only issue I've had with it is when I scan something yellow the auto crop feature goes nuts.  But as the incredible customer support folks told me all I need to do in that situation is to use one of the provided sleeves.  They actually sent me more gratis!  Their support is second to none.  Two days after delivery they sent me an email asking how I like the unit and if there was one feature I could add to let them know.  I figured it was a form letter than one one ever looked at.  Nay nay!  30 minutes after completing it they replied and told me the feature I would like to see added was already included.  Top flight folks running that department.Not sure how many scans I'll be able to get out of this unit but I know this.  As long as I am scanning matchbook covers I'll be buying Doxie equipment.  I couldn't be happier.
5,When my sister passed away I found myself in need of a high quality photo scanner to scan hundreds of her old photos in order to share them with other family members. I also needed this photo scanner to be super user friendly and compatible with my MacBook Pro. This Doxie GO SE Wi-Fi scanner worked perfectly. The setup was easy and there is a great help link online if you need it. When I had to ask a question I received an answer including additional help links in an email. I also purchased the storage case and photo sleeves to protect some of the very old photos I had to scan. There are two dpi settings and I used the higher one for a sharper scan (the lower dpi is perfect for scanning documents and receipts). I scanned the photos saved them to my MacBook Pro either by Wi-Fi or using my USB transferred them to a photo file I created just for my sisters photos saved them on a thumb drive and then burned many discs to send to family members. Doxie is very proactive in making sure you are satisfied. They contact you to make sure the product is working well for you and also like to hear any possible improvement feedback ideas. I would definitely recommend this scanner.
4,1 yr later update: Still happily using this product. I don't think this basic thing is worth more than $150 or maybe even $100 but it is good for basic scanning needs and quite lightweight. I am happy that I can easily take this overseas without having it blow up because it doesn't need a continuous power source and charges via USB.Update: After expressing my concerns about the product to Doxie Support and in this review I received outstanding service as well as a replacement product which did work out of the box just fine. I can not give the product a perfect score due to design flaws noted below - ultimately there must be a design and software improvement. However Doxie customer service is probably the best I have ever experienced.Note: I bought this used and it came with previous owner's scans of their important receipts & bills. Be sure to clear your SD card before returning this. Maybe scan a bunch of blank pages too and then format the SD card a few times because the data may be recoverable.Original review:This item would not work out of the box. Just would not take paper. Not sure why. Kept charging it and it wouldn't work until it suddenly started working for some reason.Don't get this if you're colorblind. I'm not colorblind but I have no idea what genius decided there should be a green light for 300 DPI orange (basically red) light for 600 DPI and flashing red lights for everything else from paper jam to low battery to charging to you forgot to put the SD card in. A customer service rep pointed me to the light codes as if I should have easily found them in the hidden advanced topics section of their website. So what I got from it is that you need to learn Morse code to interpret what's wrong with your scanner.You need to install software on your computer to use it. The software looks like typical printer software out of the 90s.I will not enable wi-fi as it doesn't make anything significantly easier for me. Nor do I use their very low rated Android app. I am not sure if it may introduce security vulnerabilities into my home network.I rate it more than one star because it's better than my multifunction printer. But that doesn't say much.
5,I love the slim lightweight size of the Doxie Go SE- it comes with its own SD card and once charged up it's ready to go!  I traveled with it out of state and had to remove the battery for air travel but that's simple too. The Doxie is so much faster than a flatbed scanner and the software makes it easy to rename and organize your documents..  I've learned that thicker paper like heavy yardstick or old photos and Polaroids can be scanned with just a little extra pressure on the back side of the document touring it through if it pauses.  This is definitely a go-to product!
4,Replaced canon flatbed scanner. Canon fails to update drivers and software for mac. No profit in keeping old scanners going unlike old ink hungry printers.Charged once 3 weeks ago and now on scan 67. Software installs and works on M1 Monterey just fine.To scan hold power button 2 sec  (on..off) and hold 1 sec to switch 300..600 dpi. After a scan I just move the sd card to the mac to get the files. Staple into one file if related and save as color ocr.The wifi version was clumsy and finiky but the $40 cheaper non-wifi works fine.
5,One month ago I left a scathing review saying that the scanner was a piece of junk.  I had tried to contact Customer Service before I wrote the review and got no response.  After I wrote the review Customer Service contacted me within a week and we got the issue figured out and solved.  It turns out that the old SD card I was using although it was within the size specs was not communicating with the scanner. I switched to the 16 Gb card that came with the scanner and everything is working perfectly.  It is smooth and quiet and quick producing sharp images every time. Thanks to Doxie customer service for the help.  I changed my rating from one-star to five-star.
4,Edited reviewI had some issues with mine but this was the best customer experience I've had in a long time. The manufacturer is top notch in my book!Thank you again Angello O!
5,If you are scanning old photos this scanner is essential. I did one batch with a flatbed scanner and I was just dreading doing the other thousand or so. I looked into sending them to a service like  legacy box or something but those cost 💲 a fortune.Scan pictures in 600 dpi. They look perfect. You just feed your picture in and grab a new one while it’s scanning. Old Polaroid's and other thick pictures need a little guidance and rumpled edges need to be smoothed. I also wish the software worked with chromebook.$225 is kind of expensive for me but this was  so incredibly worth it. If you’re even considering this buy it because it is invaluable if you are saving old pictures. The included memory card can hold 8000 which is more than you think.
2,I was so excited to receive my Doxie Go wi-fi. I had been wanting it for a month but was a little hesitant because of the hefty price for a product that I basically already owned in another form (we have a dedicated flat-bed scanner and an all-in-one printer scanner copier etc.)  But if it worked it was going to be a lifesaver and timesaver for me. I am a full-time working mom of 1-yr-old twins and a 3-yr-old who are in daycare 5 days a week. I have a LOT of paper coming home on a daily basis. Every day from each of their backpacks I pull out a paper that includes a report of their day and anywhere from 1 to 5 drawings coloring pages construction projects etc. I am hopelessly nostalgic and want to preserve everything but I am inundated with paper. SOOOO MUCH PAPER!! So I had the idea to scan everything (to later make artwork books from uploaded photos) and toss 95% of the paper and holding onto a small portion of the originals. The problem is I needed a convenient and fast way to do this. I don't have time to fiddle with our other scanners that are in the other part of the house from where the family hangs out when we're home. Heck I barely have time to walk upstairs and back. My little ones are at the stage where they can't be left unattended for more than 60 seconds...even in my totally child-proofed gated living room!  Enter the Doxie wi-fi...I planned to leave it on the kitchen counter and quickly scan papers as I empty their backpacks or even throw the papers in a folder and take them to the office the next day and do the scans while multitasking at my desk in between court sessions. If that worked out I was even going to splurge for the protective carrying case. I finally took the plunge and ordered it several weeks ago. I was so giddy about the thought of such a useful tool that I cornered two friends at the office who like me are juggling the time and stress of a law career by day and playing mommy at night and told them they HAD to buy this scanner.  I went on and on about ridding my house of paper receipts toy manuals and the endless sea of daycare papers. I peaked their interest but they both questioned the time factor. I was adamant that this would be a time AND sanity saver.Well to say I am disappointed is an understatement.  In fact I have spent far more time trying to use this thing than if I set up and plugged in my flatbed scanner.First the Doxie took significantly longer to charge initially - about 9 hours. That was't a deal breaker by any means but what was is the fact that it loses its charge every two days. It is advertised as being able to scan 200-300 documents between charges. I'm not even in the same hemisphere of being able to scan that many. So I almost always need to have it plugged in - which defeats the purpose of a portable scanner. The added problem is that I have been bringing the Doxie into the living room with me to do the scans while hanging out on the couch with the kiddos.  The issue there is that if the scanner isn't sitting stable on a flat surface the power cord constantly falls out...very very frustrating.Lastly and most disappointing is the document feeder... it just doesn't work well. It takes several attempts to get the scanner to recognize that a document is there before it pulls it in.  When in does pull it it is skewed (crooked). The software to fix that is fine but I just don't have time to fix more than 50% of my scans.Next routinely the paper goes in and passes through the scanner but then stops with about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch left to scan. It literally just stops. So that portion of the page is missing from the uploaded image.  Very often that's where my child's name and date are on the artwork. I absolutely need that portion of the page to keep track of whose papers are whose. So I need to rescan sometimes upside down to make sure I have an image that includes that information...and then need to rotate the image with software so it is right-side up. It happens on papers that are only 5 to 10 inches long - nowhere near the limit of 15 inches. THEN I need to go in and delete the several partially-scanned images. The added problem with that is that the images don't scan in any logical chronological order.  So I need to fish around and locate each partial scan individually and delete so I am not over-run with duplicative yet useless images.  Again a waste of very precious time.Lastly one out of every 8 to 10 scans uploads as a blurry image! Now almost every image takes a second or two to become clear when you pull it up on your iPhone iPad or computer.  But 1 out of the 8-10 never clears up.  So again they need to be rescanned...and then I need to spend the time deleting the bad scans. Again wasted time.I'm so so bummed out. The Doxie had so much potential but just can't hack it in my crazy fast-paced household. Guess I'll look into the snapscan or just stick with my flatbed.
4,I bought this scanner to get rid of my photo albums once and for all and make room in my house. This scanner is a workhorse. So fast great quality.  I could do hundreds of photos in one sitting. As long as you load the picture straight it scans perfectly. If you get a little lazy you may have to do some cropping.The only downside to this scanner was splurging on the WiFi. It’s not worth it. I have great internet speed but it was just too slow to use the WiFi. Totally impractical.  I also didn’t bother to use the Doxie interface. I would scan an entire photo album to the memory card then just plug the usb into my laptop and copied the pictures into folders.  Sometimes I would pop out the memory card and pop it into my laptop to transfer.Great overall but this particular model is not worth the price. Get the non wifi version.
5,Bought it after doing research on document scanners not the cheapest but I believe based on my usage thus far I made far and away the best choice.  I use it for personal and work (I'm a police Traffic Sergeant) to digitize and keep track of both personal papers and materials for case files. since I purchased with my own funds I wish now I had bought the next model up (non portable) but there is always the future.  Customer support has been amazing with several E-mails and an invitation phone call checking if I had any issues with hardware or software and to check my overall satisfaction with the product.  Beyond any doubt I highly recommend this product and Company.
5,I wanted to love this device as my life is going paperless. After watching all of the YouTube videos on Doxie this really seemed like the way to go. After owning it for a few months I concluded I could live with out if it weren't so portable.The scan to OneNote feature was really heralded in their videos and the reality is it isn't nearly as transparent as they would have you believe. I'm still saving PDF's and dragging them into OneNote as I use Apple and Office 365. Will it change in the future? Hopefully and at which point this would be a game changer. Right now I am doing the same amount of work as before just on a different device.What I love about this thing is it is pretty sweet when mobile. I can use it to scan all day when gathering information on new clients. Then go back and sort it in their ridiculously easy software that works on Apple and Windows ecosystems. I think the heart shaped Icon is cheesy but the software works and I haven't had any issues with it.If you are considering purchasing this device I highly recommend opting for the wireless model. I immediately regret that decision and have since added an eyefi wireless SD card. I scan all my receipts and docs at the end of the day and import on the couch and sort it out. I love this little feature.At the end of the day it is a good scanner. It doesn't always feed bent receipts straight but only a flatbed will do so. Its nice being able to scan a days worth of docs and deal with it later but at the price point this is offered its not a dead ringer for me. If you are a mobile person with a high need for portable scanning then this would be a hands down winner for you. Get the wifi model you will instantly regret not having doneso.**Update**So apparently Doxie reads these reviews and they reached out to me regarding my comments. They are a small company and champion themselves on their customer service. After speaking with them they have assured me that they full well intend to continue making the OneNote Integration better. Some of the lack of integration is due to Microsoft and the way they do things. Which is believable considering Microsoft can be a real PIA with integration. Everyone I have spoken with at Doxie is unbelievably available and likable. I can stand behind a company that cares about it's audience and believes so strongly in its customers and product. They have been upgraded to 5 stars and I would move them higher if allowable based on my interactions with their employees. They seem like a genuine and passionate bunch I look forward to seeing what the future holds for them.
5,FINAL UPDATE: Customer Support worked with me closely to examine scans I had problems with such as lines on photos. They determined that my unit had a bad image sensor and sent me a new unit next day. I reran my original scans and they turned out just fine. So it pays to try to contact any vendors' customer care as sometimes lemons do leave factories. So I've raised my review from 3 to 5 stars as a result. It does what I need it to do well. I wanted bulk scanning workflows via onboard storage and expanded storage without having to have a PC or mobile device connected and sync on each scan. I also wanted cable free sync when I was ready to sync which is what the WiFi provides.UPDATE: I have to echo the comments of many other reviewers about excellent customer service. Doxie reached out to me following this review to offer to help and made some suggestions to see if my experience improves. I'll try the suggestions and post another update later. Just to clarify the reason I gave it 3 stars and not 1 or 2 is because my main reasons for buying was the desire for battery-operated stand alone operation without needing a computing device while "in the field." It also has a memory card slot for storage expansion. Even if I do need to get scans into my Evernote databases for searching I can do that with their iPhone App. These features DO work great. It's more basic features I've had issues with but will try some of their suggestions and keep you updated.ORIGINAL REVIEW: After a few weeks of using the scanner and the associated Mac OS X software I have to say I am quite disappointed when comparing it to the 7 year old Fujitsu ScanSnap 1100 (USB) that it's replacing. I wanted to be free of cables and queue up scans without having to have a computer with me which this scanner does and I didn't want to pay what Fujitsu wants for their wireless model. First the operation is a bit non-intuitive. For example you cannot scan while it is connected to a USB port. The USB port is for charging or syncing scans stored in onboard memory as is WiFi. You scan in a disconnected mode. The quality for both documents and photos is not what I had on the old Fujitsu with photos being especially poor. It's also quite slow compared to my old Fujitsu. And I frequently get lines like scratches in the scans especially on photos. So much so that I've gone back to using the Fujitsu for photos. It also seems to feed in crooked far more frequently than my Fujitsu. The software does support OCR of documents and a variety of apps are supported like Evernote. BL: I kind of wish I'd just ponied up for the wireless Fujitsu now.
3,This scanner would be a great scanner if the feeder would not jamb up on old photographs.  The photos must be nearly perfectly flat with NO curled edges corners or thicker than modern photographs.  I have thousands of photographs 50 years and older to scan and because most of them have a bit of a curl to them most of the time they will jamb up in the feeder.  The portability and convenience is negated because of the poor feeder.  I imagine that older photographs were not tested during the product development which is such a disappointment.  If all you have are perfectly flat photographs which are printed on paper from the past 20 years it works great but not on photographs older than 30 years.  Don't believe the suggestion that it works "if you hold the photograph correctly".  This is NOT true.  Regardless of how you hold the photographs if they are not perfectly flat it jambs!  This product would have never passed to be "consumer ready" if it had been properly tested!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 UPDATE 9/9/2020I was contacted by Doxie with an email that explained some things about using the scanner in a more correct manner.I have removed my comment regarding OCR. I have not tested the OCR but it has options to output  for OCR.I updated my rating from a 7.5 - 8 to a full 8.I got this to scan receipts. My receipts get all scrunched up and wrinkled and this little scanner takes them just fine. You have to be patient as when you stick in a document it takes about 1 second for it to grab it...then a couple more seconds and it takes it through.The interface design of the power button is poorly done - - I'm never quite sure if it's on or charging or what.The software is bare minimum. It often errors out indicating it is not connected like in the video short - but forcing through seems to work. It works simply and places it in a large window alongside other scans. There are image editing tools so you can alter the image to make it more readable as well as crop rotate and export it.I ended up developing a custom income and expenses app with the ability to take the scan made by the Doxie.Overall I'd recommend this to a friend for light duty scanning or road warrior stuff. A score of 8; on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is the lowest satisfaction and 10 is the greatest.
3,This is my first sheet-fed scanner and I got it in an effort to finally go paperless. It's a nice scanner and I appreciate the simple compact design. When not in use it's not an eyesore on a clutter-free desk (which is hopefully what it helps you create)! It's certainly small enough to be portable although I don't take it with me on my travels. It's size makes it very easy to pack away in a drawer or other small location– box and all if you'd like.One area it lacks is in its core functionality and ease-of-use. It's one-button operation still has much to be desired. I've had numerous times where it seems that the "simple" button patterns don't do quite what they should. I've received blinking "error" lights and a non-responsive unit. It occasionally requires me to power off and back on. Once you get passed the initial headaches (which are really quite minor) it gets rolling quite well. It requires a bit more assistance than I'd like but it's still nice. It also could benefit from a little more speed.Its free software is MUCH better than the device itself. Like the unit the design of software is very simple and I appreciate the sleek interface design. You simply view the scans edit staple ones together and save them out to a number of formats (e.g. JPEG PDF PDF w/ OCR etc...) There aren't a ton of confusing and overly complicated bells and whistles. It utilizes lots of drag-n-drop and visual editing. The OCR is a bit slow but it seems accurate and does the trick.My biggest point of frustration lies between the software and the unit. You can spend hours scanning and have a blast. However you have no way to easily monitor the scans. You either have to upload batches periodically to check everything (and confirm that it calibrated correctly for that session) or you have to monitor your computer if you're using the WiFi card option. This wouldn't be a problem except – in an effort to be "helpful" – the scanner takes the liberty of cropping scans for you. I'm not talking about the post-crop added by the software on the computer. That can be undone. The scanner actually hard-crops items by "intelligently" attempting to detect content to scan or not scan.It automatically decides where to start a scan if there's a lot of blank white on a document or photo. For instance it "trims" things that you might want like white edges around polaroids. Its edge detection seems way off and there's seemingly no way to correct it. I have documents I've scanned over and over again. If I want a portion of the document to remain but it sees that section as unnecessary blank space or irrelevant material it simple doesn't start the scan on that portion. There's nothing you can do. At best you can get creative by starting on a different side of the document but that isn't always possible. Even if you go in and remove the auto-crop features in the software portions simply aren't even in the scan. It's annoying.All this to say I have nothing for which to to compare the Doxie. If I end up buying another scanner down the road I'll update this review. I looked pretty seriously at the Fujistu series but they're much more expensive and – at the time – I didn't think the price justified the touted features. Now I'm wondering whether their speed and accuracy may be well worth it...Bear in mind that I've continued to use the Doxie and got through my mountain of documents in a weekend or two. Since then it still allows me to easily keep on top of new papers and other items. It just isn't as seamless and elegant as I'd like.
5,The first image (attached) is when I double clicked on the doxie file and made adjustments on the sliders. The second image was how washed out it looked when Doxie its own automatic adjustments. The third image is a scan from a giant relatively new Canon printer. Doxie is way more consistent with flattening the lighting of the image. 600dpi I was equally happy with. I will update after I finish testing the linework by bringing it into Photoshop and Procreate.May 2021 UPDATE:Doxie scanner was flawless on my detailed pencilwork scan. (Now attached too)GREATThe easiest most user friendly device setup I’ve ever seen. Interface instructions drivers. All so seamless. You can tell they think hard about their user experience.Packing friendly It fits neatly into the flat edge of my 55L backpack. High res. Meets all my needs as a location independent artist. Starts up quickly. Simple buttons.The bad  (I had to think hard for these)Can’t scan things that don’t have at least one corner (art materials). But customer service has clear sheets that enable those to be scanned.Once on desktop Doxie interface you can’t zoom into the image to see your adjustments up close. They're working on that.Always slightly crooked. No matter how hard I try to feed it. Not too bothered about that I just tweak in Photoshop.As far as touching up adjustment settings for pencil sketch linework the adjustments could use a wider range of values to choose from (Brightness & Contrast). Again not too bothered. I tweak in PS instead.Super recommend. Love this scanner.
5,Very happy I invested in this scanner. I bought this scanner for the purpose of scanning in old photos that I don’t have digital copies of. I hate the thought of not having them backed up and it will be nice to be able to send others copies of the photos. I was able to scan 837 pictures on the 600 dpi setting before the battery died. It is very easy to learn to use and very quick. It took me some time to realize pictures scanned straight more often if it bumped the edge to the scanner rather than trying to line it up with the side of the scanner. Almost every picture had a slight edge that needs to be cropped off (nothing terrible and I would rather it do that then not get the whole photo)After scanning the 800 photos in I noticed some of the lower quality dark photos scanned in darker then it should have I cleaned it with the provided cleaning cloth and re scanned it and some improved others I think were just too dark. I’ve even scanned in some higher quality images and they look great. I haven’t tried printing those yet and curious how they would compare side by side.The only thing that I think could have made it better is if there was a way to differentiate the difference between ‘battery is low’ and ‘insert an SD card before I’ll scan’ (the light blinks for both and I did get confused for a minute but eventually figured it out.The packaging is very nice and includes everything you may need (cleaning cloths recalibration sheet if needed in the future SD card scanner instructions charging cord). For reference the scanner is about the size of a 3 hole punch. Great purchase!
4,You've read all the great things about this device. Most of it's true.Here are the drawbacks:Unreliable feed. Photos need to be perfectly flat with straight edges to feed into the device reliabley. Anything else will likely require multiple attempts to feed through. Paper documents have this same problem whether wrinkled or not. Perfect flat paper documents require multiple attempts to get through. You will get the hang of it eventually but it's pretty frustrating.Poor documentation. It comes with a brief quickstart guide and that's it. It doesn't explain things like how to use the cleaning device that comes with.Software is just OK. It will import items and let you rotate and crop them. As far as being 'award winning'? Don't think so. If you have other tools that import and modify photos like Picasa you're probably better off using those.Battery life is too short. Half the usefulness factor of this device is the fact that you can scan from anywhere with no external power computer or storage. Yet after 80 or so photo scans the battery dies. So you better bring an external battery if you want to go beyond that.Update Sat Apr 04 15:11:05 2015I stand by most of my original review. However after about a year my Doxie no longer fed sheets in straight. It looks like I may have had a defective unit. I contacted support and they immediately sent me a replacement. Their support is top drawer and that means a lot to me.I also learned that most of their documentation is available online and does not ship with the device. That's appropriate as I know most people don't read manuals anyway :)One additional minor complaint is that the PDFs generated by Doxie are very large. I happen to have Adobe Acrobat and will generally 'optimize' the PDFs that Doxie exports reducing the size by about 75% without affecting quality or OCR. Not a big deal unless you're storing lots of documents but worth mentioning.Overall I'm very pleased with the device. I have scanned hundreds of photos receipts and so on. I use the included software to export scans to Evernote and save PDFs and images. It's much easier to use than a bed style scanner and makes it pretty painless to go paperless. If you are trying to go paperless I highly recommend using Evernote to store your scans. It's much easier to store organize and search your stuff using it.
4,I have to be honest here -- my original review was scathing. However something incredible happened: Doxie read my review and reached out to me. Not only did they refund my purchase they sent me a NEW scanner (along with a carry case some fun socks and a little basketball hoop). The customer care representative was beyond awesome and it showed me that this company actually cares about their customers.Ok so why 4-outta-5 stars? Because there's no way to give it 4.5 stars.The scanner is an amazing little thing. It scans perfectly and the software (once you understand how it works) is pretty darned solid. Making a .pdf from a scan is as easy as it can be. Honestly it's almost perfect except for one little thing: if the battery isn't fully charged it will not scan. This may not be an issue if you leave the scanner plugged into your USB port all the time. However if you're an infrequent user and the battery drains you have to wait until the battery recharges -- a period of several hours. If you can work with this trade-off Doxie's scanner is a total winner. Given the inexpensive price and the quality of the product I suspect most people won't mind this little niggle. In my case however the fact I didn't know this is how the scanner worked lead me to a huge amount of frustration and thinking the unit was defective. Hopefully this review will keep you from going down this path.
3,I think the scanner would have worked well if I had a newer laptop. I couldn’t get the software to load on my old laptop which runs windows 7.
3,Thinner than the original  needs to be inserted bottom of battery well to ensure it makes contact.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B6TIQBS?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
5,This scanner has been a lifesaver. I had a huge box of family photos to scan and using a flatbed scanner was taking forever. The Doxie Go Plus can scan my photos in 1/4 the time (usually far less) and the results are just as good -- and sometimes better -- than my flatbed scanner. The results are excellent with great resolution and clarity so any photo can be printed on demand with no loss of quality.If you've been meaning to start scanning and saving family photos or records get this scanner. You'll be glad you did. It's an excellent value.Here are some more details from my experience with Doxie Go Plus: I bought this scanner hoping it would scan clearly and easily. It's exceeded my expectations. I can sit in front of the TV and feed photos and papers through while I watch movies and shows. Even if I feed the photos through unevenly the scanner handles it well even correcting minor issues as needed.The scanner works quietly is fast to charge and very easy to clean after every 50 to 100 photos. (To clean out any residue or dust build-up I just run a small cloth-covered wedge -- provided with the scanner -- through the feed slot. I don't have to open anything. The process takes one second. Really.)I went through the entire box of photos -- hundreds of them -- in an afternoon. I had no problem feeding in thin Polaroid photos as well as late 19th-century photos mounted on cardboard. I even scanned some photos on metal plates and the results were superb.The scanned quality was just as good as my flatbed scanner. And I have the option of scanning at 300 dpi or 600 dpi.Since using this scanner for that project I've used it to scan my own drawings my receipts and old notes and bits of paper I might need to look at again later. Everything went through smoothly and the results were consistently good.Though I've used the scanner a lot in the past month or so it's still working as well as when it arrived from Amazon. I have absolutely no complaints about it and can't think of anything negative to say.This scanner has completely changed how I deal with paper clutter and it's small enough to throw into a backpack for research trips or business travel. I wish I'd had this years ago. I'm sure I wouldn't have as many storage boxes -- the "I might need this someday" kind -- if I could have scanned everything and let go of the actual paper.And since I bought it for family photos (genealogy and general family memories) I'm able to share digital copies with my entire family easily. No more worries about wonderful photographic images being lost or damaged!
3,I bought the Doxie Go Plus to scan thousands of photos that were taken by my mom so that I can put them online and not have to keep all the physical copies. I've had it for a little over a month and a half and I've scanned about 3500 photos so far (and there are still thousands more to scan). Most of the ones I've scanned so far are 4 x 6 with a glossy finish. Initially I was pretty happy with the scanner and if I were just using it for occasional small scanning projects it might be perfectly fine. But with extensive use these past few weeks I've become disappointed with certain details. I recently bought a   Flip-Pal mobile scanner         to continue the project.Things I liked:* Small device. I don't need to take it to places other than my home but I appreciate that it doesn't take up a lot of space.* Rechargeable battery.* Scans each photo pretty quickly even at 600 dpi.Things I didn't like: * Skewed images: At first the scans often came out a little (or a lot) skewed. I've gotten better at lining the photos up so that they feed in straight but sometimes it still comes out a little crooked.* The software. I tried using the software that came with the scanner but it tended to overcorrect the skewed photos and it cut off too much of the image or sometimes even made it worse. Instead I just copy the JPGs to my computer and edit them in Photoshop Elements.* Internal memory is glitchy. I found it to be somewhat unreliable. Sometimes I would scan more than 200 photos and then find out that only the first 130 or so were saved on the device. Reformatting the drive in the scanner fixed this for a while but it tended to become unreliable again after a few scanning sessions. At some point I started using a USB memory stick instead but the USB port is awkwardly positioned under the place where the photos exit the scanner.* There's a lighter band at the bottom of each image. It might be due to the glossy finish of the photos. I didn't figure out a way to fix this. There was some indication that using the photo sleeve would help but with the number of photos I'm scanning that doesn't seem like a good solution.* At the same time the photos tend to come out a little dark overall. Shadow-y areas lose a lot of detail.* When there are dark areas near the edge of the photo the scanner doesn't read it as image and can end up cropping off part of the photo.* The construction is too lightweight especially for something that's supposed to be portable. My boyfriend tripped over the plug which pulled out of the scanner. This created an almost imperceptible crack in the plastic and now the plug won't stay in (though it still charges if you hold it in place).I just received the Flip-Pal today and did some tests. I've attached a couple examples of scans. One shows a comparison of the same photos scanned with the Doxie Go Plus (on the left) and the Flip-Pal (on the right). The color is more saturated on the Doxie Go scan but there's more detail on the Flip-Pal scan. The other image shows the light band at the bottom of the image.I'll write a review of the Flip-Pal when I've had a chance to use it a bit longer but so far it seems like it will meet my needs a lot better.
5,I love how portable and user friendly this little scanner is. I’ve used it to scan pictures old bills receipts and greeting cards (sometimes so hard throw away but they take up so much space to keep...this was a good compromise). I took the Doxie with me out of town to help family sort old pictures after a loved one passed. I can’t remember how many hundreds of pictures were scanned but the battery life maintained the whole time. It made it so much easier to share all the pictures with family near and far.If anything goes wrong with it don’t be scared to call customer service either. They were great with me! When the Doxie arrived initially it was defective. It wouldn’t charge. I think it was probably just a battery issue but I contacted support and they sent me I whole new scanner. It got to me super quickly. They also sent a return label for me to return the defective one at my convenience. Throughout the whole process I ended up communicating with multiple people by email. Each one of them was super friendly and knowledgeable about what was going on. They even sent me a free gift of a carrier and some photo sleeves for the scanner after I took a super short survey once all was sorted out.Super happy! Great product and seems to be a great company too!
5,First things first I am a student and a scholar. I do a lot of studying and a lot of documents come my way throughout the semesters. The Doxie scanner is perfect. I’ve tried so many scanners but so far this is it. I have tried CZUR ScanMarker etc. and the ease of use with Doxie is where it shines. The app needs some updates and features BUT it does what you need it to do - SCAN DOCUMENTS! The feeding mechanism is flawless and if the edges of the page are torn the software fills in the hole.I would say apart from the quality of the product (the carrying case is really nice as well) that the Customer Service team is incredible. I feel like they are actually caring about my experience and the passion they have around their product is boundless. They make other customer service teams feel like customer sales teams. The genuineness and the cordial responses are what’s keeping me with Doxie and why I will tell all I know who need something like this to stop wasting their time and ADD TO CART!!!
5,I purchased this to archive a lot of photos that my parents had. Lots of photos. The first scanner that I received would not turn on. Sent it back and received a new one before the broken one was returned. Great customer service!  Once I started scanning it proved to be very easy and fairly intuitive. Scan to SF card out the card into a computer and move the .jpg’s. I scanned photos of all sizes. Very small school size photos to 8x10s. It even scanned old Polaroids!I haven’t started to scanning documents but I foresee no issues with them. I will update if I do. I really want to thank Doxie customer service. They have stayed in contact to see I had any issues. Very nice company to do business with!
3,Firstly I feel bad giving this a three star rating as it probably is a great product. I just found that it did not work as well as I had hoped with my Chromebook.In all fairness the company makes it pretty clear on their website that their software is not compatible with chromebooks but after reading some reviews and some Q&A's here on Amazon and the Doxie website I thought I would be able to work around it. The plan was to simply save the scans directly from the SD card where they are saved on the scanner to the Chromebook. (Side note: I did need to purchase a USB adapter since my chromebook only had a micro SD card reader). When I tried this it sort of worked but instead of a PDF the scans were saved as JPEGs which makes sense in hindsight. This meant I would still need the software to convert the scans. This would be fine for anyone who is just looking to save an image but I would love to be able to search within documents and I wouldn't be able to do that with JPEGs.The wi-fi version of the scanner might have worked better since it gives the user access to their web viewer (this doesn't do all the things the software can do but you would be able to save the scans as a PDF I think). However I already spent more on the non wi-fi version than I really wanted to. I am definetly not going to spring for a $200+ scanner.I realize that it was a long shot but I really wanted to create a paperless filing system without having to buy another computer that would work with a scanner. For those chromebook users who don't mind spending a bit more maybe give the wi-fi version a try. Good luck!
5,its a small unit and key is that it's a single side scanner which can be a show stopper for some but it does that scan very well and for a very good price. Has an easy single sheet feed with a latch to let you clear snags up to 600 DPI resolution syncs via cable or wifi which is pretty easy to set up. The iOS app doesn't support OCR or large batch processing but the MacOS client app does and both are intuitive and easy to use.. I've used these for years and have been very happy with the quality of this new unit.
4,For the most part does the trick. Lets you scan documents efficiently and completely independent of a computer.Scan quality is not photo-quality but sufficient for archiving documents (it captures all the fine print for example).The per-page scanning time is low enough that I don't miss have a feed-tray or dual-side scanning. My level of usage is probably 5-10 scans a week punctuated by 50+ pages at a time once every few months.Battery life is poor and will definitely die in the middle a big batch of documents. Get the AC charger.I found Doxie's status LEDs to be quite cryptic. I would definitely say there's a learning curve to the usage and quirks of the device.I had trouble scanning to an SD card instead of Doxie's internal memory. After I scanned a page Doxie would refuse to take another for 20-30 seconds all the while the green LED flashing at me (see "cryptic" above). I eventually figured out that this delay was from writing to the SD card. I have no idea why it was so slow and it took me a while to deduce the problem. I only tested one SD card so the problem could lie there but it's the same card I've been using in my digital camera without incident for years.That said scanning to Doxie's internal memory works fine and is fast. I was worried about how I would get the data off the device as I use Ubuntu linux and cannot rely on any manufacturer's software or drivers. If you connect Doxie via USB (AND turn the device on) it will mount as a USB hard drive and you can access your scans. For some reason I could only connect Doxie as a USB 1.1 device so getting the scans off was slow but overall it's a small complaint.Papers with crumpled edges or that were previously stapled will get jammed easily. Will require several tries. At the worst inserting the bottom edge first will usually work (though your scanned image will be upside-down).Will only scan up to legal length paper. I was hoping I could send very long receipts through in one shot but eventually Doxie will think it has jammed and reject them. You must cut them up into shorter segments.
4,I bought this for convenience. I have a lot of documents to scan and photos. It doesn't always scan nice and clear and I am a little meticulous about that.  It does scan nice and clear.  It doesn't do as well on photos but that's not is intended function. I would definitely recommend this for document scanning.
5,Great product. Battery life seems great too. Easy to use good quality.
4,UPDATE: I added an additional star because after I contacted Doxies about the SD card problem I was immediately contacted by Nicole who offered to send me another card. The card she sent was a name brand PNY so all is well. The company's customer service rocks so buy with confidence.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a nice good looking small and easy to use scanner.It can scan a page of text in about four seconds. And the scans are clear and error free. It does its job well.The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because the SD card that came with the scanner quit working after like five scans. It worked fine when I put it in the scanner. The when I put it in my computer to take the scans off it my Mac would not read the card. Luckily I have a few extra SD cards so I just tossed it and started over.It would be nice if they gave you an SD card that was actually of some quality that it lasted more than five minutes.
5,I originally gave Doxie one star and would have have them zero if it was possible. They sent me a used broken device in plastic wrap.I updated my review to 5 stars here's why. After I sent my review they immediately started a communication link with me identified the problem expressed their apologies and sent me a brand new unit with socks and a sleeve. It's hard to find fast effective and efficient  customer service today! I will be a loyal customer going forward and will order one for my son when he graduates in a few weeks. See old pic to the left and the amazing customer service to the right.
5,I was looking for a scanner for bills and receipts.  I looked at many reviews but nothing quite answered my questions.  I started out with a Brother but that did not work for me.  This one does.I had to change my mind-set a bit from the manual scanning I did with my multi-function printer.  At first I thought that scanning "offline" to a SD card was more of a gimmick but it is great.  Turn the scanner on and start scanning things.  Then at some point in the future you can see what has been scanned and deal with them.  Select the pages that are part of the same document and choose "Staple".  Then click "Save" and pick the format PDF PDF w/ OCR Grayscale PDF w/OCR B&W ...  Give it a name and done.  Close the application have it clean itself on close and it is ready for next time.If you have a lot of scans to deal with at once you can name the files as you preview and "staple" them; which is then used when it is saved locally.  (Sometimes it is the little features that make all the difference.)I wanted a new scanner to simplify what I was doing and I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary dealing with the scanning process.  I just wanted the scans and I wanted them with minimal fuss.  This scanner provided that for me.
5,I was looking for a document scanner to clean up my home office and to try to be a little more green. I wanted a compact solution that would not take a lot of space and also a fast and easy to use scanner. I believe I found all of this in the Doxie Go.First it's small. I'm not sure if it's the smallest in the market but it's definitely small and portable. It won't be taking a lot of space from my desk or any space at all since I can just put it away inside any drawer. The Doxie Go is rechargeable either via the supplied USB cable or AC Adapter. Doxie does not allow you to scan and charge at the same time via the USB cable but you can continue scanning while being charged via AC adapter. This though I think it's a very minor "drawback".In terms of document scanning functionality the documents are fed and scanned easily and quickly. They are stored within the device's internal memory. Once you are finished feeding documents to it you can connect the Doxie to your computer (via USB) and with the Doxie free application you can review the scanned documents select multiple pages and lump them together as one single document ("staple" option in the Doxie software) setup a name for each and finally import them as PDF into your computer. Once finished processing all scanned documents the software will ask you if you want to delete the document from the scanner or leave it there. If you don't delete a document and continue scanning some other day the document will be marked as already "imported" and thus helps keep track of what you have already processed or not.As for the company behind Doxie they are awesome. I must admin that my first device came with some sort of problem when feeding documents into the scanner: the documents were fed crooked very often. I reached out to their customer support and after some brief back and forth to perform some general troubleshooting they decided to simply send me a new one! I was provided a prepaid shipping label to send back the deffective unit. My new replacement Doxie works perfectly and I'm a happy customer. Actually I'm a double happy customer because of the product and the high quality customer service I received. I mean how can you not be happy to be sent a replacement for your deffective product? So I'm now scanning documents like crazy (and shredding!!).
5,Most impressive about this product is the customer interaction.  They initiated a conversation asking about my satisfaction with the scanner and then made suggestions to me about how better to use it.  The scanner itself is perfect for what I wanted - just to scan photos and maybe a few documents. It’s really fast.Feeding the photos takes a little bit of ‘magic touch’ learning. When the photo doesn’t scan properly it’s fairly easy to crop it as needed.  I’m still getting the hang of how best to scan review edit then save. I put a little magic marker line on the scanner for different sized photos so I can slide the little lever that helps you align the photos for scanning.  That might be a good thing for the next version of the scanner to have built in - slide here for 5 x 7 etc.  I prefer to do it all on my Mac while scanning so I don’t have to come back to the stack of photos to find the one that got away.  I will try to use the recommended ‘stay connected’ setting and see if that helps.I am the kind of consumer that will stick with a company even if the product is not exactly what I was hoping for if their support and customer interaction is good.  That being said I’m thoroughly satisfied with this scanner - and the team behind it.
5,Really impressed with this scanner.  Very light and portable. We take it to wherever the work is and sync to our computer or iPhones later using the included usb or wifi.  Really the only wire you need is usb for charging. Wifi works brilliantly.  Included software performs all the basics and saves in a variety of formats for import to other software programs.  Most impressive is the engaging support staff who have exceeded our expectation in ensuring that our experience with Doxie SE is second to none.  And that support IS second to none.
5,Works as advertised. I've scanned over 200 pictures so far with no problem. Resolution of pictures is great. Software is easy to use. I connect via wi-fi to transfer my pictures but you can remove the SD card and put in your computer to transfer as well. Small compact size fits on my desk nicely and I don't have to have another piece of equipment the size of a printer. Customer service is fantastic and they get back to you fast with an answer. Overall so far love my Doxie!
5,This scanner is perfect for quick receipt & document scanning. It doesn't require internet connection or cloud storage (which is helpful when you're in a dead zone). Great for simply keeping scanned copies of receipts for tax purposes.
5,The Doxie is a small Portable wifi scanner that easily imports whatever flat things you want to scan. I've only utilized the Scan to SD card capability so far so I cannot speak as to the WiFi scanning ability. I am sure that is wonderful. I have been able to quickly scan a huge pile of photos onto the SD Card then import it to the computer using the Doxie software. The images are terrific! I have turned on friends and family to this and they all love the simplicity and portability as well!I had an older Doxie scanner without WiFi that had an issue. I bought this one to replace it. I had no idea that the company's customer service was so amazing. What happened was they Contacted me to make sure I liked my new scanner and I told them about my old one. They helped me troubleshoot the issue and when it couldn't be fixed they sent me a new unit! They are so helpful and responsive!I highly recommend this product and the company for its Excellent customer support!!!
5,I was initially going to buy a Brothers brand at half the price. A couple things made me decide not to. First it didn’t seem like the brothers would allow me to transfer the photos wirelessly second the Dixie customer service seems amazing based on the reviews. They didn’t disappoint. I needed to talk to Doxie and they genuinely cared about my experience. Even though the doxie has some minor flaws (which product doesn’t) the Doxie team gave me options and even offered to send me some sheet feeders for helping with scanning any paper that is a little bit wrinkled. It’s great buying a product where you feel like you are not on your own when things don’t work as expected.
5,I had been considered getting a photo scanner for a while.I have two large bins of photos & family albums and have wanted to convert them to digital. But I partly felt as though some of the photo scanners are a little too costly. This Doxie SE went on sale for $150 and I pulled the trigger.I decided on the scanner partly for its portability ease of scanning size and customer service reviews. I absolutely do not regret my choice. The software has been very simple. I simply plug the scanner into one of my computers USB ports and then open the downloaded Doxie software. It's very easy to use and does not take up much space at all on my desk.I have also realized just how useful the scanner is for documents receipts etc. in addition to scanning old photos.  That really has made the scanner worth its price.Above all Doxie is a very friendly company. They seem extremely helpful. As soon as you purchase Doxie they reach out personally via email. And any concerns/questions you can be rest assured will be take care of without feeling like you need to jump through hoops.
4,I initially had some problems with the Doxie and gave it a poor review. The Doxie folk contacted me and helped me solve the problems. They were very concerned that I was not happy with the product software and their support and they worked really hard to ensure that I was satisfied. Now that I know how to operate it I'm happier. I think Doxie understands that their website needs a little bit more work in terms of explaining their product and they assured me they intend to work on this issue. Also as they are a small company they're not available on weekends but when they reached out to me I have to say I couldn't be happier with the sincerity of their response and how hard they worked to change my mind about their product (and they succeeded).Just know you can't call them on weekends but they will get back to you quickly on weekdays. Also you do have to decide where you want to put your receipts and how you want to organize them. Doxie doesn't do that for you so to speak.The one thing that would have given this product five stars in my book would be software that allowed me to enter in the amount of the receipt and to categorize the expense -- software more informed by the need to add up these receipts in their respective categories. If they could improve the software to do this it would be a five star product. As it is this is simply a scanner and a good one at that.You charge it up and then operate it without having to have it plugged in. You can even put it in your purse or bag and take it with you. It's light enough that if you need to bring it with you that's doable. I don't need it for this but I could see others might and that its portability would be a big plus.
5,I was really wavering on whether or not to shell out the extra money for the Wi-Fi version considering that it is so much more expensive.  But after reading that a computer is not necessary and the Answer above from Customer Service saying that integrated Wi-Fi offers a more seamless experience than using an Eye-Fi card to upload I decided to go for it.Should have done more homework. Sure you can scan without being connected to a computer but you MUST connect via Wi-Fi or USB to a computer running the Doxie software to grab your scans and save them or send them to a cloud service such as Evernote Google Drive Dropbox etc.Granted it's a great little scanner. Reasonably quick good quality very portable. And the desktop software is pretty great -- especially the ability to "staple" scans together so that you don't end up with a ton of one-page pdfs that you have to combine by hand.But I just don't find much benefit in the extra expense of the Wi-Fi when I end up sitting at my laptop with the Doxie right next to me in order to pull scans and send them to the cloud. Might as well pay a lot less and plug in a USB cable.Bottom line - don't hesitate to get a Doxie but don't bother springing for the Wi-Fi version.UPDATE: Apparent customer service reached out to me in response to my original review and offered a clear explanation regarding the language used to promote this product. iOS users CAN sync scans to cloud services without a computer with a phone or tablet app. Eye-Fi (a third party product) no longer allows scans to be uploaded directly to cloud services. And in my case they generously offered to make it right.SO if you want to scan with ease using only a very mobile scanner and your iOS tablet or phone then by all means check out the Doxie Go Wi-Fi.If (like me) you aren't an iOS user and don't mind plugging in a USB cable or switching out an SD card you're probably better off with one of their other products.And if you want a scanner that's going to send your scans directly to Evernote GDrive Dropbox etc... That's not going to happen - at least not yet.
5,I spent a few hours researching scanners and I ultimately went with this one because it was said to be the easiest to work with Apple products. It also checked off other things I needed like being small and portable wireless/connected to Wi-Fi and could scan receipts photos envelopes etc. So far I am super happy with my purchase. The initial charge did take a little while and it was a little confusing at first but I got the hang of it quickly. It's really easy to set up and the apps on my MacBook and iPhone have no issues.
4,Unfortunately didn’t work with the newest Mac update 🥲
4,It’s super easy to use! I have started scanning all my old documents that aren’t necessary needed in life but I wanted to keep as memories. I’ve scanned birthday cards school papers photos tickets event bracelets and programs. It is simple to set up and simple to use. At first I thought it was weird to not directly be able to scan to a computer and that you had to use the SD card. But honestly when you’re scanning documents for hours it’s just easier to scan and then insert the full SD card and drag and drop the scans where you need them.There have only been three problems that I have run into 1)some times if a paper is not inserted correctly there are edges missing or it has a yellow border 2) it only really fits standard paper sizes. I had an auto graphed flier that I wanted to scan but it was slightly bigger than standard paper size and would not fit 3) if you have an oddly shaped document (such as birthday cards) you have to put a paper underneath for it to actually scan
5,This little scanner is a workhorse. It takes up very little space on my desk and is easily able to tuck into a computer bag for travel.  The other thing that I like about it is it's fast! I have an HP scanner printer combo and it moves like molasses in comparison to the zippy little Doxie.  I use it to scan paperwork insurance cards and such.  I haven't done photos yet but will.  I haven't read the instruction manual yet (and usually am a manual reader) but I set it up on my own and it's pretty intuitive.  It doesn't scan duplex (requires two feeds) but does create a multiple page document and if you scan OCR they are searchable.  I have had a little interaction with their customer service and I was impressed. Buy it. You will not be disappointed!
5,I decided to make the jump to paperless this year.  I already receive a majority of my bills and statements online as PDFs but on occasion I receive a bill or statement in the mail or have some receipts I need to save.  I researched several options for a scanner and ultimately landed on the Doxie Go.I purchase the Doxie Go and was super excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately the unit I received had a defect and the power button - the only button on the unit - was getting stuck in the down position.  It was about 7pm that evening so I emailed Doxie customer service about this expecting to receive a reply in 24 or maybe 48 hours.  No so.  Sarah from Doxie replied to my email 4 MINUTES LATER!  She wasted no time in sending me a replacement unit which arrived the following day.  I was shocked by such a quick response but very appreciative of the response - it speaks volumes for Doxie as a customer.The Doxie Scanners are all single sheet scanners which means if you have a stack of documents to scan you have to sit there and feed it each page.  When researching my options it seems most of the scanners with automatic document feeders ran $300+.  For me I may have 5-10 sheets a week so the single sheet feed made most sense.  And the price was far below the price of the Fujitsu and Canon models I had my eye on.My only wish for the unit would be that I could operate it while connected via USB.  While I understood this is not possible there are times where I just need a single page scanned and need the scan immediately and scanning and then connecting to the computer to download the scan just feels that it slows down the entire process.  I've defaulted to scanning things in over the entire week and connecting toward the end of the week to pull everything off much like you would a digital camera.  But it took a while to get used to that idea.I would highly recommend this (or any of the cheaper Doxie scanners) for anyone who is looking to start down the road of going paperless.
5,I successfully scanned sorted and saved over 1100 photos in just a handful of hours across 3 days.  This device is sturdy and has caused me no issues.  I have mine setup where it connects to my home Wi-Fi.  The instructions on the website worked perfectly the first time.  The only issue I have encountered is when scanning 8.5"x11" papers.  Since it grabs the paper when it gets in position if you are misaligned a little the page will angle a tad bit.  It was NOT an issue worth rescanning the pages though.The team members are all so nice and considerate.Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
5,The Doxie Go SE is the perfect product for me to scan my documents for school. Education has gone completely online due to Covid and my scanner has been instrumental in getting my assignments done more efficiently. Gone are the days of having to handwrite on paper and upload shadowy misaligned pictures that I take with my phone. I wanted something small and simple to scan my assignments so I could type directly onto the pdfs. The Doxie Go SE gets the job done right every single time. I also love that I can "staple" documents together so I can merge multiple pages into a single pdf and I can do this all BEFORE I download my scans onto my computer. Living in a small apartment the smaller the better and this is pretty much the most compact scanner I'm ever going to find. I cannot publish this review without mentioning their amazing customer service: Doxie is a small company and they truly take the time to take care of every single one of their customers. Register your product when you get it you won't regret it. Senior product manager Byron truly cares and he will address and correct any concerns you may have which I will say are probably none!
5,This scanner is ultra portable and easy to use. It comes with clear start up guides. The software is also very intuitive. The scans of pictures come out great. The staple feature for multiple page PDFs is also wonderful with the same results as scanning from a top feeder. The company itself also is wonderful. Not that I've needed it yet but as soon as you register the company reaches out to ensure you are having the best experience with their product. So really tech support before you even need it so if you do you have no questions on where to reach out. Awesome all around!
5,I’m so happy to have found this Doxie scanner!Have so much paperwork especially since I do all my parents house & many many medicals. Also impressed how fast it scans! Cannot wait to be rid of all the file boxes & expandable folders!I was also surprised that Byron (Senior Product Manager) reached out to see how I was liking or if I had any issues with the scanner. He also gave me some pointers that I wasn’t aware of.Thank you Doxie & Byron!
5,I spent months considering a scanner for my real estate business. A portable mini scanner seemed like it would come in handy but I've come to hate buying new gadgets that will ultimately prove worthless and end up in the back of the closet with all the other stuff I thought I would actually use but never really did. I read hundreds of reviews and narrowed the search down to a couple of the "big name brands" and this Doxie Go DX200.Never heard of Doxie before but they seem to have a growing cult of extremely satisfied customers. Features like the automatic WiFi uploading the unique computer-free scanning capabilities and the diminutive size and weight of the device coupled with their growing fan base finally made me pull the trigger. Best purchase I've made this year. I scan marketing materials to show on my iPad 2 rather than printing hundreds of copies. I scan contracts. I scan receipts. I scan photos. I scan memos and meeting notes. I scan checks. I scan business cards. And they're all there on Dropbox and Evernote whenever/ wherever I need them. Amazing. Quick. Easy.I bought my Doxie in May 2012 and it came with a crappy sleeve (sorry but it is what it is). In June they came out with a much better case for just $29. I contacted their customer service and got a reply almost immediately. They have taken care of my minor complaint beyond what I had ever expected from any manufacturer.  If only all companies treated their customers this way.Also as of July 2012 they have updated their already fantastic software and have provided previous customers with a free upgrade. They have discontinued the crappy sleeve that left black dust/lint all over the white scanner a wise move.As to other reviewers complaint about the charging it's true. You do have to charge it before using it. (Well duh.)  It will only charge through your computer's USB which is odd but certainly not a deal breaker. The good news is there's no dedicated power brick to carry around just a generic USB cable. If you're a mobile pro you'll appreciate that.This is not a replacement for your giant hulk of an office scanner. You can't scan books. You can't scan tonnage for hours on end. But for the many times you wish you could just scan something quickly while you're away from home the office and your computer it's nice to know that you CAN take it with you.Five star product. Five star software.  Five star customer service. Very highly recommended.
5,Love this scanner once I got it all set up. Very powerful and easy to use. The images are hi-res and I found the computer app simple to use as well.My only negative: I had a pretty annoying hiccup when setting it up. On the instruction sheet included it was not very clear how to feed the calibration sheet. It's very important to know that whenever you scan you need to "pre-feed" meaning you put the edge of the paper into the scanner and hold it there until the scanner "grips" the paper then you can let the paper be pulled all the way through.Unfortunately the instruction sheet did not mention pre-feeding; I tried sliding the calibration paper through and my scanner promptly reported a jam error which could not be undone until I did a hard reset of the scanner (the paper-clip in the pin-hole trick). This wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that Doxie Go's troubleshooting information is so difficult to find. Absolutely nothing included in the package could be used to fix my error. Had to go on the website and find a well-hidden link. (Go to very bottom of the page click 'Support & Downloads' click Doxie Go image click 'Advanced Topics' then 'Status Lights') To the people who designed this product I really like the website and product itself but for people who need that troubleshooting help the format to research and resolve errors is not intuitive. In fact every one of these links evades useful terminology (i.e. "errors" "troubleshooting" and "help" are nowhere to be found)... perhaps because they have negative connotation. But it's very necessary for people who ARE troubleshooting experiencing errors or need help to find those links as quickly and easily as possible (if anything to avoid further frustration).Anyhow once I did the pinhole trick and reset my scanner I sheepishly looked up a video on how to scan with Doxie where I was greeted with the critical detail of pre-feeding.So my suggestions for this company are: include pre-feeding on your instruction sheet and make navigation easier for those seeking to resolve issues (if not simply including some troubleshooting instructions in the package itself).
5,If you’re a small business owner who deals with tons of receipts YOU NEED THE DOXIE. We were astonished at the simplicity ease and overall time saved with this product. We scanned about 100 receipts in 5 minutes wow! There were a couple that got ‘stuck’ but they were super easy to pull out and start over. I’m pretty sure they got stuck because they were not initially aligned straight when put in (operator error). The clarity of the images is PHENOMENAL too. Please buy this and save yourself some the time!
5,I use this all the time. Especially scanning phots
5,The Doxie Go can take some really phenomenal scans. It involves a little more effort but you can do it. As a whole I just run things through fairly quickly just to get them digitized. I bought it so that I could get rid of the mountains of paper I have to deal with storing for our home office. For this purpose it's quick easy and phenomenal. Yes if you're moving quickly the scans aren't perfect. Some are slightly crooked and the fold marks are noticeable on the scans. For my purposes (and I'd assume most people in the market for this type of device) the scans are great for digitizing something so you can shred it. If there's ever an issue with data at the fold mark just make sure you smooth it out/flatten it fairly well before you scan it and it comes out fine.I see some complaints about charging. I've only had this a few days but I've been using it a lot (500+ pages). I keep it plugged in to the computer as I organize my scans and it seems to hold a charge well enough to unplug and scan another 100+ pages if not more. I've yet to completely kill it. But if I did mine came with a wall plug charger and I ordered it off amazon. I don't know if that changed in their packaging recently as I see complaints of going without one.I do not have the wifi but I don't really feel like i need it. Plugging it in after scanning everything works just fine for me.If you're looking for a quick simple to set up and easy device to get rid of a lot of paper from your world... then this is exactly what you're looking for. I like it better than our all-in-one scanner as it's easier and quicker to use. Plus the portability is phenomenal.Also you can go to the doxiego website and download their software. I highly recommend it. The software is very easy to use and helps a lot with saving the files. It isn't like a neat receipts that organizes everything for you but I much prefer sorting myself anyway.
5,I bought this device so I could scan all of my daughter's artwork as a digital format and recycle the physical copies. Since she has started 4K we have acquired an abundance of artwork that I always felt guilty not saving. I purchased this item specifically because I was looking for a quick scanner that did not require me to connect it to the computer everytime I wanted to scan something. This product has worked wonderfully. The quality of scans is very high. The setup and scanning is simple. The software when you finally do upload the files is user friendly. I also received sheets from the company so I could scan drawing with crayon which should not be ran thru the scanner without a protective cover over it. I have not had any issues with the product but the company has reached out to me several times to make sure everything is going well. I recommend this product to all my friendw with young children it has been a great way to quickly scan items that I was to save digitally.
4,After a few uses the battery on my device died. I contacted customer support and they were super helpful and responsive! I got a new device very quickly and they were really nice. The machine is easy to use and pretty self-explanatory. I only use it once or twice a month for receipt scanning and the portability of the machine is pretty awesome. I recommend it for people who don't scan tons of things at one time (since it doesn't have an autofeeder) or people who need to scan on the go.
5,I haven't used it as much as I soon will. I bought it because my mom died of covid and I ended up with hundreds of pictures. Like she really had covid but the hospital actually killed her... so it's hard to think about. I'm 1 of 5 kids and I split up all the pics but I can't part with them until I make myself a copy. I think I'll make everyone copies on a DVD or flash drive. I have scanned a bunch already and it only took a few minutes. It's just hard to keep thinking about it. But anyway I love that it works and it's here when I feel like using it!
5,The attached picture is one that I took with my iPhone printed and then scanned with the Doxie Go SE at the 600dpi setting. The scans look great and the included 8gb card is adequate. I did go ahead and update to a 32gb card just in case. It's a one-side at-a-time scanner but the software makes up for it.The software is very simple and easy to use and you can save all your scans in several different formats including searchable PDFs. Once you connect it to your PC import your scans and it displays them in a large tile format. I haven't played around with it much to see if there are different display options. But you can select them and "staple" multiple page documents and it combines them into one continuous document. It's awesome.It's also wonderful for receipts. You can scan irregular sized paper like a long CVS receipt and it detects and only saves the irregular sized document. And you can save them and sort them as you please.Only drawbacks are that it is obviously a sheet-fed scanner. It has to be something that you can pass through a very narrow space. So if you're trying to scan brittle old documents or something that's been soiled or has adhesive on it you probably want a flat bed scanner.I was worried that I'd get a lot of crooked scans with this but it's a great sheet-fed scanner; they make it really easy to get straight scans with the adjustable guides. I won't say I haven't had to re-scan a couple of times but for the portability there's no better choice that I've tried.
2,When I first got this scanner I was very pleased with it's operation. Used it to help digitalize my print photos.Put it in the closet for about 10 months- tried to turn it on and the power light flashed red one time.Plugged it into a known working charger. Over an hour later it still won't turn on.Unacceptable in a product less than a year old.I would not mind as much if I could power the scanner from the PC or the charger.Bottom line it let me down when I needed it.I cannot recommend this device.
5,This little thing is a powerhouse and the portability is for real.  I absolutely love this and am really using this for all of my scanning now.  I've pretty much replaced my scansnap I hate to say because that is a great product too... but this is just SO portable... and not having to have the wires all over the place is just so fantastic.  I can just close my laptop put this on top scan the docs I need and then turn the WiFi on and set it right beside my laptop on my lapdesk... it's that small.  It's really perfect for my needs for almost everything.  Now if I had a huge double-sided document... I may take the time to break out the scansnap so I could use the autofeeder and not have to feed each page through on both sides... that could get tedious... but how often does that happen.  Most of our larger policy docs are all available online now... so this is all the scanner I need for receipts business cards invoices bills and other smaller document scanning.  I'm also going to be embarking on a photo scanning project and I know this will be perfect for it.  Can't recommend this higher.
5,I must admit I was skeptical about this little guy. The reviews on the Fujitsu were so good but it was really pricey and seemed more than we needed.My wife and I really wanted to go paperless over the holidays. The reason I decided to go with the Doxie it is that I contacted the company to confirm that I could return it if we weren't happy. They were wonderful on the phone and assured me that I had 30 days to check it out.It showed up right away really simple setup great packaging and easy software.Some of the caveats I read dealt with bad paper feed for paper with wrinkles uneven scanning etc.Well I babied this thing at first and it worked like a charm. Then I started feeding it torn receipts wrinkled paper etc. I honestly don't know what people did to stump this thing.So many ways to store and upload scans by the way....it's internal memory holds around 3000 scans...then you can add an SD card....then you can wirelessly upload....then you can hook it up via USB.We LOVE this thing. Battery lasts forever...teeny teeny footprint.I had a question about this unit and was put off because their customer support has you email them first then they call you back. Then I talked to Paul at Doxie and got such a high level of care....he even followed up to see how I was doing. A small company with huge pride. Can't say enough I wish more companies had this kind of commitment to excellence.One more thing-the software is pretty ingenious also...it asks to delete old scans so you don't end up with hundreds of duplicates etc.I upload to a Dropbox folder that I share with my wife and we both take turns filing stuff from there. We have one folder that we share with our accountant and in that we have more folders (Tax docs receipts etc.).The only requirement with this thing is that you should order a good shredder (we got this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QAQFFS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1#) because you're gonna be throwing away a LOT of paper!
4,Overall a great on the go scanner that is a breeze to use.  That being said it's not a scanner for everyone or all situations.  I actually have a flatbed and a Fujitsu ScanSnap 1300i for my other needs.PROS:- No need to hook it up to a computer!  This makes it SO convenient to use.- It's very compact.  This along with the above encourages you to use it and take it anywhere.- Simple scanning with easy to use  software- Slots for USB and SD card slots is very convenient- Battery powered with standard USB interface - one less cord/power brick to carry!CONS:- My biggest issue is that it's not a Duplex or ADF type scanner.  However this is to be expected due to its small size but it's the main reason I bought the S1300i.  I take the Doxie GO on my business trips and use the S1300i at home. Duplex and ADF just makes things SO much quicker!- Simple software.  The simplicity is great in most situations but lacks some advanced options/controls found in other scanners. It also isn't TWAIN compliant which limits you to its own scanner software.- Feed type scanners are not ideal for artwork/photos - they can distort the image easily with the feed mechanism and pick up dust which will leave markings across the scanned image.  This is why I still use a flatbed type scanner.- Feeding of small or thin paper may take a few tries to get straight.Conclusion: Great for people on the go or for light scanning around the house.  I'd recommend a duplex/adf type scanner though if you frequently scan large stacks of double sided paper.
5,I bought a refurbished Doxie Go and was incredibly pleased by how easy it was to use. After a few test scans to compare the results and file sizes with a few of the different options available I started plowing through my file cabinet of documents and statements. It's amazing how well the software works with just the default settings. Rest assured there are plenty of options for tweaking images but with the basic defaults and auto straightening options everything came out looking great. I didn't even bother with 600dpi 300 was more than enough for paper documents.The mobility is nice too I can keep scanning papers anywhere that's convenient until the battery runs out (a bit over 100 scans at 300 dpi) and then import all the images later.The support is just as wonderful. A few days after registering the Doxie I got an email asking how everything was going with the Doxie and if I had any questions. I noticed online that some older models of Doxies did not ship with a power adapter. Mine had not and I asked them how I could confirm if it was a newer model that should have. Instead of telling me this they just offered to send me the power adapter just like that I didn't even request it.When I replied to their offer I casually mentioned a 1 time problem I had where a few pages (out of many hundred) I had scanned didn't seem to get recorded in the internal memory after a couple of tries. When I check my email the next morning I found a notification that a new Doxie had been shipped to me a pre-paid return label and an email letting me know that they weren't quite sure what would cause what I had described and to be safe they were sending me a new Doxie. I was astonished at how proactive they were to make sure I had a good experience with their productWith this kind of support you can feel confident buying a Doxie.
4,Very easy set up - scanning in minutes after battery charged up.  I like the fact that you can scan docs without being plugged in to power or a computer.  I think the software is not “amazing” but I was able to set up a file system on my Mac that works. I did not try to move photos into the Apple photos app. WiFi worked but not totally seamless. I am using the higher resolution for photos and it is speedy enough for me. I looked at a lot of scanners and this one does what I wanted at a reasonable price point. I have friends who purchased $100 units and threw them away. This one is a keeper. I haven't tried to print from my scans but photos look good on my computer. My purpose was to digitize photos.
5,I am two months shy of using the Doxie Go SE scanner for two full years. It is a no-brainer for scanning small batches of documents and shall demand little to no maintenance over the years. I did not notice any performance degradation what-so-ever: the scanned documents are crisp and clear with vivid color.Compared with the wireless model the Go SE version takes no "maintenance effort": there is zero uncertainty with the cable connection. The import process is always simple as a two-step procedure: 1. open up the Doxie app on the computer and 2. connect the cables ==> Then I can discover all the recent scans from the SD card and import them all.While there are rooms for improvement for the Doxie App on Windows (small snippets of scanned pages and not-zoomable page-view interface) overall the interface is workable. A few principles that I now follow:1. Avoid doing OCR with the Doxie App: the quality is not comparable with ABBYY FineReader and may potentially halt the Doxie app altogether.2. Only rename the files *after* stapling them together. Otherwise the renamed page titles will be overwritten when there is a page before it.3. In short leave Doxie as a simple PDF producer and leave all the "after effects" for professional tools.
4,I bought the Doxie Go after researching several document & receipt scanners and after reading one of the many lifehacker articles on going paperless. I've always wanted everything in my filing cabinet to be within reach at any time and also be out of our spare bedroom.Why I bought this:  - To keep accurate records of large purchases made to improve our home  - Store and have more ready and accurate records come tax time  - Get rid of the piles of "too important to throw away too busy to file" documents and statements around our homeMy impressions after using it so far:  Setup was effortless and scanning has so far been as easy as anything. My only complaint is with the software because it's more like iphoto than document management. I need to review each scanned page make any adjustments then save it and tag it individually or as a group. This would be relatively easy if I just scanned one type of document as a batch (like all receipts from March) but I usually scan a few receipts scan a few recipes scan a picture... Then I literally go in and clean up and organize each file in dropbox just the way I want to store it.Summary:  I give this 4 stars because it scans and saves to dropbox pretty easily. 5 stars if there was a better workflow in the software and it scanned both sides simultaneously.I will tell all my friends about how great this thing is. You really can't go wrong if you have a small amount of stuff to process but don't use this if you have a ton of documents to organize and digitize.
4,I gave this a 4 because the quality of the scans isn't stellar (even on high res mode). But for most people it will be fine. If you're like me and you have boxes of your mother's pictures to scan this is an easy purchase to justify. The fact that you can just insert the pictures and the machine scans them automatically is a total win. Saves so much time!Also it's not necessary to use the Doxie software. Just scan all your pictures. When you're done remove the included SD card and drop your files onto your computer. Easy.
5,I've been so pleased with this Doxie Go SE WiFi Scanner.  Right out of the box it was nearly ready to scan.  The included directions were easy to understand and almost not needed.  The set up is obvious and simple.  The software makes it even easier to use the scanner to full capacity.  I received emails from Doxie asking if I needed any assistance and I did ask a question - how to move scans in software to prepare for staple function.  I've only used the scanner for old documents so far but soon plan to scan some very old photos.  This is by far the easiest scanner I've ever used and the most versatile for home use and portability.  Tech support has been amazing.  This company clearly plans on working to keep their product a success.  Before purchasing I read reviews on various products and chose Doxie for it's great reviews and some features that I wanted; being able to scan both documents and photos and doing this in different locations.  Saving and sharing scans is also super easy.  It's impressive and fun to use.
5,I love this scanner!  I got it because it was a cheap scanner with good reviews.  I had no idea how much it would change my workflow for the better.  You can't think of it as a regular scanner.  It lives on your network as it's own entity.  We keep it on our kitchen island most of the time and we just grab it quickly whenever we need to scan something.  The scan sits on the Eye-Fi card until you open your computer which could be weeks or even months later if you like.  Once you fire up your computer your scans all load automagically to the computer.  When you get around to managing your scans you just open the Doxie app and boom they're all there.  You can save as pdf save as jpg OCR save pdf color or B/W email or do whatever you like with them from there (or do nothing they'll just stay in the Doxie app).  So seamless I love it!  You only need an Eye-Fi card large enough to hold your scans until you open your computer the next time.  I got the smallest one Amazon sells (I think 4 Gig) and it's plenty.  I wouldn't wast your money on the larger one unless you plan on scanning for months and months and not loading them to the computer.  The scan loading isn't even limited to your home network.  I often will forget something at home and I'll ask my wife to scan it.  Within a few seconds it pops on my computer at work no drama.You need to charge it of course and that's easy enough via a USB cable.  We don't even hook it to a computer for that I just use the supplied USB cable and plug it directly into a USB wall adapter plug.  I just use the one for my iPhone.  Easy peezy....The only criticism I have is that it only feeds one sheet at a time.  I was hoping for an add-on document feeder but no luck yet.  It's an okay tradeoff given the Doxie's portability.Great addition to our home office I'd have a hard time surviving without it.  And I've almost achieved my dream of living in a completely paperless world!
4,Followed set up instructions precisely. My scanner did not work. It took a few days to get customer service to respond to me but after that they were very very willing to help. We ended up returning my scanner and they sent me a new one that worked. It is a good little scanner that is easy to use and set up. I am very happy with it and hopeful that I we'll have success if I need to reach out to customer service again.
4,Maybe the product was defective from the gecko though the first few scans were no problem but a few days later it became erratic. Some scans don't show up in the designated software (out of 10 scanned pages only 6 did) completely straight pages get stuck once the paper is returned the feeder was stuck in reverse for a couple of hours (no exaggeration). I had already given up but it switched to normal mode again.... until the next paper got stuck. It is so temperamental that it took me several hours to scan ten pages and then half of them were missing when imported to the computer. A fully charged battery lasts about 20 minutes seriously then it needs  recharging again. A nightmare! Customer service is terrible. No phone support only emails after a few hours no real help. Luckily Amazon is willing to take it back for a refund. I am done with this brand. Other scanners offer the same for half the price. They sure can't be worse. Maybe I was just unlucky as other customers seem to like the product but for me it has been nothing but a frustrating experience.This is an addendum and I am changing my one star to a four star review. The original product was indeed defective. Doxie management became aware of my review contacted me and replaced the item free of charge. They did everything they could (and more!) to turn me into a happy customer. The new Doxie works like a charm just as described and advertized. The product probably deserves five stars and the only reason I give it four stars is that I wish they had better phone customer service. I am very happy with my (now fully functioning) Doxie Go and I do recommend this scanner.
5,I am really pleased with my Doxie.  I have scanned almost all my old photos in a short period of time.  I like that I don’t need my computer to scan but after scanning I can either connect the SD card to my computer and quickly import them or use Wi-Fi to import them (takes longer).  I had questions and the support team answered quickly.  I highly recommend the Doxie for scanning not only photos but newspaper article documents etc.
2,I bought a Doxie Go SE Wireless and a ScanSnap ix100. I returned the Doxie. Here's why:Because the Doxie only scans to the flash card in jpeg format there's a required intermediate step to import the document from the storage on the scanner to the Doxie software before you can export to your desired format and location. This is annoying and super unproductive. With the ScanSnap software for the ix100 you can scan choose a scan profile that automatically selects the output format and scan options and location all at the time of scanning. If the Doxie scanner could at least optionally save directly as PDF it would be more productive. That alone was enough for me to return it and keep the ix100.EVERY page you scan is a separate document. So this means it requires the tedious extra step to merge (they call it "staple") multiple pages from the same document after they've been scanned and imported. This is especially tedious when you can barely tell from the thumbnail where one multi-page document ends and another begins. The ix100 allows you to scan all pages for the same document continuously until you're done.File size. The exact same document scanned with comparable color/dpi settings yielded a 3x larger document output than the ScanSnap. Plus the scans were noticeably sharper on the ix100.The wifi option seems like junk. It took forever to connect (if it would at all) to my home network. Establishing a connection took 60+ seconds before it would respond on the network and half the time the app wouldn't see it. Maybe it was defective because the ix100 (and every other device in the network) connects immediately every time. But honestly the wifi feature feels more like marketing gimmick.I also got spammed by 3 different Doxie reps fishing for feedback immediately after purchase.The ix100 runs circles around the Doxie in every way. Maybe if you're just scanning a few docs here and the things I mentioned are not a big deal.
5,I initially wanted a scanner that would work well for scanning a LOT of old 4x6 pictures and there are some good scanners out there JUST for doing pictures that are a little quicker. But once I'm done with the pictures that would be it so I wanted a scanner that had other functions and capabilities as well like scanning receipts documents contracts etc. for my business and just all around other convenient uses that made scanning easier than doing it on a bed scanner. This scanner works GREAT. It's portable you can unplug it from the charger scan what you want to the 4GB card that is included and then press the wifi button to turn on the wifi signal. This is perfect for my business partner and I because we are on the go a lot scanning paychecks and stuff. The scanner grabs the document and feeds it through automatically which works great for longer contract documents. Once the wifi signal is on you switch your computer over to the doxie wifi signal to connect open the doxie app that you install on your computer and click import. Something to note which I didn't know at first. If you push the wifi button on the back the front power button will blink white. I initially expected the back of the unit where the wifi button is to blink white so that confused me at first. I scan about 200 pictures at a time then connect and import. I accidentally scanned all of the 4x6 pictures in sideways the first time but the software allows you to edit and rotate all of them at once before saving to a folder on your computer.The included documentation and information is also very well put together and the desktop app works great for both my pc and my business partners mac. Overall very pleased and highly recommend it.
4,Positives: 1) Small size fits in a carry on bag for use during travel 2) Small enough that it sits in a corner of the office desk and no one notices that you even have a scanner 3) Very user friendly feeds one page at a time smoothly 4) Love the virtual staple feature where you can pdf multiple scans into a single PDF file 5) Nice doxie app for Mac OS to go with this allows easy importing stapling and converting from JPEG to PDF.  Only reason I took a star off 1) Does not support feeding multiple sheets  at a time and 2) Does not support scanning 2 sides pages.  So you need to scan one sheet and one side at a time.  but it is fast and good quality that for 5-10 page documents  it is fine.  For large scanning jobs with >10 sheets look for something else.  I find it a perfect use for light scanning (receipts bills documents photos) etc.  Also love the SD card feature for offline use when not connected  to the computer.  All in all great product and the price is tough to beat.  I previously used Neat scanner and I was sick of the the software compatibility issues with the Mac OS
5,And what I mean by "home" scanner is that if you don't have stacks of paper you need quickly scanned and organized then this is perfect.For my business I work mobile and on the go a lot and if you have a few loose docs you need scanned here and there like myself the Doxie Go WIFI is perfect. Especially if you work on the road a lot you currently won't find anything more compact and mobile on the market for those needs.BUT -- if you have a lot of heavy-volume type scanning and doc management / organization you need done especially double-sided pages nothing beats the Fujitsu Scan Snap which I also have but keep relegated to my work office. However for the days I work at home or mobile the Doxie Go is hands down the best I've seen so far. What's great is that I hate having corded electronics and appliances strewn about my home so the fact that this is CORDLESS and WIRELESS meant the world to me. It's something that I don't need to keep out on my dining room table but rather just in a drawer as it's literally the size of a rolled up magazine. As a power source it has it's own within the device so the device just has to be charged periodically; however it holds for a quite a long time I can tell as I've used this for weeks at home scanning a few things here and there per day without requiring a charge since it's very first initial one after the unboxing.Again if you have a business where you need to scan / organize docs constantly throughout the day this won't be robust enough. As I mentioned buy the Fujitsu Scan Snap for that. But if you just need to scan receipts and loose pages here and there and on the go the Doxie Go WIFI can't really be beat.Very happy with my purchase.
5,So far I love love this scanner....my mom recently passed away in December and while packing things we came across tons of photos some very very old.  Of course these pictures are cherished more now than ever and so I wanted was to have a way to preserve these and share with others.  I love that I am able to scan theses directly into my Dropbox.  In January I got the wireless version and it's so easy to use.  I did have a bit of a hard time initially setting it up to connect on my network but it was user error.  I didnt feel the instructions were as clear as they should have been but it was simply me not finding my network in the app.  I didn't click the right place.  I contacted support and they were very nice and helpful.  You scan 100s of pics in at once before transferring.  The only problem I have is because it is so easy to use I have a tendency to go a little to fast and don't realize sometimes that the picture was not totally straight.  Then I do not realize it until I actually scan into the computer.  Again this is just a user error on my side. I do wish that there was some type of viewer that you could see as the scan is done but since this is a portable device I'm sure that would probably be difficult to do.  I contacted support prior to purchase with several questions contacted them again after I got the scanner when connecting the wifi and then recently because the battery doesn't have a great connection when charging.  Every time support has been very helpful nice and has answered all of my questions.  They have even sent me a new charger with no qualms.  So far I am very pleased with both the scanner and their support.
5,Hello! Do you scan and shred? Do you try to be paperless? Then you have to get this handy scanner. My Neat scanner began to fail mechanically after several years of great service. I went to replace it with a new Neat scanner but it seems like Neat went away. Doxie was at the top of the suggested scanners on AMZN so I got interested. It was wifi! which is pretty cool. So I did some research. Turns out it's a pretty full featured well supported and well made scanner.I ordered and received the scanner. It came in great packaging! It came with a scanner cleaner quick start guide cables and other helpful items. Turns out Doxie is a super helpful and fun company! I bookmarked a website that took me through the setup by steps. It was fairly easy to set up if you have some technical knowledge.It's great to use! I can scan and store things ON the scanner. Then I have a ton of options to get the files OFF the scanner: WiFi via a connection to your home's network WiFi via a connection to the router itself usb cable and I can simply eject the SD card and upload via an SD card reader which is what I usually do.So far so good! They are a great company and super friendly. You've got to get this great scanner! Enjoy!
5,This product is great... very convenient. I did buy it with the Wifi card so I could transmit wireless.  Still not 100% sure how the integration works... I get it working but it seems like it is a little different each time.  I did buy mine refurbished.  It jams a little on the one side intermittently but overall for a quick scanning device I love it.  I keep it in the kitchen and scan my items while I do other things.  It only feeds one page at a time so I use a larger scanner for big items... Love it for receipts and letters etc.  I also send all of my docs that I need to the Evernote application accessible everywhere.  Happy with the purchase.  It would have been 5 starts if it were not for the periodic jam on the one side.. but I did buy it refurbished.***Update: 3/27/2014:  The company replaced my Doxie Go under warranty due to the jamming issue and it is working beautifully now.  Also they provided me with the instructions to link it to my Eye-Fi card and Evernote and it is working perfectly.  Definitely 5 stars.  Amazing product and amazing customer service!  I haven't had customer support that was so impressive in YEARS.  So now I sit in one room watching tv run my scans through it goes straight to my Doxie folder then I can hit send to Evernote and it's done.  LOVE IT!Eye-Fi Setup:  [...]Integration with Evernote:  [...]One tip I can offer on the Eye-Fi integration. In Step 3 of the integration of Doxie Go with the Eye-Fi card I kept overlooking that it said to change your "Eye-Fi" folder in the Pictures folder to "Doxie Eye-fi folder.  If the word "Doxie" is not in front the Doxie does not know to look for the image that you scanned.
5,After my first use of this last night THIS SCANNER IS AWESOME...DOES WHAT I WANT IT TO...I can see my scans before importing them into my laptop allowing me to delete them directly from the scanners memory if needed. I love that it has a paper guide.  My old NeatReceipts model #00346NEAT that I haven't used in a while didn't have this feature ...and half the time I'd be rescanning the little receipts multiple times because they would slide/be pulled in unevenly. I've been using flatscreen scans from my printer that I can crop with Adobe Acrobat.The feeder on this Doxie is much more tight preventing the slipping and thereby preventing rescans. Then it has an SD card option too (so I'll to buy one so that I don't need to reformat my older cards that still have camera pictures on them).  One thing I wish that it had but battery life probably wouldn't provide is a quick display of what you scanned just in case you need to rescan it while you're mobile. I bought this Doxie Go Plus because it had way better reviews than the NeatReceipts scanner of which I've had not the greatest experience with it including having to clean & recalibrate it fairly often. Hopefully this Doxie won't need to be recalibrated often.I wanted to get the Wi-Fi version but you can't get it with a SquareTrade Warranty. The Wi-Fi version had a Asurion/Canopy Warranty available...unfortunately I cannot stand that warranty company due to bad experiences with them causing breakage to a steam cleaner (after repairing it) and sending me two broken refurbished HP printers because they cannot pack anything to save their lives...plus the negatives I've heard about having Verizon cell phone warranties with Asurion as well as all the negative reviews about Asurion online. Buy SquareTrade....avoid Asurion/Canopy...yeah. they've changed their name twice (from New to Asurion to Canopy)...
5,I considered a lot of different scanners.  I do small scale watercolor at the moment so it's document width of ~8.5" is perfectly fine for me.  The set up took me less than 10 minutes.  The directions were very clearly laid out.  I tested 3 of my practice watercolor pieces.  The pages were buckled some because they dried not taped down to a surface and it wasn't the highest quality paper for these pieces but that didn't cause any issues.  The scanner flattened them out just fine.For mine I found I lowered the brightness and upped the contrast and they came very close to the originals.  Though I'll probably play around with it further to get the blacks a little more rich.As of right now I'm super happy with this scanner. I can store it when I don't need it then easily bring it out when I need a quick scan to prepare for prints of my artwork.Their documentation is very nicely laid out as well on their website.  I'll keep you updated as I use it more often!
5,I love that is is very easy to use and very portableI dont love that it cannot scan 12 X 12 size which is my scrapbook size
5,I love this little scanner! I started a new job several months ago and was tasked with moving the company's very outdated record-keeping from a paper system to digital.  This scanner has made my job so much easier.Usability:Setting the Doxie scanner up and connecting to my computer was a fast simple process.  Scans are clear and straight and the Doxie has no issues scanning different weights of paper even flimsy receipts.  The software while not fancy is easy to use and does everything I need it to easily sorting and combining my scans.Tech support:While I haven't had issues that required tech support yet the Doxie team has already reached out to me a couple times to check in and see if I had any questions about the scanner.  I love their proactive approach to customer service.I'd give this scanner 6 stars if I could.  It's been a fantastic investment and I love using it.
2,Often misfeeds and doesn’t pull a perfectly good 8.5x11 page through. Wifi connection is incredibly glitchy and frustrating I give up plan on using the cable. Desktop software and website provided confusing instructions for updating Windows 10 drivers that I ultimately gave up on before discoverring it was unnecessary. Sometimes scan doesn’t get but about 75% of a page because it cuts off the far left side. Nice looking product and packaging but I don’t feel like doxie was quite ready for “primetime”. That said not alot of competition / alternatives out there so I guess I’m keepin it and doing workarrounds. I seriously doubt that battery will last for 400 scans (wifi connection seemed dependent on battery level so maybe you could scan 400 short receipts and not upload them with wifi?) scoring you low on tech support because of the inadequate confusing unnecessary driver update instructions and low on user interface because instructions for wifi arecinaccuratecas well. (You don’t “tap” the wifi butto you have to hold for about 5 seconds to get it to blink white.) Do people not test their instructions on commonly held end user equipment... I just don’t get it. I mean surely I’m not theconly dude out here trying to use Doxie with an ipad2 or Windows 10 on an HP All-in-one. Why does this need to be so difficult?
4,Really fast for scanning stacks of photos and I rarely have to rescan them because a photo rotated slightly as it was feeding. I like being able to save to the SD card in standalone mode. Scanned image quality is acceptable. I find it a bit cumbersome to set the scanned resolution using the power button and it would be helpful to be able to set that in software. For the most part the automated cropping is pretty good although I quickly learned to review each photo should ideally be reviewed to ensure that nothing gets cropped out.I would prefer being able to connect to my home network as the default mode rather than setting up the scanner as a new network and connecting the computer to the scanner that way.The Doxie software does a good job of OCR'ing the URL and email address on business cards and creating clickable links. The other info on the card (company individual name phone numbers) gets read pretty well although if using to import into a contacts database you will still require some manual manipulation. Definitely get the Doxie Photo Sleeves if you will be scanning even slightly damaged or dirty photos or very thin or flexible items like cash register receipts.
5,This amazing product digitizes a photo or a receipt etc. in 1 second in either 300 or 600 dpi.  Incredible!  It has its own WiFi and the battery is rechargeable by plugging in into your computer by USB.  You can be watching TV and digitizing photos with your computer elsewhere.
5,I highly recommend this! The ability to just feed picture after picture (or doc after doc) through it is a dream come true. I was able to scan nearly 6000 old family pictures in just three days. The rechargeable battery last for 4-6 hours and it's incredibly simple to use. I especially like the fact that the top hinges back so you can clean the glass and the sensor and the rollers. That's important. The only thing missing is the ability to select between jpg and pdf while scanning. Otherwise it's perfect.
5,I've been using this thing for over a year and absolutely love it.Thanks to my Doxie I've backed up my entire file cabinet and my photo albums (If you have a TON of files it would be better to go with an auto feed type of scanner just FYI).My girlfriend thought I was crazy for doing this until the apartment complex attached to ours caught fire and we had to evacuate. It was still an unfortunate experience but I didn't have to worry about the memories and files because they were all backed up to my laptop and the cloud.Every piece of consequence that comes in immediately gets scanned and shredded (unless I actually need a physical copy which doesn't happen often). I never have to worry about finding a file anymore anytime I need something I just go to the folder or search for words in the document (the included software comes with decent character recognition for PDFs and many cloud services now automatically do OCR).The portability of the Doxie Go has been great too because it has a battery I can just set it on my coffee table while I should be spending time with my girlfriend and scan scan scan.One last note: I screwed up the initial scanner that I got by feeding something through it with adhesive. I was upfront about this and that it was a refurb but they still sent me a replacement unit -- even though I voided the warranty by doing something I was cautioned no to do. On top of that the rep was incredibly helpful with my other questions. They really stand behind this product and with good reason Doxie is awesome.p.s. if you're going to be traveling at all buy a case for it so you don't get it full of dust etc.
2,I wanted this so I could scan old family photos. Unfortunately the scanned pictures (even for new photos) was grainy and dark. IT tried to help me with the problem even going so far as to ship me a new one free of charge but the quality of the scans never changed.
5,Love this little scanner!  It's super fun and feels so futuristic to just nyoom your photos through it.  I've used it to start archiving the hundreds of thousands of old photos in boxes in the attic and it's exciting to see how many I've scanned without even realizing it.  The setup is easy enough and the choices between using WiFi USB or the SD card to get your pictures from point A to point B means there's always a backup method.  It's small and lightweight so it's easy to take to wherever you feel like working that day.  Photo quality is great for sending the 30 to probably 100 year old photos to my digital frame.  Also customer support is great!  They're super proactive in helping with their product.  If you're looking for an inconspicuous little scanner to get your family's history in a digital place for preservation this is the one you're looking for.
5,This is the first document scanner I've owned but overall I'm very happy with it. Customer service is absolutely the best too!
5,We are using our scanner to archive thousands of old family photos that we have accumulated over the years and turn them into digital files for preservation. Well I can't imagine the process being any easier. The Doxie is super fast and accurate. I thought this job would be a long and difficult one but Doxie is making it simple and easy.
3,The wifi functionality is not as seamless as the marketing would have you believe. It's still significant work to get a scan into my computer.- You have to turn on wifi manually as a special step.- It takes half a minute to get "ready" to transfer over wifi- Doxie app doesn't easily connect to the appliance over my home wifi. I have to repeat the above couple of times for Doxie app to detect the scanner.- And then there is an import step. It is not fast. My recent scan of 5 pages took a few minutes to get the pages in. It's crazy to me.In this day and age all of this is a bit ridiculous. My old HP flatbed scanner does it so much better - it's seamless and I don't have to do most of the manual steps above.This is what is to be expected of any decent wifi device today:1. Scan2. Open the Doxie app and see your scans there.I do wonder if some of the other wifi scanners are more seamless.--------------------Page management is equally bad:- I couldn't find a way to change the order of pages when combining them into a PDF!- No quick skimming through your scans. It takes a high delay "Quick Look" for each separate page to see what you scanned.In short if you think this "Go" scanner offers a quick seamless workflow I'd suggest looking for a better one.
5,The set up is extremely easy to understand took me about 5 minutes or less to set it up.  I love how easy it is to use scans come out really good.
5,I cannot rave about this enough. I have BOXES of old family pictures that I don't want to store anymore. I wanted to make the pictures digital so that I could 1) scan them and throw them away and 2) make them available to my entire family anytime and anywhere despite us living in 3 different states. Although this little guy doesn't have a "feeder" to load more than 1 picture at a time it's a billion times better than scanning one picture at a time using a traditional flat scanner. Very fast and once you hold load the picture into the scanner it clamps down on the picture and feeds it through. Although it takes a minute to get used to the software and how this thing functions it is not a difficult piece of equipment to understand. I saw a review of some guy describing himself as "tech-savvy" but was having issues for hours. Dude must've been dumb or drunk or both. I was carelessly scanning pictures 15 minutes after putting a knife through the packaging tape.
4,I bought the Doxie because I needed to start taming the paper chaos in our house. I would give this a 3.5 (not  3) star rating. It serves the purpose I wanted...to scan documents and whatever else I had that I needed to get rid of. Overall I am slowly organizing the papers tax documents and other "stuff" in order to get rid of the hideous file cabinet. I am also scanning those documents that "you never know so you better keep them." After the scans are saved I shred the originals and lessen the clutter.Pros: User friendly easy scan easy delete easy "staple" feature that allows you to papers together. Go anywhere (you don't connect the Doxie while scanning). You can also save them to your hard drive or other designated cloud. You don't have to download each scan. Doxie has a built-in memory that will hold onto your scans until full (although I never really wait that long.)Cons: software: you have to organize your scans. This might not be an issue for some but it was a little frustrating at first. You create something from nothing. The software doesn't help you categorize the scans (eg: tax bills etc) I overcame this issue by keeping with simple file names then I sent the files to the cloud and some to my hard drive depending on my needs. This may take a little bit of time to see what works best for you but I found the more I use the Doxie the easier it is for me to file/organize my scans.
2,--Update--> Doxie issued me a full refund and offered to send me a new unit.Purchased one in February 2015 to use to digitize documents though due to some issues below became the backup to my flatbed scanner and mostly used for business receipts.The device is somewhat temperamental; if your document has any kind of irregularity (a tear or a crease) using it it becomes a game of trying to figure out which side of the document to feed through first to get the feeder to grab it or not get stuck half way through a scan but that may be a common problem for document feed scanners and not limited to this unit though it became a major reason why I stopped using it to scan documents for archive.The software could be better it seems to be designed by someone trying to emulate old style Mac software running on a low rez screen and  left me frequently searching for functions The biggest fault with the software is with scan import; the software loads the scans into a window with a feature that lets you "staple" scans into sets (which is a really useful thing) however it will only let you zoom in so far and on a high rez screen it's not far enough to be able to tell what the scan belongs with meaning you're left to either staple nothing and sort it out later with a bunch of individual documents or guess what goes with what (which is what I did using the stack of documents I ad scanned) there really is no excuse to not let people zoom in more. About a year ago I stopped relying on the software to convert my scans to searchable PDF I broke down and purchased Nitro Pro and just used the Doxie software to group and export scans as BMP's for Nitro to process.The Final deal breaker is that the unit died what I consider and early death. Shortly after purchase I noticed I'd get an occasional corrupt or missing scan which I attributed to Windows weirdness. Late 2016 I started noticing windows asking me to reformat the device after I plugged it in (which by this point I was suspicious enough of it to not shred docs until after I confined the scanned). I plugged it in today in February 2017 the thing can only scan a couple documents before the unit itself errors out (flashing green "bar") and windows demands a reformat.I've probably scanned less than 600 documents in its life so this seems to be way too early for the device to be trash I could probably use external memory but it doesn't appear that you can "turn off" internal memory only that the device gives external memory priority; I'm not willing to risk it at this point.I really wanted to like my Doxie Go Plus and I liked the idea of it enough to keep using it early on but after researching a replacement today (something I hadn't really done when I bought this) it appears that there are other devices that serve the same purpose and appear to do it better minus the battery (duplex scanning document feeder less jamming) for the same price.
5,Can't say enough good things about dealing with the team at Doxie!  Had a problem with my battery charging but they took care of it in record-breaking speed. And then followed up on several occasions to make sure the problem had been resolved. It had and the unit works great. Nice and compact and so so much simpler and faster using this as opposed to laying out your photos to scan on your all-in-one printer. This was well worth the price and I couldn't be happier.
2,I have to say I am a bit disappointed and feel misled. On top of it the one and first time I interacted with their customer support was not great.The quality of the actual scanner is seems to be okay but the software is not good. It is essentially useless. The software for this product DOES NOT allow you to search in any form whatsoever your scanned documents or the text within those scanned documents while using the Doxie application. READ THAT LAST SENTENCE AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT!!!! The Doxie software simply provides the scanner to talk with your computer assemble in graphical form all your scanned documents and to "electronically staple" multiple documents into one file. There is not ANY search ability whatsoever.  In order to search your scanned documents you must export the scan(s) outside of Doxie. Search of those documents requires either the purchase of a third party's software or use an operating system like Mac OS X. I quickly realized search was missing and asked Doxie support to confirm and if it was really not available to give me advice for what software they recommend to search my exported documents. Searching for content within PDFs is a royal pain in Windows 10. Technical support took two full days to respond. Their response confirmed "search" within Doxie is not available and for me to Google pdf management software. Really? Thanks a lot for nothing. So at this point I have a bunch of scanned documents but I can search any of them especially those I have not specifically exported as readable OCR documents.Another issue I have with this product is it is really not Windows "and" Mac cross compatible. Their literature makes it sound like your scanned documents are easily accessible via a Mac or Windows but in reality it IS NOT. I guess the keyword here is "or" in their literature. It seems they very carefully crafted their message. Some very creative writing took place to say the least. You can not access your Doxie database on a Mac AND Windows. Period. Your database can only be stored and accessed via ONE operating system. Therefore you must choose right from the start whether you are going to keep your database on a Windows or a Mac machine. Yes I could constantly export ALL of my scanned documents out of the Doxie app but that is a royal pain.The bottom line is I just don't think it's worth anywhere near $200. The Doxie software is essentially useless! I could have used my existing scanner and purchased ABBY OCR software for $119 and be just as well as set up. Not sure if I am going to return the scanner. I like that it can sync wirelessly and it is rechargeable but is that worth $200? Probably not.[UPDATE 9-2-2016]Doxie quickly contacted me after I posted my review. I must say they handled my comments in a very professional and fair manner. I was impressed unlike my first touch point with them. Doxie this time provided a thorough response to my comments offered solutions and helpful insight. Although Doxie did a great job in their response it does not make up for the shortcomings of their software (not hardware) in my opinion. Doxie's recent communication emphasized they are committed to complete customer satisfaction and will do whatever is necessary to make their customers happy. Thank you again Doxie. Well done.
4,The scanner its self is what is described but getting the help to set it up is a different story.I wanted to store my documents and then categorize the documents so they can be found when wanted.  In order to do this Doxie recommends using a "Eye-Fi" Wireless Flash Memory Card and a program call "Evernote".  All three have to be setup so they will work together.  Call me a novice but the product is being sold to the general public not just to those who have done these type of things before.  Now I do not consider myself a "Computer Tec" but I have been setting up programs and using computers sense DOS so if I did not know how to do it I normally can find where to get that information.When I contacted Doxie and explained I was having a problem understanding how to make these thinks work together I got a reply that basically said where their instructions were and that the instructions would tell me how to set these programs up.  Now I have already explained that I did not understand from their instructions how to set everything up so I contacted them again and tried to make this fact more clear but again basically got the same reply as to where their instructions were.My son works in the computer field and he and I working together trying various things got it to work.My long winded point is that their support leaves much to be desired.  .
4,It does a very good job of scanning documents business cards receipts etc. and turning them into either .jpg's or .pdf's which can then be copied into OneNote Word email etc. It doesn't scan photos quite as sharply as a good desktop flatbed scanner... imho they're a little 'soft'. It doesn't scan directly into OneNote (including the 'local' version) Word Excel or any graphics program I've found because the scanner is not WIA compliant. Because of that you have to use the Doxie software to import the scans from the scanner itself into the Doxie program. The good news is that you can then crop brighten adjust contrast remove color and staple multiple scans into one document to turn them into one .pdf... which works brilliantly. Can you imagine doing all that with OneNote... no chance! The software is designed to import the scans manipulate them and turn them into the format you want to use elsewhere. OneNote will import directly from my flatbed scanner but as a graphic no opportunity to import them as a .pdf. I could use my flatbed to scan into OneNote or Photoshop copy the graphic into Word then print from Word to a .pdf. but the Doxie software does all that quicker and easier and at a reasonable cost. If photos were a little sharper it would be 5 stars.
3,After several years my Neat receipts scanner gave out and I decided to replace it with the Doxie based on the positive reviews. Mistake. The Doxie is not intuitive or well designed doesn't come with software that lets you organize the scans (you have to pay extra for that) and isn't TWAIN compliant so I cannot use it with my preexisting organizing software.An example of the nonintuitive design: to change the quality of your scans from 300 to 600 DPI you . . tap the power button? Seriously? When you do the power indicator turns from green (universal for on) to red (actually orange but you'll think it's red) which is universal for low battery but in fact there's no issue with power. Madness! The other major issue - there's no way to organize the scans. The receipts all just go to a holding pen in the software and then you have to take them out of the Doxie software in order to do anything useful with them. My old Neat software included OCR (it would 'read' the receipts) and a filing system I could sort receipts based on date store etc. and print lists and reports. In order to do that with the Doxie I have to buy 3rd party software - the one they recommend is $50.Also little annoyances like:*The scanner highlights wrinkles in the paper making scans harder to read (previous scanner did not)*Thin receipts - you know - like *all* store receipts? misfeed.On the plus side? The customer service is great.Overall I don't recommend.UPDATE - if you write a review of fewer than 4 stars Doxie will repeatedly contact you with both incentives and requests to change your review.
5,We recently inherited all the family pictures from both my wife's and my parents 4 big boxes of them.  A lot of memories and family history and need to share with three kids nine grandkids five nieces and all their children.  Doxie looked like a good deal so ordered it and was not disappointed.  I've already scanned 1 box of pictures with no problems and it is as about as easy as you can get short of hiring someone to do it for you.Pictures have ranged from wallet photos of about 1 by 1.5 inches up to an 8 1/2 by 11 inch which is pretty much the max. Several larger prints I did have to use my larger flat bed scanner and one I had to use my iPhone to capture but that was maybe four or five out of several hundred photos.I use the Doxie program which is pretty simple and then connect via USB to my WIN 10 laptop to import an upload to One Drive where I share it with my family.  The only issue I've found is that when connected to the computer while scanning I often get an error message that pops up after the scan has completed.  Not sure what that's about but it doesn't effect the scan being saved to the Doxie internal card and have not lost any scans as a result of it.I have no problem recommending this to anyone who like me has a lot of family pixs to import.
5,My Wifi capable Doxie scanner enables me to do my credit card report a lot quicker. I got this to travel with and also to save time running back and forth to my 3 in 1 printer/scanner/copier at home. This saves loads of time compared to all the back and forth!  The battery life is very good. Although I haven't checked the exact time it will run on a charge for my monthly credit card reports I'm scanning 20+ full 8.5x11 receipts and standard narrow receipts from restaurants and fuel stations. I may not charge it but once every 3 months or so. As far as the feeding process goes it is a technique you will develop. It is not difficult but will take some practice to get those perfect scans without the dark areas in the corners or blurred/smeared resolution in the scan due to trying to straighten while feeding.  Deleting a bad doc feed is easy so if you feel like it didn't run like you wanted feed it again. If you do get a black corner where you didn't get the feed exactly square the edit feature that enables cropping naming the file and some other nice features makes it very user friendly.  So run your single paper documents through (loads of them)  open the application on your computer connect to the wifi connection on your computer and download the scanned documents to the Doxie program. From there you can name them edit & save them to your desired folder. I'm doing this for a Concurs accounting report and it is saving me time every month! It is a user friendly scanner.
4,+ Software is easy to use fast and polished.+ Supports wireless modes.-Overall it was nice but mine died after sanning about 500 sheets.  That does feel like a lot so I'm not weighing that as much as I normally would.  The software was also annoying in that I could never quite get my ideal setup in play.  I'd have been thrilled if scanning a sheet led immediately to a file being in DropBox and ready.  Instead you have to scan it to a computer first.  I also was tethered to a computer for processing.  Before you can export to DropBox you have to launch the Doxie App and "process" the files.  This is where the PDF is created and the formats and various OCR options are found.  It'd be nice if this could all be exported and saved so that whenever I scanned something the Doxie would be send the exported PDF straight to the server which meant DropBox.  This would also require some change on the Eye-Fi side from what I can tell.My admittedly rare scenario aside it's a good product.  I'd get the cheaper one though and put some Eneloops in it.  The rechargeable model sucks for battery life and you can't use it while charging either salting the wound.  It also doesn't come with an AC adaptor you have to use a USB port or current USB charge from another device.  Use the money you save over the "high-end" model to get an Eye-Fi and Eneloop set.
5,Easy to use and very portable.  Smaller and lighter than I was expecting.  Very convenient being able to scan multiple items and save them to the SD card in the scanner and then import them all at once.  So far I would definitely recommend.
4,Everything scanned fine.. having trouble getting pictures to my phone
5,I bought this to bring to my parents house to scan all of their pictures. With 4 siblings we all have digital copies of the pictures we all wanted and mom cleaned out her house. She had boxes and boxes of pictures to go through. I would scan she would sort. Each kid ended up with 2 egg boxes of pictures of themselves and a usb drive of every picture scanned. Some of the cardboard professional pictures from back in the day were tough to get through due to thickness. Old poloroids are easier scanned up side down and flipped later. I will be scanning my husband’s family photos next. His grandma kept all the family pictures and smoked in her house for 50 years. Double bonus of smoke free and digital.I also have scanned all of the paper I would normally file just in case: monthly bills medical documents pay stubs... I love the staple feature. 3 front and back documents (6 separate scans) can be ‘stapled’ into 1 pdf document. We still have the same documents filed just in digital form and have gotten rid of a 4 drawer file cabinet.
2,I purchased this scanner because of the wi-fi capability assuming you also purchase an eye-fi card (I did). I wanted it to be able to scan day-to-day receipts and the occasional statements that I can't get online. I was excited about the wireless because this meant I could have it sitting near where I sort mail and not have to worry about having a computer plugged into it at the exact time I scan items. I was debating between this and the Fujitsu S1300i but this won based on wireless capabilities.First Impressions: It's nice enough looking small and slick. I have no idea why they dot the i with a heart... that feels so juvenile.Wi-Fi Setup: Not the most fun process but ultimately we got it working with the eye-fi card.Software: Their software is downright dreadful. It looks and feels like it was made in the 80's. There's a horrible icon on every user interface page with a scanner that has legs and arms... akin to the paperclip that used to be in Microsoft Office that they wisely got rid of years ago. And every time you scan something the software makes a noise that is the most obnoxious noise you can imagine. Granted we turned that noise off but why in God's name would anyone think it was a good idea to program in that noise?The Scanning: Difficult to get the paper to feed in straight. It's almost like the scanner wants to grab the paper before you've had a chance to align it. And then sometimes it wouldn't even recognize that paper was being held up to it so it wouldn't even attempt to feed the paper through. It's also super s-l-o-w if you scan at the highest quality. And seriously why is there no ability to scan more than a one page document? I absolutely detest having to use their software to "staple" multiple pages together.Scan Quality: It's... ok I guess. There are a lot of wrinkles and valleys visible in the final image.So after all this I was feeling like maybe I needed to give it time. But then I realized that it didn't actually transmit everything I had scanned. There was a stack of maybe 20 documents that I'd scanned and only 12 of them actually got transmitted to my computer. Whether that's a problem with the eye-fi card or a problem with the Doxie I don't know but I do know that it was the final nail in the coffin. I absolutely cannot have a scanner that may or may not record every scan. Back in the box and being returned.At that point I thought maybe I'd try the Fujitsu S1300i but was a little worried about it not being TWAIN compliant and then I found out about the Canon P-215 which is TWAIN Compliant and seems to have all the other features I want. I just ordered that today and it's on its way. So hopefully that will fare a little better than the Doxie Go.I sort of want to give this one star but I think I may have more strict requirements than the average person so I'm giving it two stars just to be fair.
5,I bought this scanner for mainly scanning old family photos. It works great! I’ve already scanned about 2800 photos of all weird and different sizes with no problem. This is a time consuming task in general because of the amount of photos that I have but 100% worth it to do once to digitize the family photos for each member of my family. The scanner is user friendly crops everything perfectly and the Doxie software works super well with my MacBook Pro. Doxie’s customer service via email and phone is 10/10 if you have any questions. I spoke with Byron who gave me a few suggestions to help with my photo/letter scanning. If you are serious about having good quality scans of your family photos that you can create .jpeg instead of just taking pictures with your camera on your phone with the glare and funky angles then I highly recommend this scanner to get the job done.
4,A friend recommended the Doxie Go SE as an excellent small lightweight scanner to take on work trips.  It is exactly that and more - good at home as well and visually pleasing for any room.  The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because the photos scanned are not top-notch.
5,Used this product a few times now and I love it. Glad I made the purchase. It will remain one of the few items that I keep.
5,I picked this up after hearing about it on the Minimalists podcast.  This is a great way to start going digital streamline my life and jettison detritus so I can focus on the things that matter.Great scanner sleek portable and intuitive.  I like it a lot and recommend it to my friends.  And I recommend it to you as well.  Don't hesitate to pick one up.
5,This has been one of the very few product that if NOT for customer service I will stay away and discourage people to try them. Like any other brands there's you may run to some issues but once you raise them their support are proactive and will never stop until the problem is fix or they will replace it. I love the minimalist style.Update: April 9 2022Only use it once. Now that I am planning to start scanning again (paper receipt) It keeps FLASHING GREEN. So I tried to charge with no luck. I spend more time finding a way to make it work such as browsing YouTube and Google hoping to run into some advice or tips that will resolve this issue.
4,The first thing I would like to note is this is a portable scanner. It doesn't scan if it's plugged into your computer only charges and transfers files. It is convenient if you have to scan documents or just simply want to go paperless while you're on the go. The only things I don't really like all that much about it are sometimes I like to preview my scan before I save it because things don't always scan the right way you're not able to with this. You have to scan all of your documents and plug the scanner into the computer then import your scans and then you can see how they turned out. This can be time consuming if you have to re scan something because you would need to unplug the scanner scan your document again then plug it in and wait for your document to import. The other thing I have noticed is it seems to take a while to charge and the battery doesn't seem to last very long when scanning. One last thing that I don't really like is that you can't scan front and back. You have to scan one side then feed it trough again to get the other side. This again can be time consuming. Gripes aside if you need a scanner on the go want to go paperless and back up in the cloud. This is a great solution and a decent price. Much better than Neat but not perfect. Thank you for reading.
4,Before I bought I compared to a few other scanners and here are the issues that were important to me:Doxie: internal storage (no computer needed) 300/600dpi can work wirelessly download and review with eye-fi card worldwide adapters included lightweight (negative:no duplex function)Canon: duplex review can download to google docsFujitsu ScanSnap S1100: 600dpi (redness issues)Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300: duplex 300/600dpiI needed a portable scanner for travel to scan relatives' photos for our family tree. The Doxie was perfect for my needs. Very easy to use. The main negatives for me were that most of my scans came out a bit misaligned (but none were distorted and none had artifacts) but I can edit them with Corel if I really need to. I really appreciated the adapter kit as well which I think used to be sold separately but was included. You don't need to worry about the battery life (lasts for about 100 photos at 600 dpi) if you have an outlet no problem plugging it into the power outlet while scanning. With the extra purchase of the eye-fi card this scanner is super slick. You can review/download scans even on your phone with that card (and on your computer too with the eye-fi prox2).  This is like an Apple product super smooth and attractive.Wishes: Better alignment and better carrying case that would protect the power button from being pushed during transport. I recommend keeping the original box for transport or something rigid.
5,Scanned 5000 photos. I’m not much for reading directions so just jumped in and started using. I connected it to the computer  for power via USB and loaded software. As I scanned the first few pics I was expecting to see pics on the computer as they scanned. There may be a good way to do this while connected to the computer but I found it was opening media programs that just slowed the whole process down. So I disconnected from computer and connected to An outlet for my power. A lot of the time I just operated off the battery. I scanned 5000 photos intermittently over a month  averaging around 7 photos per min.After every  couple of hundred scanned I would upload pics from SD card onto my computer. Perhaps this is the preferred or even recommended way to do this but as I said I did not read directions. I also backed up photos to the cloud.Great little device.
5,Absolutely love my new Doxie Go Plus! I requested and received this as a birthday gift and couldn't be happier. I am using it to scan boxes of photos that were never put in albums (back in the day). Most of these are just family snapshots and I'm satisfied with the quality of scans. The fact that I'm able to do this incredibly fast WHILE I watch TV or visit is an incredible plus. I have not had any real problems with items not feeding straight - any slightly askew photos have been fixed quickly and easily with the Doxie software [well done folks!].When I've whittled these photos down I'll tackle all the lingering non-essential paper in my office. I maintain or assist with maintaining  records for several family members who are unable to do so on their own. I plan to scan as much as I can so that it's accessible just not cluttering my office. DoxieGo Plus and Evernote look to be a formidable team in the paper battle!I have not yet used my EyeFi card with the DoxieGo Plus but that's also on the list. It just hasn't been enough trouble copying from my (plain) SD card to my computer to warrant taking time for setup yet.Reviews here were a strong reason I chose the DoxieGo - and I'm glad I did. It hasn't left the house yet but it's toured several rooms where I happily scanned - and been hijacked a couple of times by my spouse!  If you are sitting on the fence on this one I can join the chorus of those saying you won't be disappointed.
5,The Doxie works great and the software is easy to use.
5,Say goodbye to your bulky fax/scanners the Doxie is here.  I have been using my Doxie for years.  Top notch piece of equipment that has changed how I function in my office.  Whether it is one piece of paper or 50 pages this little guy will do the job and do it perfectly!  I have also used it for scanning photos.  Intuitive and easy to use!  Saves me a ton of time.I have only had to reach out to the company one time due to the fact that I kept ignoring the update reminders.  Incredible tech support and customer service.  Wishing all companies operated the way Doxie does.  Doxie truly appreciates and cares about their customers.  Personal great communications.  I will continue to support this company by using and recommending their products.
4,We purchased the Doxie Go Wi-Fi to declutter our filing cabinets.  We use this on a regular basis to scan everything from receipts to full blown documents.  Our main reasons for choosing the Doxie were it's wifi capability and low profile.  This scanner does not take up a lot room and isn't an eyesore like others I have seen.  It is convenient to use and I have personally done a lot of scanning to Evernote and Dropbox with no issues.  This is not a scanner for someone who needs to scan hundreds of pages at once.  You can only scan one page at a time but there is a "staple" feature in the Doxie program that allows you to merge multiple scans into one file or document.Pros:  Small size stylish design easy to use wifi enabled scan capability while plugged in or not works with Dropbox staple feature for multiple page scansCons:  The feeding system has gotten touchy after use it sometimes will not feed the document through even when the paper is in perfect condition. The wifi can be touchy when connecting using different computers.Overall this is a great buy.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to the issues we've experienced with the document feeder.
5,I am not complaining but I have 14 rental houses and a farming operation.  I am constantly buying things for my rentals and in our little town that only leaves the large retailer that starts with a W.  Since they do their checks electronically now I have no way on knowing which house it is for since I have no check or no memo line.  I just bought this scanner and started on my taxes.  Big box of W receipts that I had written the address of house on the back----what a mess.  I wrote the address big on the front circled the deductible items and slipped it thru the Doxie and right into the trash can.  Used Dropbox each house has its own folder then drug from Doxie and put into folder.  I have it all on computer and then burned a disk for back up.  NO MORE BAGS OF LITTLE BITTY WRINKLED RECEIPTS.  Everything for the tax year is now recorded and I have a secure image.  Every scrap of paper is now run thru the Doxie and into the trash.  This exceeded my expectations in the amount of times I would use this scanner.I am a 65 yr old woman who has no tech savvy.  I just try to ride herd on all of these I toys I have but the Doxie was plug and use-----and it doesn't need one of those d*** screen protectors.  Happy Happy Happy with my DoxieFirst off I am not a tech savvy woman I just do my best to ride herd on all of these toys I have.
5,I bought it to scan several boxes of old photos which it got through easily.  It is easy to use does a good job and allows me to put each scan in the place where I want it.  When it is scanning it scans to a memory card which comes with the unit then you can import a bunch of scans into your computer and then save all or each one individually wherever you want it.  It's easy to darken the page of a scan slightly and increase the contrast to make it more readable although the software doesn't do any color correction.A happy surprise was that if I scan a multi-page document "staple" the pages together in the software and save that as a PDF it saves as a multi-page PDF without extra work.
5,12/29/14 I've updated my rating due to the excellent customer service I received from Doxie. I'll leave the review below but I just got a bad unit. It happens and Doxie went well out of their way to make sure I was happy. They turned a dissatisfied customer into a loyal one.-----------------------------------------------I'm not going to go into what this does I'm going to cut to the chase and tell you why the Doxie drives my insane.1) The feeder is hyper sensitive. If there is any sort of  defect on the edge of the paper you are trying to feed it will pull it through on one side only. I have to try everything multiple times to get it to scan straight.2) My unit did not come with an AC adapter so I'd use a USB wall charger to charge. The battery life has just gotten worse and worse to the point where I could scan 2 pieces of paper before it died. I contacted Doxie they recommended I buy the wall charger. So I did. I just left it charging on AC overnight. Went to scan today - 2 scans and it died again. To be productive at all I have to leave it plugged in which defeats the whole purpose of this thing. Based on the reviews I assume I have a Doxie with a defective battery. But all I can base my review on is my experience.At work I use a Fujitsu ScanSnap. It's not rechargeable but it has not given me the headaches the Doxie has.
5,This scanner has proven to be one of my best purchases in a long time! It is super convenient and easy to use. I've been able to work my way through boxes upon boxes of photos and greeting cards. My next project will be getting through all our documents. It's so fast and easy that I can simply scan a few things as I walk by instead of having to take on a long time-consuming project. The scans are good and the import process is very straightforward. As an added bonus customer service is amazing. I had one minor issue (which ended up being user error anyways) and they were fast to respond then even followed up to make sure everything was running smoothly. I would 100% purchase this again.
5,I've been into Minimalism for coming up on 9 years - always still had some papers sorted into a filing folder and tucked away "just in case" - never had enough though to warrant a $150+ purchase of a scanner. Well turns out it is way more handy that I first imagined. I of course scanned the hell out of that filing-folder-pile (maybe 100-150 pages total) on the first day when this Doxie arrived.. then I looked around and asked "what else needs scanning?!"I found myself able to scan printed photos and make sufficient digital copies to send to friends or to just keep as backups. I realized I could download forms fill them out scan them and send them back all in one swift go.But the biggest boon that I didn't see coming: friends and family benefit from this tool as well. Because the included MicroSD card is 8gb and the battery holds a huge charge for weeks on end - I have been able to just take my Macbook Air and my Doxie scanner to friends houses and scan things for them staple the files into PDFs or JPGs or whatever I want using the great software (also free) and then hand them a simpler life. Boom.Would definitely recommend. If you actually use this tool it can improve your life.
5,I first heard about Doxie from The Minimalists.  My hubby set it up for me but he didn't complain so I assume the set up was pretty easy.  Using it is a breeze.  I've been working on scanning all our printed photos and all our documents and it is amazing how fast they scan.  I can then upload them to my computer and save them in different formats and to the file of my choice.  My hubby loves that it came with an SD card and he didn't have to hunt one down.  The people at the company are very friendly and helpful and have a superior customer service that is rare these days.  I have had other scanners in the past but nothing compares to my Doxie.
5,I have to say that Doxie Go is a great little product.  It's very timely in my life too as a Gen Y going into career mode I find that I need to go paperless to push insanity to my older years.  I can't handle the paper load onslaught that I get barraged with daily.  Every night I scan paper and recycle it.  Doxie's interface is clean - I leave it plugged it and use the SD card to transfer the paperwork.Historically scanning was cumbersome and prone to failure.  I have been toying for multifunction units since I was a child.  They have been all bad and still mostly are.  I have never had the ADF feature to work on these units.  The end result was spending 5 minutes for something which should take 5 seconds.Recent update to 2.1 allows you to OCR but I find OCR to be slow (my notebook has 8GB of RAM is a few years old).  OCR is great and works for the most part.  You can keep files in the Doxie app until you are ready to spend time properly exporting them.  Doxie knows you probably like PDF and if you need JPEG it is great for that too.  These days I am scanning and depositing checks online so I don't even visit a bank or ATM with Doxie by my side - it's a result of our credit card life.Perhaps the greatest part of Doxie is a little feature called "staple" which lets you combine scans into one exportable document.  It's beautiful.  Doxie + EyeFi sounds like a good paring as well and the manual says it is compatible.
4,I purchased one of these scanners to keep track of important receipts mail bills etc.  It's easy to use and gets the job done without to many problems.  There's very little set-up required...basically you pull it out of the box and follow a few calibration steps and you're good to start scanning.The Doxie software is pretty straightforward: plug the scanner into your computer using the included USB cable and click import.  You'll then be given options to edit your scans combine several of them together and save them in a few different file formats (PDF JPEG etc.).The only downsides on this unit I've noted so far are that it's difficult to feed a document through straight (especially long store receipts).  It's easy enough to fix the scans after they've been imported into the Doxie software but it can be a pain.  Other than that I wish there was a way to note that multiple pages were part of the same document on the unit rather than having to combine them in the Doxie software.  It would also be great if there was a way to automatically scan two sided stuff but considering the cost of this unit that's asking for a lot.Overall it does a good job and I'd probably buy it again.
5,A friend of mine recommended this scanner so I did a little bit of research (had a Chromebook when I first purchased it then switched over to a MacBook Air). It was super easy to use with my Chromebook - just scanned the papers plugged the Doxie into my laptop titled my scans saved to Drive. Customer service was quick to respond to my questions (wasn't able to access the staple feature on a Chromebook) and when I moved over to a MacBook they sent me the cord to plug Doxie in. I even scheduled a call with tech support to walk me through using the staple feature how to save scans from my new laptop. I'm on the road to becoming paperless and love that this scanner is so small for easy stow-away.
5,The Doxie scanner works as advertised and makes quick scanning efficient and dependable. It sets up straight from the box quickly and easily enough I was up and scanning within minutes. Naming files "stapling" individual items (one of my favorite features) and uploading to the cloud or a directory is a few mouse clicks away. I've already scanned hundreds of documents cards receipts invoices and photos with ease and precision.Double-sided scanning would be a nice addition but for the price I paid for Doxie I can happily turn the page. This packs easily in my briefcase and will scan without the need of connecting my laptop.Doxie is by far the best scanner for people on the go who need portability speed and convenience. I've become a fan!
5,I have thirty years' worth of photos in boxes in my basement. Years ago I started scanning them using my printer/ scanner. That took FOREVER so I stopped. I recently bought a digital frame and wanted to add those old photos but I knew I did not have the time or patience to deal with the old printer. Enter the Doxie Go SE. This lightweight portable scanner ZIPPED through my old photos. The scanner is super easy to use and scans photos within seconds. Once they were scanned to the SD card I easily uploaded them to my laptop and downloaded them to the frame The quality of the photos was fantastic. Now I plan to scan photos for my parents and my mother-in-law and to go paperless by scanning old documents. Don't hesitate. Get this scanner!
5,Recently I had to review thousands of documents in an environment that had zero technology not even a copy machine.  I was able to successfully whip the scanner out of my purse connect it to wi-fi and there they all were - more than 200 pages of 20-year old documents they I needed the most sitting in the cloud and easily downloadable.  It is a lifesaver.
2,When moving into a very small house I was going to "Go Paperless" to try to keep clutter to a minimum. Doxie seemed to be the only way to go it looks cool it's "Wireless" it has OCR and the necessary Evernote integration. Lifehacker recommended this product so it must be awesome.It's really not.Wireless: It is literally a "wireless scanner" in that there are no wires used while scanning. But you will have to plug in the USB to get to your photos or purchase the Eye-Fi card to have the photos transferred to your computer. It will not act as a wired scanner even while plugged into your computer. So you can wirelessly scan your papers in the kitchen then go to your desk to plug it in but if you have a laptop you couldn't just plug it in and start scanning. It is a 'wireless' scanner after all you must scan wirelessly.Scanning: you have to be quite careful to get a good scan. Legal sized documents with folds are particularly troublesome. After a bit of a learning curve you can get a decent scan 7 times out of 10.Evernote integration: until October 2014 it was possible to scan wirelessly having all of your documents appear directly to Evernote without a computer acting as a base station. Eye-Fi has removed this integration so now you are stuck manually importing your scans using the Doxie application on your computer. Which brings me to my next point.Doxie "strongly suggests that you use their included simple software" effectively tethering your "wireless" scanner to your computer and requiring an additional step of interacting with software that doesn't really provide much benefit just more work. It reminds me of using the twain plugin to corel draw in 1995. Yes it is "easy" in that my mom could learn it. No it is not "easy" in that it creates less work for you.I really wanted to like this product but it didn't help me go paperless with "wireless scanning" and evernote. This scanner doesn't really do anything differently than any other scanner on the market. In the end you have to sit in front of your computer connect your scanner to your computer via usb then manually organize and import your scans into evernote. It's totally not worth the expense.If they made it possible to scan directly to evernote without a computer then use a cloud based toolset to organize / edit / OCR AFTER importing to evernote then it would accomplish something different.
5,I've been using Doxie for a couple of months now and it is an almost perfect solution to any scanning needs you might have. It's a portable device fast excellent quality of scans battery life is eh but enough. A few observations and hopefully some improvements to be made:1. I wish it had an auto turn on power that can automatically power the device as soon as it detects a piece of paper to be scanned.2. WiFi is pretty slow to be detected takes about a min or so for the WiFi to appear on any of my devices.3. The software definitely needs a bit more work. It's very basic and does not allow for any useful editing.But all these points are not to criticize the device but to bring it to perfection.
5,I have been putting off scanning photos for years until I purchased this scanner.  Connecting it and downloading the software was a total of 3 minutes.  I scanned about 1700 photos within a week at 600 DPI and that was taking my time while watching a show.  I LOVE this scanner.  It has simple editing software as well for quick touchups so I don't have to open photoshop to make small changes.  Documents also come out perfectly.  Compared to standing at my scanner/printer and scanning a photo and waiting to upload to my computer this is amazing.  I love it.  The only downside is the SD card it saves photos to is not compatible without the scanner and regular SD cards aren't compatible with the scanner.  However this would not stop me from purchasing it again.Also I have only Macs and it connects effortlessly compared to most products that are designed with HP in mind and Mac as an afterthought.
4,Have only had this scanner for a couple of days. However my dinner and coffee tables are already completely clear of junk with all the receipts and pamphlets scanned in. Also the website is great and the help system is very concise and useful. I got the Eye-Fi card along with this scanner and am already finding the wireless feature tremendously useful.A couple of things worth mentioning - not necessarily negative enough to deter one from buying but not obvious or mentioned anywhere.1. Scanning anything over 20-30 pages will require a bit of patience because there is no feeder2. You need to get used to feeding the paper in straight. If it does not go in at first attempt take it out fully. Sometimes the scanner will take in paper only from one corner and not the other and this can mess up your scan.3. The software doesn't convert your receipt scans into expense reports (like some competitors in case you were wondering). Actually I am looking for software to use along with these scans that can do that.For the three points above I am docking the product a combined 1 star.All in all a very good product for getting rid of clutter. I don't know that we will ever get to a "paperless" state but I think we're getting pretty close to the best we can be.
2,Update: After this review first went up I got an email from Doxie assuring me that the problem with my feed had to have been an issue with my particular unit. They sent me a new one for free which I appreciate. Unfortunately none of the problems with the feed cleared up. It's just as finnicky and frustrating as always very often failing to secure a sheet of regular paper despite many tries. I think the feed simply has not been engineered properly making this product a constant frustration.Judging by the other reviews here I can tell that this is probably a minority opinion but I have to be upfront and honest about this: the feeding mechanism is so frustrating I consider it almost broken. Again and again and again I carefully place the paper where it's supposed to go the mechanism begins and grabs the top edge of the paper and then the paper gets stuck or turns in the feed resulting in a twisted image. That happens essentially every time I try to scan a piece of paper. I've read all the instructions and gotten advice at various places online and even doing everything everyone says to do I always end up re-loading the paper again and again. There's just a design flaw in my opinion in the way the paper is pulled in after the top edge is initially fed into the machine.It's a shame because it's super light and convenient the case is high-quality the software is useful and intuitive and the battery life is great. When this thing works it's great for light scanning on the go. But I've wrestled with the feed for so long that I'm out of patience with it.*Edit* So Apparent was kind enough to send me another Doxie which I've played with for some time. I'm happy to say that the feed on this one is in fact better. Better but still imperfect. I've revised my review to give it 4 stars although really I want to give it 3 and a half. The feed mechanism seems to be a lot better on this one but even so it's a tricky thing. I don't think this is a particular failing of the Doxie Go; these types of products are probably always going to have finicky feeds. Some other people who own this judging from the reviews don't mind it at all. Others like me find it a hassle. If you think you might be annoyed by it maybe better to get a traditional flat bed scanner or stick to taking photos with a smartphone.
5,This little scanner has been fantastic for a family photo conversion to digital project I’ve been on. Additionally the scanner has been great to go paperless and rid myself of all the receipt clutter. Customer support is great—truly a great small business which prides itself in top tier service to its customers!
4,This scanner combined with the Eye-Fi WiFi SD cards is almost a perfect solution for my scanning needs.I wanted something that was cordless would sit on my counter without taking a lot of space scan various size documents and transmit them to my computer wirelessly. This scanner meets that need overall with one thing that could have made it perfect.1) Scanning is just to jpgs. At least that is all I have figured out so far. I would have preferred pdfs. However I think I might use my adobe professional to setup a periodic batch process to convert and ocr the jpgs. I will have to test and see.NOTE on Eye-Fi CardsI read extensively about these cards and the models/functionality available. I bought two different models for two different purposes I went with a cheaper mobi for one and the more expensive pro for the other. The mobi has a desktop interface that is a beta version while the pro version has a full blown program for automatically transferring files to a pc. The problem is that these two programs won't coexist on the same computer and only one card works with each. So if you want to use multiple cards (Scanner and Camera in my case) I would opt for two of the same model so the same program will talk to both cards.
5,This scanner is great. I went home for a week after a relative passed away and we scanned 4000+ images. It was so easy everyone could take turns scanning images. Plus you don't have to be hooked up to anything to scan. Just hold an image up to the feeder and it does the rest. The only thing I don't like is you can't see the image while actively scanning while hooked up to a computer. Only had a few scanned images that weren't great. Also one thing to know is that when importing the photos from the sd card to the app it takes a while for it to correct the scans. Then exporting takes a while also but well worth the time.
5,If only I were more computer savvy...doxie is the easiest scanner anywhere!  What makes them even better is their Customer Service.  It is absolutely top notch!  I have contacted them multiple times with questions (via email) and they respond to me quickly (almost always in less than 24 hours).  They will also call you at a convenient time for you the customer.  I did this once and the rep answered all of my questions so patiently and was in no hurry to cut me off.  Having purchased an epson scanner and attempted to deal with their rude and basically non-existent customer service  they really need to take lessons from doxie!  Buy a doxie scanner.  I assure you that you will be totally pleased!
5,I bought the Doxie Go to finally get rid of the USB cable I needed for my NEAT Mobile. And I also bought the Eye-Fi Connect X2 4GB to go with the Doxie (see my other review). The Doxie is slightly bigger than the NEAT but carries a battery not to forget. And it can't scan the super lengthy receipts. BUT - it doesn't need a cable it doesn't need to be connected to the computer to scan. Just power it up (takes app. 15 sec.) and start scanning. I recommend to set the paper guide for smaller receipts. This will give you better results and less skewed images. Others than that there is nothing fancy about this device it simply does what I wanted it to do. And the Doxie desktop software (I use the Mac version) is good and easy to use. Again I just want to scan a document and export it as PDF for storing including OCR that's what it does. It handles batch export and allows stacking of multiple pages to one PDF. Simple.For me this is the best portable scanner in terms of convenience and ease of use. Do I still have a flatbed scanner? Of course I do. But it is rarely used nowadays.One word to the Eye-Fi: in my opinion you MUST buy the card. It turns the Doxie Go into the ultimate wireless document scanner. While I do the scanning it transmits the images in the background and the desktop software picks it up for PDF export.
5,Bought my scanner 3/31/2020 and loved it! Was able to scan all kinds of documents to store on a hard drive rather than a 4 drawer filing cabinet. On 2/3/2021 I pulled the unit out and and it wouldn't power up. Plugged in the charge cord and nothing. Not expecting much I contacted Doxie support I was blown away they asked me to try a different cord and different outlets. Since my phone uses the same cord I tried it. Still nothing next email I got was they were sending me a replacement scanner with a prepaid return labe to ship the defective one back! That's how customer service should be done. I will buy another product from them if I ever need to.
4,Can't beat this price for a hip little contraption such as this. Scans quickly and accurately. It is revolutionizing my filing system.My only complaint is that the paper feeding is finicky. This is the only thing that knocks it down a star for me. Much of what I scan is not brand new and therefore has small crinkles at the edge or slightly bent corners which cause misfeeds.  I would say unless the paper is near-flawless there is a 30 percent chance you will have to try to feed it through more than once.  That said with a bit of finegling you can get it done  unless your paper is severely mangled and either way the software makes it easy to sort through duds.Overall great product. Battery life seems good (I have yet to need to think about it). It's compact and the scan quality is great. Documentation is slick and their customer service has already emailed me at least once making sure everything is OK. Recommended.One other minor thing for me: I would have gladly paid less and ditched all of the extra travel adapters. I think I will sufficiently lose all of them long before I ever have to take this thing abroad if that day does indeed ever come.
3,I wanted to love this scanner.  However there are lines in the images.  I followed the instructions and began scanning.  After scanning several photos I noticed lines through all the images.  I cleaned the Doxie according to the instructions and recalibrated using the blank and white sheet then re-scanned several photos.  Same lines appeared no improvement.  Will be returning.EDIT:  Doxie's customer service is excellent.  Old Doxie has been returned and a new one on the way.  Thier customer service raises the original review from 1 star to 3.
4,Based on the outstanding reviews I bought one.  I wanted a portable scanner mostly for scanning receipts and the occasional documents on my MacBook Pro.  In this regard the Doxie Go Plus does well.  I did run into a problem trying to scan the paper thin receipts from most stores.  The paper is simply too thin to feed through the scanner.  However if you place the receipt on top of a white sheet of paper (no need to tape or use adhesive) and feed both through the scanner it works perfectly.  The software while simplistic in use functions very well and reliably.  The only reason I knocked off one star is because the fit and finish is average at best.  Admittedly my Apple products have set the bar pretty high but I think this scanner would totally run the market for its intended use if the manufacturer tightened up the fit and finish a touch.Update 2022.09.06:This scanner has served me well.  It lasted almost 6 years the battery ended up swelling up and rendered the paper feeder inoperable.  I did order another Doxie I like the product that much.
5,I absolutely love this scanner.  I bought it primarily to scan boxes of old photos.  I inherited both my late grandmother's and my mother's photos plus my own to scan.  This scanner does a great job.  Some of the old pictures that I scanned look better than the originals that had faded.  The scanner is easy to use.  I can sit in front of the tv and feed them through the scanner and then load them into my computer later....so convenient.  And the customer support from Doxie is exceptional.  They are so helpful if you have any issues at all with this scanner....either with the set-up or operation.  I am so happy that I purchased this scanner and I highly recommend it.
5,I have tried multiple scanners over the last couple of years and with all those I have tried under the $250 point I have had issues with very slow scans crashing while scanning and incompatibility with my linux laptop.The Doxie Go has a pretty decent scan rate about 5-6 seconds to scan a page at 300dpi the scans come out in great quality and since the scanning is all handled inside the unit there are no software incompatibility issues with the PC.  The Doxie software is nice but if it doesnt work on your pc you can view the scanner like a camera and copy the files off or use USB or SD card to scan to instead of the internal memory.The only annoyances I have found if you want to do a lot of scanning like over 80 pages and need to charge and scan at the same time you have to buy a separate charger.  Otherwise it charges off usb.  Second I sometimes have an issue feeding a page straight.  it does not have a lot of a lead up with the tray.  Not a huge deal as I just rescan the item if it is too bad.  As I got through a few more and got more used to the best way to feed pages it became an issue less often.Summary--Pros:-Quick high quality scans-No compatibility issuesCons:-Can be difficult to feed some pages straight-have to buy separate power adapter to scan while charging
5,PROs:small portableeasy to usegood qualitycons:receipts easily get turned meaning you might have to scan them 2-3 timesbattery goes out with little to no warning and it won't scan while charging...needs a better "guide" for the papers to keep them straightbetter sensor for it to know when there is a paper to scan would also be a plus... (it has a narrow range to know to start pulling the paper through and scanning I bought this to track receipts and go paperless on many documents... and it does scan great... but it does test my patience especially with receipts. they get turned or stuck very easily...also the fact it doesn't want to scan while charging is a real pain... if I was travelling all the time for work and needed to scan on the road this would not be an issue... but for a home office document scanner... that "feature" is a pain. I'd rather have it plugged in all the time. hindsight 20/20 I'd have tried the neat receipts scanner with a document feeder I feel like that would have been better suited to my needs.update!! my biggest "problem" was not being able to scan while plugged in... doxie's EXCELLENT customer service reached out to me to address this issue and give the solution:   Doxie Worldwide Power Adapter        so if you want to have it plugged in all the time get one of the power adapters instead of using the usb power and you can scan all day long...
4,I (mostly) hate paper. You cannot search it it takes up room in my tiny house--how are we still using it? While I have moved most of my dealings to electronic records there are those who still insist of sending me official documentation via Pony Express. So until that time when we can eliminate paper altogether I going to need a scanner if I want to keep my house in order.This is the ideal scanner for someone who doesn't want a scanner at all. You can store in a kitchen drawer and handle your mail as it comes in even sending to The Cloud wirelessly. This is not however a scanner for someone who needs a ton of horsepower in their scanning gear (whatever the hell that means). The customer support is also top-notch and I received a courtesy check-in from an actual person shortly after my purchase (I appreciate the effort to add a bit of warmth to the otherwise mechanical process of ordering hardware off the internet). The only thing keeping it from being a 5-star product are a few functions in the software itself. I wish there was a "multi-page" option on the scanner rather than needing to bind the pdf's manually on my laptop. Overall I would recommend this product.
5,There was a problem with the battery. They responded promptly and told me they will send a replacement battery even though my scanner is out of warranty.
1,This product has unfortunately very limited use and unless you are buying it to use with photos and receipts only you will be returning it like I did.I bought this scanner out of sheer stubbornness because I had difficulty believing the reviews that said it wasn’t possible to scan multiple page documents.  What kind of scanner is made so you can’t create a multi-page document?Well...this one apparently.The first problem occurs when you scan a document.  You have to place the document precisely or it scans crooked.  And when I say precisely there is zero room for error—if you even slightly misalign the document you will get a crooked result that cannot be fixed.This required level of perfection in a portable scanner leaves a lot to be desired as you can imagine.  You may think who cares you can fix wobbly scans afterward why can’t you crop out errors after you scan?Because this scanner has no option to crop items you scan.  Like at all.  It’s not a part of the system software.Not only that but all items are scanned as .jpegs only no other file type and even if you go into tech support and look at “advanced scanning options” there are no options for merging individual .jpeg scans so truly you can only scan one page at a time and it is not possible to combine them into one document.Bottom line for casual fun household scanning of receipts pictures and one page docs this would be fine.  But what are you buying an expensive portable scanner for?  And enjoy laboriously lining up each item absolutely perfectly because this scanner will demand it.If you have to scan actual documents in a portable environment like a car or multiple locations this is NOT the scanner you’re looking for.  Do not buy.
5,I love this thing so much but it just isn't working out. I was VERY excited to receive my Doxie Go Plus. The set up process was very easy I did the calibration and a few test pages and left it plugged up to charge. The initial charge took about 6 hours until the light went out. I unplugged it and went into my room to scan but got nothing. The following day I plugged it in again and the light came on. It scanned beautifully while plugged in but when I unplugged it after a full charge again nothing. Both times I've let it charge fully until the light went out but once the light goes out that's the last it works...lol. I could use it as a regular scanner (plugged in) but I could have achieved that much cheaper. The benefit to me was that I could take this one out of the home and use it withOUT wires. Another cumbersome return.....ETA: Can I say AWESOME fast enough?? I didn't even have the opportunity to do a return. The manufacturer contacted ME to see how I was doing with the product and they took over the process pronto. They e-mailed a return label to me and have already shipped a replacement! That's service!!If you're on the fence about your purchase don't be. Whatever the issue they stand behind their product. They'll make it right for you.
5,I can stick my USB flash drive in there and carry the whole thing TO the hideous pile o'papers and get the copies done safe in the USB flash and then shred the paper all without carrying the paper anywhere. Very good imaging. Bought it March 2013.Read their website for all the other functionality...it is a wonderful product and was a solution I thought I would not find (I read about it on a tech sort of review in WIred magazine). They have other models too. This one is a "Doxie Go".Pay for the adapter thing so you can plug it into the wall should the need arise and if you are in such a hurry that you don't want to wait even a short time for charging - it's proprietary adapter and multi-country and I didn't have anything usable in my box of 'orphaned electricals' and didn't see one online that would work so there's that bit of trivia.Anyway I love this thing and it is very very useful to the average person who:  needs to save a bunch of papersbut not the physical copy and  isn't a medical or law or RE pro (there are high-volumesuper quickpricier tools for such needs) -- and doesn't want to wait endlessly for a typical scanner + computer and lug papers TO said scanner.Fits easily into most desk drawers a not-tiny handbag a briefcase or backpacknot heavy and looks good sitting on a desk.
5,When I bought this I was looking for a document and receipt scanner that was portable small and lightweight and I definitely made the right choice. The Doxie Go Plus was perfect for our small business needs. It's small lightweight and easy to use. We use the Doxie in our business to mostly do taxes by scanning in receipts and other documents. The app for the software is also easy to use and works great. The battery life has been excellent and most of the time stays unplugged in a closet until it's use is needed.We've only needed to charge it a couple of times even after some heavy use since we purchased it. I didn't order the wifi version since we don't really need the wireless capability we run an at home web design company so there's always literally a computer at our fingertips and no need to buy the separate card instead of just plugging it in which takes 2 seconds. This would be great for our photography business though if we were still doing print contracts and wanted to scan and send a copy to a client right away out in the field however so depending on what business you have depends if you need the wifi capability or not.This little machine really has one job and it does it's one job really well highly recommended!
3,My wife and I went on a quest to de-paper our home. After a lot of research we landed on this scanner to change our lives. What really sold me on the scanner was the ability to connect it to a Eye-Fi card to work with it wirelessly. My wife and I both have laptops and I didn't want to have to worry about plugging it into one of our computers to scan it.We started to use this scanner in conjunction with Evernote to organize our lives. However when trying to scan mass amounts of paper this scanner can turn into a real pain. It can often be difficult to load the papers and the documents would often come out crooked or stretched funny. There were also quite a few "misfires" where the document didn't feed in properly and the scanner created images of weird black stretches as it was trying to scan nothing. Multisided documents and multipage documents need to be manually combined with either the doxie software or directly in Evernote once again not a smooth process.After too much frustration I had the great idea to just use the built in scanner in my printer (HP OfficeJet 8600 Plus). I'm not sure why I didn't think of this as we started the quest as it made it about a thousand times easier. We spent several weeks going through all of our papers and scanned and threw away nearly everything (minus important documents). Now that we're on top of our paper clutter I'm thinking about reintroducing the Doxie into my flow for smaller documents and for portability sake as it is a fairly sleek little scanner nonetheless. However I would not recommend this if you are going through massive amounts of documents trying to organize your life.
4,Works but not easy to access software in wireless mode.
5,There's not much better of a feeling than scanning a stack of receipts documents and kids drawings and dumping them all in the recycling bin! I've been using a Doxie scanner about 7 years and recently upgraded to the new one. The software is super easy to scan with. I use an app called Paperless to store and organize the scans which then backs them up to the cloud. I know I'll always have them and I can search any word to pull them up. No more digging through piles of paper or hunting in a filing cabinet! WHAT RELIEF! What's more is tech support is real people can't say that about many nowadays.
2,I have had this scanner for a year.  I used it initially but like many electronic devices like scanners it is not a device I use on a regular basis.  I recently got it out to scan some documents and when I tried to charge it the light flashes one time red and then nothing.  I left it plugged in for several hours and still nothing.  The battery pack will not charge.  I have other devices that use lithium ion batteries such as my SLR camera that sit for periods of time unused and I have never had an issue like this.  The battery will not charge at all.  I am very disappointed.  The scanner itself is perfect for going paperless at home but with the battery pack not lasting I cannot recommend this product.  I have reached out to Doxie and I have not received a response.
1,I could not get the Doxie SE Go to work at all. I wanted a scanner that could be used on an Apple Phone IOS. I could not get that to work. I tried ti get it to work on PC and could not get that to work either. I am fairly computer literate.This product only scans in JPEG and scans 1 PAGE AT A TIME. It scams to SD card that is specifically formatted for the Doxie. It also has its own built in wifi. According to the manufacturer you can download their app connect the phone to the Doxie’s wifi and pull out the scans from the SD card over wifi. The issue with this is that the Doxie drops wifi signal repeatedly. I could not get it to pull more than a few pages before it dropped wifi. I bought an SD card adapter for the Iphone but that did not work.As far as PC I tried to connect to wifi also. The user interface is so weird and clunky. You don’t appear to download an app. Instead you have to connect to the Doxie via Wifi and then go to ip address to pull up options. However I could not get the options to work and my scans did not show up.At this price range the product really should be minimalized as far as what the user has to do to get it to work. Wifi is almost impossible to use and that is why I bought the product.Also the product malfunctions over and over. Getting a red light or blinking red light seems to be the norm. I had to constantly reset the unit to get it to continue scanning.
2,This is a side by side of picture scanned vs image saved. The depth of color just isn't there and this is on the highest quality setting. I know I can make adjustments with editing tools and filters but I have literally hundreds of family photos to scan and digitize and that will get very tedious very quickly.The other tedious aspect is that even directly connected to your computer it does not offer a preview of the scan. You have to navigate to the Doxie JPEG folder and scroll to the pic and open it to preview it. Since it closes the folder every time you start a scan you have to do that EVERY time. And you HAVE to preview it unless you want to go back and do a bunch of cropping because if the picture doesn't feed perfectly straight it will scan the entire width of the scanner not just the picture forcing you to crop down to size. Again with hundreds of photos to scan that is going to get old quickly.It's supposed to be faster than a desktop scanner and it might be if you're only scanning documents but for photos you are probably better off with a quality desktop scanner.
3,I really wanted to like this scanner but...I don't.  When I put a white background paper through the finished copy comes out with a tan/yellowish tint.  Sometimes there is a yellow stripe down the side.  I have trouble printing a hard-copy after scanning -- whether I use the scan disk Wi-Fi or USB port.I've had it almost 4 months down (mostly sitting unused on my desk because it is so frustrating) but I'm probably past the time for returning.  I have a couple big jobs I want to do but I can't make myself start them and put myself through the frustration..
4,I purchased this to get rid of all my paper files at home.  I wasn't sure if I should get one with a feed as I had several hundred pages to scan but I tried this one first.  Honestly it didn't take long to just hand feed each sheet and I was able to get everything done in my spare time over a few days.  I also thought I'd need a double sided scanner but again it doesn't take much time to flip the page and re-feed it.  The software is easy to use and intuitive and I was able to link up with Evernote for storage.Only downside for me was that the feed doesn't always sense the sheet right away and that can lead to some scans at an angle.  It's the trade-off for the small footprint of the scanner.  But Doxie customer service reached out to me after a few days of using to see how I was getting along and when I mentioned the issue they gave me some advice and a video.  They seem quite responsive.Definitely recommend picking up a staple remover and a shredder too.
4,**Updated** - I have to update my review as I'm absolutely blown away by Doxie's Customer Service.  After reading my review and seeing that I was disappointed they wasted no time reaching out to me to get me a replacement and refund.  They directed me to a different scanner that they offered and wasted no time in helping me out.  Definitely 4 out of 5 stars now as I still wish the scanner had worked as it should have but the fact that they quickly assisted me is a model definition of "good customer service."Wow was I disappointed when I started scanning my pictures.  Unless you put the pictures in completely straight be prepared for the pictures to be distorted and crooked.  I tried scanning with and without the sleeve.  Don't try to not use the sleeve the pictures are worse but even with the sleeve the scans are poor quality.Maybe to scan paper documents this is good but its not why I bought it.  I wish I had tried using it as soon as I received it as I would have returned it.
4,The first unit I ordered was dead on arrival it would not turn on. I returned it and got a replacement in short order. The replacement so far is working fine. The resolution is good and the system for scanned file management is workable. The Wi-Fi app is not entirely straightforward but is manageable once you get comfortable with the way it works. One area in which this unit excels is in the scanning longer documents. I scanned my car contract which measures 28 inches in length in one pass and the resolution was great! If you  expect to scan unusually long documents this is your unit for sure.
5,I do love this little scanner. It's so portable and easy to use. I just sold a car and delivered it to the buyer. After closing the deal and signing the title over I scanned the document in their driveway and didn't need to connect to anything. When I got home I wirelessly transferred the scanned document to my computer for safe keeping. Very cool. The quality of scanned photos and documents is excellent.Also support reached out to me via email to let me know they are there if I had any questions. And they offered to send a couple of accessory items for free to help scan fragile pictures and documents. Very impressive all around! I do recommend this product.
4,After using numerous iPhone apps for saving receipts I decided to buy the Doxie Go Wi-Fi because the apps weren't as convenient or difficult to use. I saw how many great reviews this product got from Amazon so I decided to take the plunge and buy this. I waited about a year before I wrote this review so that I can really give a fair assessment. This Doxie Go Wi-Fi is very convenient portable and easy to use.  I really like the wi-fi feature because it makes everything hassle-free. The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 stars because the cord really is the only grip I have about this product. When I plug in the product to the cord for charging it easily comes off. I had such a problem with this that my first Doxie Go Wi-Fi broke. However their customer service deserves 5 stars. They are easy to talk to and seem like they're genuinely eager to help you. Also I wish they came with longer cords. Besides that it is a great product that I would recommend to friends.
5,I love this machine! I bought the Doxie Go for a family visit.  I purchased this model because it had 600 dpi capability for photos.  I scanned photos letters and art work. The photos ranged from photo booth pictures to 8x10s. The paper thickness ranged from wedding napkins to old b/w photos on postcard stock. Every photo worked. The photos went steadily through and the one that stopped midway was ejected right away after I pressed the power button. I had some crooked photos I straightened them on the computer easily. I am not a tech person so I was extremely pleased with the data transfer. It would not let me make a mistake. I did learn to clear my data card after each transfer. I also do not recommend hugh batches. I had some batches with 150 photos. I also scanned the back of the photo to get name/date info then deleted the back side. I used a 32 gig photo card with and without the power cord. I liked the power cord better only because I scanned so many pictures between 500 & 700 over the course of 5 days. It also works great for receipts! I have recommended the Doxie Go to several friends who were also trying to save family photos. I am very happy with this purchase!
4,UPDATE: Apparently Doxie read this review and today I received an unsolicited package with a wall charger as well as an email making suggestions for how to solve the issues that I am having.  I will try them out and update again.  I am extremely impressed with the customer service!We bought this scanner in an effort to go paperless and start storing our records electronically.  While it does take very nice scans we have found that the battery life does not allow us to scan a large volume at a time.  It also does not have a wall-charging attachment; it can only charge via USB port on your computer and you are not supposed to have it plugged into the computer while scanning.  When the battery starts to run low it also stops sending the scans wirelessly; rather you have to plug it in to import the scans.  Although I am getting the job done I often feel like I am jumping through hoops to find the right combinations of what needs to be plugged in when which softwares need to be open etc. for it to work properly.  If I had it to do over again I would buy a different scanner.
5,Small footprint and easy to get started. My wife is tech adverse but I was able to have her scanning in a short time minutes!Scans are very clear and downloading the Dioxie software was quick and painless.Scans can be saved in every format at least all that I use.Transferring to my pc was easy. Just click on the button in the top right and it’s there or pull the SD card and insert it in your PC.I’d buy it again and will recommend to friends and family!
5,I love my Doxie scanner and I love the company even more.  The scanner takes up almost no room on my very crowded home desk.  I do a lot of volunteer work and it is exactly what I needed for scanning various documents.  The fact that it plugs into my USB hub for charging is very convenient.  I also love that I can scan either directly to my computer or take it someplace and scan to the memory card for later upload.  The company has reached out several times to make sure all was good and to ask if I had any questions.  Impeccable customer service.
5,For scanning old photos it works very well.  Mind you it's not fine art scanning but it is perfect for loads of family pictures old and newer.  They look great on a computer.  Without being  tethered to a computer you can watch TV  and scan.  For large projects just keep feedin' them through.  Worth the money. Would buy it again.  Only draw back: the software needs to do a little more with restoration of old photos faded color and B/W.
5,Please note my email back to Doxie after their response to me regarding an issue where my scanner would work with one computer but not another.  The best part is they immediately followed up with me via email after my registration to make sure that I was happy more than once and I simply respond to their email with a problem.  Their solution was immediate and clear and I was immediately up and running with a full understanding of the issue. I also learned something very important in the process with a household full of USB cables and devices.***************Dear DoxieAmazing...Recently I had a similar problem with a Sony device and after MONTHS of no help and frustration just happened to use a different cable and it worked.  I threw out that cable thinking it was defective.  I never thought of a defective cable again in this situation.So now with your superior customer service I now know my cable was not defective it was simply a charging only USB cable.  But MOST IMPORTANTLY I can now fully enjoy my scanner because in these days of very limited or no customer service doxie still believes in the customer.  I am now a Doxie customer for life and will share my experience with others.Thank you so much for being there.JerryZ
4,This review is for the DX255 model.  It works very well and is super easy to use. Paper feeds right into it with very little effort.  I wanted a very basic scanner and this is it.  It takes 1 page at a time and scans it. Even if you immediately feed in another page it scans to a new file. It seems to stay charged for a long time which is also nice I have had this since February and only charged it once so far. My use is 1-2x weekly.
5,I love this scanner. I hesitated because of the price but when it went on a special flash sale during the holidays I jumped on it. Like most people I have decades of family photos that take up a ton of storage space and I've always been a bit concerned about the memories that would be lost if there were ever a fire. I don't have to worry about that anymore. I chose the Doxie Go over the other Doxie because it had 300 and 600 DPI settings. I figured photos would be best scanned on the 600 setting but the quality of the Doxie at 300 DPI is so good I prefer that setting since it is a bit quicker. I was able to scan over 400 photos while watching an episode of Law and Order so this scanner has turned an overwhelming project into something productive I can do while watching TV (always a plus). The software is easy to download and the staple feature is great when you need to scan the backs of photos that have names and years written on them. After I import the photos to the Doxie software I upload them to Dropbox with just a couple of clicks no more worrying about losing family memories forever in some unforeseen accident. I'm very excited to find new projects to tackle after the photos are finished. I think Grandma's recipe box is next. :)
4,This is NOT an inexpensive scanner.  I was able to use it for one set of documents.  Upon second use it did nothing but error.  I determined the issue and reached out to Doxie.  I must say I have never personally experienced such outstanding customer service.  They immediately sent a replacement unit and followed up repeatedly to ensure I was satisfied.  They never made excuses for the defective product and took ownership admitting that a "lemon" made it past their QC process. They did everything in their power to make sure I was happy and that I received a scanner that met my expectations.  The replacement scanner works fantastic and overall I am more than satisfied with my purchase.  Sure it was a hassle to go through the warranty process but Doxie made it exceptionally pain free and very easy.  They easily earned the upgraded review and NO they never asked or even suggested I change my review.
5,Not only way this the perfect item to scan in all of my pictures after being evacuated for the fires in California but it wound up being a very easy way to scan in all those documents hanging around in the file cabinet and go paperless. Because it is small and portable everything becomes easier. I also interacted with their customer service to ask about how to use a feature because I hadn't used it in a while and forgot and they were super friendly and easy to chat with on their website.
5,This scanner is awesome! I was able to scan 4345 photos going back to when my grandmother was a little girl up through my family before we went digital.  And it only took a few days.Scans all types of photos including the old board-type photos from the early 1900’s.I didn’t use WiFi. I just used the scan disk card inserted in the scanner. After I scanned a group I would pop the scan disk card into my laptop and upload using Doxie software. Then I would later upload to Google photos.This little scanner is worth the price. Now all my photos are digitized and I am happy how clear they turned out and how fast it took me.
5,I have hundreds of photos taken over the years some nearly a century old. Many of them have become faded and discolored. Furthermore most were taken where as much scenery as possible was included with pictures of family and friends.After scanning these pictures (about 160 so far) I've been able to display on my computer screen full pages of 8 photos each. Then one by one I've been able to double click the pictures and quickly adjust brightness contrast black-&-whiteness and color saturation then cut back the top the bottom the left and the right putting my photo enhanced friends and family full front and center.The thing is I can always go back and see that natural beauty scenery that I removed from all these pictures but there's no going back and seeing my loved ones as they were then. This ability to put all emphasis on the people using this scanner has been like being able to finally see the pictures the way they should have been taken in the first place (with all emphasis on the people).Don't get me wrong I have a multi-use printer where I can scan pictures in. But using it to do all the kinds of things I've mentioned here is a heck of a lot of work. With this Doxie Go it's been quick simple fun and very rewarding.
5,I bought this for my mom last year. She loves it here's her review:"The Doxie portable scanner makes digitizing family photos quick and easy. The high quality scans import directly to my laptop photo application. Memory keepsakes such as cards letters and family recipes can be scanned clearly on a lower resolution to save memory. My dad whose hobby is photography was thrilled to receive a family vacation album covering a span of 57 years of memories. Doxie made it possible."I will add that she had a question about the manual and customer service went above and beyond.Really great company and product.
2,I bought this scanner slightly over a year ago. I used it when I received it and again a few months later. I recently tried to use it again and the battery was dead and unchargeable.  I should have dug into the specifications.  This will never be an acceptable desktop scanner due to the fact that once your battery dies there is absolutely no way to use it.  If you want a scanner that you will have to buy a rechargeable battery for every year or so this is the scanner for you. I prefer one that will work with its own external power supply at a desktop and can be used sometimes portably.  Again this is my mistake for not reading every bit of the fine print. Besides this the scanner works adequately.
5,I purchased my Doxie at the recommendation of a friend after a house fire. I had a lot of receipts to submit to insurance and needed a scanner but not a printer. I was able to save two plastic file boxes of important statements and paperwork from my fire and I wanted to go scan it all and go paperless to save space as well as make sure I never have the fear of losing something important again. This scanner makes it easy to feed sheets in "staple" them together to create multi-page scans and save them to my preferred file type (for me PDF).
5,Both the scanner and customer support are above expectations. The scanner is very compact portable. and user friendly. Scans are of the highest quality.I did have one question about connecting with my wi-fi.  Customer support is top notch.  Not only did they take the time to walk me through some things and offer helpful tips they also emailed detailed easy-to-follow instructions. Someone else from the Doxie team followed up to see how things were going and if i needed anything else at the moment.I couldn't be happier with my decision to go with a Doxie scanner :o)
4,Pros: Good for on the go and limited document scanning. Great customer supportCons: the power light is pretty bright. Sometimes the paper feeding can be finickyI use my Doxie Go for scanning personal documents and it works pretty well for that. If you need to scan a lot you'll probably need to look for something more robust (but will also come at a larger price tag).I had mine for about two years before it stopped taking in the paper on one side making it impossible to scan. I wrote a review reflecting this and took apart my Doxie to find out the battery pack had inflated on the bottom. Once I removed it (getting rid of it's portable feature of which I never really used so it was fine) the Doxie was level enough and it took in paper again.Luckily Doxie's team reached out and insisted they help out as the battery pack shouldn't have done that. They've been wonderful in getting a replacement and making sure the faulty Doxie is properly recycled.
4,After reading how great this thing was on the LifeHacker site I bought it. From the start it would miss-feed probably about 20% of the time which if you're scanning a bunch of documents simultaneously is a real drag. This is because you don't know which scans are successful and which have to be redone. Huge waste of time. Now after putting up with this incredibly annoying issue (which by the way I'm not the only one google it) for about 8 months the scanner has totally stopped feeding anything at all.UPDATE! UPDATE! -OK while I wasn't satisfied with the scanner I do have to say I'm extremely satisfied with Doxie's Customer Service. Apparently they came across my review and responded with a FULL unprovoked refund. Unbelievable! I can't remember the last time a company has ever been so responsive. It actually has made me reconsider making Doxie my next scanning solution (but definitely not the same model as I had before). My original review was 1 star but now based on this I have to give them 1 star for the scanner plus 3 stars for Customer Service.
5,This scanner works very well.  Either connected to a computer via USB or via Wi-FI.  I've used both methods and they both work great.  I've scanned many documents already with out any problems.  There are numerous formats you can save to but so far I've been using PDF.  This scanner is compact but has the capability of scanning in either 300dpi or 600dpi.  I highly recommend it.  It works better than my HP all in one Printer.
5,At first I was very disappointed about this product. I could only scan 3 receipts and at the 4th one the paper feeder stop working. However the customer service was absolutely fantastic in talking with me over the phone step by step to ensure that I have a complete understanding of their product and that I get the full use of it. After being better informed I realized the product was great. It did all of my documents without any issues plus I was pleased with how easy to use the uploading process was. The quality of the picture scanning was very impressive to say the least. I want to personally thank this company for taking the time and making such a great product.
5,Have been needing a scanner for business; picked this one because it seemed well rated and straightforward. Super easy to use right out of the box. The directions for use are incredibly clear and you will be up and running within a few minutes. Customer service has been outstanding. Doxie has reached out several times for feedback and to see whether the scanner is meeting our needs. Real people who truly care about making a good product. I would definitely buy another Doxie product in future.
5,My family owns 3 of these in total. In the age of paperless this is the perfect companion. It doesn't take up a lot of space and it's insanely easy to scan documents of any size up to A4. I think this model is best for scanning standard paper documents. I scan photos occasionally some small artifacts are visible. I spoke to a Doxie rep about this who recommends the Doxie Flip if you're scanning photos. But for the purposes of scanning just about anything else it works flawlessly.The software took a hot minute to get used to but it's actually pretty solid once you start using it. I like the ability to "staple" documents within the Doxie app which creates multi-page documents—something weirdly annoying to do normally.Overall killer product.
5,I got the DoxieGo + Wifi product to scan bills and paperwork from my kitchen instead of piling them hoping I would not forget to bring them to my home office to scan them on my flatbed scanner...This product could not be simpler ! Took me a few minutes to configure the scanner and a few more to get the Eye-fi card going. IMO the DoxieGo documentation (for both the scanner and Eye-fi card) is very well done and easy to follow.I can now simply scan whatever I need directly from my kitchen and have the Jpeg files sent directly to a Network storage device in my office. (Yes the only files you can send through the Eye-Fi card are Jpeg files... which is fine because if you want to convert them into searchable PDF files you will have to import the files into the provided software anyway...).The software provided to convert the saved Jpeg files into searchable PDF files is also simple and works well. The only complain I had was that the saved files needed to be in a particular (I mean hardcoded !) folder in order for the software to find them. Doxie customer support gave me a workaround within a few hours that solved my issue.Scan quality is perfect for documents... didn't try photos.If you want something simple that works well over Wifi this product really does the job.
5,AS an HR and Management Consultant even in COVID I spend a lot of time scanning and working with documents and I have be to mobile.  The Doxie has been a wonderful tool in my collection.  It works seemlessly and fast to capture high resolution images (documents ID's and more) and if I need to work with them on the go I can import so easily into my iPad Pro if they are just for storage I can grab the SD card out and plug it right into my machine at home to download and file the document for compliance.
5,Very nice little scanner!  I bought this scanner a few months back and had some problems connecting via WIFI.  I was frustrated with their support until I learned their hours of operation (see tips).  Their awesome support group said they wanted their customers to be happy and they shipped me a new unit (expedited arrived within two days).  The new unit connected right away without issue and works great.  I went from hating this device to loving it!  You scan to this units memory so you can carry it with you on your travels. No laptop (or desktop) hookup needed until you want to upload.  After your travels you simply connect via WIFI or USB and upload your scans.  So easy to use!  I'm recommending this unit and also the customer service is awesome.  These guys stand behind their product.  Excellent.. Tips: 1.  Be sure to set your Windows 10 Firewall to allow Doxie connections. 2.  If you need assistance via Chat they are open Noon to 8 p.m. EST.  Otherwise email them the issue and they will respond.
5,What a great product and company!  After a few weeks they called to see how things were going and sent me a carrying case.  I'm enjoying using Doxie yet I sometimes just use my cell phone for a quick scan; however Doxie definitely has much better quality.  The setup is minimal and then you're off to the races.  The software works well so that you can come back later and group scans in a specific order.  If you are used to high speed scanning the software can seem clunky but it gets the job done.  Overall I like the simplicity mobility and strong customer support.  Thanks Doxie!
5,I really liked the ease in setting up and the user-friendliness of this product.  I needed it to scan paperwork and other information due to selling a house in another city.  I will also be using it for receipts and storing all the paperwork that takes up so much room .  After the battery was charged the time it took to run the documents to SD card took just a few minutes.  The app to use with it so I can store on my computer was also  quick and easy.  I love the efficiency of this and the small footprint.  This was the Doxie without the wifi.  Maybe later I will upgrade.
5,Edit: From 1 star to 5 star.Wifi option didn't work but Doxie Customer Service was very responsive in sending out a replacement and walking me through the wifi setup over the phone to make sure there were no hitches. Very good product better customer service. Wish they made printers too.It scans wells into pdf jpg etc. formats but the wifi functionality is spotty and software is a bit buggy. I had to re-attempt the wifi connection several times before I was able to connect to the device's wifi signal and am still unable to connect the device to my home wifi network. I'm just going to plug into a usb port which defeats the purpose of buying the wifi version.
5,Extremely easy interface.  I really like the fact that I can scan anywhere without being hooked to a computer.  All I needed to do was install Doxie program (supplied with it) and start scanning.  Thought about a autofeed inkjet printer but so glad I chose this.  Scanned 6 inches of medical records very quickly.  About as big as a box of spaghetti and about 2 inches tall.  Definitely recommend buying the case they make for it.  Small fast portable.  Scan away and then  just pop out the SD card and pop it in your computer.  Staple feature works great.  Highly recommended.  Zero buyers remorse
5,This scanner is easy to set up and use and it is very easy to transfer the files to my computer.  The included software makes it easy to manage/save/print the scanned images.  I had a minor issue during setup and their customer service team promptly took care of everything.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this scanner!
5,Doxie is a great portable scanner. Setup is simple and scanning documents is easy. Transfering the documents to my PC is straightforward. This is my first portable scanner and I am extremely happy. Doxie customer support is by far the best support I have ever received from a company. They reached out to me after I registered my device and periodically afterwards to make sure everything was going ok with it and to provide any support I needed. I appreciate small companies like this and would highly recommend them to customers on Amazon looking for a simple reliable document scanner with excellent customer service.
3,Worked well at first.  I like the option for stand-alone use.  Completely stopped working after a year.  Now wont even turn on whether plugged in or not.
1,The scanner wont connect to the wifi or show up on the Doxie software if I plug it into my computer via USB. The wifi light wont even show up on the scanner or on my computer or my phone's network. It's been charging for 24hrs and right when I unplug it to troubleshoot it gives the 'low battery' flash. I have been trying to make this scanner work for two days - I am out of ideas. I followed all the directions in the box and went online to their website and other websites to troubleshoot. I also sent a help ticket into Doxie. I think I got a lemon I am hoping I can send it back and they'll give me a replacement because looking at the other reviews it seems like a great little photo scanner. I will update this review if I hear back.
4,I purchased this scanner based on a recommendation from the folks at the Mac Power Users podcast. I've owned it for about 1 month and have used it to scan my backlog of unfiled papers and important documents. I've been using this scanner to push documents to Evernote and it works like a charm.The only hardware complaint is that papers with bent edges can be tricky to feed in. When this happens I flip the document and feed from the other side. Sadly the software to rotate the document is clunky and takes lots of clicks to get the document's correct orientation restored. It would be nice if the software automatically identified mis-scans but clicking the little X to delete them is easy enough. Most of my concerns about this product are software usability related and not related to the hardware so Apparent should be able to fix this easily over time. *Please*My long term plan is to use my   Eye-Fi SD Card         to upload scanned documents instantly that way I can keep this scanner in a drawer near where the mail comes in scan what I care to save and then throw everything into the shredder.
5,I agonized over whether or not to purchase this for months so it stayed in my shopping cart's "Saved for Later" section. On Black Friday it went on sale and I bit the bullet and bought it. I LOVE THIS MACHINE!! I had stacks of papers that I felt I couldn't/shouldn't get rid of and now I have no more stacks of paper and everything is now organized in files on my computer with incredible software. I really cannot say enough good things about Doxie as a product and their customer service team. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
5,I have multiple people in my department who use company credit cards and I use my Doxie to scan receipts in case the originals are ever misplaced or fade. I previously had a Neat scanner and despised it with the fire of 1000 suns. It took me three years to decide to try another scanner and this one has been amazing. It comes with very clear instructions for installation and use and it has worked beautifully. In an early review I made a comment about a feature I wish the scanner software had and the company actually contacted me with some optional apps that work with Doxie to do what I wanted. I appreciated the response. I'm not used to that. They even followed up to see how the suggestion worked out. It's a simple reliable and good quality scanner for about anything but I especially love it for receipts and other odd-sized bits. I'm very happy and would recommend for sure.
4,I was looking for a small portable scanner that I could take back and forth to work as well as work on home projects with.  The Doxie Go Plus was well reviewed and I'm glad I made the purchase.  It scans very well it's quick and it was reasonably priced.  I've used it to scan photos documents and artwork that I've drawn and wanted to edit on the computer.  It was easy to set up with everything you need on line.  It's done everything I've asked and more and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a scanner like this.  The only negative which isn't really a negative is that it didn't come with a protective case.  It comes with a fabric bag but I put it in my tote bag and wanted something a little more substantial.  So I had to buy the hard case which is separate.  It would have been nice if it had been included.
2,I spent an hour trying to set up the SE with wifi and gave up.  I came back a week later tried for 45 minutes nope.  Besides the difficulty with wifi as other have noted  I found their instructions confusing.  They look pretty and seem simple but when you dig into them I was going .. "huh?"  It's as though they're written by someone how doesn't think like most people.  The card in the box has some info but inevitably refers you to their online help page also pretty and equally confusing.  I tried the "get help" button both times but didn't get a live chat only "email us."  There's no step 1 do this step 2 do this.  The instructions are all in different spots don't go in order and they make assumptions about how you're going to have the unit join your wifi network showing screen shots of an old android build which doesn't compute with a Win 10 PC.I also saw a reviewer say the wifi is almost pointless because you have to scan then start the program on your device then click around to start file transfer.  I assumed wifi meant I could have the unit in my kitchen scan and it would be uploaded.Even if I could get wifi working with Doxie support I decided there's too much wrong with it to live with it.  I'm generally a fan of the not so famous brands that seem to have a high percentage of good reviews but not in this case.  Returned.
5,I’m using my Doxie to get old photos saved onto my computer. I highly recommend.
4,Received scanner as promised! Empty plastic wrapper inside the box. Unknown content! Scanner would not work during set up tethered mode! Did not work independently either! Returning this item!Update: I received a message from Joseph of Doxie today with an apology for the machine ‘s defectiveness! Joseph is offering a replacement if I would try it again. Very rare I see anyone or any company responding promptly and taking accountability of their product’s defect. This alone is worth giving the machine a second try! Will write update again once I received and tested the scanner!Update: Received replacement as promised. Installed and scanner functioned as it would be. IUpgraded my rating and with company’s prompt response to my comment it could have easilybeen a 5 star. I would recommend this product to anyone knowing the company will back your satisfaction up!
5,I recently purchased a Doxie Go SE after my original Doxie Go was damaged. I thought I knew what to expect from a Doxie product. I was surprised to see the Go SE actually scans better than my original Doxie Go; documents feed thru more cleanly reducing the need to re-scan documents.Initially I wasn't impressed with the battery life of this scanner. I reached out to Doxie support to voice my concern. They made me aware that enabling WiFi consumes a lot of energy and recommended I leave it off while scanning. Since following their recommendation I have been able to scan 200+ pages on a single charge without issue.Overall I'm very happy with the performance of the Doxie Go SE and pleased with the pleased with the responsiveness of Doxie's support team. I recommend this to anyone looking for reliable portable scanner to use on-the-go.
5,I like the fact that it's battery powered  I have never ran out of battery life  which has been great. The size is great  very portable. Also a huge plus for me is the SD card  which allows me to bypass the computer if I want and just print from the card .I am using this for family photos  I can scan what I want and my Siblings just bring their own SD card and can make copies of any photos they want 🙂The picture quality is very good  even on old photos.
5,Bought the Doxie to scan a bunch of old family photographs. I wanted something small that wouldn't take over my desk a scanner that i could take to family members houses and easily scan photos that otherwise would be kept in storage. the Doxie was perfect for what i needed. it lives in a drawer and i take it out when i want to. The photos come out pretty great when it comes to color matching minimal retouching on photoshop. i love that i can do a hundred scans one after the next then send everything to my computer via wifi. very glad about this purchase.
5,Doxie's customer service folk are stellar and they went above and beyond all to help me. Covid in UK but wanted this  USA product and they sent it to me FOC when another one was lost due to customs complications. I think I was reimbursed and never paid. I would pay gladly it's an excellent scanner of old family photos really able to copy and throw the thousands away finally. I'm so delighted with it. And was able to use too for all my documents and records. I am delighted with it and recommend to like long hoarders who have dusty albums needing liberating.
3,I'm not sure why it has so many good reviews. It's a slow process to scan a large number of photos. There are multiple steps involved. The scans themselves are slow. The software on the Mac often disconnects from the scanner - some type of USB issue perhaps. Doxie often ends up with a blinking light that indicates it is busy e.g. I just had one after turning it on that took a minute to resolve.  The scanner software frequently does an automatic rotation to photos that have angles in them causing you to have to edit about 10% of the photos even through they were scanned in straight. I'd just like a scanner that could allow me to feed in photos quickly at 600 DPI and put them automatically in a folder on my computer without all the intermediate steps.*** Edit 4/26: I gave the product an extra star since they clearly have excellent customer support. They sent me an email soon after I submitted this review.  One point they made is that you can turn off the automatic adjustment of the photos. That's true but then you have to adjust the borders on the photos.  It is more work to adjust the majority of the borders compared to editing ~10% of the rotated photos. It would be great if you could just turn off automatic rotation since it doesn't work very well and keep the border adjustment in place. ***
4,I picked this up to start getting a couple file cabinets scanned to disk so I could clear out some space in my office. I'm still working through the piles but the Doxie Go has made the whole process so much simpler and quicker than my existing multi-function. The scan speed is great and the fact I can sit down anywhere with a stack of papers and start scanning is great. The only slight drawbacks I've found so far are:1) The preview images in the Doxie software are fairly small and it is not easy to differentiate between similar scans such as different months' financial statements from the same account. I've found the best way to get past this issue is to keep the hard copies in order and consult them as I organize and save the scans.2) The battery life is average at best. I can scan consistently for about 30-40 minutes before I need to plug the Doxie Go back in to charge. Most of the time this isn't an issue but it somewhat defeats the purpose of using a large capacity SD card to store the scans.
3,Bought the Doxie Go in Feb of 2015 and other than it being somewhat finicky loading paper that is not completely straight on the leading edge (who has ever bought something at the store and kept their receipt perfectly straight) it has been a really good scanner.  That is up until now.  While trying to scan in a full page it would only pull on the paper on one side.  Visually on the exterior I could not find any problems.  However once I started removing screws to disassemble it the problem became very apparent.  The Li-Polymer battery while still working fine had swelled up so bad that it was holding the roller on that side of the scanner perfectly still.  Once I had the screws loose I was able to scan my documents.  Even if I wanted to replace the battery it is so deformed that it will not move inside the battery compartment.  Unfortunately I am not willing to risk this battery exploding and burning my house down some time in the future so I will be looking for another scanner.  I have not seen any other Doxie reviews with the same issue so most likely I will go back with a newer version of the same product but be warned if one side stops pulling in paper you may have a battery that is on the verge of failing.
5,We are scanning in all the photos from years of photo albums and organizing them and saving them into cloud storage. The Doxie after getting it set up easily scans in the photos and helps organize them. It doesn't take up much room doesn't have to be connected to the computer to scan the photos and saves lots of scans before having to upload to your computer.  We had some technical questions and after sending an email to tech support they got back very quickly and solved our issue. Highly recommend.
5,I bought this to scan insurance documents for clients as I despise paperwork.  I keep it with me when I am at work to easily scan documents and store them in an organized manner.  My Doxie Go is an indispensable piece of equipment for my office. I am very pleased to have a portable scanner that I can depend on to help me with my work.
5,I really love this little scanning machine very easy to set up software is simple and not complicated. I can easy transfer the scanned documents to my Mac iPhone and iPad whichever I like. WiFi function works well. The software allows me to do some simple adjustments such as crop adjust contrast and stable the documents. Overall it is a great little scanner and now I can get rid of the paper (e.g. invoice statement etc.) and keep all the essential documents (e.g. medical record) in my computer/cloud drive so that I could access easily.
5,Read to the end....I had hoped this would be easy to use.  While the scanner itself is I had difficulty at first connecting it across PC and Apple .  I thought it would be easier to set up folders and then “ search “ for any item.  It’s not that easy.  I wish I had done more research about that feature.AND NOW....  they earned my trust!!I heard from the company after I had written the above review and those 3 stars are now 5 stars.  You won’t be disappointed with this company!!!  Above and beyond.
5,It does the job and personally I can't wait to see how it performs the next time I am in the rural areas of Africa (what high speed internet?)  or the Philippines. If you're in civilization with a smartphone and high speed service however then Adobe Scan is all you need especially if you require PDF because this thing is only JPEG so save your material in your phone Doc and open with Adobe for PDF printing but if it doesn't matter to you then this little Doxie is all you will ever need!
5,The first one I received didn’t work because there was a problem with  the battery port. It just wouldn’t connect to the battery. I messaged customer service thinking they wouldn’t get back to me for several days. To my surprise the responded within the hour and by the next morning a new scanner had been shipped to me.No problem with the new device. Works perfectly. Clear scans and very fast.
4,It's faster scanning than the Epson DS-30. But the Epson moves the document directly into a PDF file into the folder on you pc. Where the Doxie moves the paper through faster but you have to open the Doxie program and import the files into it and staple the files together and export them to a PDF file. I think it's something to get used to but kinda clunky having to jump through all them hoops to get to where ya wanna go. I have to admit it's neat to be able to copy without the need for a pc until you get back to the pc to download. You could bring it with you on some job and copy all the documents and then go back to the pc and upload them all at the same time.I just like to copy my bills that arrive and sort them into seperate folders and then get rid of the paper clutter.Go digital.
5,I looked at a lot of scanners before this purchase. I have a lot of documents/receipts so I was leaning toward industrial-grade scanners but I chose this one because of two reviews on Amazon. One mentioned scanning photos in her living while watching TV and the other talked about leaving the scanner in a shared space so everyone in his household could scan and go. Both reviews made scanning seem accessible and almost fun. After the purchase I can confirm that Doxie Go embodies that representation well. I recently used it to scan several hundred receipts during an eight hour road trip to another state. It is perfect for accessibility and portability and it truly takes the hassle out of scanning. This is an excellent consumer-grade scanner and my only suggestion for improvement in the future would be adding duplex scanning capabilities. Otherwise it's a great scanner for a great price.
4,Its quite expensive but found the space saving battery life user experience and performance do make up for it. Only issue I have and occasionally continue to have is inserting the paper correctly. If its askew it won't jam during the scan but your image will distort as it rights the paper. This is annoying but decreases as you get to know the machine. I like how I can use it without a computer and its onboard storage means there is no rush to deal with the things you just scanned. Perfect for going paper less! Given I am a home user I cannot say how reliable this is for someone constantly in the field scanning dozens of pages per day but I can say the official storage case is a must. The outside plastic is flimsy in a few spots and if you don't want to constantly clean it you need to store it properly.
3,UPDATED REVIEWI originally left a 1-star review which I've left in tact below.  The next day I received an email from a Doxie customer service rep a refund and a replacement scanner with a hand written note.  That was unexpected and a very nice touch.The scanner itself will corrupt the internal memory if you use the scanner while it's plugged into a PC.  If you are primarily using it as a portable scanner you should be good to go.  If you try and use it at home primarily as an economy and small sized desktop scanner you'll likely have issues if you dont make it a point to disconnect it from your computer.  This seems like a pretty big issue to me as I was mostly looking for a convenient and decently priced scanner.  The fact that it was mobile was nice but not my primary objective.  I haven't decided what I'll do with my replacement Doxie Go but I've since switched to the Fujistu SnapScan which fits my primary needs better.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter a few months worth of use the internal storage is dead.  I've reformatted it a few times but to no avail.The scan quality is great... I just wish the rest of the device worked.  With a broken internal storage actually being able to get your scans is significantly more complicated.  It's hit-or-miss if you scan will work.
5,The scanner is working great for the intended task.  I'm scanning hundreds of old family photos to compile into a printed album.  I use it with a mac.  I'm leaving it unplugged as I scan and plugging in for the transfer since it's convenient for me.  I haven't tried the wi-fi yet. The scans are fast and save on the card in the scanner until I'm ready to upload.
5,The first product that I got was defective so I contacted customer service. They sent me a replacement which also turned out to be defective. (The battery’s would not hold a charge) they sincerely apologized and sent a second replacement. They even set up a scheduled phone call to help troubleshoot because that happening with two scanners was weird. The third was functional and suuuuper easy to use.
5,I love this little tool! I have been scanning and old photos and old family history documents and uploading them to google photos and other online archives. The Doxie is so easy to set up and use and is very affordable! I was able to scan in a bunch of pictures in just a short while while I was watching a video.Something else you may want to know is that I use Macintosh computers and it works really well with them. Macintosh upgraded to 64-bit apps which means I really am limited on the kind of scanners I can use. This Doxie works wonderfully and I am anxious to get through all my family history boxes.
5,Wish I had this product years ago. I have so many small and irregular size receipts that getting them into my large scanner is a pain. Not every piece of paper feeds perfectly but that is not a problem. I need a copy for taxes and don't care if the image is slightly turned because the whole image is there. I can feed in a square receipt at an angle and still have the whole image. I can save in a variety of formats. I can save the receipt as a jpeg and as a pdf and have both scans and more extensions may be used. Saved them all in a scanned file and then copied them to other folders I use for business just like when using the big desktop scanner. Fed in 100 pieces of paper from letters to small receipts and downloaded them from Doxie to my computer. My computer is not fast and it took about 10 minutes to download into my computer. So now when I come home with receipts I can feed them into Doxie file the paper and go back to the computer to arrange them later. No more paper piles.
4,The unit did not work from the get go. But once the company became aware they immediately arranged for a replacement at no cost essentially giving me a new Doxie scanner.  This one worked beautifully.  The software is intuitive and helps to combine and organize your documents.  These features simple and effective software fast and accurate scanning easy cropping color and contrast control make the Doxie really fun to use.The company's commitment to the user is truly impressive.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it lacks some features of slightly larger portable scanners.SincerelyStephen Kane
5,Update. I was contacted by Doxie support and given a no hassle upgrade option that only cost me the difference between the Doxie Go and the wifi model. Thank you so much for the quick turn around and resolution.I would suggest going for the wifi model.I should have gone for the wifi model. The Scanner itself works great. There is a bit of a learning curve to ensure that papers are properly fed into the scanner. I have had several misfeeds but I think I may have figured out the trick now.The software is cumbersome. While it is great that the software allows you to adjust crop rename etc. I personally am looking for an application that takes the least amount of interaction. So if the software could automatically determine a file by the date the scan was performed or better yet recognize the header of the receipt or document and use that to name the file.I am now looking at what options I would have to attach this to an external wifi module or raspberry pi to make the device have the ability to automatically upload new scans.
5,Life changing!  I discovered this in a YouTube video about minimalism as a way to get rid of hard copies of pictures in order to save space. I've had boxes of pictures that I've wanted to scan for a while now.  I've scanned some of them but using a flatbed scanner takes forever. This little baby is such a God send.  I've been able to whip through my pictures in no time.  I think in the day that I've had it I've scanned more than 1200 pictures.  The scan quality is great! I was considering this or the smaller Fuji scanner but this was smaller and cheaper so I went this route and I do not regret it.  I plan to use it to scan all my receipts and other papers I want to keep but I don't have to have the physical copy.  Paper copies come out great too.  I scanned a diploma and the scan looks just like the physical copy so much that you can see the paper grains.If you need a small easy convenient scanner you cannot go wrong here.  Very easy to use.
5,I love this product and the customer service is amazing.  I am digitizing my old photos and I did not want to spend an arm and leg for one of those high speed scanners so I took a gamble on this Dixie.  I am glad I took a gamble and I anticipate using Dixie for years to come.  I did have a slight problem.  Specifically the paper slide guide broke and Doxie quickly sent me a new unit with out any problems.  They were amazing!I definitely recommend this product because the price is good and easy to use.  Get you one!
5,This little thing is great.  I hate paperwork always losing receipts (throwing them out actually) wife says where is the receipt for taxes for the blah blah blah . . . . uugh? crazy? wow? I don't know honey :-/ ? . . . . anyway now I turn this baby on scan it then take the SD card and pop it into my mac and put the file in a folder!! Love it.
3,I am not going to rate this yet because right now I am unable to connect to Wi-fi not matter what I try. My personal Wi-fi is locked and you have to provide the password which you cannot do. I also have hotspot in which you have to provide a password.I do love that I can take the scanner anywhere and use the SD card but sometimes but I need the Wi-fi. I have a 2017 Mac Pro with the version macOS Big Sur. Can you please help me?
5,I initially gave the doxie a poor review. I'm changing my review to 5 stars now.  I ended up getting a customer service rep who responded quickly figured out that my scanner had an odd battery issue and sent me a new scanner and a case.  The new scanner is working great.  I like that it's portable and user friendly. Don't give up on customer service.  Be persistent. They'll make it right.
5,I initially purchased a different scanner in my attempts to go paperless but did not like the user interface so I returned it and purchased the Doxie SE WiFi. This was very easy to setup takes very little space and has a very intuitive interface. I will be keeping this device. The customer support has been incredible. A small company so they have a personal approach I appreciate. Not a lot of extra bells and whistles to confuse me. Pretty cut and dry and easy to use.
5,I loved the way I could scan hundreds of pictures in such a short time.  Before this I scanned them on my HP printer and it took a long time and then if you did more than one picture they had to be separated.  With the Doxie the pictures scanned fast and scanned the same size as the original.  I love this product!
5,If you are looking for a scanner that is easy to set up and use this is for you!!!  It sits right on my desk and I turn it on when needed and scan my documents.  You can literally hear with the documents are available.  Picture is great!!  I don't know how I was ever working without it!!!  5 stars all the way and a most definite need item!!!
5,The customer service from Doxie is personal and far beyond what I've experienced with any other company. Upon registering my product they sent me a welcome email with a personalized scan! They made sure I knew they were there for me if I had any questions. I emailed a question and they responded right away. I use this product in the field when working with clients and it's ease of use keeps me from toting papers around. Thanks Doxie!
4,Update: Doxie says Amazon probably caused the problem described below.  Nonetheless the customer service from Doxie was super stellar when it comes to ensuring my satisfaction with my purchase.I hope to come back and review the actual product but I use Linux and Android 99% of the time and there is basically no support for those platforms but there is for iPhone and Mac/Win.  I think a product at this level should have a development team that embraces true cross-platform compatibility (web or Chrome based?).  --And that is where the -1 star comes from.Original rant:I paid for a new product but it was clearly used and re-packed or refurbished.  The bags the adapters came in were ripped open and one of the rubber feet on the bottom was ripped off and stuck to the outside of the bag.This should be illegal if it isn't already.
5,No more Scan snap for me.  Very happy  with my new Doxie.
5,I looked at many scanners before settling on the Doxie Go. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. I have years worth of documents and didn't want to be stuck in front of the computer as I sorted through which to scan and save to Evernote. The portability of the Doxie Go let me do all my scanning while watching some TV. I was able to scan about half of my mortgage papers before the battery needed charging. Depending on your needs and comfort this might be annoying but I have a toddler so taking a break from scanning was a frequent occurrence already.I absolutely LOVE the software. It's one of the reasons I went with the Doxie Go and it didn't disappoint. The staple feature makes it super easy to group your documents and the shortcuts to tag and send to Evernote made it a snap to get my docs into Evernote without having to go and sort through it all again.The Doxie Go is also a super small footprint on my desk. It fits right under my iMac where I can just grab it to scan any recent docs whenever I sort through the mail. The Doxie Go has made going paperless a reality for me!
5,This has been my favorite purchase of 2021. I was able to use this lightweight scanner to quickly load up hundreds of photos for a memorial. It handled fragile paper very well. I use it several times a week for receipts and documents. I love how you don't have to be connected to the computer to scan documents on the go. All fives are stars *****
5,I'm only disappointed I didn't jump at purchasing the Doxie sooner. It's exactly as user-friendly and portable as described. It can scan a ton of stuff before needing to sync / upload the docs. The PDFs being searchable is exactly what I needed and the image scanning is high quality. Definitely get this if you're wanting to eliminate paper / photo clutter from your home!
5,I've only just begun using the Doxie Go SE but I do have experience with portable scanners.  The Doxie Go SE is replacing my NEAT NM1000 scanner.  The Doxie is better in all ways.  Snap to set up - no remedial software required scans faster button select 300 or 600 dpi simple.  That Doxie offers support is an improvement over NEAT.  The unit albeit slightly larger than the NEAT is built to a higher standard is light and very portable.  That the Doxie Go SE doesn't require a laptop/computer because it has a memory chip is great!
5,Love the convenience of this scanner.  I have the doxie picture scanner and adding this will allow me to easily scan the larger pictures and treasures of my family history.  It's also perfect for everyday scanning of documents etc.  I'm finding new ways to use it regularly.  Took a little bit of work to get the scanner to use my local home WiFi instead of its internal WiFi.  But worked it out fairly quickly.
5,I love this device!  Sure there are a lot of portable scanners but few are as portable. This has a battery that lasts long enough internal memory to scan many pages and it's light enough to throw in my backpack if I'll be out scanning a lot during the day.Arguably I'm not the most heavy scanner in the world but when I need something scanned it scans. And it scans well!!Update 11/19 - my issues with my original review (below) and document jamming appears to be isolated. Working with Doxie I was able to quickly swap out my scanner for another one and all is well. Doxie has amazing customer support. They quickly responded to emails and shipped me a replacement device with a handwritten note. Wow!  Who does that?!?!  Thanks Doxie you've got me for life now!  You had me at "scan"!  Show me the scanning!  (Seriously though Doxie rules!)Original Review:Jams constantly and won't feed paper. My phone does a better job!
3,Difficult to set up on wi-fi network.
5,I really like this scanner.  I have used it to scan 100’s of photos and probably a thousand document pages by now and I have no real complaints.* It is fast.* It crops the scan to the correct image boundary perfectly.* The scan color and sharpness quality is quite good.* I’ve scanned perhaps 200 pages on one charge and have not ran out of battery power yet.* I love the portability of no PC or power connection required to scan.  Very convenient.* The included  2 GB SD-card has ample capacity.What I like the most: The included PC software is way easier and faster to use than the several others I’ve fought with over the years.What I like the least: Importing by plugging the SD-card into my PC is easy but slow.  Importing via WiFi is even slower and not as easy.  I paid for the WiFi option but never use it.
4,Amazing device for the price but it isn't magic.It handles receipts with ease can have trouble with letter sized documents especially if there are folds in the paper creating the occasional smeared scan so perhaps double check if it is something important.I scan every day and dump them to the laptop every month or so to process OCR and file away. Unfortunately it does not record the time or date when the receipt was scanned only the time and date when it was imported leaving me with a pile of PDFs with the same date in the name. Not a dealbreaker.Using an eye-fi card may reduce the time between imports but it still needs to connect to my laptop when it is on and initiate an import. This only will send JPGs but then Doxie loses the ability to run OCR on these files. Be aware it is your computer that sends the files up to Dropbox or Evernote and not the scanner itself.Enjoy!
5,This is a great portable scanner. Easy setup only takes a few minutes. This is my second wireless scanner and I’m so impressed by the progress since my last scanner that finally gave out after about 10 years. I love being able to scan to the sd card. Can’t think of anything I would add to make it better. Going paperless is getting better all the time. Great for pictures too.
4,Setup was easy. Scanning was easy too I just set up an area on a table so I could rapidly scan pages one after the other. Not having it need a computer to work really helps and speeds up the process. Software was pretty good OCR worked great! Much improvement since the last time I tried using OCR several years ago. However I got an error when I tried to use OCR a large document (approx 200 pages) but I remedied this by making two documents and then having a separate problem merge them together. Short of fixing that a "merge PDF" function on its own would be a nice perk to the software. I am looking forward to having an easily transportable scanner to help my in laws with their documents.
5,This scanner has been an easy fast way to get digital copies of my family photos.  I literally have thousands of photos I have inherited and I want to keep them stored to share with family in the future.  It scans them quickly and clearly.  The color is perfect and accurate.  The transfer to my computer from the scanner is simple and was easy to set up.  I haven't experienced any problems yet.  So I definitely give it a 5 star!!!  Highly recommend!
5,I absolutely love Doxie. You can not get anything easier to use. Scan the papers in and when you have time hook it up to your pc to organize staple and save how you want. Save as jpeg pdf etc. The Doxie team even takes the time to contact you to find out how you like their product. I could not be happier with it. Definitely worth buying!
5,I debated and debated amongst a number of similar portable scanners. Took nearly a full week for me to settle on the Doxie Go Wi-Fi. My reluctance with the Doxie was it's apparent simplicity. Too simple to imagine my investing in relation to price. But --- I got tired of comparing scanners and just clicked on Buy --- the Doxie Go Wi-Fi.Wow! I'm ecstatic at how awesome this scanner is! EASY setup! EASY wi-fi connect! So pleased with small portability --- easy tuck-away storage when finished using.Not a complaint but a suggestion: Switching resolution between 300 and 600 would be better served with two buttons rather than single button.Doxie software is perfect! Haven't yet tried document scanning as my primary purpose is genealogy-related vintage photos including cloth-inked late 1800's images. SD Card option is nice for transporting scans to different computer.Doxie has covered all bases with its small size excellent software cloud storage wi-fi image transfer and cleanup after scanning is finished.Did I mention that image quality is superb!?
1,It broadcasts its own local Wifi signal that you can join but that will connect you to the Doxie for importing but disconnect you from the internet. You need 802.11n WiFi and 2.4Ghz ONLY if you want to try to get it to join your home network; but it won't.  If you also have a 5GHz channel it will not work. It will not join your own home network. The process of trying to get Doxie to join your network is frustrating in the extreme. Overall I spent 2 hrs on my own and 2 hrs with their help desk (they are very nice but I think they need to be and they even sent me a replacement) and this simply will not connect to your home network. It's a simple battery (or AC adapter but not included) scanner light-weight portable. It scans quickly and you can  save your scans on the included 8GB SD card and import when you are ready. You can import your scans by linking using a USB and the Doxie App. The software  imports and enables you to save as searchable docs e.g. OCR pdf and then delete scans; there is no recognition software that automatically identifies or sorts your scans into e.g. invoices utility bills statements proposals etc. You have to file them all manually. If you are not bothered about it joining your home network and are happy to use USB or its local WiFi network which will disconnect your PC from the internet then go ahead. I would not bother with the WiFi version. The Doxie mobile app is hopeless and will not find your Doxie scanner even when your smartphone is on the same network and sitting right on top of the scanner. Overall nice idea sweet portable scanner hopeless software and virtually useless WiFi. I sent both of mine back and asked for a refund.
5,I saw and read about it online and needed to get buy one. I want to go digital with all my files and shred a lot of papers so i bought it with the case. The setup was easy. The software was also easy to install. I fully charged the scanner before using and when it finished a couple hours later i turned it on. I started scanning birth certificates IDs business cards and a couple of photos. All scans were fast and the quality of each was surprisingly good. All the files are easy to read and when they are printed they look exactly the same as the original. The photos came out real good and can be adjusted in the software suite for brightness saturation etc. The software suite is where to import all the files after plugin the scanner in via USB. The importing was fairly good not too slow. In the suite you can save photos or the files as jpeg and PDFs and you can also "staple" similar items together like taxes for example. With the separate case i cam put it in my bag without worries of scratching or damaging it. I highly recommend this scanner. Buy the case too it's needed.
5,I have liked everything about my new Doxie GO SE.  It was very easy to get set up and working even for someone technology-challenged like me.  The scanning of photos was fast.  It is easy to edit and rename before filing away.  And the technical support is excellent.  Bryon set up a call with me to make sure that I was not having any problems and said they would be available any time I had questions or needed support.  I highly recommend this scanner for photos which is what I am mainly using this for.
5,I bought the Doxie after researching portable scanners.  My intention was to use it for genealogical purposes but the scanner is so easy to use and produces such quality images that it has become my go-to scanner while at home or away.  The company's business model is impressive; following my purchase a representative from Doxie contacted me to solicit whether my experiences with the scanner were positive/negative and inquire if I had suggestions for improvements.  Quality affordability and ease of use from an excellent scanner produced by a top-tier company.
5,I’ve been using my Doxie to scan old photos to save  a digital copy. Their customer service is great.  Someone reached out to me to see if I had any questions- I did- and I got a response from a real person.  I’m not a techy person but I have been doing fine figuring it out.  I like that I can use the Doxie WiFi to send photos to my phone. Or I can upload to my computer.
5,I really like my Doxie SE with WiFi. I wanted a portable scanner with its own memory so I would not need to connect to another device. I used the online help once and the staff was very helpful in answering my question. The Doxie scans quickly and it's easy to export the files. I highly recommend this scanner.
5,I love this little scanner! It’s fast and so portable that I can bring the scanner to my piles of paper instead of lugging the piles to my desk. Customer service is warm and helpful. This model uses either sd card or usb cable to transfer the images. I needed it to work with my iPad but discovered that an sd adapter won’t work for this so I’m getting the wifi enabled model instead. Very pleased and looking forward to going paperless in my house!
4,Great scanner with useful software interface. My only issue is sometimes the scanner doesn’t move to the WiFi function (the white light doesn’t blink when WiFi button is pressed) and you have to try again. At other times the white light will blink right away as it is supposed to but scanner is slow to connect to WiFi.
5,I bought this scanner for a massive digitising project I'm working on for my family. I have thousands of photos to scan and this little scanner appealed to me for it's lightweight design and built in photo correction software. It's so simple to set up and use.The customer service team is super sweet and go above and beyond to make sure you're satisfied. Speaking to them feels like talking to friends.
5,Bought this to scan photos but started with some documents.  Within 15 minutes I was scanning. Make sure you find all the little tabs to pull off.  I have a Mac and the interface is super simple.  Earlier reviews seemed to indicated some issues with the software with Macs but I didn't have any.  The staple feature to pull multi-page documents into one file is great as well. Finally if the SD card isn't all the way in the scanner won't scan.  Make sure you hear the click.
5,Update after 1.5 months and 450+ scans: I've scanned pictures hand-written student sonnets spirit ribbons (from high school pep rallies 10 years ago) handwritten class notes printed 8.5x11 paper postcards and a few misc. items. A few documents have gotten stuck and had a very smeary scan but with a couple of retries the problem was resolved. Most documents scanned the first time with no problem. Some of my documents (especially newspaper articles) have more of a pink tint than other scanners I've used but the quality overall is good (sufficient for my effort to cut down on paper during prep for a cross-country move). The software is limited but it allows for users to adjust the tilt crop and rotate. Users can save as .jpeg or .pdf and scans can be "stapled" in the software to be a multi-page .pdf. I've also been very impressed with Doxie customer service. They've reached out to me for survey feedback and offered support via email.  Overall: Easy to use scanner simple but user-friendly software quick scan time portable. So far I'm quite impressed.
4,Only had it about a month but so far I like it.Pros:Easy setup simple to use scans are quick and good resolution.Cons:Probably more me than the machine but about half of my scans are ever so slightly crooked.  I try to line it up perfectly but the scan sometimes is off.  This is a minor issue but that's why the 1 star deduction.  I wish it had a little notch or something to line it up before it starts scanning.  It grabs quick.Also a side note.  You don't really need to download their software for PC.  When you plug it in file explorer sees it as an external drive and you can view the JPG's right on the scanner and copy them to your PC.
5,This scanner is extremely easy to use and makes it possible to quickly scan hundreds of photos or documents in a tiny fraction of the time it takes with a flatbed scanner. You can do it on the fly no computer needed at the time of scanning.I also received a personal call from customer service just to see how the product was working. This is an awesome American business that cares about their customers!
3,I like the portability and simplicity of this scanner. Unfortunately It was always giving me problems. I didn't care for the way it worked. I usually had problems feeding the scanner with odd shaped paper like reciepts or pages with a small or slight tear. It would often rotate the paper slightly while feeding and I'd end up with bad scans. I rarely was able to scan something once and have it turn out well. My happiest moment with this scanner was when I got rid of it. I wanted to like this product but I found that my cellphone scanning app is faster has no problems with paper feeding and delivers similar or better quality. Save your money and use your phone or try the Fujitsu which supposedly has less feeding issues.UPDATE: The company has addressed the paper feeding issue and they have reached out to me to see if I like it better. I haven't had enough time to give it a full assessment but their effort to make their product better and to try and make their customers happy has made me change my review from a 1 star to 3 star. (I may change the stars as I spend more time with this scanner.)
3,First off I think rave reviews about this product are results of fake reviewing tactics!So This things has a potential it makes your life easier but it has some big and some manageable  flaws:1-The mechanical design is flaws as in most of the time one of side of the paper is pulled in instead of both. You have hold both end and gently push it in. Well if you have alot of mails and stuff that you need to scan this task becomes tedious real quick2-The save and transfer operation is slow  so again if you have 20 things to scan you need to be patient3- You cant scan a long doc like auto lease .The manageable issue:1- You can easily indicate that you are scanning pages that are part of a bundle you need to do that in software.2- Other one is is that its a one-sided scanner; given that many correspondences are printed on one side you are ok but then if you have like 20 pages of stupid docs that you get from a cheap insurance company good luck scanning those.Button line for scanning one or two pages per week this thing is awesome but as the number of docs increase the tediousness  of the task exponentially increases.
4,Lightwgt good photo quality of scans paid for a wifi version but it dies not work as s wifi product in my house. Kinda bummed. Also a little confusing where the scanned items end up. I need to save them to a new backup drive that houses recovered desktop & data from a corrupted desktop computer & its corrupted backup drive. Sometimes things dont want yo go straight there & i have to save to current desktop & drag over.  However once I get in the groove I can go thru stacks of paperwork. Much faster than my Canon all-in-one printer/fax/copier/scanner—which is still a great product....  I am basically happy w/the Doxie purchase. The problems may be non-techie user error.
5,This little Doxie may be small but it is very mighty! Scanned 1500 photos and 50 paper documents in a 3 days... all while watching binge watching TV at the same time. Photos and documents scanned very clear! It saved me months of work as I was originally going to buy a flat bed scanner. But this Doxie fed each photograph and documents with ease without ruining or leaving roller marks on the pictures. I definitely recommend this product!
5,This is one of the most helpful items I've gotten in a long time.  It's easy to use its got a great program that comes along with it and the OCR technology is some of the best I've seen.  In addition the customer service for Apparent is really and truly the best I've ever dealt with in my adult life.  I had an issue with the first generation scanner I got from them and they immediately offered to fix the issue no questions asked.  That is head and shoulders above most companies I've dealt with.  I would highly recommend this device if you are on the go and trying to be as paperless as possible.  My wife is a teacher and she loves it as well!  So the biggest problem I have with this device is that I have to share it!I rarely review products and I rarely say only nice things about anything but I seriously couldn't be happier with my scanner.
5,I've scanned about 300 photos as of now and it only took 1-2 hours. Great scan quality easy user interface on my Macbook super easy and extremely fast in comparison to flat bed scanners. My favorite feature is that I can scan an old photo twice (front and back to capture the writing on the back of the photo) and the software allows me to "link" the two photos together which export to their own separate subfolder; perfect for when grandma writes out who is who in the photo.
5,I am delighted with the ease of using this small scanner - it is simple to set up and I have been able to connect it to my local network with no problems. The scans are clear and transport quickly to my computer. I like the portability of the Doxie and it's size - in a small house I have no interest in flatbed scanners or fancy printers.  The Doxie is perfect for me. Setup instructions are simple and the customer service is great.
5,I purchased the "Doxie Go Wi-Fi" earlier this year and I love the quality and portability. I purchased this specifically for traveling - visiting family and scanning old photos. Super light easy to transport through TSA (do not need to remove from bag) long battery life ample memory and user-friendly software. Works perfectly with my MacBook Pro. I chose this model over the others based on the convenience of wifi connection which is awesome... and the high reviews. My fellow consumers did not let me down!I also purchased the case "Doxie A4 Case". It is also good quality sturdy sleek design and the scanner fits perfectly inside but maybe too perfectly? ...the only downer is that the USB/power cord does not fit in the case... don't forget the power cable like me!!Product feedback: potential for the next model to have a retractable cable? OR slightly larger case -- I like retractable cable.. knowing the product will need to be slightly larger.
5,The quality of scan is excellent and I love the portability but... the fact that it's portable is also a possible weakness. I finally really started trusting it and one day scanned about 100 documents. I made the mistake of shredding the documents as I scanned them. When I went to import them it somehow only kept the last 30 or so and the rest were corrupted into a single multi-gigabyte file that could not be recovered. Never get rid of originals until they're safely imported off the scanner.I'm upping my review to 5 stars because the support from Doxie is so top notch. They sent me a new unit and are investigating the issue I had which doesn't seem to be very common. I still recommend keeping originals until you're absolutely sure they are imported and backed up but that goes with any scanner.
5,I've been wanting to scan the hundreds of old family photos I have for years but using my printer/scanner was so cumbersome and time consuming I didn't get very far. I thought I'd give this little scanner a try and I'm so glad I did! It's great! I flew through hundreds of photos in no time at all. One album had about 250 photos in it and I got through it in around an hour. The process with my old printer/scanner took about 3 minutes to get through just one photo. I love that it has the option to scan either onto the Doxie itself or directly onto a thumb drive. I read a review that said it was hard to get the photo to feed straight but I didn't find that to be an issue. You do have to pay attention as you insert it but it was easy. I only had a few that I had to rescan because I wasn't paying attention and it went in crooked. I definitely recommend this scanner.
5,I wanted to digitize all of my family photos which was a huge undertaking since.there were more than 5000 pictures.  This scanner actually made many of the photos look better than the originals.  Once I figured out how to connect to WiFi everything went perfectly.  Could not be more pleased.
2,Consistency will jam after the initial mini feed and will start to tear up the paper. If you hold it perfectly until it starts feeding the paper it works but gets old after doing a few pages.
5,My 70-ish parents have boxes of old photos.  I wanted them to have a chance to scan all the pictures they liked but didn't want them to carry a laptop everywhere.  This was a Christmas gift and it's paid off in spades.  They took the scanner on vacation and sat around scanning pictures during their breaks.  The pictures are stored on a memory card so they don't have worry much.  All-in-all a great purchase!
5,I normally don't write reviews. However I am really impressed with the Doxie Scanner. It's so cool. It's very small and light weight. Learning to use it takes seconds. Just turn it on and start scanning. I have a Windows laptop so it didn't need any setup. Just plug in the USB and follow the prompts to view and edit photos. The included software is seamless and allows you to store your photos and documents on your computer or cloud. It's all very easy.I'd also like to add the great customer service. The folks at Doxie go above and beyond to make sure your experience exceeds expectations. They followup on your use and product satisfaction to make sure you don't have any issues. I wish more companies would take lessons from Doxie customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.
5,I just scanned ALL my papers: thin receipts thick card stock some semi-bumpy greeting cards some laminated study sheets and a good amount of pictures. All went great and the software automatically crops each scanned item to its size and in 99% of cases it was right on (I had one weird card stock that it cropped slightly too small but that is adjustable). It is nice that this is portable and battery powered so I just take it over to wherever my stack of papers exists sit down on the floor feed the pages in and throw them away. Then I plunk the little card into my computer (or plug in the usb connection) and import the scans into Doxie's simple and clear interface. I was worried scanning would be unreliable and rickety but on the contrary this product is well-built and a solid tool to keep me paper free.
5,I've had the Doxie for less than 24 hours and I'm already loving it. I've been looking for a way to speed up receipt scans and the Doxie is perfect I'm burning through months of them quickly. I do wish that it could scan longer receipts (>15 inches) but I've found that folding and running the receipt works well. So far no problems with crumpled or slightly mangled receipts but you do want the leading edge to be clean for the scanner to grab it.  The scanner is small and will store easily.  I've tried scanning directly to the Doxie's built in storage as well as an SD card and both work great.  The software works well it's deceivingly simple. That said I'd like to see some better presets to batch adjust scans (example: Make all greyscale and boost contrast in single step). Right now this is two steps but not any deal breaker.  If you've been scanning receipts with a flatbed grab one of these the time saved will be well worth the cost.
5,I'm currently working on a massive photo archival project of my family photos and will need take the scanner with me to places near and far to scan photos decades upon decades old to present day. The scanner has been very helpful to quickly work through photos and help preserve them digitally and for more people to enjoy them. The scanner has also been helpful to digitalize my various academic documents and other sentimental/important documents. I greatly appreciate the overall quality of the scans and customer service I've received.
4,A few months ago I made the decision to stop hoarding paper.  I have network storage in my house I have off-site backup keeping paper is mostly useless.  I did most of the work with the flatbed and ADF on my all-in-one printer but it got very tedious.  With the Doxie Go I can come home take a receipt out of my wallet scan it and throw it away.  I don't need to be sitting at my computer - I'll just import everything when I actually have time for it.  The Doxie Go is also a godsend for business travel.  I can scan all of my documentation and not have to worry about losing it and can very easily submit to my company on my return.  The battery life is good and it charges with standard mini-USB so no problems there.  All in all a fantastic tool!
5,bought this for home use.  beginning it is good. but after couple time of use the on/off button was not working and cannot get the machine to turn on.only able to use for couple of time as not a daily use item.do not recommend as piece of Junk that able to use less than 5 times of purchase.
5,Doxie customer service reached out to me after I ordered the wrong version. They were so great. They helped me get the right Doxie for what I need. I scanned 33 receipts in just a couple of minutes. Setting up the WiFi took seconds and then I just clicked import and it took just a few seconds to import all of them.  I am not only impressed with the Doxie Go Se WiFi; I am impressed with their customer service.
4,I like it Works well for documents biz primarily what I will use it for  WI-FI a little funky easiest just to let it create its own unsecured network instead of trying to figure out when its actually attached to yours private NET  If your not scanning a confabulated  Copy of Trumps  bathroom breaks  there should be no worries in the event a Russian hacker find out he has two bowl movements a day as recommended - enjoy for educational/Biz use canot comment on photos yet though will start today scanning a couple hundred or recently deceased Dad and Mom and Family  Pics going back to the 40's :)
5,I've put off scanning tons of old pictures because I knew how time consuming it would be on my flatbed.  This little guy has been awesome.  Very easy to use.  At first I didn't think the battery and ability to scan away from a computer was a big deal but it is.  Very nice to just sit at a table scan everything and then import to a computer.  What an amazing time saver.  Good quality scans too.  A couple old pictures didn't seem that great at first until I actually looked close up at the pictures themselves and found the originals didn't provide much better resolution.  Test scans on my flatbed show this scanner to be pretty close in quality.
3,I complained about the battery life and the length of time it took to recharge it on the original unit that I received. However I learned later that this is due to my misuse of the unit. The unit was designed to be charge through the USB terminal of a laptop whereas I was using a third-party charger.Also the unit was designed to scan with the battery as source of power; not pluggged-in on a third-party charger.  Upon learning of my review the company that markets this item - Apparent - shipped me their latest model complete with it's own international charger and threw in a case for it for good measure. A Customer Rep/Sales person personally phoned me to arranged this and seemed intent to make sure everything is to my satisfaction.  I've been using my nice little Doxie scanner for weeks now and it's exactly what I was looking for. It's very reliable it's easy to use it's very portable - I have it in my briefcase all the time - inside the case of course. I love the fact that you can stick an SD card at the back - up to 32 GB I think - where you can store hundreds of scanned document without having to reload.  You can't go wrong with a Doxie scanner I highly recommend it.
5,Had an initial issue with the battery and the company couldn't have responded faster - sent a whole new Doxie when all I needed was a new battery.  I just pull a file drawer out place this on top of the manila folders and scan away as I pull stuff out I need.  Things are out and back into the manila folders in seconds no misplacing anything or procrastinating on having to file a big pile of stuff I had to take out to copy.  Photos go through great as well.  Obviously you'll need a flatbed scanner for some things such as pages in books and things bigger than will fit through the width of this scanner but if you're visiting family and just want to scan old photos this is ideal.  I also purchased the case.
5,I'm still trying to learn how to use some features and how to best organize what's scanned because this particular model doesn't allow you to pick between PDF or photo until the scans are uploaded (onto the laptop in my case).  I kind of wish I'd realized this before picking this model.  But I'll get used to it.  However this company isn't just into customer service they are into CUSTOMER CARE.  In this day and age where I feel that consumers have to beg and plead for help from the manufacturers and sellers Doxie is a breath of delightful fresh air!
2,I'm really into film photography and I thought this would be the perfect solution to a quick way of scanning all my photographs. It just doesn't scan dark photos well. When I look at a photo itself I can still see dark silhouettes or the shadows in a photo but when I scan with the Doxie it's way too dark to see any details I see just looking at the photo in my hand. No doubt this thing is a great product it's easy to use since it's just a simple plug with the downloadable software or you can just plug in the SD card but if you're a photographer and you shoot a lot of film photos and frequently scan them it just isn't going to pick up colors correct. I even ran some Polaroids (Impossible Project film and Polaroid Originals film both in 600) through it and it just wasn't getting the colors right on a lot of them.I included some scans of film photos I took that just didn't show up bright enough. I can't even adjust them through the scanner software since it doesn't save the changes i've made. Going to have to send this back and stick to my flatbed until they come up with a better version of the Doxie scanner itself. The photos I included are one from the Doxie and one from my old Canon flatbed. The one from the flat bed has a bit of dust on the photo but you see a lot more details (the actual lettering of the marquee) than the one that the Doxie scanned.
5,Before purchasing this scanner I had not been familiar with the Doxie brand. I have been pleasantly surprised with this little portable scanner. I have found that the battery holds a charge well and the ease of use is beyond compare. I like a feature I don't use much but works well; it will scan plastic card like insurance cards or drivers licenses. I also purchase the case designed for the scanner and have reviewed it separately. This scanner works so well that I find I use it more for quick scans than I do my desktop scanner. The only thing I might change if I could is that the SD card slot does not let an inserted SD card fit flush with the scanner body. Thus you must remove the SD card in order to place the scanner in the case. This really is not that big of an issue as the scanner does have adequate internal storage. Overall I think if you give this little scanner a try you will be very pleased.
1,Scanned receipts or papers consistently get caught on the rollers or guides and wont feed. Have to pull receipts back out and try again however now that they are bent where they got caught on the first try feeding is even harder to get to work. Wider the scanned paper the worse the problem. Terrible design on the feeders rest of it works fine when it actually feeds.
3,In my mind spending nearly $200 on a scanner these days should give you fairly robust features. While Doxie has helpful tech support this device was not easy to set up.Wireless setup: The documentation was limited in explaining this to the point that I thought I had a lemon product.Scanning: No duplex scanning or batch scanning so you must slowly push through pages one at a time and end up with several separate files if you are not quick enough.OCR: The files come out as OCR file types but you have to do some maneuvering to get then OCR ready.Software: The Windows software to access your scans is clunky and slow with either wireless or cable connections. The mobile app is clunky as well but a bit more convenient to get your scans on the go.Conclusion: For the clunky and limited software capabilities the price doesn't justify the purchase. I returned mine within a few days.
5,This is so easy to set up and use. I bought it for my Mom (74) to digitize old photos. She picked it up very easily. Highly recommend.
5,This has been a valuable addition to my IT toolkit (the amazon account is my wife's but I'm writing as the primary user of the scanner). I'm an IT consultant and was looking for a portable scanner to take with me to various on-site jobs where I perform audits and assess IT infrastructure. There are alot of receipts and invoices during these visits that I need to scan-in and the locations sometimes do not have the capability or working equipment to accommodate my needs. Yes the charging issue is a problem but I usually have my laptop with me and am working near an outlet so it has not negatively affected my use of the product.I had an issue with my scanner several months in and used the form on the Doxie website to ask about it. Within an hour a Doxie customer support representative emailed me back and after one or two emails of troubleshooting in the course of an early afternoon I received confirmation that a new scanner was on its way. Highly recommended !
1,I rarely need this scanner. Since purchased in 2018 each time I pulled it off the shelf to use it failed to charge and light up green. New battery replaced in order to use yet sitting on the shelf for months failed to operate again. I would say this to be one of my worst electronic choices in my life; having poor rediculous value for me.
5,Have only had this for a week but already find it indispensable. I am a freelance writer and author with most of my projects having to do with local and rural history. So I travel a lot often copying documents in out of the way local history offices and at kitchen tables of interviewees. No longer need to find a copy machine or copy shop -- and no longer need to pay for copies. Scanned a 20-page document in a couple of minutes yesterday while I finished a cup of coffee offered by an interviewee. Sheet feed is smooth. Has internal storage so you can transfer docs later to your computer via a USB cord. But easier way is to pop a zip drive in the back scan and then pop the zip drive into your computer later. Have copied high res (600 dpi) pictures successfully even some delicate historic pictures. Definitely buy the case it's nice and sturdy. This stays in my briefcase I take it everywhere with me now.
5,Right out of the box I popped in the provided SD card scanned a document put the SD card in my Chromebook and sent the document via email in JPG format.  How easy is that?  I grabbed my USB-C to USB-A adapter and plugged in the provided USB cable (micro to A) into my Pixel.  There was the document.  I could have sent it from my phone.  My only complaint is that the USB connector is micro and not C.  I still give it 5 of 5.
5,I've taken to storing everything in Evernote using my Scansnap Evernote edition scanner but that one is too big to carry on trips. This Doxie Go is perfect for that purpose. Scanning is easy and needs no attached computer at all the scans are stored onboard until you get a chance to import them. If you need more storage then it handles SD cards or USB sticks but for me the onboard is fine.The desktop software (PC or MAC) pulls in the scans and lets you manipulate them in many ways. When you're ready it exports to several different programs (Evernote included) or cloud storage.It charges either through USB or the included brick. You can't scan and charge via USB though. To scan and charge at the same time you need the brick. But I think you would only need that if you were going to scan many documents at once.I recommend getting the A4 case to go along with it to keep dust and such out of it in the suitcase.
4,We had trouble with our first Doxie. I left a review stating that. Someone from the Doxie team followed up quickly and made things right. We got a new unit and it works great. Someone even emailed me to make sure all was well with our new unit.I was not pleased at first but must give credit where credit is due here... positive customer service experience and I appreciate the extra effort.
5,I've owned my Doxie Go Plus for about nine months now for the slow process of converting paper docs to electronic form so I can ditch the hard copies. I don't have much time to use it very often so it's nice being able to keep it in a desk drawer out of the way and pull it out when needed. And when I do use it it's so straightforward - just turn it on feed docs though then plug it into to my PC via USB and let the Doxie desktop app do its magic. It has all the options I need (especially stapling docs and OCR) and before you know it your docs are all scanned and good to go.The only finicky things I found were that the import of scans process can be a bit slow and some of the shortcuts in the desktop app aren't the most intuitive. Beyond that definitely recommend!
5,This lightweight scanner is very fast it seems to take about 4 seconds to scan a picture. I hunted a good while for a wifi scanner that had a memory card. I wanted to simplify the process of sharing photos with family members. This scanner was perfect and the price was good.
4,The scanner itself is great! 5 stars for Doxie but 3 stars for the “Wifi” model. I should not have paid more for WiFi as it’s nearly impossible to set up. I just plug it in with a cord to laptop instead and it’s simple and easy to upload documents and “staple” into multi page PDF. Good for photos and easy to save into folders.
2,I tested photos and documents on both 300dpi and 600dpi and just wasn't happy with the quality.  Even the print on a bill I used as a test was a little fuzzy.  Every photo I tested was fuzzier than the original even on 600 dpi.  The dark was darker  the light was lighter and it didn't duplicate color.  To use for photos I'd have to edit almost every one and there still wouldn't be the resolution I wanted.  Maybe OK if all you want them for is paper documents that are readable but not photo quality.  Also the Doxie software didn't allow for enlarging the document sufficiently to allow for making effective adjustments to the default settings. The software license allows for installation on one computer only - since I work on a desktop and a laptop that doesn't work for me.  Also the WiFi option is unsecured meaning anyone in range can connect with it.  Nope.
5,This little device is perfect for the person who wishes to begin the archive process of documents and photos. I especially like the portability of Doxie and it tenets text and images very faithfully. Their customer support is a model for other companies. They genuinely wish to assist you in getting the most out of their products. 6 stars
5,I use this for uploading old family photos to move them to a digital world. It's so easy to use and the quality of pictures are great! The customer service is also fantastic. My husband uses this to scan documents and create searchable PDFs so it works great for both of our needs. Overall I'm very happy with my Doxie scanner!
5,This scanner is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use easy to carry with you and easy to set up. I just throw it in my laptop bag with my laptop and hit the road. I was also impressed with how much the customer feedback means to the company.  If you are looking for a dependable and efficient  small/portable scanner then the Doxie is perfect.
5,This product is exactly what I was hoping it would be. Super easy to use right out of the box. I did charge it a bit while I read over the quick start guide and gathered up some things I wanted to scan. I’ve scanned over 1K photos/documents so far. All my scans look so good when viewing them on the computer. So glad I purchased this!
5,This product is great. I scanned a lifetime of pictures (and more) in just three days. The image quality is very good. I read all the reviews before making a purchase and there are a lot of valuable hints to be found there.
5,Love this little machine. Easy to use! I bought this so i can always have a copy of old pictures. I was able to upload them to a photobook site and made many copies to share with family members!
5,This case is terrific.  It is strong and offers great protection if you are someone (like me) who totes their scanner back and forth to work regularly.  I have a Doxie Go SE scanner and it fits perfectly inside.  There is a space inside the case to store the memory card and the cord and there is a helpful strap on the outside of the case.  I absolutely love it .  It measures about 3 1/2 wide 13 inches long and about 2 1/2 inches deep.  It fits easily into my briefcase.  I wouldn't recommend transporting your scanner around without it!
5,This is an excellent scanner. There are two features I would like to mention.  First the quality of the scans is excellent particularly for a portable scanner.  Second it is easy to set up.  It seems these days that so many items particularly the wireless types are very difficult to set up.  Not this one.  It was easy and fast.  The operation is intuitive. Finally it really is portable.
1,I wanted to like this scanner so much with all of the previous reviews but the scanner would not scan thermal receipts that I need to scan for work.  The sample page they give you to scan is a thicker type of paper and scanned very easily but when I tried to scan normal paper it kinda worked but didn't work at all with thermal paper.
5,If you have a Mac and DevonThink go for a scan-snap; I had that set up at work and it made scanning and saving items a million times easier than the scanning I was doing at home.That said if you don't have the $2000 to drop on a Mac $500 for the scansnap and $300 for the Devon Think this $200-$300 option is phenomenal!  It takes a little bit of trial and error maybe a sheet or two of scanning but generally speaking it is very intuitive easy to work with set up is pretty clear and practically walks you through everything and it has made organizing my papers and life a heck of a lot easier!  This is one of the best purchases I have made in years that is not food related.  I would buy this all over again.
5,I've had my doxie scanner for a little over 5 years now. I use it a couple of times a month and I'm extremely happy with the scanner performance and reliability. There are times when I don't get everything lined up and the scan comes out crooked but that's mainly due to user error. I highly recommend for light use.
5,This scanner has everything I was looking for.  I didn't want a "portable" scanner that you had to hook into a computer to use.  (That's not exactly "portable" in my book)  Here I just have to turn it on scan the document or business card and then later it all downloads to my computer.  Why I haven't been able to find more products like this I don't know.  The convenience seems so obvious.The software is also easy to use and easy to figure out.I work as a college instructor and I've been looking to go paperless and this is helping a lot to go that way.  While I get papers from students on hard copy I can grade them scan them and hand them back so I always have a copy of their work for my own records and it doesn't take up any space at home.
3,The scanner  scans what you would need it to (documents photos etc). Its small portable and get the job done. The only downside would be the scan time or something when scanning documents it will scan longer then it which leaves a yellow portion in the scanned document.
5,Scanner was easy to use right out of the box.  Nice size quality scans 300 and 600 dpi wireless connectivity excellent.  Had to order case and a/c adapter separately.  User instructions and product support excellent.  Only difficulty may be connecting to LAN but have been using Doxie's and works fine.  I would buy again and recommend.
4,It does 300 and 600 but the file size for a document is too large at these settings. I use this to scan my bills in after they are paid and then toss the bill paperwork. It needs a 150 dpi setting for things like this were resolution being high isn't as important.
5,Revision: This is a great product; I personally had issues with it and did not attempt to call for help (I am not tech savoy) but you do not have to be apparently. Anyway the company reached out to me reimbursing and wanted to give all the help necessary to operate  the scanner. Good people buying from and a good product as well 5 stars. Simply too difficult for me to use. Maybe its just me; i followed the instructions but there were to many complications for it to be productive for me. I needed it for recording receipts because there are so many as i am a building contractor. It was easier to just scan to my computer from my printer. Haven't used since i made the attempt to set it up :(
5,I love this little scanner. I bought it two years ago and recently the power cord stopped working. I asked the company if I could buy another one from them and they put one in the mail to me the next day free of charge!
4,I bought it for mass photo scanning at my parent's without having to bring the photos home and to do them fast.The scanner meets my speed requirements and the portability requirements.The scans of the photos however are noticeable inferior to a conventional standard scan in a flatbed scanner. I knew this would probably be the case and was willing to sacrifice some color as I wanted to do an initial massive photo digitization so it's OK within my expectations it met it's purpose well.I just wanted to make it clear to all that photo scanning is not the strength of this little machine though for me it was still the solution to scan a few thousand photos in some hours: I have scanned 1000 photos in 2hs to provide an idea.
5,After my dad died I was desperate for a way to get all of our old photos into a digital picture frame for his funeral. Doxie made that so easy. After the funeral I decided to convert all of our old family pictures into digital format so I spent hours scanning about 4000 loose photos and greeting cards onto a SD card. They all converted really well and look great. Instead of sitting in a bin collecting dust our family photos actually get looked at now.My boyfriend has also used Doxie to convert his grandmother's handwritten family recipes into a digital format so he could easily have them without having to copy down her notes. This little scanner has changed our lives for the better.
5,I use this with the MOST RECENT versions of Windows 10 Office and Adobe because they are all cloud services and updated constantly and YES as of this writing in 2018 this unit and it's software perform flawlessly with all PC and MAC o/s's great little unit.Customer service also is wildly responsive with this purchase bugging you constantly (in a good way) to be sure you're flying this little lear jet well. They've responded with many hints and tips ("will staple work with jpg's in the software to create a postable magazine or photo album on Google Drive? Can I airdrop it? etc. etc.!).Awesome device and after trying a dozen others including the amazing $500 Fuji this one is my go to unit for sure.
5,So simple to get up and going the app and directions are spot on. If your looking to go paperless this high quality scanner will amaze you. Very fast and it transfers the scans to your PC or Tablet effortlessly. Thank you Doxie for a wonderful product.
5,I purchased this to scan old photos. I like the speed of scanning versus scanning a picture one by one on a printer/scanner.  Saving photos is simple and quick.  I highly recommend this scanner.  Customer service is great.  I received a follow up phone call to ensure all was working good with my scanner.  I had the option to ask all the questions I need answered as well.
5,The Doxie is an excellent choice if you are looking for scanning pictures and works great for documents too! The portability is a huge plus for those who have pictures stored outside of the home. And customer service is incredibly helpful if you should have any issues!
5,I use this product to scan multiple pages into my computer. While it does take some time to do larger amounts because it's just one page at a time  it works well. The scans are clear and easy to edit and easy to save to the computer. The portability and space saving aspects are great. It takes up very little space and has a great case when transporting it.
5,It works but the software is not as intuitive as other methods. I like that i can scan anywhere and organize the files later. I was even able to save all my personal documents from home during my lunch break in the car. Definitely worth the price point and use.
5,OMG it’s awesome. Super easy to use.  Great scans.  Highly recommend
4,This saved me from losing copies of important documents and has saved me from having to make unnecessary copies of all types of forms. It connects via wifi and I was able to download copies via wifi onto my phones & tablets.
5,I saw this at a friend’s house.  Her picture scans were awesome and I went home and ordered one.  I’m not tech savvy but I figured out how to upload the pictures.  Best thing I’m keeping pictures on the SD card and sending it to my sister.  Win-win
5,My husband bought me a Doxie some time ago and recently when I tried to use it for the first time there were some problems.  I wrote an email to the address on the site not expecting anything much.  What happened subsequently was beyond my expectations.  Someone called me at once walked me through the steps and determined that I needed a new model and without any more fuss everything was arranged.  When the new model came I had a few more questions.  They were answered courteously and promptly.  They went over and beyond to make sure that I was a happy user.  The scanner itself is very handy easy to use and works fast and silently.  I can attach it to my computer to access the scans or I can save it on flash drives.  Great product and outstanding service.
5,Originally I bought this scanner without the wi-fi card. But attaching it to the computer via cable to get the goods out of it was burdensome and sorta defeated the portability aspect of it. I eventually sprung for the Eye-Fi card and this product became all that it can be. I push the power button feed the paper watch it scan then head to the computer. By the time I sit down and launch the Doxie app the scans are waiting to be imported from the card - wirelessly and without intervention. Sweet!Doxie's included software is easy to use and has the features you need. You can drag the imported scans right out of the app's window onto the desktop to work with more robust editing software.One niggle: It'll do business card size up to 8.5"x15" scans but I've had receipts that were longer and wished it would just scan whatever I threw at it without me having to call up my origami skills.
5,Works great but using the wi-fi not easy.  Had to go to youtube to understand how to set up the wi-fi.  Other than that it works great.
1,Straight our of the box this never worked. The battery will not hold a charge. Have talked with support and the battery is on back order. I have tried the local battery stores and this battery is not available. A family member has one and theirs works perfectly  unfortunately mine never did. One of the few purchases that I regret.
5,Got this scanner for my home office.  It worked extremely well with my ancient Mac.  Had no trouble with the scanner or the software.  I was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly setup and usage went.  I'm really not very tech savvy and expected problems.  None so far.  Highly recommend!
5,I haven't bothered connecting it to my computer or the smart phone app just scan to memory card. Works well and takes up a small footprint.
5,Wow this Doxie Scanner is great and easy to use. I scan photos Documents receipts and save a ton of space by not keeping all unnecessary paperwork. I’m really happy I found them on Amazon. I gonna get the one with WIFI connection if this one is great that one should be even Better thanks
5,I will be expanding this review later but after scanning 1000+ pages to go paperless in the last week...this Doxie is a workhorse! Great scan quality and have had no issues. Battery life unplugged is much longer than expected and I love the pre-editing and auto adjustments that the Doxie software does for you. I have gotten rid of 3 boxes of keepsakes and personal records and could not be more pleased with my purchase.The Doxie customer support team has likewise been fantastic. You can chat with them live on their website (they helped get me the info I needed to make an informed decision on my purpose) and they sent me a personalized e-mail to thank me for registering my product (with a cute handwritten scanned note). Just go for it! You wont' regret this purchase and will save yourself a lot of space going paperless.
3,I'm sure this is a fine product but didn't find the wi-fi connection user friendly.  I had a prior version that had a USB connection that worked just fine so opted for the non wi-fi version.
5,I have scanned about 150 family photos and newspaper clippings that were so old the paper was yellow and fragile.  So far I am pleased.  Only one (odd shaped) newspaper clipping did not scan well.  Two or three photos had to be re-scanned but that was easy to do and no big deal.As others have said sometimes the scans were dark and had to made lighter when I saved them.  Again -  no big deal.I am happy with the Doxie GO SE.  I consider it a good value for the money I spent.
2,I wish I could say I am still impressed with this product but sadly I cannot. After 6 months of use I still find it to be extremely frustrating to load anything into the scanner and have it scan without crumpling up the page; running through crooked and jamming; or showing a severely skewed scan that has to be corrected in the rotate setting. I DO know how to feed papers into a scanner as I NEVER had these problems with my Original Doxie which is 11 years old is a gem and still works___ if only my Mac supported it. This new and "improved" version is anything but.The Doxie customer support is stellar and it is possible that their other products work as well as my old Doxie so I am not complaining about the company as a whole just the workings of this particular ("fussy")model.
5,Seldom have I encountered a company as focused on customer service as Apparent/Doxie. First we received the Doxie GO SE Wi-Fi scanner the same day we ordered it (Love that Prime membership!). Unfortunately the wi-fi capability was defective in that particular unit. The customer service reps were attentive unfailingly polite and when it became apparent there was a problem with the unit immediately offered to send a replacement via overnight shipment. And for our trouble they threw in a $10 set of photo sleeves for free. The new unit works perfectly allowing me to scan hundreds of old photos in about an hour. Then I wirelessly transferred them to my Windows 10 computer. The process was painless. I strongly endorse this product and the employees of Apparent.
5,I have been scanning 76+ years of photos and this Doxie is amazing.  I highly recommend it if you are trying to digitize your photos.  I place it on my TV table and feed the pictures through while watching TV.  I do not have a card reader on my laptop so I just plug the cord into my USB port and the Doxie and download directly from that.
5,For the price its worth it compared to other things around the same cost also scanning is clear and quick i used it for family photos and documents and if they make a new one with usb c id buy it right away but this one is still awesome
5,Was dubious when I purchased the product.  However after continuous usage while on the road this scanner is really impressive.  As good as my office flatbed scanner in scan quality.  Note that it can only scan sheets that can be fed.  It cannot scan book pages and unusual paper such as onion paper may jam.I love that it can scan while not connected to a computer then later transfer the images from the included SD card.The battery strength is pretty good was able to scan about 200 pages and still didn't bonk out.
5,The Doxie GO SE is perfect for what I need. It allows me to easily transport a scanner in a compact package and capture family and historic photos and documents.Easy to transport easy to set up and easy to use.
5,I LOVE this scanner! After reading reviews I wasn’t sure if this was the scanner for me or not but I decided to give it a try. I have over 1600 photos of various sizes and ages (dating back to the 1800’s) that I really didn’t want to mail off.  Received this on Thursday and set it up Thursday evening and started scanning.  I am finished less than 48 hours later! The quality of the scanning is wonderful. Some of the older pictures look better and clearer scanned than they do in person.  I will say that to get the best resolution choose the 600 dpi. If you are even considering a scanner purchase this one...you won’t regret your decision!
5,We travel a lot spend a lot of time in vehicles.  Reciepts seem to pile up so this makes scanning and keeping things organized very quick and easy.  We purchased the travel case and this is a permanent fixture in my "mobile"  office.
5,I loved that it is easy to set up.  The set up instructions are easy to read.  I scanned the pages from an antique tractor manual.  The pages were fragile but the Doxie scanner was very gentle.  My husband and his shop crew were grateful to have a copied version that they did not have to be so careful with.  It is easy small and light weight to take anywhere.
5,I just love my Dixie Go. It’s well worth the money. I’ve been wanting to scan all my old pictures into digital format and I was surprised how little time it took to do so.... and I have a lot of pictures.
5,I really like this scanner.  It helped me declutter a huge box of photos & bills I'd been keeping.  The software is easy to use; I use it with a Mac.  For me it was worth the money to avoid hanging on to copies of bills and receipts that I probably will never need but have a hard time just recycling.  They sent a survey following up on the scanner and asked for any negatives.  I noted that since I use a MacBook I needed to buy a micro USB to C port cord to upload my photos (I did not buy the wifi version).  They sent me a free carrying case just based on that!
5,I've been looking for a scanner for awhile now.  Ran across this product and thought I'd give it a go.  Set up was seamless especially when you have a PW protected network.  Scans perfectly multiple pages can be stapled together scans in color portable and best of all you can access your scans via the SD card when wifi is not available.Highly recommended and best product ever!
5,I got this scanner for scanning bills statements receipts to go paperless and I find it is great for this purpose. I occasionally also scan things like greeting cards and it does those just fine. I don't use this for photo purposes but it does have a higher DPI mode for them.The scanner itself chugs along just fine. I tend to scan through all of one side of the documents and then the backs. After loading in all the docs I load everything onto the computer group the pictures and export with OCR.Great document scanner & software for the price. I had no interest in dropping multiple hundreds of dollars for a lot of fancy features I didn't need. If you want to go paperless this is a great place to start.
1,This is a terrible product and it is price way too high for what you get.  Here are some of the main issues (1) Constant difficulty in keeping the scanner connected to doxie wireless access (2) It takes two steps to scan due to scans are first sent to a memory card from there it has to be imported to a computer pc (3) cannot connect to your home network if you have passwords (and who doesn't have that!).  I had an Epson and thought to upgrade to a wireless scanner.  Big mistake.  The Epson was so simple to use compared to this scanner.  The only way to use this without hassle is forget the wireless feature and use the cable to plug it in.  In the case of this scanner the wireless is a bigger headache than using it as a wired scanner.
5,It does exactly what it claims to do. The pictures are crisp and clear. What I am excited about is the customer service- I had some issues and this company wad responsive friendly and thorough.  I highly recommend this product- and this company
5,I was guilty of paper hoarding (per my wife) with old receipts bill stubs and other misc papers.The key to this scanner is to think ahead about how you want to organize the scanned papers.What I did was categorize my scans based on type and then by year.  I exported the scans to searchable PDFs and placed them in a folder that synchronizes with my Google Drive account so that I have a 2nd copy in the cloud.I must have shredded 7 years of paper docs by scanning them into the Doxie and organizing them on my PC.  I just wish that I would've done this years ago.I contacted Doxie Support about some usage questions and they were wonderful and even sent me some free document sleeves to scan larger 8x10 documents.
5,I've been watching this scanner for a while now and when the lightning deal came up over Thanksgiving weekend I jumped on it.I wanted this scanner to digitize some old family photos so I could share them with my aunts uncles and cousins. What I thought was going to take months only took a couple of hours with the Doxie scanner! Once one photo was finished scanning it was immediately ready for another one. Amazing.Doxie's customer service is excellent as well. The original scanner I ordered was defective. I contacted the company and they sent a replacement right away as well as a shipping label to return the defective one.I wholeheartedly recommend this scanner!
3,The branding is great software that comes along with it is really good too but the actual scanner can be pretty troublesome. It looks really good has a beautiful portable design but has a lot of difficulty feeding in near perfect paper. This was a real downer. It seems really hit and miss here the slightest crease or inconsistency in the paper will cause a bad or stuck feed. Something as simple a staple hole adding a sub-millimeter aberration will cause it shift and even get stuck as it's feeding in. Often I have to help it along for the first quarter of a letter page and at best I get a distorted and slanted scan.On their website/FAQ I found that they have an item for freshly printed laser scans having problems because of a 'slight curl'. Maybe this is a mechanical limitation to most portable document scanners with this form factor I don't know. Just expect these feeding issues to happen especially if you're digitizing piles of paper it might happen frequently enough to be annoying. Everything else about this scanner and software has been really great.
5,Great little scanner. We are dramatically downsizing and this has been perfect for getting my paper collection in digital format and we’ll be taking it with us on the road when we start traveling full time. It’s truly not much bigger than a box of aluminum foil.
5,I DISLIKE THE WAY TO PRINT SCANNED DOCUMENTSIT SHOULD BE EASIER AND FASTER TO PRINT SCANNED DOCUMENTS WITH JUST A CLICK OF THE MOUSENOT TO HAVE TO GO THRU ADOBE PHOTOSHOP WHICH MAKE A VERY BUROCRATIC ISSUE AN WAIST OF TIMETHERE IS ALSO MISSING A BUTTON THAT MAKE TO PRINT WHAT YOU SEE ON SCREENSO ON AND SO FORTH THE MACHINE IS VERY NICE WORK PERFECT. ONLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO PRINT OUR ARCHIVED ITEMSSO LONGBEST REGARDSJOSE ESKENAZISANTIAGO DE CHILE
3,Bought in March and rapidly scanned over 600 standard to small size  photos. Put away through the summer. Just got it back out and I have  1 very dead and useless battery.  It goes a great job for the most part but seems a bit moody sometimes.  For the price I expected to get more use out of it before I had to reinvest in its operations.
5,There's nothing to dislike about the Doxie.  I use it with my MacBook Pro.  It's easy to use and it works beautifully.  I received my Doxie with a malfunctioning battery door.  After contacting customer service a replacement was quickly on the way.  Excellent response and service.  I would recommend this product to family and friends.
5,I've been cleaning out years of boxes and needed to scan old pics old tax forms old memories in general. This fit the bill perfectly. After I scan I take the card and place it in my computer and download using the Doxie program. I then save it to the appropriate folders on my computer. Works like a dream!!
5,Sure it isn't lightning fast but plenty quick. I never used it any way except wired in to usb until one time I had it with me and couldnt have the computer around. scanned all sorts of docs onto the SD card and uploaded later. easy peasy
5,Absolutely nothing bad to say about this scanner. Bought it for keeping digital records of receipts for business as ink on receipts can wear off in a short time rendering them useless in an IRS audit. I was able to scan more than 400 receipts (all of 2014) in short order while multitasking at work and home as it doesn't require your full attention. I cautiously only uploaded 10 or 20 at a time to make sure each one scanned properly but after a few rounds I realized that was unnecessary and just let it fly.Doxie has saved me so much time and potentially so much money in the future. In the case of an audit somewhere down the road I would have pulled out thousands of dollar of receipts with the original ink worn off and likely had to pay back these tax deductible expenses.
5,I searched for days for a scanner that would fit our needs and our budget.  We have hundreds of photos and sheets of paperwork which needed to be scanned and electronically filled and stored.  This scanner is simple to set up and use.  It is portable and the bluetooth connection allowed me to work in different rooms or even outside on my deck.
5,I purchased this scanner to replace an older portable scanner that stopped working with my Mac.  After shopping around I decided to try the Doxie Go SE.  So far I have been very happy.  The scanner works great and all of the features work with my Mac.  I would definitely recommend this for use as a small portable scanner.  That said it also works great tethered directly to my computer via the USB cord.
4,I obviously misunderstood the wifi function of the scanner thinking it could be set up to automatically upload to one of the major cloud storage sites. Instead it's simply a way to connect your device wirelessly as opposed to using the cable.The software is okay it does what it says it will do and isn't crashy. I was hoping for a little more advanced functionality i.e. along the lines of text recognition features but it IS simple to use which in the end is find.The portable use is niceand it has been reliable thus far.
5,This scanner is perfect for my small business. It has helped me move closer to my goal of a paperless office. It’s small size makes it easy to carry between my home office and business location. I’m very happy with this product!
5,Doxie Go SE Scanner is a great investment. It is a small lightweight and user-friendly scanner. The directions are very thorough and easy to understand. The quality of the scans is excellent and has made life a bit less stressful in scanning and uploading homework for my two high-schoolers! Amazing customer service! Highly recommend!
5,Ideal scanner for quickly scanning in documents or photos anywhere. The wireless "Go" variation on the Doxie scanner is an absolute must have using it is as simple as tapping a button and your ready to go. Scanner comes ready to go out of the box with the ability to scan to an internal memory but throw in a USB device (thumb drives or even your smart phone via USB connection!) or an SD Card and your good to go scanning directly to your storage device of choice.I can not stress enough how convenient the ability to simply pick it up and start scanning without needing to connect to a computer is. The Doxie Go is a very fast and accurate scanner has a slider to help keep things aligned and you can switch between 300dpi and 600dpi with the touch of a button. Scanner can sync to services like Evernote and Dropbox and really is an excellent choice of scanner.
5,This is simply amazing.  Scans instantly onto an SD card.  Loads to computer very quickly.  We have thousands of actual pictures.  I transferred 750 in about 45 minutes.  A very worthy product.  Does documents pictures anything on paper.
4,I liked it but I ended up returning it. I bought it mainly to scan receipts but unfortunately if a receipt was crinkled the rollers pulling in the receipt were too small to catch and flatten the receipt (the same with crinkled paper). The tiny rollers also made it difficult to feed receipts and papers through the scanner (it took a little bit of time to position the paper even if it was flat paper). My recommendation to Doxie would be to make the rollers (or feeders) larger making it easier to feed crinkly paper (and normal paper) through. Who knows. I may have been expecting too much. Many many other people love it. Check out their reviews too.
1,Scanner was bought to scan receipts and other documents.The product arrived quickly. It was easy to setup and it was easy to use. Admittedly it is not used often.First usage was soon after arrival. I was able to scan 100 items. Items scanned included small gas station type receipts up to larger letter size items. All items scanned easily. All items were readable from scans. Items were saved as jpg's.2nd usage was 6 months later. Doxie scanner was stored away from harm on a shelf in a cushioned case with charging cable in case pocket. For next usage Doxie was dead. The battery was checked; it is inserted correctly. The Doxie flashes once when charging cable is connected. After a couple hours on a USB connection just for power and another half hour on a computer USB nothing happens. The red power light comes on once when connected to USB then goes off forevermore. No charging happens at all.I'm extremely dissatisfied and disappointed in Doxie. Product is a complete failure. Currently it just an expensive paper weight. I'd recommend NOT buying a Doxie scanner.
5,Doxie has easy to follow instruction on use excellent sales / tech support and is very portable/compact. It's done a great job scanning all my photos from the 70s-90s which is why I bought it. I highly recommend it!
5,Scanning a pile of photos using a normal flattop scanner takes FOREVER. You go to open it up align close it. press go. Then go to your computer and click through a series of dialogs.This thing? I was able to burn through a 500-image stack of photos in the time it took me to watch a couple episodes on netflix. Good times.
5,The Doxie Go Plus is a great little scanner! This makes cleaning up the folders of paper bill statements receipts general papers etc. a snap. These are saved as OCR capable PDF files with ease. Scanning old photos into high quality JPG files is respectable at both 300 and 600 dpi. It's definitely not the quality of my flatbed scanner but that isn't its purpose either. I have yet to try printing a scanned photo but when zooming into the image the screen image looks good. If you want to be picky some color correction is necessary. The scanning speed is good and the Doxie software is easy to use. I researched this purchase like crazy and ended up here and so far have been very pleased!
5,I am very impressed with this Doxie scanner.  It is extremely easy to use (fabulous instructions and support) even for a non-techie like me.  I have been scanning generations of old photos and it has performed beautifully.  Easy to transfer photos to my desktop and edit.  I am extremely happy with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone - and would definitely buy it again if needed.
5,The customer service is amazing!  Returns/exchanges are easy and free.  And the scanner itself is super easy to use.  The battery compartment door wouldn't stay shut on my first one. But they swapped it out no problem. Highly recommend.
5,I'm using this for two months already and I'm loving it.1. Portable - I can bring it to my client and scan documents before submitting it to our office.2. Easy to use - just feed the document and it will automatically save and scan to the SD card.3. No computer needed - you don't have to connect to your laptop or desktop to operate it.4. Software - easy to use. You can staple or unstable multiple pages. Rotate pages.5. Customer service - is excellent they are prompt to response.I would definitely recommend this product who scans a lot or want to digitize their documents.
5,I bought this scanner to use simply for personal use and it hasn't let me down yet! It's really fantastic.I'm a college student so I don't have very much extra space to keep a scanner and this makes the Doxie Go perfect. I have used it to scan receipts old photographs and of course lots of regular documents. It is easy to feed the materials into the scanner and it scans them very quickly as well (which is what I was looking for). However my favorite feature of the Doxie Go is the software. I love being able to edit all my scanned documents clip the edges rotate the images choose what file format to save them as and to "staple" separate scans into one complete document.For me this scanner was perfect and I would highly recommend it.
5,The Doxie is an excellent scanner at a reasonable price.  I submitted a question to the company about the machine I had purchased and got a quick professional response. Very happy with the machine and the company. Would buy another Doxie without hesitation.
3,Software is exactly the same as the product I bought 3 years ago from this company.Still designed to be a pain so you will buy what should have been included as an add-on.Other vendors have improved their products a lot this vendor has not.
2,I've had this scanner for about six months and it's a decent photo scanner but less great for documents. (1) couldn't get the wireless feature to ever work the light never turned on no matter how I troubleshot it. (2) It only scans in Jpeg as far as I can tell so 10 page documents become 10 separate jpeg images and if you don't have a PDF editor that's a huge detractor. (3) If your document is *slightly* misaligned it'll continue that misalignment throughout the scan and you might have a yellow half of your image. The lack of the wireless capability is a huge inconvenience as it means every time I scan I need to take out the memory card stick it in an adapter to plug into a computer transfer the file over etc etc EVERY time you scan. Quality of the scans is okay but dimmer than I'd like for documents. If you're just scanning photos it's fine and easy to use.
4,If your desire is to keep a digital copy of documents you think you might need later this is the scanner for you. It will not scan book pages or anything bound to a spine like magazines. It is for loose documents only. It is a little expensive for a no name brand  niche application device.
5,The Doxie SE is so much nicer to use than my older scanner that was slow and which took up too much room on my desk.  I'm not very tech savvy but it came with great instructions and a link to their website which was also very easy to follow.  When I had questions the customer service people were really responsive and so helpful.  I would buy this again.
4,Pros:Scans really well.The software is nice for exporting to PDFs.  Though it is faster to just pull them off the device via USB if you just want JPEGs.Cons:Does not come with a US based charger.  Though it has several international attachments.Takes forever to charge off of USB.Can not be used while charging via USB.Software is really limited in use beyond renaming files and saving to your chosen format.Wifi means you have to disconnect from your own wifi and connect to a local network from the scanner.
3,I bought this scanner to scan receipts from Home Depot and the local lumber yards.  The ability to have a scanner in my truck and not have to have a laptop was really appealing.  I like the scanner the problem is with the software. The scanned images of larger documents and shorter receipts are discernible but for long receipts (12" or so) the images are not clearly visible even when zoomed to the full extent making it impossible to sort the receipts for different customers without exporting to a different application. I emailed Doxie customer service and they were pretty much useless as this is just how the software is.While trying to find an alternative portable scanner I came across the IrisScan Anywhere 3 which turns out to be the same exact scanner as the Doxie.  The IrisScan Anywhere 3 comes with ReadIris OCR software which allows full editing and searching of the scanned images sorting of business cards and more.  Just what I was looking for and more at a better price!
5,Super easy to use right out of the box. Plenty of support offered and available from Doxie including a cute note when I registered by scanner. This thing is wonderful. I take it between work and home once a week to scan papers I need to reference later but don't want to haul around. The scans go to a SD card which you can go easily between my laptop and scanner. There's a USB cord to import scans as well. The software is intuitive and easily understandable. I love that I was able to scan all the little Polaroid pictures from my daughter's sleepover and share the digital versions with everyone. Would recommend.
5,I love Doxie -I recomment them highly  = BUT ...  I was expecting something better with this " New" model.  So far I haven't noticed anything very different except that its bigger. This one has Tethered Mode which they don't recommend or explain well so I'm quite confused about that.  I really don't see much improvement here compared to my old Doxie Go. Loading is easier  I do notice that.  There may be more that I will notice after I use it longer.  Get one - you won't be sorry. It makes life so much easier.  You won't find a better company.  They are wonderful people
4,I mostly love this scanner and it mostly scans quickly.  When it works the way it is supposed to it's excellent.  However  the wifi connection has been very finicky working one minute and then dropping the signal.  I have set up via Doxie wifi and through my home network with similar results.  After turning the unit off for a few minutes it usually connects and off we go.  Additionally paper alignment has been going awry resulting in smudged scans resulting in rescans.  It's more annoying than anything not a deal-breaker when you factor in the size and portability.
5,Using the Doxie Go Se to scan a bunch of 4x6 photos.  It is quick and simple to use.  A color 4x6 photo scanned at 600dpi takes around 1 meg of memory.  Love the fact this thing is cordless so it is very easily used anywhere.  Software works very easily as well.
1,We purchased this product in the summer of 2021 to help scan documents when we were away from our office. We used in in early August for two days and it worked effectively. We tried to turn it on again last week for an upcoming orientation and the device will not power on. I would appreciate if we could receive support to get the device functioning again as it worked effectively the first time.
5,I have a flat bed scanner but wanted something small portable and easy to use mostly for photos.  It is perfect for my objective.  It is small and very portable.  I use it connected to my computer but the versatility of scanning independently of the computer is a very nice feature.
5,Got this to scan all of my family's childhood photos. Worked wonderfully. Now I use it to upload and send documents. Fast and reliable. I have had no trouble with it thus far and bought it in May. Personally I do not use the wifi capability like I thought might come in handy. IT is easier for me just to plug it into the computer to upload documents. So if that is not an issue for you then I would suggest buying the non wifi one (it is a little cheaper).
5,I just got this yesterday. Great little scanner. It was easy to set up. Easy to use.I mostly am planning to use this to scan things like bills receipts (deductible tax expenses) and other stuff to put into Evernote. The Doxie software makes it easy to send your scanned material straight into your Evernote account. Piece of cake.I already scanned a bunch of stuff using it today. Tax statements receipts memorabilia/cards a check I wrote and some bills.Since it's portable I can carry it around the office or the house and scan stuff. Then when I get back to my laptop I connect it to the laptop with the usb cable import the images and push them into Evernote. Takes a minute or two to do the import.Overall this is a great device that'll help me declutter my office and take back my desk space bulletin board space cabinet space etc.Gale
5,This is an amazing product especially for an OCD individual like me that is obsessed with organization and record keeping.  I highly recommend this scanner if you are interested in converting and saving all of your important documents and pictures.
5,I took on the project of scanning all the family photos and was looking for a portable scanner.  I ordered the Doxie and it worked perfectly.  It is really light weight and easy to use.  I literally sat in my chair while watching TV and scanned over 1000 photos with no issues.
5,This little portable scanner is so easy to use!  I was able to scan photos within 2 minutes of opening the box.  I used this scanner to scan hundreds of old photos.  The memory card holds thousands of photos so you scan for hours.  I am very happy with this purchase!
5,Making the choice among all the options was hard but thankfully I made the right choice with this product! Would highly recommend it. Easy to set up and operate--can't imagine anything being more simple. The portable feature has been more handy than I thought. Bought it mostly for my wife to use--she inherited a ton of photos she's been sifting through for over a year to hand out to relatives. Now we just scan and send or link. We use mostly the 300 dpi mode but it's nice to have the 600 dpi option. Scans VERY quickly and holds more photos in memory than I would have expected. If you're confused about options try this one--you shouldn't be disappointed.
5,I love the product and used it to convert all my paper records to digital.  Now I just have to scan documents and receipts as I receive them.  I dropped the unit and the glass scanner broke.  I contacted the company to see if they repair the scanners.  To my delight they sent me a new unit.  Thank you Doxie!
4,After using my Doxie to scan several documents I changed my review to a 4. I would recommend getting this scanner but there is a method to the scanning and it takes a bit to get used to. I would recommend starting with papers you don't mind getting a little wrinkled until you get used to the scanner. Otherwise you're good to go - and this is a good little scanner. Very convenient.
5,This thing is so easy to use once you figure out the initial setup (that's what I have teenagers for!). When I'm watching TV at night I'll go through a box of old photos and scan about 100 or so into the scanner. It even scans 8x10 photos! I plug it into my laptop and let it download for the next 1/2 hour or so. The next morning is when I make a few touches on each photo if it needs (cropping removing adjustments brightening contrast etc.) and file them away in a folder of my choice. I'm getting organized with my photos and I love it! It's easy. it's mobile. I'm thinking of taking it to my office and scanning all my receipts next. One thing at a time though.
5,Bought this instead of using those mail-in shoebox companies. Absolutely love it. Sits on my desk and I scan things as I dig them up so I can discard them. Went through thousands of family photos earlier this year.Only issue I've had is the auto-advance quitting on thicker media (in my case polaroids). Those I've had to put on the flatbed but it's a real small percentage of the work I was doing before.20150911 Update - Received a same-day email from Doxie about scanning polaroids after writing this review - they explained it works fine if you insert the thicker end first (the white tab in this case) and then just rotate the scan afterwards in the software. So no problems at all now!And the case is great!
5,I am in LOVE with my Doxie scanner!  There are so many things I love about it.  It is so compact it can travel with you anywhere.  It has so much internal storage so you can scan while you are offline and then upload whenever you have wifi.  It works so well for any size document or photo!  You can easily edit and title your photos or documents before uploading including 'stapling' documents together.  It's the perfect solution for both business and personal use.  I use Evernote a lot and it is the perfect pair with Doxie.  Goodbye recipe books paper documents and clutter Hello Doxie!
5,Tech support is wonderful. Some of the best I've ever dealt with. The scanner is a nice little machine. I had some issues with the smaller receipts but Tech Support sent me some sleeves to put them in issue resolved. I love the interface very easy to use. It's worth the extra money to get a nice scanner.
5,I love it.  Easy to set up and use. I've gotten rid of so much paper.Just scan download set up files in your computer and paste them into the appropriate file.  I especially like the "staple" option where you can attach 2 or more pages to each other.I had a large paper folder for "Miscellaneous receipts".  It had over 200 receipts. What a nightmare.  Now each receipt is in its own file for easy reference.I set up a file for Auto then sub files for each vehicle.  Maintenance records are now a few clicks away. Receipts for appliance purchases warranties and repairs - Washer Dryer Fridge Coffee Maker etc. are all organized and easy to access.Just make sure you have everything backed-up.
5,This is my second Doxie product. I had the original Doxie scanner which worked great with my iMac. I just updated to the new 16" MacBook Pro and  bought the Doxie Go SE. Allows me to scan quickly and easily while storing it away when not in use. I can also use its portability to take it anywhere scan docs into it and then upload to my Mac later.
5,This mini scanner came in handy as my scanner and computer both have malfunction.I can connect the USB to my lap top and import my scans.I specially like how I can group and ungroup scans to save them as different documents.
5,I use this scanner to scan paperwork on the road for work and school. It is extremely portable and easy to use. Documents scan fast even at 600 dpi. The quality of the scan is superb for my needs and it is almost to simple to connect to scanner via WiFi and transfer scans. The matching case I also purchased is ideal for storing the scanner as added protection in my briefcase. The software is "to the point" and provides me exactly the functions I need that is scan to PDF and generate a single PDF from multiple scans. Good product worth every penny.
5,This scanner is amazing. For my second use I turned it on and easily scanned dozens of photos. I turned on its wireless function (I have it synced to my wireless see below) and after a few minutes I was importing the photos. I had a sense of it being almost... too easy?If you want to use your wireless or Doxie's wireless it feels a little "technical" to handle. But I can't imagine this being any easier and it definitely felt within my range of handling. If I had struggled there was a lot of supporting document and contacts.
4,Used Doxie Go SE WIFI to scan family photos. Works great . No issues whatsoever.
5,Absolutely LOVE this scanner!!!!! It is everything I wanted and more. Quality is amazing! Easy to set up and perfect size! I love that is can be used anywhere and runs on rechargeable battery! I can feed photos while watching tv or making dinner it’s amazing!
5,This is the best scanner. It is fast produces very clear and sharp images and if you purchase the wifi version you will be able to use it with your smartphone tablet or even your PC wirelessly. I wish if it was able to scan both sides of the page.
5,Had this for about 6 weeks and it has sure mad my life easier. Scan my receipts and shred... no more big fat files taking up space! Super easy to set up and use. I bought the SE but it turns out I probably could have used the plain one. But even for a technophobe like me. I was up and running in minutes.  Customer service from Doxie has been exemplary. They sent me a survey and I replied with a couple of issues that I thought could be addressed. I got a wonderful note back thanking me for my input and directions on how to address my issues.
5,I have used this scanner several times now. I totally recommend for the size. Yes one has to switch wifi when using this scanner and this is not ideal but i love the size of it as I am a minimalist and don't want to have stuff sitting on counter-tops. Does the job really well and the staple functionality (you can staple pages together into one pdf file) is amazing. For home use for those personal documents you don't want to be scanning at work this is amazing. You do have to carefully feed the paper into the scanner but that goes with the size of it I guess. I love it and recommend for all the minimalists out there.
1,Regret I did not open to ensure scanner would work as soon as it was received.  Purchased specifically to scan old photos but had to delay the project.  I finally opened the Amazon box Friday to scan pictures for a family gathering only to find an inoperable device.When plugged into my computer and a USB charger the power button flashes red for less than a second then turns off.  (No green light laminated or flashed). After 24 hours of charging no change!  Doesn’t work.  It’s too late to return for a replacement!I do not recommend this device but if you do purchase be sure to test it as soon as received!
5,This the great! You can quickly scan receipts etc. Even better it is so small that you can carry it in your laptop bag hook it up anywhere and scan. I am interested in documenting our family tree and digitizing all the old family photos so I take it to visit my relatives and when they get out the old photos I easily scan them and share them with the rest of the extended family. You don't have to arrange photos on a flat bed etc. Simply feed the photo into the Doxie and by the time it comes out the other side you are ready to put it back into the album and feed the next photo. Very efficient way to scan photos without losing your place in the album.
3,Until I had it delivered Doxie offered a newer version so be careful. I returned it and bought the Fujitsu ix500 instead. Don't get me wrong the Doxie has some great advantages:* you can scan anywhere thanks to battery and internal memory* it's fast I scanned some 60 pages while I was on a conf call in under 30 minutes* software gets the job done the stapling is greatWhat I didn't like:* issues with feeding paper: especially with multi-copy forms that were glued together on the top* had to buy Wifi extra: not sure Wifi is really needed but if you want it you need the top line Eye-Fi card* single sided and single page scanning only (though not too many documents are double sided...)So in summary I'll simply start going paperless with my new ix500 to get the big binders done. Maybe once this is done I'll get a new Doxie to get the weekly additions taken care off :-)
5,Bought this scanner to scan in photos we inherited.  And it's a powerhouse.  Takes a little while to upload to the PC but it paid for itself in just one day.  It's easy to use and perfect for photos as there is only one side to scan.I could see this also being good for art with the photo sheets.
5,I couldn't be more pleased with a portable scanner than I am with the Doxie. It does everything as advertised and it is not a pain to set up or operate. If I can get it running anybody can!
5,Excellent product with lots of features! Paid a bit more and worth it! Great customer support and follow up by Doxie staff! Highly recommend this portable scanner!
4,Received it today and it works well however when I plugged it into my PC Windows Defender notified me that the internal memory on this device has a Virus:Win32/Gael.A on it which it ended up cleaning. The virus was in an exe called A0100452.exe.Edit Feb 3: Doxie customer service contacted me about this post and apologized about the issue. Apparently this is something they had seen in the past but is extremely rare. They ended up sending me a replacement and made things right. Five stars for their customer service!
5,This is single handedly one of the best purchases I have made.  I can scan and send documents to my laptop in under two minutes (maybe faster?). My Canon photo-quality printer/scanner would take forever!  I am so pleased that I spent a little extra to get the Wi-Fi version and treat myself to the storage box.  The Doxie holds a charge for a very long time warms up super fast and is ready to go.  When I get a little free time I plan to scan recipes my now college-age kids' artwork from preschool and some family photos.  It really is great when something you invest in works and makes your life easier.  Thanks Doxie!
5,This scanner is incredibly easy to use and makes short work of digitizing documents. Just turn it on and start feeding in pages. There's plenty of onboard memory and the battery lasts a so long that I can scan as much as I want without having to worry about running out of memory or power. I don't actually know the limits because I haven't reached them yet.When you're done scanning just plug in the USB cable to your computer and use the included Doxie software to import your scans. Importing is easy but not especially fast. Once imported there are lots of useful export options including OCR and Evernote which I use together to make PDFs I can search in Evernote without paying for a premium account.
3,As other have noted I also find this unit to be temperamental about page feeding and frustrating when attempting to feed continuously. I still don't fully get the blinking power button. I cannot consistently feed paper straight and often there is no apparent reason for the inconsistency. The status button seems to blink frequently which I guess means its not ready to feed and its annoying when you want to continuous feed a stack of documents. The desktop software is good and does everything I expect mainly conversion to PDF and automatic cropping. I find a USB connection to be more efficient than WiFi which must be specifically connected to the device whereas the USB is virtually instant. On my unit the power connector is fussy. Any slight tension on the cable disconnects the charger cable. It is very compact and in that respect much preferable to my Canon LiDE 700.
5,I had the original Doxie and used it until the software was no longer supported on my computer. (For over 10 years)This Doxie is portable reliable and easy to use.  The software is also VERY user friendly.  I've never had an issue with Doxie and their products.
5,I received my scanner today and I am shocked out how I ever scanned mass amounts without it! It is extremely fast and easy to use. I kept thinking there should be more steps but there wasn’t. I found the set up and scanning extremely user friendly. I am currently using it to scan tons of pictures and the pictures look great when I imported them to my computer. I even had some pictures that I was hesitant to feed because of damage but they fed through without a problem. I couldn’t be happier!I don’t usually review my purchases but this item warranted it!
5,I wanted something lighter fast and more portable than my PIXMA printer/scanner/copier so I did my research and went with the Doxie.  Satisfies all of my scanning needs in an easy to use manner and I can bring it on the go when I want a portable office.  Highly recommended.
4,Unfortunately the wifi option on this devise is only compatible with iOS (iPhones iPad etc) and not with the android system (phones) so the wifi is useless in my case.It is capable of downloading directly to Dropbox however which is great but it requires a USB cable on a PC.  I wasn't aware of this prior to purchase so I am disappointed in that but it is a great scanner user friendly and seems like a great buy all together.  Just don't pony up for the wifi option if you're thinking you can wirelessly upload to your phone's gallery.  smf
5,I love the ease of using this scanner!!! Charge it up - take it with you where ever you go and scan away.  You can scan using the rechargeable battery or by plugging it in. If scans super fast!  Before I got it I wondered if I had to have it connected to wifi for it to work - nope - saves everything to the Doxie - later you connect the doxie to the computer and import the scans. My computer takes quite a while to download - but that could totally be my computer and nothing to do with the doxie. Sooo glad I got this lil guy!
5,It does the job well and efficiently. I reached out to Tech Support for a question when I 1st got it and they got back to me right away. I use this primarily for photos and it Scans them clearly. Also very light weight and simple to use Would definitely recommend
5,I will always be a Doxie user.  I bought a Doxie go about 6 Months ago.  The scans were great but started having a few feeding problems a week ago.  I contacted Doxie Support  and within 24 hours I got an email saying they were sending me a new one.This is what I call service.I hope they come out with a large sheet feeder model and I will buy another for my office to go with my portable.I have an iPad and take the Doxie Go with me on trips and love the portability.  I've tried the photo apps for the iPhone and iPad that convert the photo to a scan.  Don't like the quality.  The Doxie works great with Evernote
5,Battery dead on arrival. Unit was plugged-in for 30 hours without charging. Contacted seller via amazon refund issued by seller without question asked. A replacement unit was shipped. Excellent customer relations.  New unit work as described. Scans could be rough at the edges if paper is not fed to the scanner straight however there is a function in the software to edit/crop out the bad part before converting to a pdf file and save. Conversion to a searchable pdf file can be time consuming and for some reason my Windows 7 computer work much faster than my Macbook pro. Renaming the files with a simple click. Overall the the unit does what it's advertised but there's room for improvements four stars there and five stars for customer service. Thanks.
3,For the most part this product does the job. After using it extensively for the last couple weeks here are ways I would improve it:- can be difficult to feed pages. If the slightest crinkle causes the paper to be rejected- scan quality is ok not great. There is a 600DPI setting but it takes forever to scan- the biggest let down is the software: difficult to sort pages (no cut / paste functionality) which means you better have your pages in order when you scan; even at max zoom it's hard to read your pages requiring you to do the "quick look" or even going to a step further to use your computer's preview viewer; no undo -- God help you if you accidentally delete a scan. You'll have to rescan it.Overall I'm pleased. But it could be a great product.
5,I LOVE this thing. I'm a small business owner and needed something to quickly and efficiently scan a significant amount of monthly receipts. I did a lot of research beforehand and cautiously selected the Doxie because it had software that seemed most compatible with my Mac. It works really great. Correctly grabs receipts 95% of the time (watch out for jagged or crinkled edges - that seems to be the main source for incorrect feeds) the software is SUPER simple and easy to use and Doxie customer service is fantastic. I had an issue with my first Doxie where the plug didn't seem to sit quite right in the scanner causing it to unplug too easily. They immediately sent me a new one which works great. Very pleased and would highly recommend.
1,Stopped working after 2 uses.  Contacted support and they had me take out the battery to do a hard reset.  Worked after that.  Went to use it again - same issue.  Repeated what support had me do and it didn't work.  Bought the machine to save me time and stacks of paper.  Has taken more time to try to figure out and try to get it working than it's worth.  Very disappointed in my purchase.
2,I thought this scanner would be a great tool to let me scan things wherever and whenever I found the time.  The problem is the battery life isn't that great.  And if you are using a wi-fi enabled SD card the battery life is terrible.  It's so bad that I can't believe Doxie would use it in their marketing.  I barely got 15 scans in before the low battery warning showed up.  So much for scanning anywhere in my home and having the documents show up automatically on my computer.What's even more ridiculous is that Doxie is promoting the Doxie Go as a mobile device.  Every complaint about the product is met with a the Doxie response of: "It's meant to be a mobile device."  If that's true then put a battery in it that lasts.  The scanner isn't even close to pocket-size so there's room for a big battery.There are other issues with keeping this thing permanently connected to your computer.  There doesn't seem to be a way to keep it always-on and always-charging.  That is a ridiculous oversight.  Mobile is nice but I may want to leave it connected as well.  I will say that the software is easy to use and I like the built-in OCR.  But that isn't enough to make up for the shortcomings.  This scanner is only good for a very very specific use case.  Too specific to justify the $200 cost.
5,The Dixie was so easy to set-up and use. It took us minutes to get several of our old photos scanned and inputed into our hard drive. It was smooth scanning and nice picture quality too.
5,Don't let those thermal generated receipts disappear on you copy them on this quick and easy scanner.  If you have this scanner and noticed the creation date isn't current look up in tech support and you'll find out easy it is to set.  Wish I had this when I build my home all those receipts generated on thermal paper have faded away.
5,I needed a portable scanner that was easy to use and was a quality product with great tech support.  Doxie definitely delivers!  I highly recommend!
2,It is easy to scan papers using this product and have them written to the supplied SD card.  However there are problems with the Doxie mounting as an external USB device with a MacBook Pro 2018.  The Mac only sporadically sees the device.  As a result the Doxie software is constantly hanging and I have had to force it to quit.  On the occasions that it does mount the Doxie via USB it soon abruptly disconnects resulting in a message that says "Disk Not Ejected Properly".  I tried using different usb-c adaptors rebooting etc.  I makes no difference.  Perhaps the only reliable way to use Doxie with a MacBook Pro 2018 is to transfer the files by ejecting the SD card and using an SD reader to USB c adaptor or perhaps the wifi option (which I did not try).  I also verified that the Doxie cable and SD card are good (using an older MacBook Air).  When I contacted Doxie support repeatedly the agent said to me "Hmm...that is super odd".  There was no solution offered.  Update:  they have suggested using a 3rd party cable (usb-c to micro usb) which they offered to provide free of charge.
5,So simple to use.  I scanned thousands of single photos and photo album pages in no time.  Now comes the hard part . . . going back and renaming/identifying the photos.
5,This easy-to-use small device is fantastic for scan work at home or in the road. The image quality is good and the organization/reorder function is simple. Getting started is so quick and easy I was able to teach my 3 year old daughter how to scan  her pictures!
5,Easy to use portable produces great results. Customer support and outreach is outstanding. Multiple unsolicited contacts after the sale just to check-up and make sure the product is doing what I want it to!
5,Purchased to scan my sons artwork for a book I’m making for a graduation project.  The outcome was perfect. I could even see the erase marks on his sketches!
5,Excellent product! Very easy to use! One of the first things I scanned was an old 1965 cookbook that has many of the family’s favorite recipes. The cookbook was falling apart and scanning the pages makes it so easy to share with all of the family members. Looking forward to doing family photos soon.
5,Scanning works well as does uploading via wifi or USB.  The only problem is sometimes receipts don't "take" to the rollers and scan right away.  However I also have a desktop system from Fuji and while it's excellent all around it is even more problematic on that count.  I think receipts can be a bit tricky especially if you stuff them in your purse or wallet and have to flatten them to scan.Very happy to have a scanner that does not need to be plugged in to scan or upload.  I am definitely glad to have this in addition to a desktop system.  I am now scanning things all over the place-- and the paperload is much easier to handle.
5,After a month of talking to tech support I finally got tired and gave up. Never got it to work consistently. Update: They contacted me and refunded my money.
5,use this every day have scanned photos lots of other papers. works good to scan labels and instructions on new product you purchase. it is a keeper and would buy it again
5,This scanner has been perfect for scanning in a life time of pictures from old photo albums.So easy to use and the scan is very good quality.Highly recommend this scanner
5,Had my tech savvy daughter set up our Doxie and scanning pictures has been very easy and straightforward.  I had put off doing anything with the thousands and thousands of pictures I have but now that I see how easy it is to scan them I have started my long term project.
5,I have been using this scanner to reduce the paperwork in the house.  It has great software and is easy to organize each document.  You can choose 300 dpi or 600 dpi at the touch of the button.  I love it!
5,The size alone of this scanner makes it a versatile tool that has a permanent place on my desk. Updates to software in the last few months have made it even easier and streamlined to use. I typically scan all of my receipts and export to Evernote. The Doxie Go does this without issue. Does it have a nice feed tray? No it does not. However the price is right when attempting to digitize large amounts of paperwork on a budget. The power adapter has made the biggest difference as my Doxie is going on 5 years old I can just keep it plugged in at my desk and scan away. Very handy little tool.
4,This is a very handy little gadget. I bought it for it's portability to help with scanning papers and photos for genealogy work.  It worked very well for me at a family reunion to scan items other family members had brought.  Overall I am very pleased with this item.  And with the Doxie Flip that I purchased at the same time.  I have found both products to be very useful and I'm glad that I purchased them.  I would recommend them to anyone.
5,I had an earlier version... this one is worlds better! Perfect for quick scanning of a photograph (I use it to get my Polaroid digitized to share). The Wifi connection works by having your computer leave the network and connect directly. That is good/bad... computer leaves the internet but is nice when out on the road away from a home network. Software is easy to use move your scans to a local folder or to a cloud service provider (I send everything to Evernote - goes into the general area not able to set a specific folder just have to move later). The charge lasts a long time when scanning a picture/document once a day or two.
5,Great scanner! Easy to use small WiFi and SD card options. Great for dealing with the paper clutter. Great customer service! Small company that wants to help you make the best use of your new device.
5,I used to travel home with 150-200 pieces of paper for writing reports and the Doxie SE has completely changed the way I do my job.  I'm a big fan of reducing waste and the Doxie is helping me achieve that goal.  My only complaint is I wish it could accept a larger memory card (currently limited to 32gb) but that is a minor quibble.  Scan quality is excellent and the included software is especially helpful.  I would gladly buy this product again!
5,The Doxie Go SE WiFi is exactly what I was looking for. It was a very easy and quick set up. The scanning worked great. I have no complaints so far. I recommend this portable scanner.
5,Bought this to start digitizing all our paperwork using something faster/better than the scanner/copier we have.  While you can only scan one page at a time that works perfectly for me.  I've digitized all my tax documents and it's so easy to keep up with scanning.  Can't wait to scan everything else!  Love that I can "staple" scans together and I can easily upload to my Evenote or Google drive.  Definitely my favorite tech purchase of 2018 (I purchased during holidays last year).
5,So far it has been excellent and the support is Superior! Does what I want it to do with no problems
5,I absolutely love my Doxie Go SE. I have been concerned about all the photos we have taken that are just in photo boxes in the basement and what would happen to our family's photos if something happened to our home. Now I am scanning them in and they will be protected for our kids as they have families of their own. It is incredibly easy to use as well as fast! I have recommended to several people who are checking into getting one for their own use. Get one and save your treasured photos.
5,I bought this scanner from Amazon.com mainly to scan old childhood photos. I love the portability and the ability to scan the images directly to a flash thumb drive. I can do my scans and watch tv at the same time with out the need to be next to my computer. The scanning speed is adequate and the quality of the scans are pretty good. Even the software that you download from Doxie's website is pretty user friendly and does it's job well.Set up and useability is very easy.However I do suggest you buy the power adapter that they sell separately because if you plan on scanning a lot of images say over 50 or so depending on the resolution the internal battery runs out quickly and then needs to be recharged again which can be a pain.
4,All the comments about document feeding are true. This scanner is really fussy to get it to take a sheet of paper. Software is about as unsophisticated as it comes. Doesn't help you organize anything just helps you copy things off the device. It won't even remember your preferred file save format. But the simple fact that it's compact you can just turn it on scan stuff without a computer and worry about uploading it later negates many of it's bad points.
4,After reading an extensive number of reviews for various scanners I purchased the Doxie Go Plus to digitize documents in my home office and photos that have piled up for many many years.PROS:• portable• compact• easy to set up• easy to useCONS• photos and documents tend to feed slightly crooked which is why I deducted one starI use a memory card on the scanner which makes importing to the desktop a snap.
5,I initially had an issue with the battery for this scanner but the company solved it immediately going well above and beyond to solve my issue.  Great customer service!!
5,I have not had the time to use tech support yet as we have some ongoing health problems taking up our time right now. But I have scanned a lot of photos and I just love this little machine. Very easy to use. I will post more later when I am able to fully take advantage of the software. It’s a great scanner you won’t be sorry if you buy it!
4,Pros:-Very portable small form factor and great battery life-Easy to install and setup loved the documentation which was super brief and clear no need to wade through volumes of instructions-Ease of use encourages you to digitize any records you need included photo sleeve was super useful for smaller itemsCons:-Often hard to get documents properly aligned and the software auto aligning in software doesn't compensate as much as I'd like occasionally requiring me to have to rescan problem items numerous times-Small items sometimes have a hard time feeding unless you use the included photo/small item sleeve
5,Just fantastic! Fast quiet and light weight I can scan in receipts while watching tv and batch upload them to my computer later. The OCR feature of the software is excellent as is the default scan quality. A big surprise is that it actually scans in color.If you are one of those people with a lot of business expenses that come attached to flimsy tiny receipts and you are drowning trying to take care of those you'll love this thing. Scans larger papers just as happily.If you have an Expensify account you'll love it even more as you can dump them in there and Expensify will read amounts and merchants off the receipts and auto-create expenses on your expense reports..
5,I have only had time to just set up and try out my Doxie.  What I have put through it PDF and photo have come out excellent and it's so handy.  I tether mine to my computer I have the Doxie app on my PC and my pictures go right to it.  Then I can go back and do whatever needs done with them.  Same with the PDF's.  I needed something easy and portable and I am so far very happy.  Thank you.
5,Wow I got this and needed a little help setting up and tech support offered was amazing!!! 200% get this one!
2,This thing never turned on. The red light flashed twice and no matter how much I charged it never worked. I forgot about it and now they won’t help me out with it. What an expensive mistake
5,I love this scanner.  I reviewed a lot of scanners looking for something good but inexpensive.  I ultimately decided to spend a little more based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did.  It's portable and quick and scans pictures with great digital detail.  The tethering function isn't ready yet but hooking it up to your computer while scanning allows you to move the pictures over and not worry about filling up the card.  Customer service is quick to respond if you have a question.  Love it!!!
5,Doxie has the best customer support I've ever encountered.  Support gets the 5 stars.  The scanner itself I'd give it 4 stars.  It does what it says it'll do but more than occasionally I'll have to rescan a doc because it didn't feed right.  The software is required and works for 90% of my needs.  It's pretty simple to use.  My primary use case is to scan bills and important mail that I can promptly shred without remorse.  For that it works fine.Once again their support team is amazing.  I had an issue with the battery not taking a charge and I had a replacement within three days.  Cool peeps.
5,Gone are the days when you have to place documents on a scan bed find your scanning software and figure out how to make it work.  With Doxie just scan each page and use the included software to easily combine and convert the images to the required format.  This is one of the best additions to my home office.
4,I purchased this product mainly to go all digital with my documents. So far it's been working very well. I really like the portability aspect of it and that it works seamlessly with Evernote. However I should point out two important limitations that may sway some of you away.(1) The maximum copy size is 8.5 x 12 which means it will not totally copy a standard legal sized document 8.5 x 14. This is strange because the lower end wired model is capable of this size?(2) The wireless option using an Eye-Fi card only exports in JPG. You will need to download to your computer to convert to PDF or to combine multiple scans to a single PDF file.Hope this helps.
5,The Doxie Go SE was easy to use and the scanned photos were exceptional. I would buy this again.
5,I love my Doxie Go- it is compact easy to store able to travel if I need to take it for any reason does not need to be attached to a computer and makes PDF files of the copies of the documents. The only thing I haven;t figured out yet is how to enlarge the docs to read better and/or manipulate them to make notes or put them into files. I'm still learning what it can do but so far I am quite satisfied with the purchase.   Love Letters from the Heart of GodHas God Said Thou Shalt Stay Abused?: A Memoir & Road Map for HealingAbused No More: A Book of Healing and Empowerment
5,Very easy to use. For best quality tho you will need to stop scanning every couple dozen pics or so and wipe the scanner lens and wheels - if scanning (as I was) older degrading photos. The separately sold plastic sleeves worked well to reduce the dust/lint build up however. I also re-calibrated the unit after each cleaning and did not have any issues. Very happy with the device.
4,Really easy to use.  The only glitch was it said to follow directions of cd provided but there wasn't on.  Directions should be updated to state go online to get program downloaded.  Otherwise all was good
5,I have needed this scanner forever.  Has internal memory it's own battery and scans very quickly.  I got through about a hundred pages in about 15 minutes and didn't have to worry about transferring them to my computer until later.  The battery held up fine too. I don't love the interface software  (free download from Doxie website) but it's functional.  The scanner itself is great easy to carry and works every time I take it out.  I need to get a carrying case for it recommended if you throw yours in a bag or briefcase.  The charger is proprietary I leave it at my desk to charge in the evening if needed.  Solid quality for what it is I am very happy.
5,This thing in absolutely incredible. I have MILLIONS of photos that I'm scanning for my family to put on flash drives to give them as Christmas presents. And this thing has made this insane project so quick and easy. The quality of the scans are great. Its smart and knows which photos you've already imported. I'm thoroughly impressed. Worth every damn penny.
5,My son literally scanned over 3000 photos over the course of a couple of weeks and it worked great.  I think that the software is kind of clunky but overall its a great midrange product to do quality photoscans quickly.
5,Only critique is it only scans one page at a time but the Doxie program allows you to "staple" multiple pages together.  Good for thin receipts thick ids (driver's license) and normal paper.  Best part is that it is portable and doesn't have to be right next to the computer.
5,This is a cool product.  Get rid of all the randomly acquired paper stacks that you will probably never need but feel some strange responsibility to keep.  Easy to set up.  Once you get rid of your existing paper piles it is easy to scan important documents as they come in.  Would recommend works as advertised.
5,The Doxie GO SE is the best compact portable scanner I have ever used. It makes scanning and organizing documents extremely easy. The computer interface is excellent and intuitive.
1,I diligently researched Bluetooth portable scanners and thought I had found the right one for our home. I took the unit out of the box powered it up it would not easily connect to Bluetooth or feed the paper for scanning. After unsuccessfully messing with the unit for an hour to attempt to get it to connect to my phone and/or computer  I am returning.
5,I had several boxes of family pictures I wanted to digitalize for years. I even considered a mail in service but couldn’t swallow the cost. I shopped for a good scanner to get it done for at least 9 months. I kept coming back to this one because of price and reviews. I am over the moon happy about this purchase. In the first afternoon after a quick set up I scanned about 400 pictures without even spending much time
5,This scanner is awesome it really reduced my time scanning photos. The app will clean up the photos so you don’t have to crop. I love it!!
5,If you want a scanner that's gonna be a great place for you to easily scan documents and photos...this is it! You don't even need a computer to use it! I LOVE this thing!
5,After a few scanners that have crappy software and not great support so happy with my Doxie Scanner. Super easy to use and doesn't take up space!
1,This product stopped working after barely one year. We used it once and it will no longer work. Regret this purchase.
5,I bought this scanner last year . It was super easy to use.  After not using it for awhile I had issues turning it back on .  I send an email to customer service and they called me and helped me trouble shoot my issues .  Furthermore  they swap my battery.
5,I use my doxie to scan and store invoices for a small retail business.  It is small and very easy to take with you anywhere it is needed.  As I have time I plan to use it for genealogy storing both documents and pictures. This is where the portability will really come in handy.I bought my  Doxie after using the one my son had bought a few weeks earlier. It is definitely worth the money
1,Low quality product. Device won’t turn on.
5,I got my mom this scanner for Christmas after eyeing it for a couple years for myself. She's recently moved into a smaller house and is doing some downsizing so it seemed like good timing. Here's what she said:"It all worked just beautifully!  Thanks for such a lovely and effective present.  I really appreciate it.  i see lots of work applications and will likely get to the personal later!"I think that speaks for itself! I definitely plan to grab one myself soon.
5,Ease if use is great!! Just what I was looking for.
5,This is so easy to use. It holds a good charge and I can scan photos on the sofa or back porch easily. It also is great for a variety of sizes.
5,This product lives up to its reputation! I love how easy it is to use and the quality of the scanned pictures and documents is great. I am glad I made this purchase.
5,Very much like this little scanner. My needs are simple: scan and email. Doxie was easy to set up and easier to use. When I need to scan something I plug the Doxie into my laptop press and hold the power button until green and then insert the paper(s) to be scanned one at a time. I then go to the Doxie folder select and email the scanned document. Super simple and best of all no frustrations with technology. Highly recommend.
5,I love this scanner super portable fast and the final images are great. I have scanned all my toddler draws and they look beautiful on screen also business cards and old papers storage for years.
5,awesome product. it does everything i need and more. i have been involved for some time in getting all of my business paperwork and photos into my computer. my flatbed scanner just was taking too long. i heard about this scanner from a friend and took the plunge. wa-lah! it is excellent. i find it very easy to feed in the paper photo or what ever it is. this scanner will do business cards and all other standard paper shapes.the only improvement i would give it is that the original packaging come with the needed computer software in CD form for loading onto your computer.this is specifically the white Doxie go i am referring to.
5,I'm going completely paperless and have boxes of photos a whole file cabinet of records and tons of college notebooks to recycle. This scanner is amazing. It works quickly and efficiently and comes with great software that allows me to save everything to my hard drive or (what I actually do) seamlessly send things to Evernote to digitally file them. I can also send photos straight to Picasa for digital archiving.The only problem I have is that the photo quality is not 100%. It's good enough to archive old photos that you want to be able to look at every now and then but not if you want to make prints of them again in the future.I love this scanner. I'd recommend it to everyone.
5,Super fast scanner.  Got through 800 photos while I was binge watching Netflix. Stores on an sd card so it doesn't have to be plugged in to the wall or a computer.  It's pretty good quality.  Some of my photos are older or darker so I just put it on 600 and it came out pretty good.  I'd recommend if you have that stack of photo boxes in your closet you want scanned.
4,Was the wrong charger
5,I've done a lot of research to find the right product for going paperless and hands down Doxie is the one. It's portable easy to use and has lots of the functionality you need to organize your documents.
4,The software is easy to use wish it would automatically import while connected to the computer instead of having to select import. Perhaps an automatic titling feature would be nice to use the OCR to scan for the heading.  The hardware setup is a bit dated the usb port is the mini not the micro that is now standard and why it can't charge via the usb and needs a separate cable and box is just simply annoying as another power cord and separate usb cable to cary around for a mobile device.
5,Doxie was so easy to set up. It is a joy to use around the house. Most software that accompanies hardware is confusing but Doxie is the exception! I highly recommend this scanner to others. I cannot wait to continue scanning photos!
3,If you're looking for close to perfection this is not your scanner. If your paper has even a slightly bent corner a crease or has been folded  it will pull it through crooked. You have to take the time to repair any imperfections as best you can on the paper and then you have to try and send it through straight.I've scanned a few thousand pages through mine without incident other than those above.Generally its an ok scanner. There are improvements that should be made. My biggest complaint is that it only scans in color. It's a big pain in the arse to convert each image to b&w just to make it a smaller file.
5,I will write a complete update once I start using it.  So far customer service has been great!Update as of Feb 3rd 2020:The scanner is great.  It does what it says.  User-friendly.  Try it and you will be thankful that you did the right investment
5,It came with a defective SD card but their customer service was great and sent me a new card.  With the new card it works great!  Excellent quality scans (including color photos) and it’s fast!  I would recommend this scanner.
5,I have had this scanner for several years.  It is easy to use and works great.  Even though it is small you can feel the quality.  I use it for documents and photos.
5,I decided to archive all my old photos. The Doxie is working perfectly for me. It is super quick and the software is super simple. I have scanned over 1000 pictures so far. I highly recommend !!
5,You should rename this to "Scanner with a Superman Cape"!  This little scanner is awesome.  I not only have found it to be effective & accurate but also a lot of fun to use.  It is very user friendly and can professionally scan everything from a business card to an 81/2 x 11' letter.  It will scan both regular and irregular shaped documents.  I just thoroughly enjoy this Doxie and am so glad I have it.  Everybody should get one to use around the house to organize documents.  Good job to the Doxie folks.  Keep them coming.
5,This product is excellently portable and usable. The support staff at Doxie is better than I have ever seen in companies like these. They are extremely friendly helpful and personable. 10/10 recommend.
5,I LOVE this thing. I read a long time ago you have people who file and people who pile. I'm a piler. Enter Doxie. WOW. I cleared off my desk. Scanned everything in connected to Evernote sorted into notebooks. VERY happy. The scanner is small light and very forgiving. The only thing I don't like is having to scan one page at a time but I knew that when I bought it. That is initially a pain if you have a huge backlog but for everyday stuff it's fine. It's so small and wireless that I can carry it to any room scan whenever I like and then synch at my convenience. Big big fan. Does the job of $400+ scanners for half the price.
5,I've been obsessed with this thing scanning everything I have and throwing it away.. All the receipts and useless papers I've kept just in case now that I scanned them I don't few guilty throwing them away... Don't use the scanner when connected to the computer because it uploads every document and takes a long time between scans.. Either have it charged or connected to wall and between scans range from 2-5 seconds while the other way may take 30 secs to a minute... Love the fact once I buy a product scan the receipt then it's trash.. I have not seen much wrong with this product.. It has def improved my life
3,Great scanner but it doesn't take much time for the port where the cable plugs into the back of scanner to become loose and nonfunctional.  Also it was impossible to update the scanner driver.  The program would prompt me to update but whenever I tried it would not update so I forever was prompted to update every single time I used the scanner.  Didn't last a year.
4,I love the ease of use with the SD card. I wish that I would have bought the version without WiFi. It takes too long to connect. Also it is not easy to connect to iPhone. Downloading to computer pictures file was easy but I wish I could download it to iCloud.
5,Amazing. I bought this just for receipts and quick scans and it is way better than I expected. I have it running in WiFi mode and can sit in other rooms and scan receipts and they show up like magic on my computer in the app. Then I send them off to Evernote (I do this manually on  my computer to better tag/file which you can't do if you run in direct to Evernote mode).I still have my full scanner/printer for high quality photos or big multipage documents but the Doxie nails the simplicity and speed.My goal was to have something small sitting out in the kitchen area to quickly scan healthcare and other tax-related receipts or anything paper I want to file in Evernote. This handles that perfectly with nearly no effort.
5,I'm scanning a lot of old letters and greeting cards that I never thought would go through the scanner but almost all of them have scanned successfully. In many cases the scanned versions are easier to read than the originals.
4,I like it because I can scan documents without being attached to the computer.  I have a multifunction printer (HP) and a flat bed scanner (HP) and the Doxie scans appear to be of similar quality to them.  The only negative is that it is very sensitive to the condition of the paper; if the edge is dog-eared or a little ragged you have to put it in the included sleeve or it will not feed.  Rather than carry the sleeve with me I wait until returning to the office to scan those documents.It is a great scanner.
5,I have had this scanner for a two days and it is a great all purpose scanner to keep within arms reach. I have used the portable scanner from neat receipts and the Doxie scanner is more flexible and is quicker to integrate into my workflow for meeting notes documents and expense receipts. Setup is very quick and the ability to use this scanner disconnected from a computer and power source increases the flexibility. I did not have the same issue as people did in other reviews with the mis-aligned scans. You just have to take advantage of the built in guide and pre-feed feature to make sure the document is lined up. The MAC version of the software is easy to use.
4,Like: Portable easy to use fulfills purpose.Dislike: Cannot import multiple scans from Iphone app into a cloud storage medium.
4,I bought this just over a month ago. I love this scanner because of its portability. It has an internal battery and internal memory. The OCR is better than other scanners i've tried. The only thing is sometimes it skews papers. You have to feed it in perfectly because if it gets skewed you'll have to rescan it again. Also I wish it had an auto-document feeder so I could scan more papers quicker. Other than that it's a great product and I do recommend it especially for those who scan things on the go.
3,One of the things I don't like is there is no good way to organize what you scan into the files.  I wish there would be some type of scan identifier that would try and combine receipts that had the same key words.  If you have a two paged bill it scans those in separately and you have to go in find what goes with what and manually combine them.  The other thing I was disappointed to find out was that I sometimes have long receipts.  It refuses to scan those in so there is no way to keep record of them unless I guess I cut apart the receipt and scanned it in side by side but I can't do that because I need to provide actual receipts for reimbursement.
1,I was super excited for for this. I have a ton of medical bills prescription tags and receipts in addition to medical files. I needed to organize them and this looked perfect. Especially since I don’t work with a laptop or PC unless absolutely necessary. I wanted something that could work solely with an iPad and/or iPhone. Never touching or connecting to a PC/laptop. This is the only option on the market but…The user interface sucks. I’m still having a problem locating my scans on my iPad.I could never get it to connect to my iPhone.Only seems to transmit when plugged in.However the biggest problem is after a somewhat decent start it just quick connecting to anything after the battery died and I had to recharge it. Now it doesn’t scan connect or do anything of use. Basically a paperweight.
5,I've tried several other scanners and this one is awesome.  This was my second purchase of a Doxie scanner.  They are a wonderful company to work with and the scanner is simple to use.  Can't beat the quality for the price.
5,Doxie is a great and *relatively* inexpensive (compare it with the Neat and ScanSnap options) solution to piles of paper statements.Doxie requires even less space in my home office than my last two scanners -- Canon LiDE models which are nicely compact but don't offer the convenience of cordless document-feed scanning. I can feed a month of statements and other documents into Doxie before I even bother to connect it to my Mac. Once I connect it I can combine ("staple" in Doxie's interface) pages from a particular statement choose whether or not to save the scans in color or black-and-white and decide whether or not to apply optical character recognition to make searching for a statement later much easier. The recent firmware update added support for legal-size documents resolving my only minor annoyance.
5,Very simple to use and set up.  My wife has a huge project to scan her parents old photo albums. I'd try getting her to use traditional flatbed scanner but she felt it to technical and restrictive. Doxi Go Wifi SE is just the thing for the job 2 quick demos and she was scanning like a pro.  Very nice product.
5,My daughter recommended this scanner to me as an easy to use doesn't require a lot of tech savvy abilities. It does all that it says it does. After a few months of use and while still under warranty I ran into a problem and contacted customer support. Within 3 days I had a new replacement on my doorstep!  Customer support was great!
1,It worked once after a few hours of trying to figure it out but went to use it again and it wouldn’t scan at all! Wasted money. You can see it links to the computer but when you can no image is scanned.
3,If I had a dollar for every time I had to rescan or the page didn't feed properly I would be using it to buy another scanner. Although this is useful and for the price point it works I just get frustrated that i have so  many scanned pages of blurred scans or scans that were good for the first half and then blurred the second half...or scans that get read but the page didn't actually load....every time the scanner rolls the rollers it is scanning and the success rate of the page feeder is probably 5/10. So about half of the scans are no good. the pages basically need to be ironed in order to feed without having issues.
3,Simply feeding paper into this is very difficult. More than half of the time it sticks and the rollers spin and you can't get the paper to load. Very frusterating. I contacted support who are very nice and they sent me a replacement unit. Brand new. Same deal. Don't buy. Unless I have bad luck with these. I'm getting the Fujutsu.Update: I updated my review to 3 stars as I figured out the problem. Apparently you can't scan paper that has been recently printed on from some printers that bend the end of the page when it's fed through. Something with the angle my Brother printer bends the paper is not compatible with this scanner.I love the Fujitsu it's just pretty spendy. I would have liked this scanner ok if I didn't have this incompatibility.
5,Prefect tool for scanning receipts on the go. I used to hold on to Christmas and birthday cards for memorial sake. Now I have the ability to scan these cards and throw the hard copies away. Great for eliminating clutter!
5,Easy to use. I have found a few scans that had to be redone so I check them on my computer after scanning a bunch of papers. I wan't able to get the Android app to work but it is so easy to use with my Windows PC and OneNote that I'm not concerned about that.
5,I have been using this scanner for around 2 months now and it has been great for doing fieldwork as an auditor. It is very portable and useful for small jobs of between 1-30 or so pages. It was super easy to use and setup.
5,I have a huge project ahead of me and Doxie is cutting my scanning time in half.  Photos and documents. No-brainer software that can crop and straighten- many formats pdf jpg etc. Two different resolution settings 300 dpi and 600 dpi one can switch to with the click of a button.  Only con is upload time but I'll take that over sitting at a scanner for hours on end.  It can also charge while uploading.  Best part is that my kids (5 and 8) love to help me scan now.  Buy the case if you are going to take it places - It is nice and protects it.
5,Does exactly what it says it does. I'm really happy with it.
4,UPDATE: I originally gave this product 1 star because it would not charge due to a loose power cord. The seller was incredibly responsive. They read my review and responded immediately. They shipped a new product overnight. The new power cord snaps into the scanner firmly. Resolution in less than 36 hours!If necessary I'll update my review again after I've used the scanner more.Original: Power cord would not fit snugly into scanner. As a result the scanner would not charge.
5,This scanner was just was what our nonprofit needed to be able to work remotely be able to scan and share documents on Google Drive quickly and easily.
5,I really love this scanner! It changes the way I handle photos and definitely great for my business
5,As a photo scanner the Doxie Go SE provides very crisp scans.  I'm in the process of scanning hundreds of very old photos.  It does a superior job to an older scanner that went bad.  Using the photo sleeve protects the fragile photos and enables fast  easy scanning.
5,I keep the Doxie in my briefcase so I can scan client paperwork when needed.  I absolutely love it.  It keeps the charge for a very long time (haven't run out of charge but I do use it at home so it's in the office too).  Very handy and easy to use.  Sometimes the wifi connection takes a moment or two to connect but it has it's own wifi which you access then upload all your documents onto your computer.  VERY convenient!  Highly recommend!
5,I love this gadget. it set up easily. I mostly use it for work. I scan documents so I find myself carrying around fewer documents and thus I have a lighter briefcase
5,This a great tool for scanning photos because it doesn't need to be tethered to your computer.
5,I bought this as a replacement for my neat desk scanner that was failing with poor scan quality.  I could not have made a better choice.  This scans without a computer and can hold thousands of scans depending on size and color of the scans.There are two downside to the scanner.  One is that it stops at around 14 inches.  Anything longer that that has to be cut and then reassembled with software. The second is that if your paper is slightly wrinkled at the edge you are inserting into the scanner it will jam easily.I've run over 5000 scans and the quality is still great.
5,I'm using this to convert my paper files to electronic - the word recognition is a life saver because now I can ctrl+F my giant file folder! Would recommend.
5,Bought this scanner to replace another brand and love it. The ability to scan completely untethered is great the software is much better than the one in the other manufacturer generated PDFs are smaller and have good OCR very pleased with this so far.
5,I was hesitant about buying one of these scanners. I thought I should just put my receipts in my printer's scanner instead of spending money on something like this. But friends had told me they were really useful so since my house was swimming in receipts I decided to bite the bullet and buy one. It's great. It sits on my kitchen counter and I just turn it on scan and throw the receipts way. My house is now receipt free and the software allows you to organize the scanned receipts nicely. Since I have a small business my receipts are important to me. Very glad I bought it.
5,It works and is more practical than I expected very good buy.
5,Really great tech support from right here in the US. No Bangalore problems. Only negative is that scans are saved to an SD card and not right to your hard drive
5,I've scanned well over 1000 pages of documents with ease. The unit is easy to set up and use.
5,I've had this for 2 days now and had a problem with the charging cord not wanting to seat itself in the hole. I emailed the Doxy team and they immediately responded that they would send me a new cord. If you have to have a "kink" in a product purchase you only hope customer service is helpful. Doxie's customer service was absolutely phenomenal. I got an email right away indicating that my new cord was on the way. Awesome!
5,This photo scanner is super easy to set-up and operate.Love how small the scanner is.Love how simple the directions are.Love how interested and friendly the Doxie personnel are.
5,This scanner is an absolute gem.It's portability is great and the Doxie software works nicely. Get the eye-fi SD card and you can scan to your computer wirelessly. It is super easy to set up and super easy to use.My only real gripes is that it would have been great to have a USB charger rather than a standard A/C power cord. Also sometimes the item being scanned will stall or get crooked and require a second pass (if it's folded or otherwise mangled). But that's pretty rare and neither of these gripes are even bad enough to warrant a loss of stars.
5,I like it! Best potable scanner yet. All self contained simple  no hassle startup on Mac recommend highly.
5,I really really really love Doxie. This has saved my attic and closet from the boxes of old paperwork. Christmas cards forms receipts letters -- you name it Doxie scanned it in perfectly. It has some challenge with staples so I recommend that those be removed before using the scanner. I had the strange pleasure of contacting Doxie support over a question on their documentation - and their service was prompt and pleasant. Looking forward to every bit of new mail to archive!
5,This scanner is easy to use and a quick way to scan documents to store or email. I highly recommend it.
5,This little scanner is amazing! Its fast scans perfectly and absolutely worth buying.
4,This scanner is very portable scans in high quality and is easy to use.  It is a bit picky regarding damage to the edges of documents you are trying to scan -- not grabbing onto and feeding imperfect documents.  I also hope for some improvements to the app.  But it gets the job done at an economical price and the Wi-Fi capability makes it a breeze to import scans made while on the road.
5,This scanner is fantastic! My dad passed away and to prevent "challenges" over possession of > 1500 photos I bought the Doxie and a 32 GB card. I would sit on the couch and scan till the card was full then transfer to my PC to optimize later. Scanning is super fast and software allows scanning of front and notes on the backs then "staple" the two images together! Now someone else has MANY boxes of photos to deal with. Document scanning is perfect. Very happy with my purchase. I recommend Bluetooth version.
5,Good quality product and great customer service. Actually Could be the best customer service out there. If you have a problem they will take care of it and the most refreshing part of it They want to help! Doxie Set up was easy scanner is solid and works great. I had a small issuethe speed and tone of the customer service response was amazing. Doxie now has a customer for life in me. Good product good price good service good people.... How often do you ever get to say all those things together. So If you need a good portable scanner Doxie!
4,The scanner made quick work of uploading boxes of physical photos.  Quick and painless.  Would love the app to be able to search for duplicates.Using the scanner now to scan receipts paperwork!  Thanks Doxie!
5,Doxie Go SE makes good scans.  The software is easy to figure out.  I had it scanning and making PDFs in 10 minutes.
5,Love this scanner. Very easy to use. Able to connect both wired and wirelessly. Scans flawlessly. Appreciate the ability to scan all sizes of documents.
5,I love this scanner! It’s so easy to use and scanning lots of photos/letters/documents goes so fast. In a week I’ve already scanned thousands of family photographs From my mom’s house. It’s amazing!
1,This is a great little machine. I have scanned 2000+ documents. It has helped me clear a lot of old clutter from my desk and filing cabinets. That being said the paper feeder chokes on any piece of paper where the leading edge has any crease at all. When the machine detects that a new sheet is being fed the intake wheel starts spinning the scanner lights turns on and the image capture software begins capturing an image of nothing. If you fidget with the paper the scanner may finally pull the paper all the way through but when you look at the image created by the Doxie the top section of the page is a weird stretched image of nothing that was created while the paper was stuck. The blurred edge then has to be removed manually by editing the image in the software that comes with the Doxie. The software is capable but the fact that it has to be used at all and so often negates the laudable qualities of this device.By comparison I can scan 30 double-sided pages to PDF on an office-quality scanner in 30 seconds. This same task takes 30 minutes with the Doxie Go. The USB transfer rate is 1.0 slow. The paper feeder is terrible. The export speed is also very slow.This would be a fine scanner for $30. Priced at $199 this is an overpriced disappointment.
4,I'm ok with this now.  I hated it at first but I've figured out some of the quirks with the help of doxie support.  Still have to manually switch my computer to it as a network and then back when finished.  I think it's better on apple than on pc but both work ok.
5,This pocket scanner is great. It feeds well is ultra compact and has a lot of onboard memory. My only quibble is the staple function in the software which wants to put everything together. You have to staple a bundle save it elsewhere and then delete that stapled packet. If you don't your next staple attempt will just attach to the first set of documents. However this si a minor inconvenience weighed against the pluses of the scanner.I highly recommend you purchase the case as well to keep the scanner clean and protected between uses. It would have been nice if the case had a little pocket for the cleaning tool but ce la vie. It's not a deal-breaker
5,This thing is so easy to use! Everything I have read about it has be accurate. I haven't had any issues. I didn't buy anything extra with it. It works great!
5,The scanner is awesome but the WiFi is not that useful.  I wish I had purchased the version without WiFi - I find myself connecting it to my computer via cable anytime I want to grab my scans.Update: After I posted this review I heard from Doxie Customer Service who offered to refund me the difference between the WiFi and no-WiFi version since I'm not using the WiFi.  I bumped my review up to five stars as a result.  The scanner itself does everything I want and I love it.
5,Nice little scanner. Sheet feed is quick. Software on the computer is easy to use. Allows for slight angle when the scan is crooked.
5,Best invention since sliced bread! I scanned all our family photos from birth to current ... parents  plus 4 siblings..plus spouses .. and all those kids..4000+ photos...done in a very short time and very clear!
5,I bought Doxie SE so I could visit my mother and scan old photos for family history. I scanned 160 photos in two hours. There is no way I could have done that with a desk top scanner. Doxie SE is quick and the resolution is top notch. I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase.
5,This is the single best purchase I have ever made! I have scanned everything to articles I want to keep (without having a sack of magazines as clutter) photos bills product manuals to anything else I can get my hands on. Doxie Go with my 2 TB hard drive will enable paperless in no time! It is fast accurate and the software is so simple. With a quick click of the mouse I can staple scans together into one document unstaple if I made a mistake as well as crop and/or rotate so quickly. I am very happy with my purchase!
2,Was under the impression it was compatible with quick books but not the case
5,This scanner does everything Doxie advertises. If you are looking for a great scanner that does what it's supposed to do and doesn't break your wallet in half this is the one you should get. The customer support is phenomenal. It so easy to use that I didn't need support but they checked in with me anyway to make sure I was satisfied. You will not go wrong if you get this scanner. It's small and portable but it does a big job very well. Get one.
5,Have spent the past few days going paperless with this awesome scanner! Love how I can decide to staple multiple pages together and save them as PDF or JPEG.
5,Will be used for genealogy.  Tried a few test photos and other things since getting 4 days ago.  Works great with my Mac.  I use a SD Card.  Also took SD card and loaded test photos into iPhone 6 plus and my iPad with no problems.  This will work places I go and want to take scans of very old documents or photos.  The size is great.  I had a software question and Doxie replied back within a few hours.
5,Simple easy to use compact and untethered from charging or computer wires.  At times sat on my couch with a bunch of papers and leisurely fed them through Doxie.  Later organized them in an online filing system after a simple wireless download to my computer.  The software is easy to use and what is key is that you are not tied to their software forever - no horror stories of not upgrading to their new version just so you can access your saved documents.  Would buy Doxie again in a heartbeat.
5,I bought this so that we could go as paperless as possible in my house.  We now scan bills/receipts etc after their immediate use and once a week we use evernote to file and index the scanned copies.  We then do a online sync of the evernote database to dropbox.  The scanner works well and my wife finds it very easy to use.  It's small foodprint allows us to stow it away on the counter and it gets all the charge it needs during the weekly filing session when it's hooked to the PC via USB.
5,I use the USB connection for fast scanning great photo copy easy to group pictures into one folder (Stapling) with one name and Doxie adds the number at the end. Import & export is quick. Love the slim line. I have not had a problem with the thickness of the document being scanned.  I love it.
5,Took some early learning and Doxie is very supportive. They will contact YOU!  Thanks Doxie!!
2,I am returning the Go SE. After scanning the several pictures I compared the scans to the originals and saw the color red sometimes blue and occasionally yellow were added. Other scans were significantly darker than the originals. I have thousands of pictures I want to scan and do not have time to edit all of them with a photo editor.  All of the scans I did were at 600 dpi. I am not sure why scanning alters the photos so much a decent scanner should not alter the scan at all.
3,This product I thought was portable. The computer set up is more complicated than expected.
2,Arrived in plastic bag not in manufacturers box. Looks like used not sure. Software is not user friendly. Disconnect itself “device is not found”… will return
5,I bought the Doxie after a review I saw on a blog I follow and it's everything they promised it would be.Lightweight easy to setup and easy to use. I scanned thousands of documents and was able to clear out an entire filing cabinet from our house.This is a must have for people who are looking to minimize and simplify their lives.And because it's small chargeable and portable you can easily take it anywhere to scan receipts or other small documents you want/need to keep.
5,I purchased the first one in April 2013. The battery did not last very long and then about a month ago it stopped working completely. I called Apparent and they sent me a replacement along with a universal charger. What a difference in battery life! I've had it sitting on my counter for about 3 weeks before it needed a recharge. The wireless feature works great too. I no longer have a pile of receipts and paper around my workspace. The universal charger is great because when the battery runs out Doxie will continue to scan when plugged in—not the case previously. Overall I am very happy with Doxie Go.
4,This works quite well although it seems to require that you download software on your computer in order to transfer the images.  This is no problem for me but a friend tried to use it on her work computer and their IT settings didn't allow the computer to download the software which was an inconvenience.  Sometimes I do have trouble getting it to load the document straight.
5,I have scanned over 3000 photos and this is very easy to use I am very pleased with it  Once I have scanned the photos onto the card reader I use a usb  card reader converter to save the photos onto a portable hard drive which also plugs into my computer using a USB cable
5,The Doxie GO SE is very easy to use and it's great to have such a portable scanner.
5,great way to digitize years of glossy photos - simple mechanics (enuf for an 80 year old) ease of use seems to be very interested in helping users.
5,I’ve owned Doxie products before. This new scanner allows me to scan as I go and upload to my computer whenever. There is no longer a pile of papers needing to be scanned and an hour or so of scanning to be done at a time. I love the convenience of it. Easy to use. Fast and it just works! I recommend it to anyone wanting to organize their bills and receipts.
5,You wouldn't think something this small could do a great job scanning but it does.  My husband had a stack of receipts he needed to scan and once it was charged he finished in no time flat.  He likes the program with it too.  He had a huge bulky scanner before and likes this smaller one much much better.  It is much faster and he can take it on trips to keep up with the paperwork as he goes.  I am going to get one for myself now that he's tested it for me (smile).
5,So easy to use! Love the size and portability. Obvious customer support. Photo scans appear to be good quality. I'm really happy with my purchase.
3,the scanning capabilities are great but don't use the software if you have a Mac. It doesn't work with the C port SD card or DOXIE connection to import.
5,This FAR out-performed my expectations.  I was hoping for a device that would perform adequately.  This is everything promised and more.  Everything works the way it says.  No gaps no workarounds.  They thought of everything.  Very simple and elegant.  Very well designed.  It is truly portable without extras to keep track of.  Everything you need goes right in the sleeve.  Very thorough instructions with a useful few tips.  Make sure you read the instructions and the stuff online.  It really is helpful.  I'm not used to being treated this well by hardware or software providers.  I love it.  Hat's off to the Doxie people.
5,Absolutely loving our Doxie Go WiFi so far. We keep it in our kitchen for convenience -- scanning receipts and mail items every day (or every couple days). Scans are sent via WiFi to a computer elsewhere in the house and are automatically backed up to Dropbox for easy remote access.The charge lasts for a quite a while and a typical iphone charger works just fine for refreshing its power (using the supplied USB cable). No need to bring it back to the computer.The OCR works very well. Every search test I've conducted yields excellent results.I'd definitely recommend this scanner to anyone looking to move their piles of documents and receipts from physical to digital form.
5,Used to archive family photos scanned a little over 5000 and counting. Great little machine.
5,I bought the Doxie Go Scanner so that I could easily scan and store my tax documents on my computer. I have been using it for several months now and I could not be more satisfied! The only thing I could say is that I wish I would have waited until the newest wireless version came out. I did purchase an Eye-Fi card to go along with this scanner so I still have the ability for wireless use and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an extremely portable and reliable scanner. The Doxie Go saved me from having a giant hideous scanner sitting in my office and taking up precious space!
4,I bought this to have a more paperless office. So far So good.the software is insanely easy to use and allows to export into searchable PDFs which is a awesome!the only con is that you cannot have it plugged in to your computer and scan at the same time as it confuses the system you have to scan all your documents and then connect to your computer.But overall this has a nice compact look quick and simple software highly recommend!
5,Adore this tool. I needed to get rid of as much as possible in a hurry to facilitate a move halfway across the country and this enabled me to digitize my files in a hurry. If I have a doubt about throwing something away if I think that maybe just maybe I'll have a reason to need it later I can scan it and stash it. So much less headache than the scanner that was bundled in with my printer. Love the software which allows for stapling documents OCR and saving as PDF or jpg among other options.
3,I'm a truck driver who needs to scan in paperwork in order to get paid. With this scanner I'm able to easily scan in multiple documents in various size. Its the perfect travel companion. I used a usb adapter in order to send my documents directly to my phone. The big problem I have was it’s durability in my truck it stop working after 3 months- it was great while it lasted.
5,So far this product has done all of needed plus more. Plus very portable and easy to use
5,Small portable simple and extremely easy to use.  Does a great job with scans too.  Battery lasts a good while.
5,Wow I was very impressed with all of it.  I used to scan all my old photos to downsize our home storage.  Very user friendly great photo quality even very old photos.  Can't say enough about how great this product is to me.
5,Absolutely LOVE this scanner. SO easy to use and is really fast for pictures. I like that it has internal memory so you don't have to plug in a flash drive or hard drive. I like that it is wireless and the battery lasts quite a while before you have to charge it. I scanned over 2000 picture and now have them on my computer. Just what I needed and worth the money. You won't regret it.
5,I love this little beast. I have been able to reduce the amount of paper that we've been storing. Pairing this device with Evernote is ridiculously easy and I can have all my documents anywhere. I can't tell you how many times this has come in handy. From medical records to friends asking how much it cost me for random services it's awesome. This is such a well-working machine for a home office situation. Very reliable. Highly recommended.
1,Have owned it for 3 years and have had nothing but problems everytime I use it. Barely connects to Wi-Fi. App is not user friendly whatsoever and even when plugged into usb on computer still doesn’t scan. Will scan one picture and then stops.
5,Bought with intention to digitize family albums. Worked fantastic. Although maybe out of 800 pictures 15 didn't scan and had to be re-scanned. So maybe that was due to the abundance I was scanning all at once. When only scanning one thing here or there had zero issues. Great replacement for my printer/scanner. And the fact that you don't need to be connected to computer to scan them is great they simply store in Doxi memory till you upload. Scanned in 800 pictures before uploading to computer. Didn't have built in Wi-fi on this one but wasn't an issue.
5,Doxie Go Plus is a quick way to scan photos into a computer. I have scanned well over 5000 photos and they look crisp and clear. It has both a memory card holder and internal memory. The software is easy to use and allows you to edit on the fly. I contacted Doxie for a small issue I was having and they responded with the solution within a day. Happy with my purchase!
5,Like the portability and compact size.  Don't like that you can't save to google photos or Verizon cloud.  Using One Driive which is ok.  Love being able to see photos digitally can modify them and share them electronically.
5,I ordered a Doxie Go in March and used it successfully for several months but encountered a problem with it that I couldn't figure out.  Customer service came running to the rescue and went above and beyond to correct the problem and make sure that I was happy.I travel for work and encounter many written documents and contracts along the way.  It takes only a few moments to pull out the cordless wireless Doxie Go and scan them then at the end of my trip upload them all to my cloud drive.Thanks Doxie
5,I'm in love with this scanner. Running a business from home I used our NeatDesk a lot and thought it was the best but they fell behind in their software being able to work with a Mac's operating system and got VERY glitchy. This fills in where that was failing for receipts business cards and quick one page documents. For me it's a perfect companion to a large auto-feeding scanner that we use for bigger documents.
5,I love this scanner! Easy set up has worked flawlessly and easy to use. I leave it plugged in on my home desk so both my spouse and I can immediatley scan in any reciept or document. I got tired of keeping copious amounts of paper work and receipts for tax purposes when now we can go paperless. Soon to be gone is the wall of 4 drawer file cabinets with 7 years of receipts and tax documents.
5,At first I purchased a wand scanner and I found the process to be more than tedious.  I needed something portable that did not require connection to a computer in order to scan.  This is it!  It scans fast is light weight and each time I use it I love it more!  I had a question about encrypted USB drives for use with the Doxie Go.  I received a very detailed and helpful response the same day from Doxie Customer Care which I  found to be amazing in itself.  I believe when my wand using colleagues see my Doxie Go they will want one of their own.
5,Light. Quality construction. Fast. Amazing scans. Superb customer service. I use it with my Surface Property. Fits easily inside my Surface carry bag. Has almost completely replaced my flatbed scanner. Great for importing hand drawn sketches into Photoshop or Illustrator. Almost entirely eliminates the mountain of paper. Scan receipts paperwork too. I love it. Only wish I had sprung for the WiFi version.  No computer necessary. Bring this and your sketch pad out in the field upload drawings into PC later.
4,Product works well.  Doxie provided excellent customer support.
3,It's okay. The picture quality is pretty decent. I gave it 4 stars mainly because of the reason that I couldn't get it to connect to any of the cloud storage is that it says it's supposed to work with but overall it works really good. It would have been nice when I scanned it and uploaded directly to Cloud. Versus having to use the included micro SD card.
5,Great portable device. Wasn’t crazy about portable interface.
5,I love my Doxie scanner! It is very easy to use and portable.  It scans up to a legal size paper. It is sturdy and withstands some abuse from my children.My only complaint is I've had a few issues with the software but I hear that the new release of the software has fixed several of my complaints.  The software is great allows you to trim flip correct coloring etc.I wish there was a little more documentation included with it but it's all online and available. I just like to have the information in front of me when I'm working with it.
5,I am very happy that I chose this over the neat desk.  I have recommended it to a lot of people.  I was so tired of hoarding documents so I started scanning everything in. This thing scans photos in very well also! I scan a lot of my kids' pictures/art and notes that they write to me. You can electronically staple the pages together to make one set.  You also have the option to save it as JPEG or even PDF (or both.)
5,I like this scanner  it is very small  super practical it works perfect  great quality.
3,The Doxie is okay. I can see the benefit to having a wireless scanner but the battery just didn't last long enough to make it worth having. I returned it for the scansnap instead. You have to plug it into your laptop when using it but honestly I found it much easier to sort and rename the files as I was scanning than to go back through the 150ish pages and try to decide which pages go together as one document (each page scans as it's own pdf so you have to combine them whereas the scansnap will scan a document together into one pdf).
5,I've had the Doxie Go for a few weeks now and it's been incredibly helpful in scanning receipts magazine articles saved recipes from magazines business cards etc.  The software could be a bit better but the scanner itself is great.  This afternoon my husband (or maybe me we disagree) brushed against it when it was on the dining room table and it went flying -- and hit the floor hard.  And .. it still works!  That was a feature I didn't expect ... hardiness.  (Now don't go throwing it at the floor and expect it will always survive....)
4,This is a great little scanner; I love everything about it with the exception of it jamming if paper isn't fed in just right.  If your paper has any bent ends on it or corners it will jam it.  Otherwise it is fantastic.  I love the portability and the clarity of the scanned images.  The set up was super easy and the software is easy to use.  I would still highly recommend it despite the jamming issue.
4,I had to sent the scanner back because the ac adapter was not working.  You couldn't slide the appropriate plug on it for US power.  I want them to send me a new one because I think the scanner sounds cool but until I get a chance to use it I won't know.  I received the replacement and it is a wonderful little jewel.
5,I use it for scanning receipts needed for work right now but after seeing how fast it is compared to using my all-in-one printer to scan things I've decided I'm going to use it to digitize every photo in every album that I have.  The software that comes with it is super easy to use too.
5,This is one of the amazing scanners available and the software that comes with it is fantastic too! Only gripe is that it takes 20-30 seconds to connect to the internet. OCR is perfect. I use it for everything!
5,Easy to set-up transport and learn to use.
5,This has been the best decision I have made for my company. I am a small business that is virtual and paperless. When I go to seminars doxie is with me I scan handouts on the spot and file them appropriately. It is easy to use and the best feature si that it has it's own wi-fi. First review I have ever written becasue I want to let others know it is worth it!
5,the task was making a digital copy of my wife's family pictures. When I tried using my printer to scan pictures it a couple of hours to do only few small packets of old pictures.  With Doxie I scanned all pictures in a couple hour session what was going to  takes weeks.
4,I am really impressed with this scanner.  It was easy to install to my Mac and easy to operate.  I like that I can take it anywhere scan in what I need and then plug it into the computer and save the items to my Evernote folders easily.  I wish it were just a tad bigger so that I could scan in my 12 x 12 scrapbook pages!
5,Have used the original for years and now the new model (240) for the last few months. Works great the software looks a little dated but I haven't had any problems with it in the last few years.Few times I've had issues customer service have been very quick to help and once when the scanner stopped working they immediately sent me a new one. Very impressive and would recommend to anyone for that alone.
3,Original review:  Seems like a good idea but never got it to work well. I ended up purchasing a Neat desktop about 6-months later.Update 6/2/14 - After posting my original review I received a call from a Doxie rep and I have to admit that I was shocked and pleasantly surprised at the high level of customer service shown. It is rare to receive such concern from a company and I was impressed. For that reason I am raising my rating from one star to three stars and will give the item another shot with the help of company support. I will provide a future update.
4,Love it! I have emptied at least 7 binders of work into my computer from my bookshelves. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it does miss a page every once in awhile so I have to make sure that everything went through before recycling the documents. The setup was effortless and the wi-fi works great with my laptop at home.
5,Produces high quality scans quickly and easy. Has been a lifesaver for producing PDFs for online teaching purposes.
5,I tried many solutions in order to convert my paper life into digital media. I used standalone scanners scanners in MFUs I made pictures of the bills and papers with my smartphone etc. And now I feel happy with the Doxie Go Wi-Fi scanner. It's amazingly nice fast and precise. It takes almost zero time to scan a bunch of bills annotate them and store on the cloud. I especially enjoy Doxie for MAC application it's so clean powerful and "Apple-style" it does exactly what's needed.
5,Everyone should have one. I don't  use the WiFi like I thought I would.I am getting rid of my paper clutter and digitized  most of my old photos then put sd card  in fire proof safe. So much easier  than a flat bed scanner.
5,Super easy to use and quick to scan photos. Easily uploaded to cloud and transferable to computer and other places.
5,Potable and easy to use
3,In retrospect I would just go with the non-wireless version.  The wireless is very slow to connect and to transfer.  It usually drops the connection before I get finished prepping a batch in the software so then I've got to reconnect again to do the next batch.  Now I just hook it up using the cable every time anyway.  I could have saved some money and got the basic version.
3,Scanning works great very portable looks nice.  The wireless functionality is OK but really flaky.  Lots of time spent with the light blinking mysteriously and only some success with wireless transfer.  In the end it was easier just to work over USB.  So I wish I had bought the non-WiFi version and given it 5 stars instead of buying this one and giving it 3 stars.
5,Works great but doesn’t give a really crisp scan. But for home use to make basic scans of bills documents etc. for filing it’s fine. Surprised how fast it feeds the page. Also the app to retrieve the scans is very easy to use.
5,I was suspect of this at first but after reading reviews online and seeing it work i decided to try it.  First run of it this evening and boy am i impressed.  It does everything it promised....simple and will save it in the eassiest way for you.  Save directly to Google docs basecamp....or flickr or many others even to your own desktop filing system.  WOW...easy and hassel free.  I am greatly impressed.  Now all I have to do is remember to scan all my receipts and create a filing system for them.  VERY nice piece of gadgetry.
5,This device is EXTREMELY cool. Also I never needed their tech support but they are amazing in that as soon as you register the product they connect with you to make sure everything is working as expected.Among other things the fact that you do NOT need to have this connected to a PC for it to work is an exceptionally GREAT feature and makes for great convenience.
5,Great product. Compact.  Mine stopped feeding after about 2.5 years of use. I talked to on-line chat on Doxie website. They tried to help me troubleshoot because they said sometimes it's just a software glitch instead of mechanical which didn't solve my problem so they offered to send me a replacement for free - I didn't even ask!  This is an expensive item so that was so surprising and much appreciated.
5,This scanner works great. I've used it to completely digitize all my paperwork. It's fast and easy to use. The software that comes with it is great. I save all my documents as pdf's with ocr recognition. It has no problem recognizing text and i can no easily search for documents using keywords. Also the files aren't that large either. With no feed tray it's hard to get every document through straight but you can easily rotate the document in the software.
5,This is one of the most versatile and useful little devices you will find.Compact stylish works well.Scan things anywhere without a computer or power. Scan stuff...Then just bring it back and connect it to your computer to instantly store what you scanned. Just works....no fuss....no drivers....nice quality scans. Included software is simple yet powerful.Works great with Apple Mac or Windows.This is a key way to simplify your life and finally get rid of lots of paper. Scan stuff organize it and get it up to the cloud. You are going to love it !
5,This is the cutest little scanner that will help you archive all your old photos laying around!
5,Great product. Had some issues with a charger that once I had notified the company a rep worked with me to make sure the problem was solved. Any new product/return shipping was covered by Apparent. Very happy with how this scanner performs and the customer service has been exceptional.For those wondering about how it plays with eyefi cards; the setup was straight forward... I followed the instructions on the Doxie website and it works fine. No need to plug in to computer for data transfer.
5,I love it!! Easy to scan documents..
5,This scanner is a life saver! I had thousands of family photos to scan and this made it so much easier it's well worth the investment to have the ability to scan quickly and easily. Software was easy to use and it's portability allowed me to continue my scanning project while my family and I were driving on a long road trip. Highly recommend this to everyone!
5,I bought this based on comments I found on a blog and wasn't sure how it was going to work out but it has been a great investment that is easy to use generates good scans converts them easily to multiple formats and is allowing us to digitize our files/transition to being as paperless as possible.  Customer service has been accessible and attentive (even though I haven't needed them). This has been a good investment and is a good tool to have at hand.
4,Quite useful. The included software has apparently improved in latter versions.I've been using this to digitize a lot of our paperwork and I can't ever imagine going back to my old scanner for much else.Do note this version is really geared towards mobile users. If you want something to plugin & sit on your desk consider the other versions -- this one prevents you from leaving it plugged in which is the one caveat.
2,We purchased this scanner a while ago and occasionally will use it to scan in various receipts. Scans are good quality and I love the fact that you can scan items without having to plug into the computer and then organize the documents later. Initially when we got the scanner I could not figure out why sometimes it would not turn on recently I have noticed that this is because the compartment that holds the battery does not stay closed well. The flap keeps popping open even in the middle of a scan which causes the scanner to shut off. This alone is very inconvenient. I wish that it would work better especially after spending so much for a scanner that only sometimes works.
5,After a couple weeks of use I am in love with my Doxie + Eye-Fi card.  Every time I scan in a page of handwritten notes or a bill it's a little magical.  You can't beat the automatic handling of Eye-Fi scans the "stapling" and the ability to send right to Evernote.  Doxie has definitely changed the way I keep track of my work.I have no significant complaints.  The battery life is definitely shortened by the Eye-Fi card but I just keep the USB cord handy and charge Doxie when it starts to warn me about a low battery.
4,It is easy to use and does a quality job with resolution my only issue is that it often scans slightly crooked so you have to hold on carefully to the document or photo to ensure it is straight.
4,Very handy. I use it about once a week to scan in all of my mail and receipts. I am almost entirely paperless. Fairly seamless with Evernote. Can be a little contentious depending on the paper but overall works great. Good interface but you have to do the labeling sorting and categorizing yourself as opposed to some other portable scanners. I am well-satisfied with it.
5,This is a great little add-on to your computer setup. Daunting at first to get started because I had stacks everywhere but once I started scanning it was easy to whip through each stack organize on my computer screen and have everything digitized at my fingertips when needed. I put all medical records school records land docs car docs bank docs etc and since I have everything backed up it can be accessed from my computer phone or ipad. It has already saved me a lot of paper search time. I recommend it to get organized and save a tree or two.
1,If something doesn't work according to directions I will no longer feel obligated to call customer service or tech support prior to returning it.  My time is just as valuable as everyone else's and no one pays me for my time on the phone or online to trouble shoot a new product that should work right out of the box.  No regrets.  No remorse.  Product was DOA.Brand new.  Followed directions.  Would not turn on.  Would not charge.  Returned it without wasting time  with tech support or customer service.  My user policy has changed.
1,book
2,This is very easy to use and it may be fine for archiving documents.  Don't buy it for scanning photographs; the resolution is poor and there is considerable moire.  Scanning old photos was my intent with this purchase but it is inadequate for that purpose.  Returning this item
5,Fast easy to use reccomend you go to website and for information on how to sort and store your photos.
5,I love this little toy! Totally easy to use manages documents easily I can send them anywhere I want.  I would have liked it to have a paper feeder but it feeds paper just right if you hold it right.  I'm very happy with this gadget.
5,Very helpful in keeping organized.  Cuts down on clutter.  I just scan it all in and put it in my Evernote.  Scans quickly and easily.  Very easy to upload to computer via wifi connection.  Or even faster with USB cable.  Light and portable.  App works great.
4,This scanner does not scan longer than 8.5" x 15". So if you are purchasing it to scan receipts it is not a good choice if most of your receipts are long. We also had some issues connecting to our Mac Airport wifi. Actually scanning and dealing with the scans has been easy though!
5,Great product
1,There are some cool features about this but it is not as advertised. First of all the design of it pulls in the papers and receipts so most of them scanned incorrectly the main problem though was that the company brags about its organization software. This software does not exist there is a simple software that the papers are scanned into but if you want to do anything with the scans you need a third party software like evernote the problem with evernote is that you can't easily turn the files into PDF and send if needed. Basically if you want to scan your items and never do anything with them than this scanner would be okay but if you need to do anything with it you are probably out of luck. Also not happy with the "Doxie Cloud" it is a part of the software but there apparently is no way to access it looked it up everywhere online and from our understanding it doesn't exist. I am sure for some people use it would be okay but if you are getting it to organize and try to go paperless this scanner does not appear to be the way to go.
5,After researching many similar products I finally settled on the Doxie Go Wi-Fi scanner and I'm happy I did. It is compact well made and easy to use. The accompanying software makes it easy to organize documents after scanning them. Doxie even recommends scanning all your documents at once and organizing them later which saves a person a lot of work. Very happy with my purchase and at the drawer space I have now that I was able to shred all of my documents.
5,Perfect little scanner. I've had mine for over a year & it has revolutionized our home "paper situation". Easy way to scan & reduce clutter! The software application is straightforward & gives you plenty of options - easy to attach several pages together  select the file type you want easy to name each document before you upload to your computer from the scanner memory. I would recommend this to everyone from techy to simple computer users!
5,The Doxie SE has been a wonderful scanner for our business.  It is easy to use does a great job scanning and has made our record keeping paper free!  Highly recommend.
5,This is the best thing since sliced bread. Excellent product and easy to use.
5,This is a great product.I purchased this scanner to complete sales contracts and send them in for processing right from customers homes.  I use the Eye-Fi card to link it with my Iphone then I convert scans to PDF's using an app called Cam Scanner and I email it to my office.  I keep a USB charger in my car and charge it while driving to my next client.  It cones with a case it works well and it is easy to use.Bravo Apparent! (When are you going to make a flying car?)
5,We LOVE this scanner. It is very small and creates high quality scans. The Doxie app for iOS is fantastic.We keep this in a kitchen drawer and use it to scan mail receipts bills photos coupons cards and our son's preschool "artwork". If you are interested in de-cluttering your life this is a must-have!BONUS TIP: Doxie has the GREATEST Customer Service ever!
5,Absolutely love it. I dont know how I have functioned for 15 years managing 2 companies from my home and from foreign countries without one of those. Slick Smart Simple & Super efficient. I just bought this and I am  traveling tomorrow for a few months so I already used it and... this is coming with me! My hope is to get rid of my file cabinets soon. Thank you Apparent great product.
5,This works great and is such a time saver.  My daughter used it to copy pics for her senior video.  Then my son used it to copy a bunch of family photo's.  Super easy to use.  Love it!
5,Awesome scanner! I bought this since every printer I own has a scanner that doesn't work. The Doxie is easy to use very quick at scanning and able to be taken wherever you go. I can't ask for anymore Well done Doxie highly recommend to anyone!
5,Super simple to use. I have been dreading scanning a huge stack of photos from my wedding for about 13 years. With the Doxie Go SE it took me less than two hours. I finally have hope of getting out from under my huge pile of paper documents as well!
5,This is a great portable scanner!  Scanning is easy transferring to a computer is easy cropping/adjusting is easy.  I especially like being able to take it from room to room without hauling around power cords.  Very happy with this purchase!
1,Worked great for the first project I used it for then seven months later it wouldn't turn on or charge. Of course after the return or tech support window.
5,Gave it to my husband for Christmas.  He loves it!  He likes the speed and how easily it is to operate.  Great product.
5,Pros:Easy to use portable good life per charge great internal memory for scanning anywhere easy software installation and use and good quality of scanned images/documents. So far we've had great luck with the PDFs coming out with easily editable text as well.Cons:Doesn't scan double-sided (though it doesn't claim to). Requires additional accessories to wirelessly connect and transfer scanned documents.Overall:Great value for the price and was exactly what we needed to get rid of so much paper clutter I would highly recommend this.
4,The scanner works exactly as advertised and gives remarkably good results even on photos. The only issue I had was that my box arrived without the international plug adapters mentioned on the contents card however this was quickly remedied by Doxie.
4,This is a nice portable scanner. The pro is that it allows you to scan files anywhere. The con is that it does have a limited battery life.  Also another interesting thing is that it does not always grab the paper straight. It will sometimes come in sideways. Of course the software that comes with it tries to address this issue but it doesn't completely solve it.
5,Not the most powerful scanner out there but the ease of use and fact that it's battery powered is great.The motorized "wheels" that pull the paper through eventually started to pull at different rates though.  Once that happened the paper would get pulled crooked and it became worthless.Update: Doxie customer care replaced the defective unit w/ a brand new one that works great!  Excellent customer service
5,i am satisfied
5,Love this product. So easy to use and lightweight and portable! Customer service is also amazing!
5,Super fast and easy to use - and I’m not tech savvy at all.
5,Very easy to use and several options to scan... Wifi card or wire
1,I had high hopes for this little thing. Unfortunately I discovered too late just how horrible the scan quality is.Scanner arrived and I put to the side for a bit- past the return period or I would 100% be returning it.The scan quality looks as though it was a photo with more "noise" than if I had taken a picture and printed.When you scan a page in you can see through to the other side.everything scans as .jpeg.  You have to manually go in an change this to .pdf after you scan.COmplete waste of money as I can't use it to scan even decent quality papers
4,This has been a great little scanner and very ez to travel with wifi connect is flaky but works once connected.
5,Excellent scanner. Its amazingly easy to setup/use and powerful device! Fast scanning and simple to transfer file via WiFi or USB. Thank you Doxie for making this happen. Easy to carry. I use at my work and it's super productive. I call it my Magic Doxie. :) very recommended. You won’t regret it.
5,This is a very fast way to scan 1000's of photos and am glad for the 600dpi setting.  Tech Support has been AWESOME and fast to answer all my questions and problems. So far so good!
5,Amazing!! Makes saving old pictures and documents way too easy. Absolutely love it. Everyone can use this it's so simple to operate. Travels great.
5,Very nice portable scanner that is all in one. No computer hookup needed. You will use if you have it. Then download your stuff.
5,This little scanner is a dream come true! You can scan and leave it in the memory of the scanner to work with (download) later if you don't have the time to do it right away. The software is easy to use. And the files are easily accessible. Just perfect.
4,This was an impulse buy and I am very happy with it. It does pull some things in crooked but once you get the hang of it you are fine. I scanned 200 old photos the first 2 days. The cropping mechanism is a bit tedious but it does some auto cropping. Their web site and instructions were clear and simple.
5,All the stars!
5,I love my new Doxie Go! It is enabling me to go paperless which is my goal for this year.  I scan all bills and receipts through the Doxie Go and then when I have time I download the data into my computer and categorize it. I'm looking forward to being able to access my receipts with out searching through a shoe-box of paper. I love that I won't have a file cabinet with twice as much paper in it than I need.  So happy to have received this thoughtful gift!
5,I've now had my Doxie for a while and feel the need to talk about it. This item has kept up it's standard throughout my ownership. I've had zero problems with it at all. I did have questions and customer service was able to answer. I can take a document and turn it into a jpeg for inserting into another document. Love this item and I'm sure glad I bought it.
5,Great scanner for documents and photos!
5,Easy to use and portable
5,Very easy to use to quickly scan documents pictures etc. without the need of a computer.  I like that you don't have to pick the format of the scan before scanning.  Only the 300 versus 600 dpi.  Doxie software is easy to use and straightforward.
5,This scanner is incredibly portable easy to use and it is rechargeable. I highly recommend. I bought this machine for a project I finished a lot faster than I had anticipated. Great buy.
5,The Doxie is a very handy personal scanner. I use it often to scan a couple of sheets I need to send quickly.
5,Bought it for scanning receipt instead of throwing them into an envelope. Very easy to do sorts alphabetically making them easy to find if need. Customer support was very good.
5,The Doxie is a great tool that I use to keep that electronic record of all receipts.  This helps me with submitting expense reports for my job and any household receipts as well.  The scanner is quick and efficient and so portable.
5,Never needed assistance very simple to use.  Took on our travels to visit family and was able to scan their old family photographs
5,This scanner is amazing I use it daily to upload forms to my computer so I won't lose or damage them. The software to edit the scans is also very useful and the quality of the scans is wonderful. I really love this and highly recommend it for anyone who is out and about on business with lots of forms to keep in order!
5,Before Doxie I used to only scan while tethered to my computer. Now I can take the mobile scanner with me anywhere business or logistics require the scanner. It has improved my document workflow and the compact machine is just a joy to use.
5,While looking at the Doxie Go Scanner with WIFI I had a couple of simple questions their website hadn't explained. I saw that they do Customer Support over Twitter so i thought to give it a try and see how fast I would get a response. To my surprise I got my 2 answers in under 10 minutes.Scanning is so simple and easy. I have the WIFI version with Eye-Fi and after a quick setup all of my receipts and pawerwork go right into my Evernote account.Freaking Amazing !!!!
4,So far I like this product. It has be really use to set up and use to scan my documents. The thing I dislike is the time it takes to name and save the scanned documents to my computer. I also have not been able to figure out how to delete the internal hard drive so I can reuse the space.
4,annoying to have to consistently plug in power cord to the device kept falling out  was to loose and only  stay charge for 20min. Then the backside bled through.  (UPDAY) customer service offer to replace the unitapologize for the bad unit.maybe I just got a bad one. ( 5 stars for customer service.)
5,really cool thing! occupies as little space as possible plus is portable. I use it to get rid of paper stuff  that i keep for history or as reference. Just scan send to evernote add tags and you have released space and always know where to find it.I dont't like wires so wifi really helps. You don't need to find suitable cable connect one end connect another - just turn wifi on and you are ready to go.
4,Only scans one side and sometimes will pull a paper through a bit off-kilter but otherwise this is a highly useful tool at a decent price if you are unwilling to spend more money for a more efficient scanner.
5,The portability of this scanner is awesome.  Easy setup and even easier to use.  Great product.
4,Added what appeared to be roller lines down every scan (unless card stock). Editing software doesn't allow simple functions like zoom and crop. Returned and will try something else.Update: Replacement unit does not have roller marks so that was a bad unit. I'm told that the editing software does allow zoom and crop so I will give that a try.
2,This scanner is fast and good at scanning paper documents. I also like the staple feature to link documents.  I just started scanning receipts for tax returns and this is extremely frustrating which is mostly why I am giving it 2 stars -- Had I been in the return window I would send this scanner back.  The Doxie software is ok -- wishing the crop feature was a little more updated.  The picture of the scanned document is very small (even when using the biggest size) but it is simple and easy to navigate.  I also wonder if paying more for the wifi and app feature would have been worth the money.
5,Trivial to use fantastic tech support please please Doxie don't sell your company to a competitor that will surely screw it all up!
2,Had to return this doxie go wi-fi after a day because of the huge scanner grabbing problems leading to really distorted scans.  After about the 50th time not exaggerating I decided it needs to go back.  I don't have time to waste on things like this. The Epson wi-fi portable scanner was great in this respect it's just that its mobile app features were not compatible with Iphones and Ipads so I gave doxie a try hoping it would be the answer to my portable scanner needs.  On to the next because this scanner isn't happenin' for me. Plus it's too expensive for what appears and feels like a rather cheaply made scanner for the price.  Customer service is quite responsive though and that's why I give this 2 stars but that's it.
5,This unit is the best portable scanner I have for my long-term traveling. I hit the road with my crew for 2 months and it's a delight to carry this small lightweight scanner.The company is EXTREMELY responsive - the first scanner was defective. I called the Doxie company and a replacement was sent immediately. Then they followed up to make sure everything went well.Please ignore my previous 1-star review of the case.
5,I liked how small it was and how it does quality quick scanning.
4,i love this little scanner. It's easy to travel with and makes my receipt scanning so much easier. Travel expenses are s real pain but with this I don't let my receipts pile up. I wish it came with some receipt management software. That'd make it perfect.
5,Easy to use I scanned and saved to a memory stick over 9000 pictures without a single problem! This was just what I was looking for. Thanks Doxie Jim G.
5,This helps to get rid of old photos I had. It's nice to be able to scan all my old photos and see them in a digital picture frame. Doxie does a great job and auto corrects if a document is a little off center.
5,Doxie has totally satisfied the need for on-the-go scanning. In an almost two year history of usage of one scanner at home one at the office and one in my bag on the road mountains of paper have been eliminated. One scanner failed. After an email contact with Doxie the scanner was replaced immediately without charge. Doxie is where I go for excellent service.
5,It's a very nice mobile Scanner. It's meant to be portable. It works pretty awesome I haven't try the photo scanning thing yet I will assume it works awesome too~~ the only thing is I can scan stuff directly to the computer when I connect the scanner to the computer...it will always save it into the scanner itself first then you have to import the stuff into the computer...Well but this scanner IS made for Scan-as-you-go so probably I ask a little bit too much...Except thateverything works perfect.
1,I needed this for work and I was thrilled to get it. I used it properly but it had difficulties from the beginning. After the few times it actually easily scanned the items turned out great and the transfer to my Mac was seamless. But just trying to get it to scan was frustrating. The side roller then seemed to act as its own entity with its own personality. The left roller ate the paper at a different speed than the other side leaving a half-scan or a wonky scan. After a few tries we discovered the magic - if we held the device at about a 45 degree angle from the table and did not move the device during scanning and did not touch it elsewhere including the top cover it scanned beautifully. So if you are an acrobat who can juggle that or if you are a magician go for it. We returned it and we’re still deciding what to buy.
2,I've used portable scanners for years and was looking forward to trying this wireless one. But the scanner does not actually communicate with a laptop while scanning. You have to scan everything to an SD card then bluetooth it to your laptop. Very inconvenient if one wants to quickly scan something and move on. If I had wanted all of the extra steps and time wasted I would have used my printer/scanner.
5,This is one product that completely solves a problem I have.  The scanner allows me to scan all of my paperwork that I want to retain but don't want taking space.  Easy to get the scans as PDFs on my computer too.
4,I'm still a long way from completing my efforts to go paperless with my Doxie combined with Evernote premium but I'm off to a good start.  I suggest the combination of the two products along with the wireless card.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I wish the battery lasted longer.
5,This Doxie is exactly as described. It is very easy to use even for a technology novice like myself. Their customer service was excellent very quick to respond very willing to help in any way. I would definitely buy another product from this company.
2,This scanner is pricey and not easy to use. There are no instructions for how to feed the paper  through. It took trial and error to discover you have to press down on the top bar for it to feed.
4,Love this thing. We put a eyeFI SD card in it and scan directly to my dropbox account (via an intermediary always on media center Apple Mini). It's iffy sometimes grabbing the paper on the first shot though - it was this way right form the beginning. One star off for that.
5,Love our Doxie. Scanning is very fast and it transfers to your computer via blue tooth. You can scan several photos and organize them into folders and it's much easier than having to put them under a door on a traditional printer. You can feed these one right after another. Highly recommended.
4,It is good: compact and fast. The only negative is that scans move to the PC only once. They cannot be copied more than that in our experiences. If another option exists we would appreciate knowing how to copy and forward the scans to multiple sites.
3,This is a great thing if you need to do things like scan receipts while you're on the road. Other than that it's not so good. I had to use it to scan a whole bunch of photos a couple of years ago before moving across the country and it took multiple tries to get any of them to actually scan correctly. In a pinch it will do but I would go with a different scanner.
5,I use this scanner to scan pictures. I've scanned over 3500 photos to date without any issues.
4,Image quality is great setup is easy my only real issue is it gets hung up on certain lighter weight paper (carbon paper copies from invoices and thermal paper). I have always gotten everything to feed eventually but sometimes it takes 6 or 7 failed attempts
5,Love it!
5,fast...  quality scanner!
5,I got this for my wife who is not the least bit technically inclined and makes unhappy noises when things don't work and she really likes it!  Pictures magazine articles she cut out even pictures glued to paper and not one problem.  Well done Doxie!
4,Haven’t used the product yet but I’m wondering if I received a returned item or refurbished because the item has small signs of wear.
5,This was one of my best purchases! My bags of photos from the pre-digital era are being catalogued and organized digitally. A highlight was scanning my In-law's wedding album to make prints for their 60th wedding anniversary party. It was quick and everyone loved the framed collage.
4,I'm happy with my purchase but 1 of 10 receipts scanned is blurred/un readable.  Which is kinda bad because the point of scanning it is so that I don't need to hold onto the paper.....Almost necessary to double check the scan prior to tossing the receipt.
5,This works great. Once you get all the pictures scanned there is no use for it. I started using an app on my phone to make sure I never have to have stacks of papers around the house making a mess. This was great for pictures though.
3,Why it is so hard for me to walk across my office to scan things I don't know. I really wanted something I could have right beside me and easily scan docs as needed. The Doxie seemed like a dream come true.The software installed easily and seemed user friendly. Unfortunately the scanner never worked. Even had my tech savvy husband make sure I didn't mess something up but the device never scanned. Followed all the instructions and dealt with their tech support. Had to return it and still haven't decided what to replace it with.
5,Getting rid of heaps of old photos and these allow me to post to a digital frame and also easily text to family and friends.  Works great with ipad and iphone
5,Have scanned thousands of photos great little scanner  only concern is trying to photos from Doxie app to camera tool on the I pad  wirelessly upload from scanner to app on ipad
4,its a good product and it works well but I found it was not for me so i went back to the old fashioned way of keeping my receipts.I was able to return it for a full refund and the company was very gracious about it
5,So easy! Love it!
1,Difficult to use
5,THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EXPERIENCED SO FAR IN MY LIFETIME.I had sent them a video of the faulty machine which i had received from them and being in a different country they had couriered a new machine as a replacement.The New machine works good so far.They constantly email me and keep asking me whether the machine works fine.Thank you Kristy!
5,We travel full-time in a motorhome so there's not way to lug around a large file cabinet to keep all my paperwork. Enter...DOXIE !After much research on many scanners I chose Doxie Go.It is very easy to use. Saves scans to my preferences of  PDF or JPG which I then "file" on my laptop or place in OneNote. I scan business cards letter sized receipts medical records....anything I can find to digitize.Highly recommended
5,This thing is amazing.  It's compact the battery life is great and the software is easy to use.  I use it with both Windows and Mac with great results.  I also like that you can change settings depending on the media being scanned and the storage options are great - internal SD card or USB stick.  It's a versatile machine and works as designed.  Don't forget to get a case with it!
5,This is the best scanner I have ever used. I would and have recommended it to many others. When I first got it I scanned over 300 documents! And I have been using it weekly if not more. It has not failed and besides remembering to charge it. This is a great buy and you will be happy you have it.
5,This was very easy to set up and I've scanned 3000 documents so far.  The battery seems to last a very long time and the pages scan very quickly.  So glad we invested in this.
5,I got this on the recommendation of my sister and I'm so glad I did.  I have pictures that are nearly 100 years old and I needed to scan them safely.  This fit the bill.  I found that if I just scanned them onto an SD card I could upload them easily onto my computer.  I don't need to use their software.  I would recommend this to anyone for any scanning uses for items under 8x10.
5,Simple easy intuitive small....what else can I say about this excellent device.
2,The product arrived to me in good form and nothing was of fault by the delivery. Everything has arrived in whole. After a few days with the product I am disappointed with the item. The most frustrating problem with the Doxie Go is the feeder. It's a constant fight to feed the documents and half the time it gets stuck or don't pull properly no matter how I calibrate it. The software on the item also slows down it's performance that I find myself scanning with the item unattached to the computer first before connecting to retrieve the documents. I feel as if I need to send it back if I cannot get it to perform to at least satisfactory before the next week.
5,Awesome product.  Receipts and single page documents are easily digitized.  I also own a one of those all-in-one printer/scanners.  However I opt to using this little product to scan nearly all receipts and documents.  The convenience is the base aspect.  I can sit on the couch with a stack of receipts and just scan away while watching television or a movie.The interface and data transfer with the computer works well.
5,Fast efficient very portable small enough to keep handy on a small desk.... or anywhere.Software is very user friendly.
2,Scanned several pages with text only. Moved the micro SD to a Win 10 PC. Opened the PDF file and the Doxie software which did nothing with the so-called PDF file. It was nothing more than a JPG file with a different suffix. All Doxie did was produce a copy of the sheet of paper which I could have done with my copier. Waste of time installing this device and software. Will now look for a real working scanner.
5,Super easy to use. Took 5 min to set up and was able to scan pretty much immediately out of the box. Great compact size. High quality images.
5,This portable scanner is easy to set up requires little technical proficiency and produces wonderful results.  It scans variable paper weights and sizes without feeding problems.  Sometimes it takes a little effort to line up your scanned document straight but once you get the hang of it the process is a breeze.  It's like having a hand held copier at a bargain price.
4,I was skeptical about this but it works just fine. It can be difficult to get the sheet to feed into this but it is a thousand times more convenient than one of those big scanner/printer machines. It goes wherever my laptop goes.
5,Scanning with the Doxie is a breeze!  I love that it's compact and doesn't crowd my desk space.  The software is super simple and it's made my home and work life much simpler.
5,I love Doxie.  It is helpful and easy to use.  This scanner is nice for people who need to scan things when not sitting at their computer.  It stores the document until you can plug it into your computer and upload.  What would make this better would be if it could be scanned and stored in "the cloud" via wireless or sent via bluetooth to a device so that you didn't need to plug it in.
5,Small easy simple to use backs up to the cloud bring it with and I can be on about my business. No longer do I need to spend time trying to line things up or trying to use my phone camera or any of that. Scanr import backup on with my life. It's so good I scan everything now bills receipts random business cards everything.
5,I love the Doxi I was able to get rid of so many boxes of pictures and was able to save all the memories with ease. Would highly recommend everyone doing this with a Doxi..
5,This scanner makes my office life so much easier. The software is great too. Makes documenting things quicker.Would recommend!
5,I bought the scanner to reduce the paper everywhere.  Very happy with the purchase.  It's portable and easy to use.  Five stars!
4,Edited: Turns out the issue was McAfee anti-virus wasn't allowing connections even though the ports were set up correctly...
5,Easy to use & super portable
5,So easy to use.  High quality scanning tiny physical package easy to use software (download to PC for importing) and some acceptable OCR for documents (not for handwriting but for typed notes).  Would buy again.Note: when you put an SD card in the slot in the back it doesn't sit flush and I worry about it snagging on stuff and breaking as I travel.  (I tape the SD card to the case when not in use.)
1,I hate this thing. It doesn't register when there's something to scan. Things get stuck. Don't bother with it.
5,This is exactly what I needed. I have a huge box of old family photos that I wanted to scan on to my computer but I didn't want to spend hours sitting in front of my desktop/scanner. I can put this on my lap and scan away while watching TV. And it does a great job!
4,I used the Neat desk for a day and returned it due to its poor quality. Then I purchased the Doxie Go and was surprised by the quality of the product and it ease of use. If Apple made a portable scanner this would be it.
5,Copy photo prints to digital photos to upload to my computer
4,Perfect for my use either in the office or when traveling. Easy to use with great softweare.
5,I haven't had a scanner years. But this thing is great. We recently purchased a home and had a lot of documents to sign scan and send back electronically this made it very convenient. It's ultra portable too which has been great. And I've used it to go completely paperless. It's worth the cost.
5,This scanner is easy to use. I'm scanning hundreds of old photographs and the quality is outstanding. The scanner is easy to use. The software easily uploads to your computer.
5,This is a great way to scan documents and pictures
5,I love this! It makes scanning so much easier and scanning makes it so much easier to let go of papers. It works really well it's so easy and intuitive get one!
5,Just great. My husband calls it a wizard. Great quality scans and copies. It scans docs which can then immediately be put in an email and sent rather than be faxed. Haven't had it long so cannot speak to how long the ink will last but with it ease a quality of use and the fact that we have a regular printer  I'm not sure it will matter much.
1,My first impression of the product was that when I plugged it into my Windows 7 OS computer it was treated like a bad USB stick. Made a funny connect-disconnect sound on the computer and the "My Computer" tab wouldn't see it as a connected device. Have spent the past hour trying to find out what is wrong. Tried to download Doxie's software for Windows but it routinely fails. Have tried all USB drives on computer none of them work with it.Next tried contacting their customer service but they won't give out their phone number. "Instant Messaging" only but received a "We're away from our desks" message at 9 am on Wednesday morning in California.Great first impression!! My thought is that if you're a millenial hipster using a Mac this product was designed for you. If you're a Windows 7 user YOU DON'T MATTER ANYMORE
5,It advertised itself as a document scanner but I really just use it for photos. You can fit a TON on a relatively small SD card. Not helping my habit of taking too many pictures though (but that’s another issue)!
5,Great portable scanner. Easy to use.
5,Scans photos as described. Old photos not as clear as newer color photos. Photos on card unable to scan.
5,Fast and easy to scan and download. Had a battery problem in the beginning and Doxie replaced the unit.
1,Just wanted something simple that would scan to my PC when I'm home and could scan with or without a laptop when I'm on the road. I have a new PC with fresh Windows 10 install. No other devices experience any trouble being recognized by Windows but the Doxie refuses to communicate. Windows can see the SD card on it but never sees it as a scanner so it is basically useless for scanning to the PC. Tether mode doesn't work and all unconnected scans are saved a jpgs when I need pdf and there is no method to change this (at least so long as the driver won't shake hands with Windows so it can be recognized). I've been waiting for several hours now for a response from support and nada. So adios I'll be returning.
5,Great product great software.  Bought this to replace my Neat scanner after they switched to a cloud model to get software updates and couldn't be happy.  Even better - the support is fantastic!
1,This device does not support connecting to my home network (WiFi). Let me explain.My intention was to use this as a receipt scanner which could automatically store receipts on my Google Drive. In order to setup Doxie and connect to a home WiFi Doxie must scan for WiFi networks on either an Apple iPhone/iPad/Mac or a Windows PC that supports WiFi.  I am an Android fan and my Windows desktop PC uses Ethernet only (the superior networking technology). This means that Doxie requires me to purchase additional hardware simply because Doxie has chosen to ignore Android users. What I really don't understand why there is no option to configure Doxie's WiFi even when Doxie is connected to Windows with USB.The design decision to ignore anyone who doesn't use Apple has left me baffled and distraught.
5,This is the perfect document scanner for me.  It doesn't take up any room recharges quickly and is easy to use.  We also have a flat bed scanner for high-quality photo/negative scanning which I'd recommend for the serious stuff but if you just want to send somebody a quick image of a snapshot this is fine for that as well.  Really helps to keep the paper at bay.
4,works great but occasionally I have to redo the scanning because it doesn't feed straight.
5,Love my Doxie. I've scanned hundreds of documents so far and it's super easy to use. The files are clean and organized once uploaded too. My favorite feature is the "staple" feature - it allows you to group multiple files into one PDF (for example a bunch of receipts when I'm tracking expenses).  Worth every penny and fits right in my desk drawer!
2,**UPDATE: I am updating this review to document that on the same day of posting my negative review about my dissatisfaction with the photo scanning quality/capabilities Doxie customer service promptly contacted me to try to help with the issues and make the situation right.  Their customer service is fantastic and they do try to help with any issues and ensure customer satisfaction.  I improved my rating to  2 stars simply due to the great and prompt customer service.**Very disappointed in the quality of scanned photographs.  Wish I had opened and tried the scanner sooner so that I could return it.  Purchased for easy photo scanner but not a good product for that.
5,Great tool.  Not the best if you want to scan large 20+ page documents due to it's manual feeding but this was never the intention  :-) this is fantastic to couple with evernote for a paperless home.  Once you buy this you're going to also want a shredder and probably also an eye-fi pro x2 to make the scanner wireless.Check out http://lifehacker.com/5973033/how-i-turned-three-years-of-paper-into-a-highly-organized-searchable-document-database-in-two-days for the paperless model i emulated.
5,Easy to set up and use.  Scans pictures pretty fast.  .  Making quick work of scanning 100's of pictures .  Am pleased with the results.
5,Super simple set up and great customer service. Awesome purchase!!
5,Wow a portable solution to my scanning needs.A feeder would be better but the program that allows me to "staple" things together is wonderful.I've been scanning things in for three weeks.  I still have a lot to sort through once it gets on the computer.
5,Great scanner but my it seams that is not working correctly can someone tell how can get another one?UpdatedGreat costumer service they provided me with a new scanner and it’s working...
5,We tried two other portable scanners. This is the one to buy. Great quality  easy to use. It works. Customer service on the application along with it is second to none. It is the one to buy for sure. Your going to love it.
5,This thing is small enough to carry in a briefcase and with its internal memory there's no reason not to scan a document when the need arises.  The software does an excellent job of optical character recognition so I can just scan documents instead of saving a hard copy.  If I need it in the future I can just search on my computer rather than trying to dig through a pile of old papers.
5,Worth the purchase. Does exactly what it needs to do scans and even scans as it charges. No need for software. Take your time and line it up neatly it's not the fastest device. The purchase of the scanner provides everything you need even for adapters out of the U.S.
5,very pleased with the quality of scans and portability.
4,The Doxie Go does everything it's supposed to--good quality scans OCR works great it's small and portable etc.The only complaint I might have is that the software can be a little laggy. Including the importation of scans--can take a very long time. Even though the scanning itself is fast as advertised.
5,perfect size the software is easy to use.
5,This is a game-changer. I scan receipts I organize them it has an amazing "staple" function that digitally staples batches together... it is wireless. it creates nifty PDF's of batches... it's bliss. The best part - I am on my way to being paperless. And the wireless works like a charm. The Doxie Go WiFi is worth every penny.
5,Just what I needed.
5,Great things beautiful things are simple things. The Doxie Go is a beautiful thing.This cute little scanner has finally allowed me to throw away my filing cabinet my hanging folders my organizer tabs and my label maker. Now I can scan items into my Doxie Go wherever I am create beautiful OCR'ed scans and then upload them to the cloud so I can access them anytime anywhere.It doesn't get much better than that.
5,I can't get the iOS software to work right. But otherwise this thing is amazing.
5,Love the product customer service was wonderful for a small problem I had using it.  Highly recommend this company
5,I look forward to getting junk that I need to store just so I can use this. I got the Eye-Fi with it which I'm very glad I did because you don't need any cables or bluetooth connections or anything that way.Only negative would be that the battery seems to die fairly quickly and recharging takes a while.----------------------------------------Changed review from 4 to 5 star after great customer service interaction
5,I like the portability of this scanner and it does everything I need.
5,I love it lightweight small and efficient. Works as it should but was missing the usb cord( it had been replaced with a standard power cord). I bought it open box but still expected the right accessories. I guess I'll shell out for a new one so I don't get shorted.
4,Small footprint easy to interface with Mac Book Pro.
4,Not ideal for scanning tons of photographs but it definitely gets the job done. I'm very happy with the quality of the document scans.
5,Love this so far. Scans quickly upload a bit slow but that could be my computer. User interface not as flexible as I had hoped but workable
5,Excellent portable scanner.Use it for archiving tons of old photo albums whenever I head back home. Feeder setup allows me to multitask watching TV and scanning photos. Some rotation mistakes may occur in my multitasking mode but still time efficient overall. Covered hundreds of photos in the span of an hour.
5,I really love this little portable scanner. Took it to my parents house and spent a day scanning old photos so the family could have printable digital copies. Also carry it to contract meetings so I can make digital copies of signed documents. It is a multi use tool for both home and business. A great investment.
4,Really a four and a half but it takes a little getting use to feeding the paper for a straight scan.  I really think this portable scanner is perfect for any real estate agent or salesman as you can scan on the go!!  LOVE IT!
5,This scanner is extremely easy to use. Great for sharing photos or documents (although they must be single sheets in order for them to go through the scanner). I have been using it to archive family history by visiting each of my relatives and scanning their photos and family letters.
5,I needed a portable scanner to use on road and this one is indispensable. Small light and fast. I can connect to my iPhone or iPad and send drawings or contracts in seconds. Easy to setup and eyefi app is simple to use. One of those rare flawless products that works right out of the box. I rarely use my scanner on my desktop anymore as this is faster and easier.
3,Generally nice not expensive useful scanner.But extremely slow when transferring scans to PC.
5,Just as described. It works really well on the go and its memory is nice to have. There is a slower connectiong with any computer by cord but other than that it's great!
3,Scanning is simple and quick however it would be nice to be able to use a wireless keyboard to tag as you scan.  Also I deep losing the connection as I download.  As long as the connection is up the download is pretty fast.  I did send a note to Doxie re:  connection issue and they responded right away.  I haven't tried the recommendation yet.
5,I love the scanner.  Worth the money.  I looked for a long time.  Bought and return a few different scanners.  I am happy with the purchase.
4,This is a lifesaver to have at home and keeps me from needing to have a big flatbed scanner. It can be a little tricky to feed the paper sometimes but you get the hang of it. A really nice product!
4,Easy and quick setup.  Scanning is quick.  Software is simple to use. Scan quality is decent for my purposes at the default resolution.  Sometimes pages jam when feeding them into the scanner but I suspect that's the case with most scanners.
3,I like that the Doxie is small and compact and allows me to get rid of a much larger scanner.  However the software that comes with it is just okay.  I actually need to do quite a bit of work to get clear PDFs that I can then reduce in size with Adobe Acrobat.  Also the functionality where scans go straight to Google Drive or some other cloud-based service is only possible with an EyeFi SD card.
4,Had to upgrade when my brothers ds700 would no longer work with Windows 10. Love the mobility battery-life quality and evernote compatability but I'd sure love for it to scan in double-sided documents.
5,Hardware and software (using the Mac version) both function very well!Paper gets jammed or misaligned sometimes when going through. Other than that no complaints.I like that I can insert an USB stick as memory and scan all my documents at once. When I have the time to process them I simply stick the USB in my computer and upload everything to Dropbox via the included software.
5,Love this scanner. It's so much better than previous Doxie Go version. Paper doesn't get hung up in the track like the old one.
3,Design wise the product is great.Battery wise it needs to hold longer.Scanning quality is good except that the scanned items appear occasionally a bit rotated although I align to the left side as indicated in the manual. Why don't you put an alignment plastic moving piece to the left just like the right side? This will make it scan perfectly with 0 rotation. I would give it five start if it were not for this point.
5,Love it. It is so easy to use and the portability is amazing. I love being able to scan anything I need at any time
5,I don’t normally write reviews but this product worked perfectly for the huge photo project I was doing. It cut the time in half.
3,Good for scanning on item at a time and it's somewhat sluggish. Don't expect it to be fast. And sometimes I have to pull the paper in and out for it to even sense the paper is there
4,Excellent. Better than the HP four-in-one printer I have and very simple to use. I see myself packing this on on out of town trips
5,I LOVE my Doxie.  It is worth every penny that you pay.  It is portable rechargable and you don't need to have it attached to the computer at the time you use it.  I keep mine in the kitchen and scan all the papers that come in.  Then once a week I take it to the computer and dump and file.  It really is great!
5,The convenience is wonderful -- good design for the casual scan user. Easy diwnload & save options.Sometimes it is a bit tricky to start the feed but you eventually get a feel for what angle works best.
5,Loved this scanner!  My mother in law let me borrow 10 huge photo albums so I could copy all the photos before or family vacation in September.  Thought it would take a month to do - it only took the length of 4 movies to get it all done with doxie.  Can't recommend this highly enough.
5,I travel from Florida to Colombia often. Mt scanner is always packed for the trip. I save paper and carrying paper I save trying to find a copy machine the portability is wonderful the quality of the image is always great and it is easy to use I would always recommend the Doxie Scanner
5,This is a very slim and portable scanner with outstanding scanning quality.I live in a small one bedroom apartment and cant have a lot of stuff around the apartment.This scanner is easy to hie and easy to use with the built in battery and memory.Easy as one-two-three.Start it scan it and plug it in to the computer.I highly recommend this portable scanner.
4,I am very happy with the device so far it performs just as advertised and I love that it's rechargeable soI can take it anywhere to scan my documents.  It's much cheaper than other brands and was ranked higher in performance.
3,Had a problem and returned product
5,Best investment I ever made. My first Doxie Go lasted about two years - but I scanned 49000 pages with it. This newer version is even easier faster and more user friendly!
5,Made it possible to go paperless in one afternoon.Strong software to go with fantastic hardware.Feels well made very attractive and well put together unit.Customer service reaches out to you once you have received the unit to make sure you have a place to turn if you have problems.Doesn't get any better than that.
5,I use the scanner for work and it is really nice that you don't have to be connected to a PC to scan documents
5,Easy to use instructions!
5,This is a great device and much much faster than using a flatbed scanner.  I am able to scan multiple photos in a short amount of time.  Feed works well resolution very good and software works flawlessly.  Extremely pleased with Doxie Go Plus.
5,Portable scanner with very nice features I highly recommend it
4,It took a while to get used to it. It sometimes grabs the paper one side and doesn't go through and you have to redo it. Overall I'm happy with it
5,I am using this with my MacBook and it is so easy to use and allows me to save my files how I want.
4,Great portable scanner. I still like my Fujitsu Scan Snap iX500 at home.
5,This is not the best quality scanner that I have used. If you need to make not important copied of document this is fine. I like the you can carry it with you and scanner without a computer and save as PDF or other format file once you connect to a computer. You can crop and staple scans together.
5,Love love love this little guy!  Small footprint easy to move room to room and I can scan stuff as it comes in avoiding backlogs.
5,We scan everything in our office - receipts checks work orders pages torn out of notebooks - and Doxie can scan it all!
5,This is really great as a backup or home/travel. Does only single page at a time. Not sure if it works for scanning card🤔
5,Just what I was looking for!  This scanner is quick and easy to use and the quality of the scans is excellent.  The portability makes it so easy to go paperless.  Rarely use my slow flatbed scanner since purchasing my Doxie several months ago.
5,I found the Doxie Go to be everything advertised. I had boxes of old photos that were beginning to fade and I simply feed them into the scanner one after the other when I am watching TV. Then I upload them to computer where I can edit them. Very simple procedure and much faster than a flatbed scanner.
5,the device works great!  Files that i've maintained since 2000 have been archieved electronically and physical copies shredded.  I haved saved e-copies in two locations so i feel certain i'll have the ability to access them.  I no longer have to box and drag large files from location to location (move after move).
5,Having a scan of this portable with its own internal storage and then topping it off with Wi-Fi connectivity is a godsend.
5,Great product. Scan quality is clear and consisent. Feed is smooth has never jammed. Software is user friendly yet powerful. Recommend to anyone esp to travelers with limited space.
4,Given as gift
5,Excellent device! I scanned 100s of photos in a short amount of time! Easy to use!
5,I love the Doxie!  It is helping me clear out hundreds of photos and put them on my computer.  Wish I would have had it years ago!
5,Does an outstanding job.  Best scanner I have ever used.
5,Great product.  Scanning in hundreds of pictures. I am amazed at the quality and features of this small compact machine. I did get the WIFI.
5,This is super easy to use fast and portable. Scanned ALL my photos with this.  Very little straightening to do but if adjustments are necessary they are fast and easy. I love the wireless feature!
5,Doxie exceeded my expectations! Occasionally I do have a little trouble with feeding documents. But the excellent features of Doxie far outweigh any occasional difficulty. Please get the wireless version. It's more than worth the addiitonal cost. I absolutely luuuuuurve it!
5,Had an issue but Doxie contacted me and went above and beyond to remedy the situation.
4,Works very well simplifies copying..  Only issue is short battery life.  I am scanning pictures and the limit is about 125 to 150 pictures before it needs another charge.  Will not work when it's charging.  Otherwise love it.
5,I've scanned a couple hundred pages/receipts/stuff with this scanner and so far it works great. Image quality is fantastic considering the small footprint and portable form factor. It's all plastic which you should expect from a unit like this but I don't believe it wil survive the rigors of travel very well. Keep it safe and it should work great for a long time.
5,I use the Doxie Go with my iMac and though it's portable it just stays on my desk because it takes up very little room. Mainly I use it for scanning checks to deposit though I have scanned the occasional full-size document. I have a flat-bed scanner that goes unused now because the Doxie Go with its software is easier to use.
2,I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this scanner.  I finally pulled it out of the box and used it today.  I like how it feeds the photos but they don't come out the clearest even on the "better" setting.  Sometimes it adds extra space so you have to go in and crop the photos which adds time.  For this price I expected a better quality.  Very disappointed.
5,I have been telling everyone how terrific this scanner is and how quickly i can scan any pics and documents !
5,This is the best. It can travel doesn't require charging every scan and produces good quality scans. The only downsides if you're considering your options is that you must load each page individually and you need to buy an SD card if you are scanning a huge document.
5,Love our Doxie! We have scanned all pictures and  documents and stored them on our USB drive. Helped so much in making less clutter in our house.
5,Everyone should have this.  I bought one for my daughter and she loves it too!  Great for on the road needs.  When dealing with a relatives home in another state.  It is handy to be able to scan anywhere.
5,The Doxie go is exactly what I wanted. I can scan anywhereit is small enough to put in my purse or computer case.. I recommend it to anyone needing a small portable scanner.. I also bought the case for it..There isn't an App for he iPad but if you scan to a SD card I believe you could transfer it to your iPad.
5,With this I can scan anywhere I choose.  Then all I have to do when I get home is plug it in the charger turn it on let the Eye-Fi SD card I have in there to do its wi-fi magic and presto... on my computer everytime.
5,Theres nothing... NOTHING I don't like about this scanner.  Its compact its smart its simple.... I just keep finding more and more ways to use it.  DEFINITELY get the Doxie GO WiFI
3,Generally works pretty well with good integration between software and hardware.I was only disappointed that the auto feeder worked just acceptably (ie. some missed aligned feeds) at the start now is no longer sensitive and takes very long to detect sheets I am trying to feed in. When it catches the paper it is usually misaligned.This is with very low usage.
5,Easy to use right out of the box. I also received an email right after my order offering any assistance with set-up and use. That’s excellent customer service right there!
5,LOVE this scanner!  So quick. So easy. I am not very tech savvy but this thing is super simple to operate. I am scanning and saving everything. The IRS will take scanned copies of receipts so you can clean out all those file folders of paperwork!
1,Bought this item 6 months ago. It worked well and I was very happy with the purchase. Now it stopped working overall. Seems like the battery died. I guess it is not a long lasting scanner.
5,Great product
5,I have wanted this capability for years. A full-size scanner smaller than a stapler (well a little longer) about the weight of a six bagels. That is cordless.I keep it in the kitchen to scan mail and recycle everything as junk mail now. I have not tried the photo or OCR capability yet - but wow.
5,Love the unit and the best tech support
5,This is  a great little scanner.  It handles volume well and I had zero problems with delivery setup and use other than with the Eye-Fi.  That's a topic for a review of the Eye-Fi.  I no longer use it and find the Doxie Go's own memory and upload over wire process to be sufficient to my needs.
1,We used the scanner once then stored it. Just tried to use it again and it won't turn on.
5,Es rápido  es fácil de usar  tiene buena calidad de imágenes  software simple pero eficiente.
3,Was a great little scanner I bought this in high hopes of scanning a bunch of old B/W Pictures it didn't work out it couldn't Scan the the thick paper of yesteryear... Works great on new thin paper pictures
5,Simple. Not over-featured. Does exactly what I want it to do. Got the recommendation from The Minimalists and it has helped me along that journey.
4,A great scanner to take along to meetings to quickly store copies of important documents and contracts when on the road.
5,This thing combined with an EyeFi is how we are storing 10 years worth of accumulated paper pictures cards closing documents tax forms and other miscellany. It's working a treat and it hasn't needed a cleaning yet.This thing freaking rocks as a scanner. If you're looking at this page dont wait buy one now. :D
4,This is a very easy scanner to use. Just turn it on and you are ready to go. No need to connect to a computer! Very portable carry it to where you need it.
5,Easy to use and portable love it
3,Was not as advertised with there cloud and recorded saving my files.
5,The longer I have this the more I use it.  It works really really well and takes quality scans of important documents.  Sometimes the alignment can be a bit tricky to get right when feeding in paper.I wish it came with a larger document sleeve for feeding in troublesome 8x11 documents.
5,Easy to use. Great scan quality. Fits in my backpack.
5,Great scanner. Does what is advertised and quick. So far so good!
5,Well it's a good scanner to take with you everywhere with eye fi sd card this is somtingI use for work saving my important document in my iphone with eye fi sd card make it possible it great productI recomendet  for you important doc . The chargable battery is fair enough to do the job
5,The Doxie G0 Wi-Fi helped us scan all of our papers and go paperless. We sorted through 3 filing cabinets and it took about a week to do.  Not a fun process but now as paper comes into the house we scan it and then shred it.
5,The Doxie has really changed our household. No more paper bills and other information everywhere. Everything that comes in is scanned and discarded. We also purchased the Eye-Fi card to go with it which makes it even easier (although it drastically shortens battery life) so it automatically uploads and I just send everything to Evernote!Great product highly recommended!
3,Tried it. Was not satisfied with the software or its connectivity to the iMac. Plus the scans were not well aligned. Returned it (thank you Amazon). Purchased the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i to replace it. There's no comparison! If you're looking for a scanner in this category check out the ScanSnap - it's well worth the few extra dollars.
5,I can sit around on the couch watching TV and feed stuff into this thing all by itself then later just hook it up to my mac and move the scans there. So easy. Or I can use the SD slot while in couch potato mode and just pop that SD card in the mac. Did I mention it was easy?
1,Nice concept but quality control is terrible. Purchased a unit about 4 months ago. The first unit had a bad power supply which they shipped to me. after 4 months then unit stopped connecting with USB cable so I was not able to retrieve any of my scans. They sent me a replacement last week. It worked for a couple of scans and now when you try to scan the paper will not feed into the unit. The green status light flashes which is supposed to mean the unit is busy.For the amount of money they are charging it is definitely not worth the hassle.I would recommend the scan snap portable unit. It worked flawlessly for years until someone knocked it off the desk and broke the paper feeder.
4,Light and portable; perfect for our law office use on scanning small items.
4,Love it but I'd say get the WiFi enabled model. Converting files is kind of a pain.
5,I was debating between this scanner and other (epson brother etc.) I definitely made the right choice. The WIFI is a plus. I am able to upload to any computer in my house anywhere in my house.
4,Overall a good portable scanner. I have had to rescan a few docs due to bent corners or tears on the doc. It definitely requires two hands if you want good scans.
5,This is the easiest portable scanner I have had.  I love it.  The wireless makes it so easy.  I can use it anywhere
4,Quick scanner easy to use.Have uploaded but haven't yet used the OCR feature to search the scans
4,Setup was a little problematic. Directions are far too vague. Scanning seems acceptable. So far so good.
5,great product
5,This replaces our fax machine. use this on a weekly basis to scan receipts and documents. Love it!  Wifi All Day!  You can set it to work with your existing wifi using the app!
5,This little piece of art works like a charm.Easy to configurate designed to work without a computer pairs with the powerful and simple software that puts together the scanned documents and photos to create pdf files export to evernote dropbox and so on.Very very satisfied with the purchase.Highly recommended !
5,This is a great scanner however I returned it in exchange for the Doxie Q since the Doxie Q more suited my needs
5,I bought this to scan in my recipe clippings and it has worked beautifully! Scans are clear and easy to read and the editing software allows for trimming the images and dropping into files. The USB port is a big plus as you can scan and take your image with. Great value for a very good product!
5,Very easy to travel with and super easy to use.
5,Love the portability (handheld) rapid scan ease of transferring scanned item to computer small size.
5,Fast and easy to use.  Use WIFi or micro card to transfer scanned items.  Priced right!!  Would definitely recommend.
5,Easy setup works fine.  I lack space for equipment thus the compact size works well for me.
4,needs better instructions
5,Works very nice and software is easy to use. Note the length of the item being copied. (receipts from the stores now a days require me to make two scan to get the whole doc.
5,This was the best buy I could have possible make! This is nice works great and easy as hell to work and transfer docs from. I would give 10 stars if I could.
4,Very slick and easy to use.  Scans quickly and produces nice quality scans.  A little pricey for simply a scanner.  Worth it though if used frequently and in high volume.
3,It was a bit tedious to be scanning one page at a time. Software was also not easy to work with.
1,No support!
5,Very easy to conect to my laptod and scan to a memory chip
5,It’s very convenient and efficient it makes my life easier strongly recommend it great product
5,Fantastic customer support! After two years of heavy use the motor stopped working. Doxie customer support came to the rescue and promptly sent a new one. Simple as that!
5,Our Doxie Go takes great scans it's simple and portable and the support team is great. All around great buy.
5,They contacted me from day one and helped me get adjusted to the scanner!
5,I love using this my DOXIE SCANNER.  It works great and has been a welcome tool.
4,Have not had any issues with this device so far. Scans in pretty much anything I throw at it.It's nice that its portable and doesn't take up much room.
4,Love the product Do wish that you could pick the pages that you wanted to staple and not pick others would make the process so much faster.
5,Love The Doxie! I have been scanning using a flat bed scanner for years. I started to use Evernote and found that Doxie will export directly into Evernote. Very Cool. Would highly suggest this for anyone looking to go paperless.
4,It is very nice. The only thing is that sometimes the paper feeder does not work that well and I need to do it twice or three times.
5,I use this for my kids projects and photos. Absolutely love it.
5,This scanner is great! It's small lightweight and dependable. Connects to wifi and delivers clear high quality images.
5,Does exactly what it says it does. I managed to digitize several boxes of records before shredding and Doxie's software made it easy to scan organize and export to Evernote for backup. I absolutely love this product.
5,I use this for scanning old family photos and creating digital libraries. It is a convenient tool. Sit at a table organize the photos and feed 'em through the doxie one at a time and then upload the photos to the computer and sort them at your leisure.
5,Easy to use.  Great for digitising old photos or scanning pretty much anything.  No complaints.
5,Great device.  Very intuitive.  Easy set up.
1,I used this once. Now I can't get it to work at all. I charged it tried to recalibrate it. It doesn't matter. It no longer works. This is very upsetting as I was getting ready to scan photos of my mother after she passed away.
5,Now I can just pick up my terabyte when Hurricane comes instead of 11 photo boxes amazing.
5,This is a nice little scanner with outstanding customer support. Can’t say enough. Would recommend.
5,Love the convenience of being able to have it portable. I can watch TV and scan at the same time.
5,Easy to use easy to set up! Very happy with it! I don't understand the tethering but that's just because I'm being silly.
5,Love this little scannerGreat quality scansSmall and lightLinked to Mac book pro without hassleFeeder works really wellWould highly recommend if u r a road warrior with lots of receiptsBeats my iPhone camera
5,This is a great little scanner.  The batteries last a decent amount of time the scanned product is clear at 600 dpi and it's nice and small.
4,Nice.  Does not scan directly into the computer but for the money and for it's compact size it's a really nice scanner.
5,I've been using this scanner as a way to reduce the paper clutter I receive each day. Considering the cost especially I am highly satisfied with this product and the support I've received.
5,Haven't had any issues the the quality is good for me.
5,This is an outstanding scanner and even easier to use than I thought it would be. It's truly wireless being able to download the documents from the scanner using your local WiFi. It's also a very portable device.
4,Had for 6 months now easy to use nice time saver to organize receipts!!!
5,Does what it says. Nicely convenient when traveling or when I just want a quick scan. I have a heavy duty scanner in my office and this is a nice additional product.
5,Love this scanner. It can be a little touchy when downloading images onto computer. But it is fast and portable.
5,This is a great product.  We have tossed so much paperwork already.  Helps to get rid of the clutter.  Great customer service also.  We had an issue with the battery charger and they quickly made it more than right.  Highly recommend.
5,Great product.  Easy to set up and use.  Good quality images.
5,I wanted to have something easy to install and without the need for a PC set up. It is also portable and it does a very good job for regular documents and receipts. Have not tried it yet for pictures. I also bought the A4 case and I would recommend it for protection.
5,I've been using Doxie Go for about 3 weeks.  Scanning is quick and accurate.  The software feature to convert images to text works well and is surprisingly fast.  The battery life is great.  The only thing I could wish for is a feature to use scanned text to auto-name receipts.
1,Had high hopes for the Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi. The built in Wifi was fooky. Couldn't get it to stay connected to my Mac. Couldn't get it to connect to my house Wi-Fi. I spent an entire afternoon bashing my head against the wall. Finally had enough and ran off the the UPS Store to send it back to the devils who invented this garbage. The instructions (you have to get them from the web) weren't very logical or linear. You're experience may turn out better but the two happiest moments were when it arrived in the mail and when it went back in the mail.
4,Good scanner.  Having some issues with the scans being straight.  But hopefully with more practice that will get better.
5,Purchased these for users in the field. Easy to transport. Easy to use. Accommodates many paper sizes.
2,I am a lawyer and need to scan many documents all the time. Then based on a review of the site lawyerist.com I decided to purchase a Doxie portable scanner. I live in Brazil and bought the scanner through a friend who was in the United States. I was very pleased with its features and battery life however after a year of use the battery inflated. Now  the battery does not last long enough and dies only after 10 scans.
5,Love this scanner for the office or travel. Works great and compact enough to take on the road!
5,Really easy to use I am able to scan all my college papers while watching a tv-show or listening to music.
5,This thing is awesome!  The software is great it isn't clumsy or slow like every other scanner I have ever used.  I can scan documents extremely fast...  If you have any questions about your product email them and they get back to you quickly.
5,Great device and perfect for my office in scanning documents and important letters.
5,I use this for my business and it is AMAZING! SO easy to use and has allowed me to go paperless. This product has not only streamlined by business but my LIFE.
4,Portable and works pretty well. Maybe my only complaint is that the included software is kinda meh. But the scanner itself works great.
4,Works well scans easily. I am using it to scan pictures and other than having some of them scan crooked it works very well.
5,Another great portable office product!  I wouldn't use it for 50+ pages but if you have to scan a few pages this is a very handy product that is also portable.  Scans are good enough for text and OCR.
5,My big scanner is upstairs so I needed something downstairs but had no big expectations for this little guy. Low and behold it works perfectly. Fast easy makes great scans. I'd love to have one in every room. Oh yes – great customer service
5,I bought the DoxieGo scanner at the recommendation of Mariah's Downsizing Class as a way to help eliminate excess paperwork in my house. I've been delighted with the ease with which I can scan multiple pages "staple" them together and save them to a variety of formats.
5,Best portable scanner. Was able to turn it on and immediately start scanning without having to install a driver.
5,It works great. Scans show really clean. The files are cropped once scanned. Works fast. It does what it is supposed to do and does a great job at it
5,Some difficulties loading software. Windows 10 and having an incredibly SLOW internet service sure didn't help. Proud t itself is easy to use.
1,I have a Canon P-215 that works great but it needs to be hooked up to computer to operate it.  I was interested in Doxie because it can operate as a stand alone scanner.  I did not expect the caliber of the Canon (no feeder no double sided pages) but I did expect that document would feed straight.  Furthermore I found the scanned documents difficult to manage.  And last they were scanned into iPhoto. Perhaps if I had spent more time with the software other options might have been available.  But when 50% of the pages (10) resulted in crooked documents incomplete documents I was not willing to spend time checking out software.  Do not recommend.  Spend more get the Canon P-215.  Easy to use easy to manage documents has automatic feature that straightens documents etc.
5,I have sat for hours going through my papers at work and at home.  Have scanned over 3000 papers.  I bought a wireless card but not needed.  I am loving this.  My wood lateral file cabinet will now be for my bulky winter sweaters..........
5,Very good product. Portable and easy to use
5,Small and easy to take anywhere.  And what I love most is the simplicity of operation.
5,Love the fact that it's super easy to use ... In fact I used it while comfortably sitting on my living room couch!  So great to finally see older printed pictures now in digital format on my laptop :). I would buy it all over again ...
5,It is compact and easy to use
4,Good scanner.  Huge improvement over my old flatbed.  EyeFi card seems to overheat sometimes when plugged in and charging though.
1,I could never get this to connect.
4,Nice scanner easy to setup but takes a ling time to charge ge first time which has been mentioned in other previous reviewers.
2,i like the concept. The execution of the product is very nice the design software and everything are really lovely. But the mechanics the rollor and scan head are just poor quality. the unit is horrible at scanning receipts and when scanned look horrible and not clean so it introduces lots of chromatic abriations and resolution issue that OCR is much harder to do and far less accurate then with other scanners. im going back to my Snapscan the quality doesn't even compare. worth the extra costs.
5,I really like my Doxie.  It is very convenient easy to use and so far absolutely no problems of any sort.  I am a heavy Evernotes user and can't imagine Not having this gadget close at hand.  Have recommended it to all of my associates.
1,It worked fine for the first 12 months but now it doesn't turn on.  I charged it -- it just doesn't turn on any more.  What a waste of $180!
4,Easy to scan anywhere  easy to create different files but I am having a problem with consolidating the files that I want.
1,I just bought this scanner followed the start guide and at the second scan it froze mid-scan. Trying to get in touch with customer support was a joke. This scanner is definitely not worth the money. I will be returning it.
5,I picked this brand because you can use cards & flash drives with it also.  I have only used it for photo's so far but will be doing newspaper clippings later.This brand was recommended to me and I'd tell anyone that asks to buy it.
5,Perfect reproductions of old photos. All different sizes. Couldn’t ask for more.
5,Simply excellent
5,I'm on the road quite a bit and I used to carry a neat receipt portable but I had to use it with my computer this stores up my scans until I get back to the hotel or home which keeps my load to a minimum. Thanks Doxie.
4,The battery life isnt the best!Thats why i bought the Doxie Worldwide Power Adapter wich should have been sent with the scaner!
5,Love this!! Scan your photos documents business card contacts. Get organized digitally!!  It’s the 21st century after all!!!
5,How did I manage before this thing? My closet was exploding with papers I didn't want to throw away but had no idea what to do with and I had them all scanned and organized the day I got this in the mail.
5,This scanner is small but provides great copies.
1,I have consistently had problems getting it to sync with my computer so its essentially useless.  I spent two minutes scanning a document and 30 trying to get it to connect so I can transfer the file.  Save you money unless you want an expensive paperweight.
5,AMAZING! I tried the Scansnap before I purchased this and it was great however for my busy college lifestyle being able to scan and go is exactly what I needed. Software is incredibly easy to use and the OCR keeps things organized.
4,Very easy to set up very easy to use.  I also bought the case for it so it's protected.
1,Wasted two hours trying to get this thing to scan. Did all the trouble-shooting and watched videos...nothing worked.
5,Small portable & stores a lot of information. Was easy to set up. I have no negative comments.
5,Easy to set up use and transfer to computer! Great investment and organizing tool for paperless office
5,One of my most useful purchases in a long time.  I have no more file cabinets.  Google Docs has all my images now.  Wonderful product
5,Took me a moment to figure it out but works great!
2,Doxies seem to have problems with the power button.On the first Doxie I bought the power button froze during set up and wouldn't do anything. I sent it back and the Doxie customer support sent me a replacement.On the second Doxie I had the exact same issue.I'm trying to do a hard shut off and try again and see if I continue to have these issues. Perhaps it's just buggy to set up.
1,Tech says they "think" it could be a bad battery but I will probably return it.
5,I have to say I was kind of shocked at the speed and quality of this scanner. Add to that the tiny size the wifi access and the automated sending of my documents to Evernote and CloudApp? Me and the Doxie are new BFF's for life. Seriously awesome.
4,Really love this scanner. It was fast and the pictures were good quality. I am so excited to go paperless in 2013.
4,So far this little machine has not let me down.
4,Is easy to set up use and works well for my  occasional scanning.
1,The hardware is decent and seems to scan with decent quality. The computer software suite on the other hand is terrible. I had imported 2 8.5x11 scans and the process of OCRing them and exporting them to my desktop took almost a complete minute. Compare that to the Scansnap's utility which allowed me to OCR over 100 pages in under 5 minutes. This on it's own isn't so bad but the export utility forces you to wait on the OCR process preventing you from batching up a set of documents or even combining the next set of pages for export. This turns importing a set of 10 different scans into a 15 minute process which was unacceptable for me.
4,Sometimes the scanner doesn't grab the paper or it pulls to one side. But otherwise it's great!
1,Do not buy battery is dead after 3 months plugin it in will not charge it will not work just on usb. In short I need a new $20 batter to use. JUNK
5,Great scanner!
5,This has worked out very well for my going paperless project. It is easy to use and quicker than my flatbed scanner. I am very pleased with it.
1,Usability is not as convenient or effective as the idea of the product. I have difficulty connecting to WiFi at times and have to continuously try to reconnect. The scanner sometimes works but also has issues. Not much direction on how to import directly to cloud. The web version is difficult to access and the ability to export multiple PDFs at once is not user friendly. Definitely lots of improvements needed on the functionality and bugs to fix to make the device more user friendly and convenient.
5,The doxie go has been one of the best purchases...such a handy and reliable product.  You can scan your papers without being hooked up to your PC and then upload the documents at your convenience.  More reliable than my print/scanner/fax machines.
4,Christmas  gift  came on time and I am sure my son will love it.
5,This scanner is so simple to use you wonder if the scans are any good. When you upload to computer you will be amazed at the quality of scans. I use Evernote with the scanner and it can really help you go paperless.
1,I bought this unit because it said you could do automated cloud scanning. I was supposed to be able to scan directly to local apps but there is absolutely no documentation on how to handle the HTTP Post. In essence it doesn't automate anything as it would lead you to believe. When plugged in it also shuts down and disconnects from wi-fi after a certain time- so you would need to turn on and re-connect to wi-fi almost every time you use it. The software for Windows is extremely basic. Would not recommend.
5,Love this scanner!  Needed something easy to use to scan some older photos into digital format. Having the 600 dpi setting and the easy to use software to crop is just what I was looking for in a scanner.
5,This compact scanner works as promised. The software works well too. It is easy to "staple" the individual pages into one document and then send it to the storage service of your choice.
1,The scanner never started scanning just flashed different colored lights. Its not intuitive at all the focus was just on style (what looks good) not functionality. Don't care if a lot of people figured out how to use it... all people figured out how to turn a door handle...so most isn't good enough. Try again.
2,Sorry it had so much potential but finally tossed it in the trash today which feels like a massive waste of money.  Got very very tired of papers not being fed through properly getting caught on the left edge of the feed slot and time being wasted trying get the thing to do its job.  Perhaps I had one with some ill-fitting bodywork or a mechanical problem but I don't have time at the moment to waste time like this.
5,Muy practico
5,Great little scanner for the price. I've also used the Fujitsu Scansnap S1100i and they provide more or less the same experience but I prefer the Doxie for the software and the aesthetic.
2,Used it for a couple of days now and will probably return it.  Yes it's convenient to bring outside the home office but still adds bulk to your briefcase/messenger bag.  I'm still turning to the scanner on my laser printer for the convenience.  A little annoying to have to consistently plug in and disconnect the Doxie from my computer to transfer scans.  For it to be worth my while there has to be bluetooth connectivity as a feature.  Will be returning.
2,The technology is old. Some programing features are no longer working/available.I will have to look for another scanner...
5,My Doxie was a little finicky at first but Christie was a great help getting the problem resolved in record time. It's Apparent the Doxie has excellent customer service. Of course the scanner works wonderfully!
5,I love this product!  I originally bought it for scanning business receipts but quickly started scanning every loose paper in the house!  It's easy to use and really helpful!
5,Easy to use and makes great scans.
5,Great little scanner. It scans quickly and produces great quality images. I'm very happy with the portability. I like being able to take a pile of filing to the coffee shop and then run it to the recycle center on the way home.
5,I have been using this constantly since i purchased it.  I have scanned all my photos and most of my paper!  I am going to purchase a second one for my mother for Christmas.
5,Even better than I imagined! It does everything it claims it will do and it does it with ease. I would recommend it to everyone.
5,This is an essential piece of tech. The scanner is small light and easily scans your documents and photos in amazing color quality.
4,Love this scanner- a little more than I wanted to spend but SO convenient!
5,I really couldn't find anything wrong with it... If you can't get it to work right then you aren't using it right.Amazing little thing get the case to go with it.
5,After 10 minutes reading instructions and downloading software  I was up and running. Scanner is fast and easy to use upload to my laptop is very easy.
4,My wife liked it what else could I want.
5,Very pleased with this little scanner. Haven't used it as much but yet. But I love knowing that I can get rid of a lot of paper files. And keep everthing on my computer.Handy little item.
5,It does what it is supposed to do no frills.
3,It scans fast but it takes a long time to upload and you have to be careful because it tries to automatically upload your files to DropBox when you connect.
5,I love this little scanner it is great for scanning old pics. I love it more all the time!! The customer service is wonderful too!
5,Very happy with my Doxie.
5,My husband and I recently downsized from a large home to a condo. We scanned over 3000 photos in a single weekend. This little machine delivers.
3,It works good appears to be good quality but has very serious limitations!
1,I’m just putting 1 star ⭐️ because I haven’t used it yet.Will post something once I use it it should work as described. It’s just copying what it sees.
1,I tried to work with Doxie customer service. I ran several Doxie requested test on this unit. The final straw was when Doxie customer service wanted me to purchase a new usb cord to trouble shoot this unit. I decided to send unit back.
1,This scanner does not use industry standards. You will only be able to use this scanner with the proprietary software which in itself stinks that accompanies it. It is not plug 'n play and can not use TWAIN / ISIS drivers. The scanner is incredibly slow and jams easily. It will not scan any document longer than 14" and will not allow you to scan while connected to a computer. The entire time I was trying to keep an open mind about using it I felt like I was using a toy. For the price go ahead and get yourself a plug 'n play industry compatible scanner that you may use any scanning software available on the market and you will be much happier!
5,Grabs paper nicely pretty easy to connect to wifi faster scans than old Doxie Q
4,The Doxie software is a bit clunky but it all works.
5,This little bad boy is as advertised! AWESOME! Fast setup quick scans clear as any scanner ever. NEAT (the scanner company) will be so sorry they try to scam people once this thing picks up steam.
5,This is so nice. Works as published. Downloaded software for my MAC & I was good to go. I carry this in my computer bag or briefcase. I would definitely purchase this product again.
4,Great little portable scanner. I like the size and the carrier bag/pouch. The user interface is pretty straight forward and easy to use. The scan quality is good and about what you would expect from such an item. I did not find another portable scanner that ticked all my boxes like the Doxie SE.
5,Fantastic scanner for keeping yourself paperless. The software works great. High quality OCR and good integration with Evernote.Only con being sheet fed scanning a large document can be daunting.
1,I am so frustrated by the poor design of this product that I have to warn others before purchasing. The battery door wouldn't closed so the entire machine won't work. Even plugged in. A simple piece of plastic that is supposed to open and close!IF customer support can get this right and replace the entire scanner without cost then this will bump up to a 5 star review. I hate poorly designed products and I love good customer service. Simple as that.
5,This works great as a every-once-in-a-while scanner.Super simple to setup and start scanning.  Also the software is real simple to use.This isn't the most sophisticated scanner /software out there but its simplicity makes scanning workflow quick.
2,While Doxie is convenient and quick when it works it is not a durable design at all. Expect to send it back at LEAST once for repairs. I've sent two back in four months. The power Jack does not fit securely so I have to tape it in while I charge it. The actual aka canning process is simple and high quality but the machinery is sub par and poorly designed.
1,Just dropped off the second one that didn’t work at the UPS store. Wi-Fi didn’t function on first one and second one couldn’t hold a charge. Technical support was email that send me to their troubleshooting webpage (waited 3 days for response). Maybe they have changed manufacture but don’t waste any of your time on this one.
5,This scanner took only a few minutes to set up and is amazing to use.  Friendly process created by people who clearly want to have the experience be pleasant.  For a non-tech person this is a BIG plus!!
1,Had to return the first one because it required creating a makeshift device to apply pressure on the top. Without it I would get a read error light because I thought the cover was open.  Got the second one and it does the same thing I have to use rubber bands and wrap it around the top so it thinks the cover is closed and now papers frequently get stuck halfway says they’re being scanned. Good concept poor execution.
5,Love this little scanner! As someone who is technically challenged I needed something that was EASY. The Doxie is just that - and easy to carry along!
2,tech support was right there to help but feeding it seems to be a problem doesn't like to do receipts and does not like feeding it twice in a row
1,Was excited to received this item with reading the reviews. Unfortunately my excitement was felt short. The scanner paper feeder stopped working after four weeks. With an estimated total 25 sheet scanned this was extremely disappointing. I was granted a one time return with amazon being that I purchased the item one month and 8 days from the complaint. A bitter sweet moment glad that Amazon agreed to the return but concern if this happens again. Will I be stuck with a broken electronic device. I think I'll purchase my electronics from best buy from now on.I won't be buying this item again. Hope you have a better outcome if you do.
5,This is a great product for a small business like ours. It does what we need to do without any complicated steps.  We love it
5,Love scanner
5,Works great.  I love the small size.  Good quality.  Software is easy to use.
5,It's so small but does a fantastic job of scanning photos and documents.  AND it's user friendly.  I've recommended it to family and friends.
1,Rarely leave bad reviews.  This scanner is so complicated to use plus rarely works.  Today I found out it is difficult to scan if you have just printed something off.  I was using a Fujitsu that I loved and decided I needed portability.  Yes it is portable but useless
5,Totally wonderful piece of must-have equipment even if you don't do a lot of scanning. Lightweight easy-to-use and fabulous customer service from the folks at Doxie. No learning curve to hike!
5,I use it daily for over a year now and it works perfectly.
5,This small scanner is an amazing piece of machinery.  I travel a lot and can scan documents on site rather than taking paperwork home to scan.  Makes everything so much easier!
5,Great little scanner the software is great too. Makes it so easy to duplicate my paper files into the same layout.
5,First they have great support! I bought a Doxie scanner back in 2013 to well scan papers – jump ahead 9 years of moderately regular use and I noticed the pages weren't scanning in full anymore. I reached out to Doxie support to see if there was maybe something I was missing (since it was wildly out of warranty by this point) and when I explained my issues and sent over examples of what was happening they weren't able to help me fix my original one BUT they did offer me a 50% off code for a replacement. Only negative is that they don't ship to IL (Amazon plz?) but this happened to coincide with a trip to see family out-of-state.On the device itself I really love it! Easy to set up and operate simple to link with dropbox/google drive/other cloud services to save your scans and the staple feature is useful especially for pages you want to keep together but don't necessarily plan on editing in any specialized pdf software.
5,Fast and easy scanning of my photos. Great value.
5,Fast portable and clear. Totally worth it!  No software needed so it works with Linux and Microsoft. its about 9 in wide and only scans 11ish in tall so it can't do anything big
5,Easy to use and portable
1,Weak battery life even when the adapter is connected.  It takes forever for the unit to connect to my computer via internet.  Then you have to save each individual document after importing them.  It ends up taking a long time way over priced.
5,I have tried a few other scanners and this is by far the best quality and easiest to use - I have recommended this to several people
4,Quick and easy to carry
5,Perfect! Great quality.
5,Great scanner at an affordable price and it's very easy to use.
5,We recently moved onto a 40 ft. sailboat (space is limited). This little scanner allows me to continue being paperless. The Doxie Go Wi-Fi just works!
5,At first glance this is an awesome tool.  What's great is the plug-and-play feature for the aspects I used it for.  Easy to scan easy to manage easy to download and easy to collate.
5,It really works great when you're on the go.  Especially when you need a quick way to scan a document.
5,I love my Doxie. It makes it so easy to go paperless  It is also wonderful for continuing with my genealogy work.
5,I'm still learning to use this but I really like the convenience.  It wasn't what I expected I thought I could categorize the images easily in to accounting type groups.
3,Realty my fault I bought this to go paperless. In fortunately you need a Mac or PC to fully utilize the scanners abilities. And I just have an IPad.
5,Very cool device.  My wife uses this scanner almost everyday for documents.  And she loves the software for it.  Definitely a great tech gadget
5,Love it
5,The OCD in me thoroughly enjoys the scanning of ALL her receipts this 2014 fiscal year. It's stupidly easy to use people. Not the fastest but for the price.. not so bad.
3,I like the way it worked. Saves me time. what I didn't like was not able to name the project at the time. and some time not remembering what it was
4,Just perfect....
5,Great scanner and even better customer support.  I use the scanner with Evernote and Google Drive daily without issues.  The software is good but could be improved.
5,Best purchase I've made in awhile it is exactly what I wanted for exactly what I wanted to do!
5,Works as expected and helps me tame my paper jungle.
5,Love it.  Had issues with power supply/ unit they replaced the whole thing no charge.  Awesome !!  very easy to use and works great.
4,Works as advertised!
5,scanned photos & documents. Easy to use.
5,This is a handy little gadget! I sit on the coach watching Dancing with the Stars and feeding pictures though in my lap. It is fast and user friendly.
1,I bought this scanner in November 2019 thinking it would do everything like its advertising but NO IM VERY DISAPPOINTING. Today June 30 2020 I opened and try to scan my small receipts and the scanner didn't want to accepted it only accepted the big receipts.
5,😻😻😻
5,This product is as great as advertised.
1,I am pretty tech-savvy and this thing is impossible to set up without chatting with customer support and begging them to call you. The software does not recognize the hardware the things that should be automated do not happen in the fashion that is suggested.This product is not for those who aren't tech-savvy.
5,Love this scanner! Works well when scanning funeral home records copying to a flash drive. And the size makes it easy to transport!
5,Love Love Love it. Did two filing cabinets full of papers love that it is so easy and the software is just quick. love love love it. Got two of them
5,It's great.  Small and easy to use.  It has trouble with really minor things like staple holes or folds but not enough to not make it awesome
3,The scans aren't spectacular and they're always tinted green. Not necessarily the best thing for family photo archiving but it's fine in a pinch.
5,Super useful for office work.
3,Great document scanner but does terrible with pictures.
5,Nice little scanner I used it a lot.
5,i like it
5,Works as advetrized ocr feature as well. Great in the field.
3,One of these days I will actually use it. It seemed to be okay when I first tried it so I imagine it will be fine.
5,The scanner meets my expectation. It is very useful.
1,Very quirky wi fi setup.  Poor instructions.  Slow scanning compared to SnapScan.  Very slow wi fi file transfers.  Short battery life.  I am sorry to say that i really can't find a single good point to mention.  I  would send it back if I could and I would not buy it again.
5,I love this product!  It saves me time and money.  I've been spreading the word to all my friends!
5,Must buy! Great!! Easy on the Go!
5,Easy to use. High quality copying.
5,This is an awesome product. Perfect for my application.....scanning 35 years of kids pictures. Allows you to set outside and scan or use right at the computer. Love it.
5,Excellent customer service and product
5,I can't wait to use it.
5,i used alot of scanners but this one is my favorite ...its fast and easy to use..the best thing is doxie's app is really helpful and easy
1,Doesn't clearly state that only really good with I phones
5,Compact and easy to use
5,Easy to use and very clear pictures.
5,Get rid of Paperwork!  And the Company has great Customer Tech Care.
5,Works great & fast at scanning pictures and other documents. Easy to sync with iPhoto. So easy to use my 90 year old Grandmother was scanning within minutes.
5,So easy to use. I scan everything now -- all my mail medical records bills receipts. Use with Evernote Premium for even more awesomeness.
1,Purchased this thing on January 13th relatively minimal use and it no longer works.  Will not feed any documents.  This was supposed to save me time in my business and I've wasted more time than ever trying to get this thing to scan a few documents.  Easier to use my full size desktop scanner. Don't know where all these favorable reviews are coming from but this is a piece of crap.  Don't buy it.
5,The quickest easiest way to a paperless office. Easy UI plug & play operability integrations with cloud services like Evernote make getting this is a no-brainer.
1,I needed this for a time sensitive project and it didn't work out of the box.
5,Love love love this handy little scanner. Great quality easy to use and Doxie makes the extra effort to provide support. GREAT!
1,Wow what a disappointment! This scanner was DOA. It grinds buzzes and doesn't even accept the calibration sheet that came with it. Apparently this is a known issue as Doxie's support page makes mention of these exact problems. They describe it as a "rare condition."I don't need this badly enough to bother to get a replacement. Back to my ScanSnap S1500 which is awesome. I'll wait until ScanSnap comes out with a truly portable scanner.
1,This product started downloading harmful malware software on my computer when I plugged it into my computer. I was lucky enough to catch it and remove the software and malware. I'm not sure if it was from the manufacturer or the distributor - the manufacturer told me it has never happened before and they are sending me a replacement but I intend to test this THOROUGHLY before giving it another try.
2,They don't tell you that it will not connect to any other phone other than iphones. Their was no app. I felt mislead with the description. Got here in time. I'm not giving it a complete one star only because I didn't get to use it on the job.
5,This is a terrific scanner. Portable and very easy to use. Perfect scans every time. Quickly scans old photos. Charge it using your computer no electric outlet required.
5,I'm on my way going completely paperless with all of my monthly bills as well as my annual tax returns.  Doxie Go makes it THAT EASY!!
5,Works as described and is super easy to use.  So much better than a huge scanner that you need to plug into your computer.
5,Real easy to use.  I always use with a SD card in the slot quicker for transfers.
5,Works great!  Nice small form factor lasts a long time on a single charge - exactly what I needed!
5,So far this works great and very easily.  This helps make working from home while meeting clients elsewhere just that much easier.
2,My goal with the purchase: get rid of paper in my filing cabinet and any new statements/receipts.  The lack of Doxie Go's dual-sided scanning and auto-paperfeed made this too time consuming of a task.  I'll be switching to a new solution and will update this review when I find the right one.
2,Battery pack quit taking a charge under four months boo.
5,Easy to use works great
5,It was so simple to install and transfer scanned documents to specific folders.  It did exactely what I had hoped.
5,great scanner portable and easy to use.  already scanned over 900 pictures and working great.
5,I love that it’s portable
5,Love this easy to use scanner!
5,I use it to scan Chinese opera sheet music at the clubs.  It just works as I expected.  Good product!
1,Doesn’t work as advertised. Difficult to setup abs keep it configured. Tech support is always busy
5,great and easy to use just wish you could scan more than 1 sheet at a time.
5,Simple to set up and operate.  I like the small size.  It does all I need and more.  Very happy with it.
5,Portable as possible.. and fast device also battery equipped...
5,This scanner is so easy to use. It's been working perfectly for me. The scanned images are  high quality.
5,Works great!
5,Can't beat it for the price. Very well made and easy to set up.
2,The biggest issue with this is FEEDING. The feeding is horrible. Other than that if you can finally get it to feed after 10 tries the scan quality is decent but it shows bends in the paper.
5,A must get. I use it for all my receipt scans. Great integration with Evernote which helps me sort out all my scans!
5,This works great.  Portable rechargable. Best part is the software!  The scanning software is amazingly easy to use.
1,I received an used scanner. The box came in with multiple tapes on it and inside sd card and cable are missing. Doxie please do your quality control!
2,For $200+ I would expect at least a decent case for the scanner and a USB ac wall adapter.
5,Easy to use; easy interface with computer and Evernote.  Excellent customer support.
3,The software doesn't have OCR Hebrew support as spouses to
2,Hard to use
5,Great tool for the office especially when connected wirelessly with Evernote. Wish the battery lasted a little longer but excellent none the less
5,Well worth the money. Easy to use and does a great job!
5,Amazingly easy to scan documents. Getting me closer to being paper-free.  Very pleased.
1,Received the product yesterday and immediately the WIFI doesn't work and the battery is only good for (1) scan.  Called their customer service support line and trying to get someone to call me back is impossible.  Not recommended at all.
5,I love this. It's easy to use and scans great pictures.
1,The resolution is poor. The software is lousy very limited and hard to figure out. It’s also incompatible with any Mac older than five years.
5,First document scanner ever used; this one does a terrific job.  Interfaces well with my desktop no additional software needed.  Very pleased.
1,Stopped feeding on the left side after only a day or two of use then stopped feeding altogether. I have to attempt to scan a sheet several dozen times before it will actually feed correctly and it takes about a minute for the scanner to reset between scans. My effective scan rate is no joke about four sheets an hour.
1,Not happy it doesn’t scan as it saysI need for documents scanned Not pictures scannerI need to return it ASAP
5,This product is extremely user friendly and takes high quality images. I highly recommend this to teachers musicians etc...
1,Hard to feed and would not feed all the time. Returned it and got a Scan Snap which works perfect and easy
5,This is such a handy device.  Very simple and performs as I had hoped.
5,Work great easily down loaded to place in folders.
5,This product exactly meets my needs for portable and fast.
5,Great. It does everything I need it to do.Very good product.
2,Nothing special about this scanner that makes it worth the $220 price tag. Brother makes virtually the same scanner for $60. Also the software/app are just o.k.
5,use this for paper work in the office  works great scan documents . easy to use nice software like it
5,Loving this product.  So glad I didn't spend a lot more for the Neat Desk.
2,I did not like this product because it really didn't do the job I was looking for.  I needed something to do high volume scanning and the software that  came with it was also limited.
5,works exactly as described.  charge it and scan on the go
5,item purchased is exactly what I wanted and what I ordered.  Very satisfied with sale and and with product.  Highly recommend.
5,Works perfectly and super intuitive
5,Works very well and scans have been very high quality either B&W or Color.
5,So far love the ease of this.  Like being able to use while watching tv...
5,Love this scanner. I recommend it to all my friends and family. Very user friendly..easy to use.
5,I love this scanner. It is so small light and convenient and easy to use. I take it everywhere
5,Amazing scanner...convenient size fast and easy to use with great results!
5,I really like the Doxie and I love that fact that it is mobile.  So far so good.
5,I love this.
5,Excellent! Much easier than bulky flat scanners for most items.
1,could not install
1,Stopped working in less than a year. Can’t even perform a factory reset. Company gave me a replacement and that one stopped working within a few months as well.
2,Not what I thought
1,Scanner constantly errors. Difficulty connecting to PC with WiFi and usuallly flashing errors resulting in having to turn off/on to fix. I usually spend more time troubleshooting than scanning. Avoid this scanner.
5,amazing office tool
5,Arrived on time. Very well packaged. Product worked as described and held a good charge.
5,Perfect portable scanner for what I needed. Scans look great :)
5,Good scanner
1,The light indicators are annoyingly confusing it doesn't feed multiple documents. The software is alright but there are better options for a lower price if you re looking to backup all of your important docs. I guess if you just need a basic portable scanner it's alright but overpriced.
5,A fantastic little tool for the home office. I love it. Great that it scans to an SD card!
5,best portable scanner
5,Love it. Easy to use anywhere. Good quality scans.
5,Scan it and forget it.It really works and I use it all the time!
5,Amazing thing to take to appointments and scan documents for later.  It's a winner!!
1,Does not feed paper or receipts easily
5,Very satisfied with this portable scanner.  Does everything I need it to do and then some.
5,This has worked very well.  I would suggest getting the Wi-Fi card to go with it.
5,Very portable easy to use great scans a great use of money to buy this. Just go get one now.
5,Love it paired with a eye-fi card. Good quality scans and the card wirelessly transfers them.
5,Arrived promptly.  Exactly as described.  Works very efficiently.  Easy to set up.
1,Hardly ever works. Same problems happen over and over. Worst purchase I made this year.
5,Excellent scanner. Love internal memory and rechargeable batteries
5,I took this to the East Coast and scanned many genealogy photos of long lost relatives.
1,Excellent Scanner. Love it. I primarily use it to scan receipts for Quicken. If I were to buy it again though I would get the Wi-Fi model. It would save me from having to plug it into the computer.
5,Great product. Easy to use and organize receipts.
5,This product was exactly what I needed! The perfect scanner for home office and anywhere else you need it!The portability of this product allows you to scan and store images anywhere.  Then hook it up and you've got what you need!The customer service is awesome as well!  I had one scanner finally start to have issues after years of hard work.  I contacted the company with the issue and had a new scanner in two days!  No questions asked!They also reach out and make sure things are going well with their products.  This is the way to run a company!  Great Job!
5,Great product - simple to use
5,Great product with easy setup
5,Scanned a few documents very easy to use. Does have limitations. But for what is does it well. Hassle free.
5,This is great and very easy to use really exceeded my expectaions
1,WORKED ONE TIME AND QUIT
5,my wife loves it...working well
5,Excellent scanner for photos.
5,Great product works as advertised compatible with my mac.
5,I love it!
5,Great quality
5,I LOVE THIS SCANNER !!!
5,good stuff.  We have scanned thousands of pages and there hasn't been one jam.
5,Very fast!
5,works great!
5,Very easy to use! Great product
5,Love it.
1,DO NOT USE
5,I love the product.  It is small convenient and easily transportable.
5,Works Great
1,Never worked out of the box. Still does not work. Support poor and after too many attempts problem was known to Doxie recurring issue. We want an RGA and refund please.
5,Works great love it!!
5,Love love love my Doxie scanner. Easy set up download and operation.
1,I did not like this and returned it. I wanted something that I could scan my receipts in and it didn't have any kind of program to use.
5,We love our Doxie.  Scans anything and does it VERY FAST
5,Very good product. Very convenient and works well. I love it.
1,This device is awful. The charging cord does not work. Now the USB cable does not work. This product is TRASH. DO NOT BUY!!!!
5,Should have one. Brilliant device fast great battery life.
5,my second purchase. Love it!
5,Makes scanning much more convenient for me.
1,USB port arrived broken poor driver support. Internal memory not accessible
1,Inefficient.Doesn’t work for my business.
3,I had the original Doxy Go and it was innovative for its time. I liked it enough to continue with the brand.A solid piece of advice is that if you have an original and are looking to upgrade you can contact them for a discount code to help you upgrade. It was worth 50%. Great customer service in that regard.That said this unit frustrates me. I'll clean it and still get a line in the image as if the rollers or scanner is dirty. I'll wipe the photo too and still need to redo.When you scan an item you have to reenter the file folder for your scanner and then click on that image to see it blown up. Imagine needing to do that with 100s 1000s of photos.Scan click on the scanner folder click on the file. Images you scan should auto populate on the screen for vetting. If you're doing receipts the lines don't really matter. However if you're doing photos you can just scan scan scan and feel confident they are perfect.There's even issues with cropping sometimes that is an automatic thing. Older photos with dates along the side good luck. The doxy loves to cut them off.I'm really thinking a traditional pad scanner is the way to go. I really hope they improve their unit. I WANT to love it.
1,Doesnt work a bit. Did not even scan a page properly.Very low quality. Will never ever recommend this to anyone.
1,It has given us trouble ever since we purchased it. Now the computer and wireless port is not working!!! No returns!! Really!!!
1,Hard sync WIFI
1,Not user friendly.  Want to return it but missed my window.
5,Awesome scanner. Does a good job and charge lasts forever.
5,Great product
5,I cannot live without this! Mobile and easy to use!
5,Perfect for an easy to use portable scanner.
1,This might be a good home scanner but i would not recommend this for even light office work.
5,Excellent scanner.  Scans photos well and included software is intuitive.
1,Scanned 2 pages and promptly broke
1,I did not get to use it tower cord would not say connected for it to charge.
1,Accidentally posted review to adaptor purchase. But long story short battery sucks scans difficult to feed straight.
5,Well made easy to use convenient.
5,Update to review - After reading this review a customer representative contacted me and replaced my Doxie with a new one.  They wanted to make sure I am a pleased customer.  I am happy now.  All I wanted was a new battery to fix the one I had so it would work.  A new scanner works too.  It really is a nice little scanner and very portable.  The software is easy to use.  Thank you Doxie.Unboxing the Doxie I thought it seamed flimsy but I thought "well it is portable and I splurged on the case so it will be okay."  When I first used this Doxie I liked it with a few caveats - 1) it can not be used unless the battery is charged 2) you have to scan to a SD card then transfer the files over to your computer.  It was a pain in the butt so I only used it a few times.  I also noticed after the first time using it it started becoming more and more difficult to get the battery to charge.  Now 2 1/2 years later it won't charge at all.  I contacted Doxie customer service to see if I could get a new battery for it.  There response was that this was a "rare" problem and they offered me a 50% off coupon for a new Doxie if I prove that I purchased this one from Amazon.  No thank you!  If it is a rare problem and I can prove my purchase how about sending me a free new one?
5,Easy to use. Really compact and handy!
5,Very portable reliable long battery life clear copies.
5,Amazing
5,Great scanner and easy to use. Very mobile
5,Love this scanner.  So easy to use.
5,The best portable scanner ever!!!!!
5,A wonderful scanner and its portable
5,This is a really well thought-out product. Small portable and self contained. Quick at scanning. Offers very good quality even when scanning photos.  Great for working when you don't want to lug around a computer.  Took it to Starbucks (no computer) and scanned about 100 documents fairly quickly.  Definitely a keeper. Highly recommended!
5,love that its so portable
5,this was everything I'd hope for
5,Works as described.
5,Great
5,This scanner is making my home digitization project much easier.  The customer support is also very good.
5,Convenient compact  and lightweight! Love it!
5,We bought this for our office as the majority of the receipts and documents we deal with are primarily still on paper. I liked the Doxie Go SE for its portability so that anyone in the office could use it and it didn't need to be tied to a computer. This also creates a dilemma of course because if you DO have the option to connect to a computer certainly an "instant transfer" like a print/scanner would do would be preferable. It's not a material problem however and it works excellently without this feature.The support for the device is also excellent and so is the customer service. I will say this device does take a little technical understanding between downloading the import software scanning the calibration sheets and utilizing an SD card - i.e. I wouldn't send this to my grandmother without someone there to set it up.Pro tips I learned from Customer Service: Doxie sells some special sheets for scanning damaged documents or documents with a media that might smudge like crayon or oil stains. I would recommend including at least one of these in your purchase just in case! Also if you have a lot of documents that you might want to be able to find later import them as a PDF and not an image. It turns out file explorers can search the content of a PDF so you can quickly find information by using a unique keyword in your search. I didn't realize this so I scanned all my receipts to images thinking I could easily go through and find them in the future but actually making my life more difficult - shocker!
5,LOVE this scanner! Fast simple....
5,Works perfectly scanning receipts and documents in home office
5,Simple and Easy to use.
5,So nice to scan receipts with...
4,I've tried a few different portable document scanners over the years my most recent being the Fujitsu S1300 but I recently updated my Mac to Catalina Apple's latest (64-bit only) OS. In some some regards this was a mistake as several of my programs and some hardware such as the S1300 scanner stopped working. Come to find out the software and drivers were all 32-bit and Fujutsu had no plans to support my model any longer on the Mac. So I decided to look for a new scanner and wanted one that supported scans over Wi-Fi a feature my old Fujitsu didn't have. I'm not a power user when it comes to scanning I use mine to scan important home banking and medical documents nothing for work so I didn't want to spend a ton of money like I originally did on the Fujitsu. I came across the Doxie which looked like it fit the bill and since I caught it on an Amazon Lighting sale it was in my price range ($100 - $150). The scanner works well especially if you are a road warrior and don't always have a PC with you or the time to hook everything up. The Doxie can scan directly to a SD memory card with nothing other then the scanner required. It's battery powered and can scan at either 300 or 600 DPI. I also liked that it had it's own access point built in so I could connect my iPhone directly to it's wi-fi network and capture scans directly to my phone and then store them to a cloud service from there. All that seems to work fine. So what's the problem? In my case it was the workflow. It just simply took too many steps to do what I do most. I want to scan directly to email or a cloud service or PDF-- scan and done! That does not seem possible with Doxie. You have to scan to the memory card then export to the Doxie app then save to PDF or an image file then to you app like email. Just too many steps. Also the scanner isn't the quickest. It takes around 8-9 seconds to scan a page I believe best in class is somewhere around 4-5. Last and this is really an issue for me there wasn't a way I could find to scan directly to Word or Excel so the text was editable in those applications. The Doxie has the ABBYY software built in to create searchable PDF but it can't save to Word or Excel formats. Hopefully this will be a feature in a later version of their software.This brings me to customer support. Doxie is on top of it-- period!. I wish other companies were as responsive as they are. Even once they provided a response they would follow-up  to make sure I was satisfactory. The only problem I had was that they didn't always read my question throughly and would sometimes reply with the wrong response. For example I asked about being able to save a scan as a editable Word or Excel file and they replied quickly but really only provided the steps to save a scan as a searchable PDF file-- not what I asked about. But hey anyone can make a mistake... overall they seems to have excellent responsive customer service from techs that really seem like they want to make you successful with their product.In the end I think Doxie is a great little scanner especially if you work on the road and need a standalone scanner that will capture images with no PC or electrical outlet required. I just wish it had a better workflow that fit my needs.
5,Works great with my Macbook Pro
5,Love my Doxie
5,Wonderful....as advertised....convenient and easy to use.
5,Outstanding product and fantastic customer service.
5,Great product!
5,Wonderful. Simplifying my life.
5,Yea!  Bye-bye mess of receipts!
5,Great transaction Great item!
5,Love my doxie
5,freaking awesome!
5,We had an issue with one part of the Doxie but was beyond the 30 days with Amazon. The tech support with Doxie is incredible. They mailed me the part and we’re incredibly gracious and patient.
5,Great little scanner.
5,SUPER HELPFUL!
5,Great scanner!
5,Easy to use!
5,Works great
5,💗it
5,Bought this on sale a while ago - I think on an Amazon Prime day maybe with the hopes of digitizing my filing cabinet to reduce clutter and it's worked great!Never used OCR before (image to searchable text) and it's SUPER useful! Software has some quirks and it has a few features missing from iOS before I can use this on the go fully but it's still great and feature-rich and I recommend it!PROs:-- OCR tech is nice and it manages to read and convert smaller images of text into searchable text!-- the "staple" feature is so handy when putting individual pages into a single document-- Compact-- Sturdy for what I was expecting!-- Support is awesome!!!! I've had some issues with the software but their Support is STELLAR where they found workarounds for any issues they couldn't fix and made me feel heard when they said they'd report issues to Devs. They also listen to their customer base when considering new features.-- User Friendly documentation which is a big plus over other software-- Robustness of Use! It's great having options to connect via wired WiFi or pull out and use the SD card. Especially since you can set it up to auto-connect to existing WiFi and it'll auto-switch to broadcasting it's own if it can't find your WiFi (like you took the scanner from home to a coffee shop)CONs:** all of these are minor or being fixed/implemented **-- No OCR or Staple features on iPad / iOS **YET** but they're working on it (fingers crossed that it's not subscription based like other scanning apps)-- not able to scan both sides of a page in a single scan or a re-scan function - but you can tell it to Interleave pages in the software-- on Windows there is no mouse functionality other than point-and-click (missing drag over selection or right click functionality on a selection)
5,So easy to set up and use! I am scanningALL of my photos and scanning my parents photos and important papers…. I must have thousands 🤗
5,This is my second doxie. The user interface is so well-conceived and executed. I have used the Doxie for work and for home. It is a great investment!
5,I love this! It has made work so much easier. It's so easy to work I love that it doesn't have to be plugged into my laptop to be able to scan. I can use it anywhere.
5,This is a great simple and very portable scanner. We wanted a reasonably priced scanner that could be used stand alone or connected to my Mac that could scan 300dpi or 600dpi and that was reasonably quick. This scanner fit all our criteria and we have been very pleased. We needed to scan well over a thousand old family photos plus I needed this to scan receipts and other documents into my Mac. The scanner automatically crops the photo or documents and aligns them if you happened to insert an item into the scanner a bit crooked and 99% of the time does a perfect job with alignment and cropping. When it rarely doesn't get it quite right due to an unusual photo or document the intuitive software makes it easy to correct. The software (for Mac or PC) allows for adjustment of  brightness contrast saturation rotation and cropping and will allow you to save scans in JPEG PNG or a PDF format and can automatically do text recognition. If you scan a multiple page document it's super simply to combine them into one PDF using the "staple" function. The battery is rechargeable using a standard USB to micro USB charging cable (included) and the scanner comes with a 16 GB SD Card which provides far more space than you'll ever need. Scans can be transferred to your computer via the USB cable or simply by swapping the SD card from the scanner to the computer. An amazing lightweight portable easy to use and great quality little scanner. I should also mention the customer and technical support were outstanding. I had a few questions and they were answered promptly. We've scanned in 100s of photos so far plus many other documents. We couldn't be happier.
5,This scanner is the best thing ever!  It's a real work horse for scanning and sending documents straight to my favorite organizing software.  It is compact and easily portable from my desk to coffee table to on the road.  I can quickly scan documents that I need to send via email as well as scan save and organize receipts  health records and recipes.  After scanning and easily interfacing with my desktop software documents are accessible from my laptop wherever I go.  In addition to being a great product  the Doxie customer service is outstanding.  They really back their product's performance and provide excellent customer care.
4,Update: Shortly after I wrote this review I was contacted by Doxie with a very thoughtful and detailed email addressing my concerns and offering pointers on overcoming them. Ultimately this doesn't change my gripes about the product but I was vacillating between 3 and 4 stars. I originally scored the product 3 stars but am raising it to four since the care and concern shown by Customer Service was well beyond the call of duty and deserves to be recognized. So bravo.I wish I could give 3.5 stars: I don't quite feel like this is a "3 star" device but also not really in the "4 star" range either. Ultimately it's fine and it gets the job done but it does so with a bit more headache and shoddy output than I'd hope.I have a   Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i Mobile Document Scanner         which I think is superior but it's not really portable. Therein lies the real benefit of the Doxie: you can take it with you - even without a computer - and scan in materials to download later. Ultimately this is the real selling point of the Doxie and the reason you should get it. In this sense I'm reasonably satisfied since I have the "real" scanner in my office and then the Doxie to use at home and/or on the road should it ever come to that.That said you do give up a lot for that portability. For one the Doxie software is for lack of a better word terrible. It admittedly does allow you to "staple" multiple scans together but this is a bare minimum feature given that there's no ADF or duplexing which would automatically do that for you. There's no auto-deskew no color detection no option to choose output format.The scanning mechanism is pretty unforgiving as well. Especially if you're scanning receipts - the bulk of my use case - it seems to want to twist the paper inward which makes the scan messy. It should also go without saying that the best case for this scanner is with smaller jobs: scanning a 20 page document (as one may occasionally do) will almost certainly lead to madness. This isn't the right tool to "go paperless".So if you have a competent scanner already and want a more portable one or if portability is critical and you're not scanning long documents the Doxie is great. It's totally alone in its class as far as portability - with the SD card/USB storage slots you don't even need to get it near a computer. But if you plan on any kind of volume scanning or you want something for your desk - get something else.
5,Love my doxie make my job a lot easier running our small truck company
5,EDIT:I wrote a previous negative review on this product and was contacted within the same day by their customer service team. They worked very quickly to rectify our situation. It appears we had a defective item and they have now replaced it! I honestly couldn't say enough good things about this company; my first impression of them was so drastically changed by their willingness to correct my situation with as little inconvenience to me as possible. The positive reviews on this product are all absolutely well deserved.P.S. Claudio from the customer service team needs a medal and a raise. He was awesome.P.P.S. I was tempted to remove the text of my old review but I think it helps to see how frustrated I was early on and how quickly and thoroughly they were able to turn that around. Great company!My mom bought this product to scan all her old pictures. I set it up for her (or attempted too) and after following all the directions both in the box and online it would still never charge. I checked all online FAQ's to try and identify the problem. Power is getting to the unit as the red light will flash once every time it is plugged in but it would never actually charge. I tried switching chargers taking the memory card out and using different USB boxes; nothing worked. I sent an email to their customer service and never received a reply (maybe I will get one eventually but definitely not as they claim "ASAP"). Extremely disappointing.
5,This scanner works very easily.  It would not work with my Chromebook so I switched to a Windows laptop.  The included sheets make setup easy along with additional options for use.  Ease of setup and use. Highly recommend this product.
5,Four weeks into receiving the Doxie Go SE the piles of paper strewn across my study are down to manageable proportions and I am once again accessing documents on my laptop.This small unobtrusive unit produces high quality scans in either 300 or 600 dpi. Most of my paperwork is now scanned on it except for specific tasks such as scanning a passport or film negatives these I scan on my desktop flatbeds. Today I scanned a medical instruction leaflet that unfolded into a 30 inch long strip. The Doxie ran it through effortlessly turning it into a single perfect scan that is now stored on my laptop.In the field I use the Doxie as a stand alone unit unconnected to a laptop powered by its own rechargeable battery. Scans are saved to a memory card until I upload them to my laptop in my own time. Upload time is slightly unimpressive but the ease and convenience of it all is overwhelming.The small size portability and quality of output make scanning on the Doxie an overwhelmingly liberating experience. Brilliant product love it.
5,This is a great product if you’re interested in getting rid of paper receipts and other documents when you only need a digital copy.  This Dixie SE was a replacement for an older Dixie which gave me five years of great service.  The customer service is fantastic.  They should be a model for other companies.  My old scanner was having feeding problems; so they sent me a free replacement.  They even sent me a free gift for giving them a positive review.  Great job!!
5,I received this as a birthday gift because I needed (and requested) a new portable scanner. This Doxie came in my birthday package and I have absolutely loved it! Initially I used it without downloading the software which is fine if you're just scanning one page. But when I needed to scan several pages and turn them into one document I went ahead and installed the software. Not only was it easy to install but it was very user-friendly. Love that I can scan multiple pages into the program and then choose the pages I want "stapled" together into one document. I can then easily download the PDF wherever I need to store it. Truly it couldn't have been more straightforward and took no time at all to set up. Plus the customer service is terrific. I haven't had any issues but once I registered my scanner their team checked in to make sure everything was working as it should. Couldn't be happier to have this Doxie close at hand for every scan!  :)
5,I first purchased an original Doxie from Amazon 5 years ago and have been very happy with the product- I have used it to digitize a ton of old paper clutter taking up space in my house but that I couldn't throw away (tax documentation from years past health paperwork nostalgic items like old schoolwork etc). Because it's so portable easy to use and can store so many scans many evenings I would sit on the couch with it and mindlessly scan papers while watching TV- super convenient. The device is very user-friendly even "idiot-proof" and robust- it's really sturdy and hard to use incorrectly but still light and small enough to not take up a lot of space. The companion software is also very intuitive and user-friendly: if you scan a multi-page document it's easy to select all the pages and click "staple" to combine all pages into one PDF document- much easier than using a separate clunkier PDF merge software.The real kicker and the reason I'm writing this 5 star review now after 5 years is that I recently pulled out the device again after not having used it for 6 months or so and it wasn't working right- paper was feeding in crooked and the motor seemed to be sticking such that the paper would jam halfway into the scan. I tried cleaning the rollers with a lint cloth but no dice. I took a short video of the device malfunctioning and submitted a customer service claim fully ready to hear that the device was out of warranty and nothing could be done as I've experienced with other inexpensive consumer electronics in the past (worth noting that I probably still would have purchased a new one because the device is so handy) but instead literally within 12 hours Doxie customer service replied to me with a personal email confirming that I had what they called a "rare motor defect" exhibited on my device and offering to ship me a brand new Doxie (in fact the current upgraded SE Model compared to my 5-year-old one) free of charge no more questions asked. The replacement was shipped immediately after I confirmed my address and they sent me a prepaid label to send my old defective device back. Charles from Doxie customer service followed up with me by email several times to confirm everything was going smoothly and that I'd received the new device.So here I am literally 5 days after having submitted the customer service inquiry scanning papers again with a brand new perfectly functioning unit. If I could give more than 5 stars I would- this was truly an exceptional customer service experience on an exceptional product. There is literally no reason to buy any other scanning device- I'm a lifelong customer.
5,The scanner is portable but it still scans quickly and accurately. Comes with powerful easy-to-use software. I can use it anywhere in my house or take it with me on the go.As an added bonus it's backed by Doxie's exceptional customer service—they stand behind their products 100%.Definitely recommended!
5,This Doxie scanner is easy and intuitive to use... it holds good (though not great) charge it is small enough to be portable and its functionality is as advertised. I used it to scan over a thousand old photos from family albums while traveling abroad and it did the job perfectly including scanning some cardboard-thickness photos without ever damaging any of the precious photos. So I am happy with the results.I will mention one caveat is that if the object scanned is not rectangular one must scan it with a rectangular piece of paper underneath it. The scanner automatically senses the width of the document upon its initial insertion so it isn't ready to scan a larger area if the document becomes wider as it is being fed if that makes sense. Anyway it is a small problem with a simple solution.Technical support is on point and courteous to boot.Doxie scanner is a five star product and I highly recommend it!
5,3826 photos of all sizes scanned over 3 days....front and back!...ok my mom passed and we had to scan all the pictures they had over the years dating back to 1926 and dad was a Marine who went thru WWII..China. ..Korea..Vietnam and everything thru 1986....anyway it performed like a champ....here are some tips...do not keep it hooked up to your computer if doing mass scans like I just did...keep it unhooked and plugged in..if you keep it plugged in via USB to the computer it is slowing you down...believe me I found out after the first 7 hour run... you can feed the photos as I did without the sleeve it is not needed....now you put a photo up to the intake slot and it will just barely grab it and set it..then it scans...now if you want a completely next scan file ...when it pops out the other side..just count to one eighth...just like that..say one eighth. .then set the next photo quickly as you did the last one...one after another like this..we had piles and piles of them..thick ones.. thin ones..wide..small..ok now you can also do a rapid 3 photo scan I had many that were 3 photos or 4 photos of the same subject..if you insert the next photo of the bunch just as the last one is about thru it will suck it in and scan it as though it was a 12 or 16 inch piece of paper..now realize those 3 photos are one file not 3 separate photos! ...I think sometimes it stopped if that 16" length was reached...so watch for that... also get used to the lights on the button...you can ignore the top light but the green bar light flashing is a must to learn if doing batches like I did...if it's flashing move the scan item away firm the feed area also make sure after every scan you tap down the previous scan that came out the back...this seemed to be the method..set..scan..tap and insert one after the other...it really was a scanning monster for us...oh I also had to scan the backs of 80% of those photos to get the writing description  on them. ..so just rapidly grab the photo as it comes thru then flip it and re insert. ...ok...now it was time to transfer to the computer. .method one..very quick..just open the folder of the doxie on the left side of the Explorer window and drag to your desktop and push the control button..a plus sign will pop up on it and that means copy it there...this is quick...method two...use the doxie software...ugggg slow damn slow when importing via that software...I recommend they do something about this...it is killing me!...but I got away from the scanner and let it run its course...so that was a break...but if it's plugged into a usb 3.0 this bad boy should transfer like a bat out of hell!... now realize it will NOT hold the more than 3000 pics on board...I did  a transfer every 700 or so...another tip..you don't need completely be to the left side of the in feed slot. ..where ever it takes it..it scans fine...sometimes it will slip or go sideways...just reset the scan item and hand hold or give it a slight push...bottom line this saved us...now our family has every photo that's was in the house in boxes...next week we tackle the garage boxes...oh boy...any questions?...send them..sorry for the book review...hope it helps
5,Awesome product!  Small portable battery or electric.  Love it!
4,After agonizing over the stupid issues on #PrimeDayFail I did get the Doxie Go Plus for $131. The scanner took about 4 hours to charge initially (using the wall charger) and once it's charged I started scanning. I use a Mac and the OSX tool is relatively simple (very barebones) you can make some minor adjustments to the scan but you'll need to export it into JPEG/PNG or PDF if you want to do some major changes. Resolution is set at 300dpi (you can switch to 600dpi by pressing the power button again so it turns orange it'll scan at 600dpi). I made about a dozen scans and while the feeding mechanism took a bit getting used to eventually I've gotten the hang of it and most of the scans had just a small angle on it. The output is OK - sufficient for what I needed which is to scan all the letters bills receipts. I tried the 600dpi on a property tax bill and it took about 2.5 times longer to scan the result was pretty impressive under PDF format but it's an overkill might be good for photos but I don't really have any to test with at this point.As I said on the title: don't expect miracles but this is a very easy to use very easy to store and relatively quick scanner that meets 99% of my needs to archive receipts tax bills letters and important documents; and if I need more I'll use the $10000 all-in-one printing/scanning/fax station at work. I think $131 is a great price but $170+ is probably just above the line. $149.99 for this would have been perfect price point but that's just my opinion. You don't need the wifi feature - in fact it'd be better if it were BT since I think you'd have to switch WiFi connection on your PC to the scanner when downloading (therefore cutting off your internet connection) I may be wrong but popping the SD card in & out is a breeze.
5,I am in the process of (trying) to get family photos together from members scattered across the state.  The Doxie SE WiFi is proving invaluable in making this happen.  I get set up in either a dining room or hotel room and spend hours scanning.  The motorized feed makes this easy. The I download everything to my iPad and then send them to specific folders in Google Photos.  The Doxie software makes this task SO easy…!  The hardest thing was finding extra batteries for the machine.  Fortunately I discovered the battery is the same as used in the Fuji NP-20 camera and you can get quality ones on Amazon for less than $10 each.  Now I have a complete kit with 4 32gb SD cards a USB Charger 10ft cord and several batteries.  Doxie should be in every historians bag!
5,This is my third Doxie.  The first one was a gift for my sister: an earlier version of the Doxie Go Plus w/WiFi.  I used it for an extended period of time to help her scan pictures and found it to be efficient with excellent editing and save options.  To my knowledge she is still using it.Because I liked hers so much we purchased the same Doxie Go Plus (but without WiFi since we didn't really need it). It was also very user-friendly and served our purposes quite well.  I had not used it for over a year when I went to start on going paperless goal.  This time the Doxie would not feed a whole sheet of paper.  I contacted Customer Support after troubleshooting everything I could.  Here is where the quality of this product and company really being to stand out:1. Customer Support responded in a timely manner via email.  The Customer Rep asked appropriate questions and gave a few simple suggestions to try.  After I did so he agreed that the Doxie was not working correctly.  He then sent out at no cost a replacement machine that was the newer model.  We sent the defective machine back to the company (also with free shipping).2. Customer Support followed up to make sure we received the replacement and that everything was working correctly.  They answered questions I had about software and scanning.  The new machine works perfectly and suits our needs very well.3. Customer Support followed up about a week later to make sure everything was still going well.  I had another software question that ended up not being about the Doxie but about my own computer.  Customer Rep still took the time to answer and get me on the right track.Every contact I have had with this company has been professional timely supportive and gracious.  The Doxie is  easy to use and I love the editing possibilities after scans are imported.  I cannot recommend this product ... and the company & people behind ... enough.
4,Fantastic portable scanner. Clear quality on each scan. Be sure to get a case. Only issue I'm having is with the power button but the company is fantastic with their customer service.
5,I have been using Doxie SE to scan my photos and documents. It's easy to use and the scans are of high quality. When I received it the battery did not work. The tech support answered my chats for help immediately. Instead of sending me a replacement battery they sent me a whole new machine! This one worked perfectly. And they checked in with me to be sure I was satisfied. I am!
5,Portability and ease of use are key aspects of this scanner for general purposes. Having only single-side scanning is its biggest weakness. Yet it can readily handle papers with holes (from various types of loose-leaf products) while other scanners specifically tell you to avoid such papers.  Was invaluable for scanning the single-sided 14-holed desk calendar pages used as a journal by a dear departed relative for example.I like the one-button choice of 300 dpi or 600 dpi resolution and the ease of scanning anywhere. Haven't pushed the battery with my uses but it has handled dozens of scans at a time with no problem. Very simple to feed through page after page even though it doesn't have a sheet feeder. Could use a little more of a side guide to help align pages exactly square but overall I'm very happy with this scanner.
5,I have owned this scanner for about two years now. It has traveled the world with me several times over. I use it specifically for scanning receipts for expense reports and to get drawing edits from a site to my coworkers back home. This scanner has worked very well it packs small and is pretty light. I love how many options you have to get the scan as well. You can plug it into a computer get it from the Doxie app get it off of the memory card or connect wirelessly to you computer. The scanner is perfect for my needs.The absolute shining star of this scanner has been the customer service. I have never in my life received such personal customer service. Other companies should take lessons from these guys. I received a few emails from them asking how things were and was asked if I would be willing to take a call for them to ask me about my usage. The person who called was very personable and listened to all of my suggestions and offered me a lot of advise as to how to get the best from my scanner. During the conversation I mentioned that I use it to scan receipts fir work and said I had experienced a few issues with it scanning outside of the receipt giving it a kind of an uneven yellow boarder. He told me that he uses some sheets for scanning pictures when scanning receipts and offered to send me some of them to try. A few days later I received them in the mail along with a $25 gift card for taking the time to talk. I have yet to try the sheets as I just got back out on the road. I’m willing to wager that they work pretty well.For those of you who need a portable scanner and like great customer service absolutely look no further than this company. I can’t recommend them enough.
5,Wow! I needed a lightweight portable quick to scan easy to use scanner that I could use overseas without having to worry about power supply issues. I got this Dixie Go which does everything and more. I never opened the directions as it is that intuitive. I had a quick question about a light and tech support through the chat was brilliant and super helpful. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this scanner. Amazing bang for your buck!
5,We ordered these for our nonprofit organization to help reduce the amount of paper we have in the office. They are exactly what we were looking for. Our team is able to take these scanners to various locations and scan the documents we need without making paper copies. The scanner has also made the process for our stakeholders much easier!
4,Love this thing. Battery lasts a surprisingly long time and it's a decent size and shape (I do wish it was just a tiny bit shorter in height to fit in more places).This is the kind of thing that just about everyone needs. As long as you can feed in a document one sheet at a time and as long as the documents aren't more than 9ish inches wide this is the way to go. It's very inexpensive for the amount of time it saves me. The fact that I can scan a bunch of stuff and not need a computer around is LIFE-CHANGING. It's also very nice looking.Now for the negatives - because there are several but none of this should stop you from ordering.- The feeding of documents is sometimes a little wonky. It will pull stuff in at an angle leading to bad looking scans. You can usually get it to perform properly by PUSHING your paper in and doing so at the LEFT corner.- When it messes up it can create truly bizarre artifacts (stretched text images look like they're under a magnifying glass etc.) This is more just a fact of the technology in use than anything else. Still I'd prefer if it discarded scans that are obviously bad (1 second of a page being pulled out by the user).- Recharging seems to take an astoundingly long time. It's good that the battery lasts though.All in all the only thing I'd improve here is a better feeder system less prone to pulling things in on just one corner. That or a way for the software to automatically correct for the artifacts that this can cause.Well worth owning!!
5,I just upgraded to this Doxie scanner after having my previous Doxie scanner for 9 years.  It is super easy to set up works great for paper documents and photos and the customer service is incredible.  Questions are answered quickly and kindly and they schedule a time to connect if you are having trouble with any part of the set up.  I would highly recommend this product to reduce your paper clutter!
5,The scanner is very simple and easy to use. The customer service company is outstanding. We had a problem setting it up in an instant help to help us. I highly recommend buying this unit
5,Excellent portable scanner and really nice software. Bonus points for the easy hacker compatibility with the JSON api over WiFi. I use it for receipt and various mail scanning and it has yet to fail me. Excellent customer support.Pros:* Rapid pace of scanning; accepts different formats easily with included plastic guide.* Software includes OCR which enables me to scan a year's worth of receipts using OSX or Windows OS search features* Easy stapling feature to combine multiple receipts into a single PDF.* Customer support was responsive at getting me a replacement unit when the mechanical drive system failed.Cons:* Setup for WiFi is a bit clunky. I know it's a weird problem to solve (getting credentials into an embedded device) but a wizard for setup would be nice. Also any optimizations to speed WiFi network joining would be nice -- it seems to take quite some time to go through the joining and DHCP process even when it has credentials for only 1 network in its store.* Battery dies somewhat abruptly; life is usually good enough for a few scanning sessions but there's no indicator short of "low" on the device. Obviously it's running a mechanical drive and a full computer in there in a compact form factor so I don't expect miracles.* Mini USB port: for f*!k's sake this is not 1998. I fail to understand why these are still shipped in modern devices. I have to maintain a separate cable just for this device (well not just but still...)* Joining WiFi takes long enough that I switch to doing something else while I wait. The auto shutoff often kicks in before I remember to go fetch scans on my computer. I think there's an audible alert when the software discovers it on the WiFi network but I have the absent minded professor gene so I don't necessarily fault the product.* Has a maximum length limitation to scan which means on some of my longer receipts it will cut off with the receipt still in the drive. I have to pull out the receipt and scan it in the other direction then rotate and staple both scans together in software. It's a bit of a pain. When I asked Doxie about this they said that it was some sort of architectural data or intentional feature limitation and wasn't going to be addressed. The Doxie Q does fix this but I couldn't for the life of me get a receipt to scan straight.
4,I received this as a Christmas gift from my daughter given I had always talked about trying to organize the many hard copy photos I had kept over the years. This was the perfect solution to organizing and storing them all on my computer. I’ve also used this to scan store and send many documents. It’s extremely easy to use.
5,I ordered the Doxie Go to make document scanning easier. I have a Canon scanner that is great with photos but scanning documents and receipts is far to cumbersome. I use Evernote on my iPad so I also ordered the "iPhone/iPad Sync Kit" so I wouldn't need my computer. The sync kit turned out to be a standard Eye-Fi card which means I don't even need the iPad Eye-Fi can sync directly to Evernote.The setup is easy the initial battery charge is of course an unwelcome three hour wait when I want to play with my new gadget but after that it's almost zero configuration. I had to create a Eye-Fi account and enter my Evernote login and then I just plugged in the card and started scanning.Scanning a lot faster than my old scanner especially since the process is fully automated so I don't have to hook up the scanner start the scanning software place the document under the lid check the settings make a preview select the scanning area do the actual scan and the finally save and handle the resulting file. Now I press the power button and feed the document to the scanner. Done.The scans are jpg files and it's possible to change the quality to suit your needs. I selected the second highest quality and my scans ended up as 650k for an A4 page and 150k for a receipt. No problems for my free Evernote account.The "cute" design is toned down compared to the older doxies so it doesn't really bother me. It's a bit strange to sell office machines using pink hearts and colorful pictures but I guess beige and grey is not for everyone.As a wireless Evernote accessory the Doxie Go exceeded my expectations. The fact that I don't even need a computer (or an iPad) in the scanning process is just fantastic.Fo the next version I would suggest some sort of selector that would allow me to say "this is picture send it to flickr" "this is a document send it to Evernote" and so on. Now everything gets sent to Evernote if I don't change the settings and to do that I must open up the computer.
5,Great scanner and portability!
5,The Doxie Go SE has proved to be the solution for a project I've been avoiding - scanning tons of old family photos. Using a flatbed scanner would take forever and the Doxie handles the scanning and transfer process quite easily. At first I was having less than ideal results as the dark areas of some of these photos didn't include much detail in the scan but Doxie's customer service (very quickly) responded to my inquiry and suggested using editing software such as Lightroom to post-process the scans and coax more detail out of the shadows. Doxie's software includes its own contrast and color adjustment options but you might need LR or similar to get the most out of the scan jpg. That's working well for me and I've quickly made my way through hundreds of images. The scan quality is going to depend on the state of the original photo and some of ours were quite faded and discolored. I scanned a couple of these on a flatbed scanner and compared those to the Doxie scans and they were just about the same.The scanner and software are both very easy to use and their customer support is top-notch. I'm quite happy with the Doxie and relieved to finally have this scanning project underway. It's also been an enjoyable trip down memory lane as I go through the old pictures.
5,I ordered this scanner mostly to scan older family photos and the scanner is perfect for that! I was even able to scan Polaroid photos and other documents that are over 40 years old. It is easy and fast to use (I taught my grandma who is not very tech savvy to scan photos pretty easily). I have not used the Doxie software much as I have used an SD card to put pictures on my computer to store and edit them. However the Doxie software seems easy to use and has some basic editing features built in. The scanner mostly takes care of cropping automatically but I do occasionally need to crop a few photo scans to the actual picture size. The scans are good quality and I am very thankful for the ability to easily and quickly preserve family memories digitally. It isn't as great with darker photos but I find that true of many scanners. The scanner is much better quality and makes scanning way faster than a flat bed scanner on a printer. It was well worth the investment to save family photos and save myself so much time compared to using a flat bed scanner.As for Doxie I have received a few emails from them to offer their support with the product if I needed and I was offered the opportunity to schedule a short call to give feedback to a Product Manager. They seem to really care about their customers and creating a quality product which is quite refreshing. I would definitely recommend this scanner!
5,I've been using the Doxie Go (with WiFi) for awhile now and I have to say I do rather like it. Some would argue that smartphone apps have eliminated the need for a scanner like this but I find the process of getting high-quality scans from my phone to be a bit of a chore (especially with the lighting around my computer desk). The phone still wins for quick scans on-the-go but when it comes time to digitize a folio's worth of paperwork I pull out the Doxie.The Doxie scans pretty long items (only the most egregious paper-abusing receipts don't fully scan so those I just fold) and the quality of the scan itself is great. Some items can be a bit of a pain to scan straight if the edges are folded or damaged in which case I usually just scan it upside down and rotate it later if the bottom half works better (I think there is also a photo cover sheet that they say is ideal for damaged items but I haven't had to try it). Any paper I get that is worth keeping I usually end up scanning with the Doxie and the WiFi makes transferring it to my computer really convenient (especially since I use the new retina MacBook and try to be as wireless as possible).The main item on my wishlist for future Doxies would be duplex scanning which would make it an even more worthwhile alternative to scanning apps and better justify the price tag. Other than that I would like to see it start up a bit faster and starting the Wi-Fi mode is especially slow right now. Not deal breakers but the delays add up if you are using it sporadically (I usually scan a lot in one sitting so it is less of an issue).Also a note for those who buy the carrying case (  Doxie A4 Case (for Doxie Go Doxie Go Plus Doxie Go Wi-Fi & Doxie One)        ): the WiFi button in the back protrudes a bit which isn't really a problem but I've had the Doxie twice start up having forgotten all of its WiFi settings (preventing it from connecting to my home network automatically). Best I can tell putting it in with the "back" facing down may have been the issue as holding the WiFi button for 10 seconds or so will reset those settings. I started putting it in "front" down and haven't had an issue since.
3,As someone wrote here "That is it is not a scanner in the traditional sense where you scan in documents while connected to a computer. There is no checking your document as it comes in and then saving it off somewhere. Doxie Go seems ready to work anytime with out the computer. Just grab a stack of papers and start scanning."Another point of view: "It’s OK as a portable scanner. But it’s pretty slow has no auto sheet feeder and can’t scan both sides of a page at once. So fine for photos and the occasional odd document but not a reasonable substitute for a desktop scanner."I should point out that Apparent has *amazing* customer service. After I registered my Doxie I actually received a handwritten then Doxie-scanned note from an employee. Amazing!But this couldn't make up for the deficiencies in the scanner. I was indeed looking for a small scanner that I could use for scanning documents and photos. It actually works pretty well for documents that are smaller than an 8 1/2 x 11" sheet of paper. But when I tried to scan documents that occupy the entire slot on the scanner I found that it often took several tries even while holding the paper taught and level as instructed.But my biggest disappointment actually stems from the scanner's portability or rather complete independence from a computer. The Apparent employee who congratulated me on my purchase told me that she had used her scanner to scan documents in a *moving car*. That's a wonderful capability but how often does one have such an urgent scanning need? -- besides instead of juggling a scanner in a moving vehicle one could use one of the many document-scanning apps available on a smartphone and then the document would be available for annotation emailing etc which aren't possible on the Doxie. The typical usage scenario (at least for me) is to have the Doxie on a table ready for use when I need to scan. Here's what a typical usage sequence looks like: turn the Doxie on. Wait 15 seconds for it to become ready. Scan the document which may necessitate more than one try. If you want to transfer the document wirelessly you have to press a button on the back of the Doxie (wireless is never enabled by default) and wait another 20-30 seconds for the Doxie to connect to your wireless network. Then launch the Doxie software on your computer and wait 5-10 seconds for the software to find your Doxie (if you don't wait to launch the software until the Doxie is on the network the wait can be considerably longer). You'll have to repeat this tiresome sequence if you want to scan again if more than 5 minutes have elapsed because the Doxie shuts off automatically to save battery -- it actually isn't designed to be used connected to the AC!This shows that the Doxie is not meant to scan and then import immediately afterward -- it's better adapted to users who will scan various documents over a period of time and then import them at some point later.
5,I absolutely love my Doxie Go SE. I bought it back in 2019 but I wanted to finally write a review because of the outstanding customer support I received recently.The Doxie that I originally bought worked great for the time that I used it. Unfortunately when I took it out of storage after a few months to use it again it didn't turn on due to a malfunction. But customer support was incredibly helpful and ended up sending me a new unit that works perfectly.Pros:*It's portable and easy to store away when not in use.*It works incredibly well with documents and photos and the editing software is decent enough.*The battery life is good and the storage space on the memory card is excellent for what it's being used for.*It's easy to use.*EXCELLENT customer serviceCons:*While I like it's size I wish it was just a little bit bigger so I could scan wider documents and photos but this is a minor issue.*I wish I could scan longer documents. The current length is good but it's not possible to scan things like long contracts.*The charging cord could be a bit longer.Overall despite the very minor issues that I've personally had I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. It does its job well. And if it doesn't customer service has your back.
3,I got this to go paperless by scanning everything onto my server for later reference. I've been playing around with it for a couple hours so I will revise this if I learn otherwise...Im using MACOS High Sierra on a 2014 iMac. I configured the scanner to use my home Wifi network and use the macOS import SW. I got the unit onto my net the macOS SW can see it. I'm looking to accomplish this with little thought little human intervention and lots of software smarts and automation.THE GOOD:- I was especially attracted to this solution because it inserts the OCR text results directly into the PDF and the text doc doc contents are fully discoverable and searchable from the macOS finder using either spotlight or the search field on a finder window (or the finder "find" option). I verified this and it works great. This is great! -- No document management SW required except...- I can do the scanning away from my desk because of cordless config with battery (but wireless features oddly tie you to your computer at export).THE BAD:-It does not know how to combine pages from a multipage document into one -- every page is separate. The scanner should have a "next page" button so that multi-page docs can be identified. I know I can merge them later but who has time for that?-It takes several 10s of seconds for the macOS SW to discover the scanner on my net. This needs to happen within a couple secs.-It does not even try to title documents based on OCR content -- the OCR and export are one step and it saves docs with all the same name with date times or serialization. It would be better if it used a little bit of AI to gab a title from the OCR.-Even though I can scan away from my desk oddly enough document movement across the net to the computer must be initiated from the computer. The unit would be better if it completely initiated and completed the transfer while I'm away from my desk.More to come as I try to scan a lot of docs.
5,Over time I have had various paperwork build up until I found myself facing a cluttered mess that was hard to organize and track. I decided to order a scanner to digitally backup and then get rid of my paperwork. After researching various models I decided to go with the Doxie Go SE and I'm very happy I did. I had to order directly from Doxie's website as Amazon could not ship to my location but I wanted to leave a review as I found the scanner through Amazon.The scanner is portable has intuitively designed features and is easy to setup and use right out of the box. The accompanying software is easy to use and works great for importing all your scans directly off the SD card where you can then combine the scans and save them to the cloud or as a local file. Their technical support and customer service teams are excellent - very responsive and quick to support with any requests.Overall the Doxie Go SE has worked great for my scanning needs and I would highly recommend it to anyone who was like me and wary about some of the other scanners on the market. Doxie has figured out how to make a great scanner that does exactly what you need without being difficult to use.
5,We love our Doxie Go! It has streamlined the process of scanning and digitizing our bills receipts and other correspondence to such an extent that we're almost ready to go complete paperless at home.It is extremely easy to set up and  works exactly as advertised. The software (we have the Mac version) is user-friendly and simple to operate. It took me a couple of tries to understand the workflow but once you have that down it is a breeze to scan and save files.The scanner itself is built pretty well and it looks like attention has been paid to quality. As long as you have a relatively flat surface scanning itself is an easy process. There a couple of items I'd like to see fixed however:- The little adjustable guide seems a little flimsy. It works fine right now bur am afraid it may fall apart if not handled very carefully- It would be nice to have size guides (perhaps in inches) so the guide can be adjusted easily. (I've had problems with the scanner grabbing at the paper when I place it near the entrance with the intent of adjusting the guide)- I have had some trouble scanning pages that are taller than 11 inches although I must admit I've not really experimented with all possibilitiesI love the way that incremental software updates have actually added new value to the overall experience. The most recent update added OCR capabilities and although it increased the processing time and file size it allows one to (optionally) save a fully text-searchable PDF - this is very handy indeed when coupled with the indexing capabilities of Spotlight.One other small gripe is that it seems to take a longer-than-expected time to recharge but this may be a case of resetting my expectations. I'm assuming that the Doxie can be charged with a normal USB charger (like the one that comes with my iPad) instead of needing to be connected to my computer's USB port.Doxie's Customer Service is excellent and they've always responded with well-thought-out and personal messages within 24 hours of my emailing them. Given that everything works well (as advertised) I've not really needed any kind of urgent support - they were mostly questions about peripherals.A couple of things I'd like to see included:- A micro-usb port (instead of mini USB) - this will allow me to use my phone chargers- Built-in WiFi (although the recently announced EyeFi compatibility takes care of this)If you are looking for a compact portable and multi-purpose scanner Doxie is definitely the way to Go (pun intended). I should point out that I've not really tested out the photo scanning capabilities of Doxie but hope to eventually (on my long list of things to do is digital archiving of photos).
5,Great customer support
5,I am so happy with my Doxie. It's fast and easy to use and is making digitizing my photos a breeze. It's also great with receipts I want to keep or other paperwork. The app for my computer has some tools to adjust in case I didn't like the document up properly or want to adjust the brightness of the photo. You won't have a full suite of Photoshop tools but it's enough for a quick correction. Photo quality scans are 600 dpi which is enough for my needs. I can finally get rid of all those shoeboxes. You couldn't ask for better service from the support team either. A few months after purchasing my Doxie wouldn't turn on. I went to their website for troubleshooting guidance and after trying everything suggested without any luck I contacted their customer service. They walked me through a few more steps and identified the problem as a defective battery. Within a couple days I received a new battery from the company and they checked in to make sure everything was working properly. I highly recommend this product more so because of the customer service.
3,This opinion is about Doxie Go Plus (DX220) - I have recently come to acquire a bulk of approx. 5000 photos that needed scanning at an archival 600dpi. Having much experience with scanning on flat bed scanner I thought of getting Doxie to do 99% percent of the job for me (feeding scanning croping saving) leaving 1% to me (renaming and filing in proper folder).Before fully-committing to this device I ran some comparison tests with a flat bed scanner to see whether Doxie was in fact the quality of scan I needed. The results came out disappointing --- I scanned two photos at optical 600dpi resolution. One photo with high contrast brights and one with dark shades to see how Doxie handles range of contrast gamma and saturation.The flat-bed scanner delivered full array of shades between whites and blacks natural saturation and contrast. I proved more prone to dust specks that got in between photo-glass.Doxie (Go Plus DX220) delievered highly-compressed (artifacts at crucial areas of the photos like sharp lines shiny reflections jewelry) over-contrast balance and over-saturated colors. It did provide a dust-free scan but half-kilobyte size of the file produced by flat-bed method.In my opinion Doxie is a wonderful scanner for document scanning (as the name on packaging suggests) - perfect for scanning forms legal documents and newspaper articles - but I would not use this device for scanning photos especially archival images used for enlarging retouching and/or reprinting.Eventhough it would have saved me much time in scanning I will have to revert back to my flat-bed scanning 4-photos at a time.
5,I never expected to be so happy with a scanner or actually find a scanner to be cute in a way! The packaging is really nice the scanner is nice as well as sorta cute the software is great the team welcome email to me was so friendly and personal seeming it's super cool that the Doxie usage instructions come laminated which is a care feature that I've never seen another company bother to do for their customer and I'm just so super happy with my purchase!Doxie has such a simple program that's so easy to use straightforward & has great features like the ability to staple & save in multiple formats including pdf jpeg google drive ability to send files etc! More options than I expected. The scanner can be plugged into your computer to upload photos & charge it or you can use it on its own then pop out the SD card & into your computer later! I've used Doxie with the Mac version of the software but my boyfriend enjoys using the PC version as well & hasn't seemed to have any issues. It scans great you just need to make sure papers go through straight when you feed it. Though the program features the ability to crop & rotate as well as work with lighting & contrast so if it doesn't go straight then docs don't necessarily need to be rescanned.Documents seem to scan great! For the most part photos scan alright but could definitely scan better. I ended up taking many of my photos to scan onto a CD at Walmart instead in order to get the photos digitized easier & with a little bit better quality.Tl;dr This scanner is so cute & functional the company has the best customer service ever & in my opinion is WELL worth the money!
5,I've been paperless for "a while"--3 or 4 years--and love the lack of clutter and the ability to access documents. But this year my scanning fell to near zero as I rarely bring my laptop home from my studio relying instead on an iPad. I got the Doxie Go to help me keep more current with my digital files. I unpacked the Doxie Go today scanned away and tried out the software on my laptop and then set it up to send scans wirelessly to my iPad with an Eye-Fi card.Here's what I love about the scanner:1. It's tiny. I thought my portable Scansnap was small but this is unbelievably small!2. I adore being able to scan without being connected to my laptop. You can use the internal storage ior scan to an SD card or Flash drive. It's so convenient to be able to set this scanner anywhere to scan instead of being tethered to a computer with a USB cable. You can then upload to your computer at your leisure.3. The Doxie software (Mac) has a clean interface and is a pleasure to use. I love that you can adjust the scans and OCR right in that software and can save to a variety of Cloud and non-Cloud locations and in common file formats (PDF JPG PNG).4. It has a power adapter so I can scan without worrying about the battery running down. And there is a full set of global adapters!5. Last but not least the wireless transfer to my iPad means I can scan at home and that means I can keep current on my scanning more easily.I bought the 4GB Eye-Fi X2 card and scan wirelessly to my iPad (scans go to the Camera Roll and from there can be sent to Dropbox etc). You need a computer to do the initial Eye-Fi card setup and need to the free Eye-Fi iOS app. I found the iOS setup process "unintuitive" and had to use the step-by-step  Eye-Fi support [...] (for example you need to set up Doxie's direct network before you add your own wireless one). But once configured you scan to the EyeFi card and the scans appear like magic in your Camera Roll.As for scan quality you can set the quality for PDFs and JPGs separately in the Doxie app settings. I think the scan quality is terrific. As for speed I generally scan one page items so feeding it page by page is not any slower than using my portable Scansnap. I especially appreciate that I can clean up a scan if I need to (rotate/crop/adjust contrast) right in the Doxie software.
5,This company contacted me (I set the schedule) to see if I had any problems in the setting up and use the scanner. The unit is so very easy to set up. By design it's very compact and self contained. It will allow you to take a box of pictures with you while you are sitting in the yard or watching tv or anywhere you want to put all your old  family picture in one spot(for sharing with friends and family) also it works great on keeping all your papers together for Tax time. You can use it to copy your medical papers and even a picture of your winning lottery ticket :). I think once you start using it you will be hooked. I know I am :)
5,I bought this in 2014 and still use it.  It was a great purchase!  I recently lost my power cord and contacted Doxie for a replacement.  Within a few days I heard back from them and they sent me a new one.  It works perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  Thanks Doxie!
5,This scanner is FANTASTIC as is the customer service for the company.  Scanner is very easy to use and set up.  Would definitely recommend this scanner.
5,Pretty easy to use straight out of the box. The scanner works really well  I had a few questions and Doxie Customer Service was extremely responsive and actually made an appointment to call me not only once but twice. C/S was super knowledgeable and friendly and answered my questions and offered some helpful tips which made sense. Highly recommend!
4,I had the prior model (a Doxie Go) and got this one as an upgrade. In terms of function it is best in class. One baffling thing however is how the engineers decided to indicate the 300 dpi vs 600 dpi setting. As I am red/green colorblind I have to ask my wife which one is active.It would have made more sense to make this a physical toggle or at least use blink patterns as an indicator. As it is I am either not getting the quality scans I wanted or wasting disk space on simple scans because I can't independently use one of the scanner's settings.Does Apparent not employ at least one colorblind staffer?
4,Really am enjoying the new Doxie scanner.  My only complaint is it only scans one document at a time.  Would love multi page support but its still easier then the alternative.
5,Reliable conveniently transportable and extremely user friendly (says this boomer👵🏻) and I thought it reasonably priced👍... easily  getting my photo albums digitized and organized!
5,I have owned Doxie scanners since they first came out the GO SE is the best one so far. They continue to make improvements each and every generation that's worth the upgrade. I have three other scanners connected to my PC - this is my daily user for all purpose items. It's even good enough for photos which is nice to bring over to family member's houses to scan older family photos for preservation.
4,I bought the Doxie Go (not Go SE) November 2014 and it worked great until just recently when the feeder started slipping.  Text started looking elongated and now it always feeds crooked (like there's more pressure on one side than the other) so it is pretty useless.  I don't have many other devices that lasted this long so still a good investment.I'm just going to use Adobe Scan on my phone for scanning documents instead of buying a new one... but I would buy again otherwise.
5,I purchased my Doxie SE scanner in November 2020 and have been extremely pleased with the product. The size and portability are exactly as advertised the scan quality is great (I'm using for photographs) and the customer support has been outstanding. I was so happy with the product that I bought one for my sister and recommended to a friend. I also did a good deal of research first to see which scanner met my needs. I connect the Doxie to a Mac and compatibility is not an issue.
5,I bought my original Doxie a couple of years ago when I started my own business working from home.  The device itself is very much worth the cost.  It is portable and convenient for scanning things as they come in.  I use it for mail and receipts mostly plus the odd thing here and there like old photos and recipes.  Obviously it isn't great for huge volumes of paper but it's small profile and easy of use is great.  The scan quality is great and the options for saving in the software are nice (jpg png pdf and several OCR options).I was prompted to give this stellar review because my original Doxie started to fail because of some problem with the insertion mechanism (it started feeding skewed for some reason).  I contacted Doxie support and they ended up sending me a completely new replacement in exchange for my old one.  It was not like pulling teeth and they stood by their product.  I was very impressed and happy about the service.  10/10 would buy again (and will I'm sure)!
4,For the price this product is the real deal. I've been able to scan multiple receipts photos important documents and multiple other documents. The scan quality is much better than I previously would have imagined I thought because this is a portable scanner that I would sacrifice a lot on quality and gained more by convenience and ease-of-use. This Doxie go SE is the best of both worlds if you want quality scans and one of the better applications for a product then this is the product for you.
5,The Doxie Go SE is a great scanner for quick jobs.  It can do the job of a large desk top scanner without taking up a huge amounts of space.  High-Quality scans on documents and ease of use make this an excellent purchase for your scanning needs.
5,This company has amazing customer support. The battery on the original Doxie Go (not Doxie Go SE) I purchased several years ago started swelling and I contacted them to see if I could purchase a replacement part. Instead I ended up with a brand new (upgraded) replacement!The Doxie Go SE is a solid improvement on the original which fills a niche I find very useful. It scans faster than a flat-bed but is more affordable and takes up less space than a desktop sheet-feed. The included software while a little clunky handles things well enough that I was disappointed to find I could not import generic JPEG files into it.Some improvements over the old model include a micro USB port for charging & transfer (rather than mini USB) the scans default to the SD card rather than internal memory (the new model saves things to the card fast enough to maintain a steady flow of documents; 8GB SD card is included) the ability to flip open the scanner and directly clean the scanning strip and most importantly an easily accessible rechargeable battery compartment.
5,The Doxie Go is fantastic if you find that like me you have boxes upon boxes of printed photos from the pre-digital age that you would like to digitize to bring them into the modern age of photo storage. This is the ONLY reason I purchased this as I already have a document scanner so this is dedicated to photo scanning of our photos from the days of "It's time to develop another roll of film!"Now if you are a purist this would certainly NOT be for you. If you want the highest QUALITY scans you need to use a flatbed scanner OR send your pictures away to have them professionally scanned. This device gets the job done in a timely manner at an affordable price and provides certainly very acceptable results. I finally choose to scan my pictures EFFICIENTLY knowing I would give up some quality but at least I would get it DONE after a long period of procrastination knowing these types of portable scanners will not produce optimum results. For me it was "I'd like to get one of these portable scanners BUT I know the results won't be perfect BUT I'm not going to sit at a flatbed scanner for 10 YEARS scanning these individually..." so I was stuck in the "Do Nothing" rut. I can say I'm VERY happy to finally be getting this done and really like the results I am getting with this device.This device is very portable is battery operated and rechargeable can scan without being connected to a computer and holds a LOT of photos in the internal memory (it has 477 Mb of usable internal storage).Be aware of a few things: when you turn it on the DEFAULT is 300 dpi (dots per inch). With a 4x6 photo I get 1776 (horizontal) x 1232 (vertical) pixels. Scans at this resolution are FAST. If you are scanning photos for archiving you DEFINITELY want the highest scan resolution and with this unit it is 600 dpi so you must press the power button after it is powered on and see the green LED change to orange. You MUST do this each time you power up the unit...don't forget...so you get the best resolution the unit has to offer. That same 4x6 photo scanned at 600 dpi got me 3568 (horizontal) x 2448 (vertical) pixels. It is MUCH slower but gives you a much better result so yea I wish this was the default but not a biggie if you remember to set this each time you use this.The images are stored internally onto an SD card or even USB flash drive so this has lots of options for storage.The software it comes with is well it is okay...but it isn't the best. You can just drag and drop the photos off the memory. The software allows you to make adjustments to each picture. I actually find this useful due to feeding issues (more on that in a sec). I try to avoid tweaking the contrast saturation etc...of the images since that is best done with software designed really designed for that and there are a lot of options there. For the average person the raw scans should prove to be quite acceptable.When you feed a photo into the scan you try to keep it flush to the left; however I find it will "catch" quite often and you have to get a feel for just how to start the feed. I'm not sure what it is actually catching on but don't think it is defective. If you start the scan correctly it will pull it through just fine. If you try to "fix" it once it starts feeding you will skew the scan so once it is on its way just let it go. I have found it works best to push the picture into the unit holding the photo just ever so slightly to the RIGHT of the left edge then promptly push it left and let the machine pull it through. There is also a sliding device to help guide the pictures into the unit. The Doxie Go Plus is stated to have "improved feeding" so I'm just guessing the folks at Doxie have made the newest unit a little more feeder-friendly. It really isn't that bad but something you do need to be aware of.The provided software does have a quirk whereby it will try to straighten a crooked scan and sometimes miss and be FAR off the mark. I find it will randomly skew a straight scan (note that the image in the memory is NOT skewed this is a function of the software). It is easy to fix...just drag the slider until it is 0.0 and you are fine. Perhaps it would be best to turn that off. I still prefer to use the software to make SLIGHT adjustments (such as the skew) and slight cropping just to avoid a black line along an edge that is an artifact of the scanning. Yes you CAN just accept the raw scans but I do find if you take a few minutes to check each photo you WILL get the best results. Note in the newer unit this might be improved such that individual proofing and adjusting might no longer be needed.Keep it clean and dry avoid dirty environments and understand this will not give you "picture perfect" scans but WILL get you a VERY nice scan in an efficient manner giving you freedom to take this with you anywhere or scan while watching TV or just relaxing...no need to be at a computer. If you just want to FINALLY scan your old photos THIS is a great tool for the job. Perfectionists...keep on procrastinating OR get a flatbed scanner and realize you will be taking a LOT more time per scan for that optimal result.Cheers!
5,I bought my original Doxie scanner ~8 years ago when I had a travelling job. Now retired but active both at home and with volunteer work I find my Doxie scanner an indispensable part of my "kit". Receipts business cards photos documents of all kinds... In combination with Evernote I retain very little paper- it all goes to the cloud. Often I am in a meeting when I would like a copy of a paper document at the table but there is no copier at hand so I pull out the Doxie and scan it. The software works great and is easy to use and the result is a high quality scan much better than trying to snap an image with my phone. A special mention regarding their customer service: Exceptional! These folks are incredibly available and helpful.
5,This is my third Doxie product any my favorite. I am trying to be as paper free as possible with a business home papers and school treasures. The paper is endless. I have scanners on my phone my printer a fancy bulk sheet feeder and a prosumer flatbed for genealogy originals. The one I reach for the most is my Doxie Go SE. My favorite new feature is LONG RECEIPTS. Even if you trim the junk at the end of register receipts they are often way too long for various scanners. My Doxie laps them up. It's easy to tote so I bring it along whenever we are headed to a relative's house switch on the higher-resolution scanning and feed photos letters and recipes through the scanner. I am sure I'm capturing things that would get away from us. You don't need a computer with you to scan and it has a long-lasting battery. So I just feed the scanner and transfer over when I'm at my computer. It's fast very good quality and I don't have to get out a manual every time I use the thing to figure out how I made it work before. It only has two buttons! I am making a dent in our paper mountains. Don't scan staples (duh) or crayon drawings but pretty much every other sheet works well for me. Also the build is really solid. I still don't want to drop it on the ground but it's not flimsy. The software is simple to operate you can edit if you want and it has a user-friendly interface and reminds you what you've already saved.
4,i am still waiting for customer support to call me back.  There is no phone number so i dont know why feedback raves about their customer support?  The wireless sync is confusing and only works sometimes i am not sure if i got a defective one because every time i go back to use it its disconnected.  i wish it would work i plugged the usb in and it still is not recognized.  i am pissed because i bought it on prime day and i could have gotten the regular one without wifi.Update someone called me back and worked through the instructions and it works great now
5,I was looking for a scanner I could find that I could take with me in luggage since I'm mobile these days. This fit the bill perfectly--easy to set up intuitive functionality high-quality scans good software USB or WiFi connection lightweight but doesn't feel chintzy. I've only had a couple minor issues: it's a bit difficult for the software to recognize strips of paper below the top left corners of stapled papers that often get ripped off or any other frayed/irregularly shaped paper. You can adjust the cropping though which fixes the issue. Also sometimes the software doesn't totally get the rotation correction right when you scan at an angle.After purchasing the scanner I registered it on the Doxie website and had the head of product management reach out to me personally to set up a call to get my thoughts on it. He was extremely friendly and is sending me some sheets that will help fix the issue I had with scanning irregular paper above. Love companies that really care about their products and customer experience.
4,Being in the uk I had to order this directly from apparent as it's not available on amazon.co.uk but here's my quick review anyway..The scanner itself works fine and is helping me to achieve my goal of being at least paperless downstairs in my house.. I use this in conjunction with Evernote on both the pc and my iPad with the standard apple connection kit.The recharge time if doing it overnight is fine it's a pain if you're in the middle of back scanning a load of old paperwork.  Reverted to my Allin one printer in the end.. Now I've got that out of the way the ad hoc scanning of post means this is less of an issue. The actual scanning process couldn't be easier turn it on feed the paper in and done...My biggest bugbear is the import time using the doxie software on a pc. I now only use it if I have more than a couple of pages that I want to staple together as a PDF otherwise I just find it too slow. Despite the documentation saying it's quicker to use an sd card rather than plug in the scanner I saw no real difference in speeds.One nice feature in the software for use Evernote users is to title the PDF with the right tags for it go into the right notebook and tagged correctly. Big tick there!I think once the software goes through a few more updates it'll be five stars.
2,I bought this device because after reading about it online and visiting the manufacturer's website I was convinced that this was the end-all end-all of scanners. I was sadly mistaken.Here are the problems:1 - It needs to be charged first (took about 2 hours). This is such a buzz kill as I was excited to use it for the first time so now I am already slightly annoyed but that's fine. Maybe they don't want batteries leaking inside the box.2 - They acted like the additional Wi-Fi feature was their own and that it's built into the hardware but it's actually a separate company which sells a separate SD card that you need to insert (and also set up). So now I have 2 separate pieces of software to use and 2 separate pieces of hardware to set up.3 - The paper gets crooked ALOT. I try so hard to slide it in straight but 99% of my scans are crooked and 80% of the time the paper gets jammed and I have to start all over again. The plastic alignment slider is also USELESS - it doesn't help. The hardware needs to be improved. They need to develop software that automatically adjusts crooked scans or create better hardware that prevents crooked scans from happening or both. (And the whole time I am asking myself why this device costs $200+)4 - There is almost always black space in the scanned image even If I follow instructions to avoid this.5 - It doesn't scan long receipts. Ever been to the grocery store? Yeah those receipts can get long. But now I'm learning that Doxie can only scan up to 12 inches or "it may stop working" as posted on their website. This also is not posted on the website before purchasing the product it's only in the online manual.6 - The battery died in about 30 minutes. I'm now getting more frustrated - Isn't this made to be portable? Why the short battery life? This is a major flaw. So I now plug it into my computer in order to continue scanning...7 - Now if I scan while plugged into my computer it gets disconnected during scans and keeps getting reconnected after with annoying pop-up warning messages on my screen. I look at the manual again and read that the company even warns not to do this. REALLY!? Ok now I'm officially pissed off. And if you're reading this and don't understand why it is because Apparent (Doxie's manufacturer) did not hire good programmers to make their software. If I'm wrong then the hardware needs to be improved. Either way this is absurd and a complete deal breaker for me.8 - Luckily I bought the "worldwide charging kit" so I plugged the other power cable into the wall socket. I started scanning again but the device randomly shut off. So Now I cannot scan until the device is fully charged only for this cycle to repeat itself all over again.I am so frustrated with this product and am so disappointed.If you're wondering why customers gave this product good reviews it is probably because of these reasons:- They wrote the review too soon before using the product long enough to experience flaws.- They were too lazy to go back and change their review.- They let branding good visual design and marketing get in the way of their opinions. (Device looks amazing and website also is well done.)- They let buzz or cool factor brainwash them. (If everyone else online loves it then it must be good.)Reasons why bloggers didn't give it bad reviews and hold their mouths:- They want more free stuff to get sent to them.- They want more visitors and positivity attracts them.- They want more ad revenue.What is Apparent going to do for me? For everyone?
4,This is a great time-saving easy to use low profile portable scanner that make scanning and storing scans easy.  The software is simple to use and wonderful for organizing.  I would give it 4.5 stars only a 1/2 star down as I think for the price it should include wireless computer/cloud connection even on the base model.
5,We love our Doxie. Works off Wifi and super portable. Having peace of mind knowing that our photos are backed up is a great bonus. Add the traveling case to your order too!
4,Bought this from the actual company itself. This device is amazing. Only negative flaw is there only targeting iPhone users. There is currently no  say to connect the device via Android. So all android users will have to make extra effort to connect to doxie. Other than that it's a great device. My vote is based as a heavy andriod user.Edit: company has amazing customer service changed my
5,Really impressed with product and this small company’s efforts to provide great support. Scanned over 1000 pages so far it’s been a seamless process.
5,I love the portability ease of use and the personal follow up from more than one employee to see if everything was working to my liking and to check in.
4,Great little scanner performs like the big guys while taking up 95% less space. Scan documents photos etc anywhere you want and then save them to your computer via Wi-Fi or the included USB cable. Holds appx 600 documents before you even need to send them to your computer.The app effortlessly guides you through that process. Great for going paperless. The only reason I did not give the fourth star is for the occasional misfeed when starting a scan but this is not a constant  problem.
4,I’ve been using this product for about a month and I love it! I bought it to scan in the random paperwork that comes across my desk at work. The software is easy to use the images scan in clearly. I really have no complaints.
4,It performs exactly as they say so I can't fault the product. Well done to Doxie!Now they need to include a small human assistant in the box so that I can become even more organized / lazy.
4,This product is excellent quality if use it to scan pictures and forms. When purchased I didn’t see anywhere mentioned that unable to use  it with different programs than Doxie’s.
4,Great product!! Big fan of Doxie products. Only problem is occasional problems importing scans via Wi-Fi and sometimes SD card is rejected and needs to be reinserted. Otherwise I recommend it!
4,Product was as described and instructions were easy to follow. Did not require tech support so far. It is lightweight and portable which is what I was looking for.
5,Tech support is fantastic a small but personable company that really works with you as an individual. I only needed them because I am a tinkerer and messed with the battery but was able to fix the problem working with them easily. It has been a huge help for clearing up documents and keeping everything more secure saved offline and in one location rather than a box of files loose in the house. They also offer a Wi-Fi doxy-go version for those who want to upload wirelessly to a computer.
4,Works well. Easy to travel. Charge time can be an issue otherwise I am pleased with it. Good experience with Doxie.
5,With all the fires in northern California  it allows me to put my mind at ease  backing up everything important knowing if I lose my home I haven't lost my memories and important files.
4,I like this product.  Only issue is the lack of ease of the Wi-Fi but still getting used to it.
5,The scanner is everything it claims to be. It is great for my purposes...organizing the paper clutter. The only issue I had was attempting to purchase the item from Amazon. For whatever Amazon was not able to ship to my location. I live in suburban Chicago...not someplace unheard of and hard to get to. I tried having Amazon ship to a close by pick up point...they could not ship to a pick up point either.I wound up purchasing the item from another online store who had no problem shipping the item to my home. I almost purchased a different scanner from Amazon just to avoid having to search for the Doxie elsewhere. I am soooo glad I did not buy a different scanner. The Doxie is terrific! I just could not get it through Amazon.
5,Like:- No computer needed- Compatible with iPhone and iPad via camera connector- Good design- Very portable- Corrects alignment when I put in a page slightly crooked.- Integration with Evernote Dropbox and Facebook (why are you sending scans to Facebook?)Do not like:- No OCR (though I hear it is coming soon)- Wish the battery lasted longerI really like the Doxie Go for what it is.  That is it is not a scanner in the traditional sense where you scan in documents while connected to a computer.  There is no checking your document as it comes in and then saving it off somewhere.  Doxie Go seems ready to work anytime with out the computer.  Just grab a stack of papers and start scanning.So far I have been able to move a small mountain of paper through it and on to the hard drive of my computer clearing out some clutter while not worrying that I'm throwing away something of importance.
5,I owned an original Doxie ten years until Apple finally updated its protocols and it no longer worked. Doxie helped get me into this new model which is even easier to use and gives really high quality scans. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,I LOVE MY DOXIE! I honestly purchased it because I saw the great reviews and thought it was cute. I didn't think it would be think great a work horse. It's been a phenomenal tool for my everyday use. My kid used it for submitting school work when classes went viral due to COVID. It helped me handled my parents affairs since they are NOT tech savvy and keep a lot of papers. And since I run a small business from home it's instrumental in organizing my inventory. I love this little gadget! It's awesome!
5,Doxie scanner is an easy and efficient way to scan documents. The product hardware and software are easy to use and give you the control you need over your documents. The quick-start guide included with the scanner really helps you get going with the device as soon as you open the box. Its easy to scan in all your documents at once and then figure out what format to export later using the included software. Note: this scanner works great with documents but probably not the right product if you're looking for advanced photo or negative scanning functionality. Highly recommend this portable easy to use scanner for your document scanning needs.
5,I received this model as a replacement for a unit that had been discontinued. The previous version was not feeding properly so I sent an email to Doxie asking for help. The response I got was fast and stated "we can see there is a feed motor issue and we would like to send you a replacement unit". They did so right away and asked me to use the preprinted label to send the old one back to them. This is the definition of top notch customer service. I highly recommend Doxie!
5,I owned the original Doxie for 8 years with no issues until it became obsolete and no longer compatible with my newer laptop. The newer Doxie is totally worth the upgrade! I love it. It's so easy to scan and there are 3 different ways to connect to your computer USB WiFi and SD card. I export all of my files to Evernote so my filing cabinet is totally virtual.Customer service has been excellent. If your device is obsolete you can get a discount towards a new one. Just remember to save your receipt/order information! Better yet scan it ;)
4,Slow in scanning. Can only scan one/single side
5,I found that I'd put off scanning health bills and important tax stuff etc because my traditional scanner on top of my printer was slow and tedious to use for more than a page or two at a time.Been very happy and impressed with the Doxie hardware and software. Customer service is excellent setup was a breeze Mac app works very effectively with awesome out-of-the-box support for OCR pdfs etc.I like that I don't have to have it plugged in in order to scan documents. You can sit by the tv and scan a bunch of papers then bring it to your computer for importing in one step.Very satisfied.
4,I liked the ease of use. At times it's construction felt weak.
5,Doxie is easy to use and solves my scanning problem when traveling.The carrying case is also perfect for traveling.
5,What a simple yet effective product! It is easy to use with a single button for turn on/off and switching between resolutions portability and battery life that are fantastic and effective and a helpful software to organize your scans. The OCR works well with various typewritten fonts (I need to scan my work from my typewriters) and it has a nice and sleek design as well. The Doxie team is helpful and personable definitely not like talking to a robot. They were receptive to a suggestion I had and have a great and simple product that works.
5,First off the Customer Service for Doxie products are amazing.  They are quick to respond and help you with any issues or questions you may have.  I have had a Doxie Go for several years now.  I started with the Original and it survived 4 years of document scanning for work (and home) purposes before I ran into feeder issues.  Customer Service helped me replace the old with the newer SE and so far I am really happy with the product.  A little different from the original but it seems to be for the better.  I highly recommend this product for on-the-go scanning because you do not need your computer to do the work.  The app is really nice to work with on your PC/Mac with features many scanning software lack.  Simple and straightforward all across the board with the scanner and the software.  I don't have anything bad to say so far.
5,I really like this little scanner. It has some basic features. Good lower resolution and reasonable higher resolution scanning features. Good for documents OCR and artwork of a smaller scale. It seems to scan colors reasonably accurately. I have yet to jam it while feeding.Worked with easy set up. The software is good but basic. Good enough to scan and move to another program for editing or correcting. Very portable and comes with a nice case. This is really a no-fuss option that is reasonably priced. Customer support is excellent. I would buy another.
5,Recently upgraded from the original Doxie Go after 7 years of use. I was up and running within minutes of opening the box. Go SE seems to be faster at scanning and it seems quality of the scan slightly better comparing to the original Go.  Otherwise my workflow did not change. Very happy with this scanner. Recommend!
5,I had been on the search for a portable scanner for both photos & documents for a long while. The price compatibility and nice appearance of this one caught my eye. I bought it & very glad I did. It has made cleaning up boxes of paperwork almost fun! I reached out to customer service with a question about the scanner & was so impressed with their quick response & personable service. It's rare to find that nowadays. Will certainly recommend this product & have absolutely no regrets about purchasing.
5,The Doxie scanner is honestly one of the most useful Christmas gifts I've ever received. Between my husband and me we had multiple filing cabinets stuffed with papers. It took a while but having scanned everything and uploaded it to an external hard drive we are now almost paper free (with the exception of personal identification documents and tax returns). The scanner has held up for two years so far and is still going strong. I'm not tech savvy at all but this is very easy to use. It's also handy that it can store scanned documents (I'm not sure how many) until you're able to upload them in case you don't have a computer on hand. I also love the sleek minimalistic look. Their customer service is also fantastic. Highly recommend. This is a great investment especially if you're looking to declutter or downsize.
5,I purchased my scanner in Sept. 2018.  Long story about it not being used but with the Corona-Virus "shelter in place" I pulled it off the shelf to use.  I couldn't get it to feed paper - after a couple of emails back & forth with Doxie they are replacing the unit.  THANK YOU SO MUCH TO DOXIE.  Everybody was very pleasant & kind & helpful - tried walking me thru all kinds of problem solving solutions.  OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!
5,This scanner will surprise you at how easy and fun it is to back up your photos or documents. The setup is very easy and the directions couldnt be more simple. I highly recommend this scanner if you need something that doesnt take up a lot of room and is very light to take a long with your travels. Very happy I purchased this for our travels and future minimalist ways.
5,Using to scan documents to the office instead of faxing. Because of the pandemic I’m not able to visit my clients in person. I’m able to scan the documents quickly (12 pages in a minute or less) and efficiently. Be sure to download app for Windows or iOS. You can adjust the contrast merge files save etc. So happy with this scanner. No longer feels like a chore. Plus customer service is A1.
3,I have used Doxie products for years and have had the Doxie Go WiFi for over a year. The simplicity of having this work via wifi made it very enticing. The problem is that probably to allow for greater time between charges this device does a much worse job of pulling my papers through fully. I often have to try two or three times for each page. Any roughness the slightest wrinkle or tear and it just doesn't go through well. Plus even after several cleanings it sometimes doesn't pull the page fully through. I "help it" manually but this often results in blurry images.I loved my old Doxie (which didn't have this problem) and I love the concept of the Doxie Go WiFi (it does hold a charge for many scans is portable and the wifi option is absolutely helpful.)My number one wish would be a Doxie Go Plus WiFi-type product that was connected to wifi did a better job of pulling paper through and could scan both sides of the page.... Ah to dream....
5,I owned the predecessor model to the Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi and used it regularly for three years without experiencing any scanner problems.  Recently the scanner started making noise and jamming and I contacted Doxie customer service to inquire as to how I could get the scanner repaired. To my pleasant surprise they told me they would ship me a new scanner without charge and also e-mail me a UPS shipping label to return the old scanner to them. Shortly thereafter I received the new scanner.  What outstanding customer service and what a great product!M. Brown
5,I've had this scanner for about 6 or so years now and it still keeps chugging away. Scanning my receipts and paper records to an SD Card and then loading them onto my computer couldn't be much easier. The downloadable software for importing the scans is simple and has just the features needed to get you going.  There are other models with wi-fi (for direct uploading of files rather than using the internal device storage or SD/flashdrives) if that is your thing. This is a quick simple and effective device for going paperless. Top notch!
5,This scans much faster than the original Doxie scanner. I appreciate the adjustable guidelines for different document sizes.
5,This is an outstanding product.  I ordered this for one of my jobs (at the recommendation of our tech advisor) and within a couple weeks ordered one for my other job.  In both places we are now going paperless (meaning no longer filing/storing files) because of the convenience of this product. Not only is it saving me time filing and file storage space but I can reuse the same file folders every year.  The ease with which it scans receipts and other odd sized documents (too frustrating on a flatbed scanner to even bother) made this possible. Then once imported being able to staple documents together however I need them before it becomes a pdf is fabulous.  I also love its memory so if I have to go dig in storage to find something from our pre-paperless days I can take the Doxie with me scan it right there in storage.  I have only been doing this since January but  I use it a LOT and have had no trouble with the scanner so far. I read a lot of reviews before buying this and have not had any of the troubles I read about (whew!).  I have also received excellent and personal customer support when I have had questions.
5,Excellent product and support. Easy to use and works phenomenally every time my only regret is that I didn't spring for the WiFi version!  From the initial unboxing through set up and config this has been the experience you look for! Even after you register they welcome you with a email containing a scanned image (see pic). I love the software that comes with this scanner too! Intuitive and works every time. I haven't had a need for tech support yet but I bet they hit a home run every time based upon my experience thus far. Priced reasonably if you need/want a portable scanner this is the one to buy.
5,This portable scanner is AWESOME. It is SO easy to use and I love the options of storing scans or sending scans to your  computer. I figured it out in a few minutes. I  had one issue and they emailed me right away! easy peasy. The quality is really excellent! I wish I'd had this years ago when I was tethered to the all-in-one printer/scanner contraption. This is much  better than those scanner wand things AND bonus - it does receipts and  all that crap you DON'T want  to worry about but have to because Grown-up.Try it!
5,This is my 3rd Doxie. While the software leave sa lot to be desired in terms of functionality Doxie scanners are the best portable device I've tried for scanning.The original Doxie I had eventually died so I "upgraded" to the Doxie Q. I did not like how the extra features made it less useful to use when I needed a quick scan. Plus it was too large to use as a portable. I got the Doxie Go and it has all the best parts of the original Doxie.
3,I still have not see what the hype about intuitive is? What’s intuitive? It hasn’t done anything special except can the paper I put in it. Lol and it saves it to the memory card which I have to take out and out into my computer. Just like all the other ones.
5,Overall this is a great scanner if you are not trying to do a big scan such as I was. I had thousands of photos to scan and if I were to have continued using this it would have taken so much longer. You have to put the photos in just the right way or it messes up I had to keep going back to rescan photos which was a process due to me shredding the phots after scanning. Luckily I realized the issue before actually shredding any photos.
5,I wear a lot of hats; entrepreneur crafter girl scout leader the list goes on.  Luckily I'm married to an early adopter of tech and my husband bought one of the first Doxie Gos.  At first it was hard to convince me of it's brilliance but after YEARS of usage I am a super fan.  Sadly my DoxieGo died after years of care-free travel in my work backpack.  There is no question that I'll be buying another.Taxes dear god taxes.  Aren't they the worst thing on the planet?  The Doxie is a lifesaver and makes sending your documents to your accountant somewhat manageable.Have those photos you want to send digitally without getting the EXACT lighting to do it with your phone: again Doxie to the rescue.  Or as a crafter if you need to digitally capture a pattern/photo this is perfect.My office is only 15 minutes from my house but I also am a mom that sometimes works from home.  The flexibility of the rechargeable battery and small size has cut down on those "oh but the scanner's at the office" moments that lead to a dip in productivity.  Ain't nobody got time for that!Finally the customer service at the company is TOP NOTCH.  Why are you still reading this?  Hit ADD TO CART now!
5,I am trying to reduce paper in our house.  This device is small and easy to use it is also so quiet I can use it while we are watching TV.I had some questions about its use after I bought it tech support got back to me very quickly and answered all my questionsHighly recommend
4,Great product that does exactly what it says.
5,I have no room for paper clutter in my life and the Doxie Go SE Scanner is the PERFECT tool.  I run a small non-profit that teaches engineering in schools and I've used this scanner to digitize the work of hundreds of students.  The scanner is small portable battery powered and can save scans internally if you don't have your computer handy.  I planned to just use this for work but it's so easy and quick that I use this for everything in my life - important receipts documents photos.  Doxie's customer service is incredible. I've corresponded with them via email and had the pleasure of talking to some lovely accommodating people who are understanding of my needs.  I'd recommend this scanner to everyone I know with any type of scanning needs.
5,I have been a traditional scrapbooker for over twenty years but recently I decided to complete my first digital album. After a glowing review of the Doxie from a fellow scrapbooker I purchased one to scan my pictures into my computer to be able to use for my digital album. I have been extremely pleased with how easy it is to use the Doxie the long lasting battery life once charged and I have been extremely impressed with the quality of the scans! I love that you can edit your pictures after they have been scanned in the Doxie to correct a number of things on your original picture. I would definitely recommend purchasing a storage case for your Doxie that is sold separately as I don't think I would be comfortable carrying it unprotected. I do wish that the storage case was large enough to fit both the Doxie and it's charging plug but if I am traveling with it I will just usually make sure it is fully charged up before I leave so I don't have to take the plug with me. Since finishing my initial digital album I have used the Doxie to scan important documents receipts etc. This portable easy to use scanner is definitely worth the price and the purchase!
5,Well made and designed product!!  Easy to use very few issues.  It took a number of tries to get the paper to load correctly but once I did it was easy to use.  I have gotten much paperwork off my desk thanks to this amazing product!
5,We use the Doxie for household storage and organization. Very portable and easy to use. We scan almost everything and it's nice to have a lot fewer paper files. Company is very helpful and "customer focused."
4,Would be better if you could sync to computer wirelessly otherwise it's nice. It speeds up scanning for sure and love that I can scan anywhere. Some trouble with feeding it sometimes though. Papers have to be intact and wrinkle free where you start feeding it in otherwise it won't feed or it pulls in crooked. Great other than that for the price :)
5,I love the ease of using this scanner! The machine is easy to operate and very user friendly!!I have started scanning old family photos that we only have 1 copy of so that we can digitally share them and everyone gets a little piece of history!
5,Used it on Mac and on Windows successfully. The software is very easy and intuitive to use. I especially like the options to save as JPG (photo) or PDF  (within PDF you can save as black and white color and with or without optical character recognition).The OCR is quite good. I scan stuff and then I can search by the keyword from the Mac’s spotlight. This is great for finding tax documents or searching recipes for all the recipes with walnuts in them. (On Windows use Agent Ransack for searching the text within the OCR'd documents).If your papers are stapled remember to remove those staples. And do it carefully so you don’t rip or crumple the edges of the paper too badly.  Not taking staples is probably the worst thing about the Doxie.Very crumpled paper is hard to scan; the edges get caught and don’t roll very well. Folded papers are fine- just unfold first.Remember it will take a couple minutes to import the files and when saving with OCR.  That’s not a problem for me- it does a great job and I just spend that time shredding the papers I don’t need anymore!You can even scan receipts or small pieces of paper— it will crop it to the size of the paper. This also works for recipe cards. Just remember to scan both sides (once face up and once face down) if you have double-sidded documents.If you are converting to paperless and scanning lots of documents it helps to have 2 flash drives so you can scan onto one flash drive while importing the other.
5,I could not be happier with my Doxie Go WiFi. It's so convenient and easy to use. I spend a lot of time taking care of my parents and it has been so easy to take it with me and use it while I'm there.I was using it quite a bit and realized that I had a line going my scans. It was a faint line but I contacted Doxie's Customer Service via email. I had a response within 24 hours. They were apologetic for the inconvenience and sent me a new Doxie Go WiFi right away.  They were in constant communication making sure that everything was working as it should be and if they could help in any additional way.Another aspect that I was really impressed with was not only the quick response from customer service but the fact I actually was communicating with a CSR with a name! And each communication was prompt genuine and informative.This is a great product and a great company. I would and have already recommended purchasing the Dixie Go WiFi to anyone wanting a new scanner.  Can't go wrong with this scanner and all of its extra capabilities!
5,Never heard of the company esp compared to the Epson ones that are more plentiful.Got a great deal on PrimeDay and this turned out to be the best deal we got.It works PERFECTLY. It does not have features you don't need and the ones it does have just plain work.Flawlessly executed. Solid. Well thought out. Making something like this as simple as possible but no simpler really takes some skill. A lot of other tech start ups would do well to take notice.
5,I bought it about a month ago and am working on scanning my office's records. This little scanner is a total workhorse. I have been scanning and scanning and so far ithas not let me down. In the beginning there were a coue of glitches but nothing major. I haven't had any difficulties since and am really happy with it.
4,I bought this little scanner almost two years ago so have a bit of experience with it now. This review is about the scanner itself the physical piece of hardware. I mention this because a lot of the "features" touted by Doxie are things you get if you use their software apps and have nothing to do with the scanner itself (such as OCR PDFs uploading to Dropbox etc.).PROS:1) Tiny and very portable.2) Battery operated so free to use anywhere without a computer or plugging any cord into it.3) 300 and 600 dpi settings the second one being nice to have for things like photos.4) Saves JPG scans to SD card so you can put the card into a card reader or your computer SD slot rather than plugging in the scanner itself if you prefer. And again no computer needed if your card has space.CONS:1) Lack of labels or other indicators on the scanner to indicate what things like LEDs colors means (for example a simple label above the power button to indicate Green = 300 dpi orange = 600 dpi red = charging would be helpful (I added my own)).2) Battery operated while listed as a PRO above the con is with a dead or missing battery you can not operate the scanner (more below on that).3) Only scans to JPG files; no PDF option on the scanner itself.4) Does not scan duplex or both sides at the same time. You feed one side then turn it over and feed the other side resulting in two files.5) This one is fairly pricey compare to other brand of similar scanners but most of those are not battery operated so must be plugged into something to operate.So here is the very short version of what this scanner does: You  power it up power button lights up GREEN indicated it is in 300 dpi mode but if you want to scan at 600 dpi press the power button again to switch to being lighted ORANGE feed the item you want to scan into the front give it a second to grab the item pulling it through scanning it and finally the scanner then saves the resulting JPG file to the included SD card that is inserted in the back of the scanner.  That is it. There really is nothing else this device does all by itself.Here are the details about the battery:The advantage of this scanner is that it runs off a battery and scanner is tiny. So you can keep it in places where you are most likely to want to be able to quickly without fuss scan something. For example you might keep it on your kitchen table where you open your mail or if cleaning out a filing cabinet you can set it right next to you and scan items you want to get rid of the paper copy but still have a record. No cord or computer needed.The disadvantage of the battery is if the battery is dead you can not scan. I recently found my battery had failed completely and with a dead battery that wouldn't charge you can not use the scanner at all. You can not take the battery out and run it off a USB cord. You must have a working battery to scan. What normally happens is you use it then maybe put it away and forget about until you need it again maybe weeks later and by that time the battery may have discharged. So before you use it you have to wait for it to charge again. Not convenient. So the downside of this is you need to remember to plug it in once in a while to keep it charged and ready for use.On the battery itself when mine died Doxie had no stock anywhere of the replacement battery. However after some research I found that this battery is a model NP-120 and is most often sold as a replacement for a Fuji digital cameras. You can buy this battery from many 3rd party sellers (including here on Amazon) and I bought a pair of them with an external charger for under $10 (less than the cost of one battery from Doxie). Now I have two batteries and can charge one outside the Doxie and swap batteries if I need to scan a lot of stuff and run out the first battery (like when cleaning out that filing cabinet).I can not comment on the Doxie apps (they have versions for Windows Apple iOS Android and web based) as I have not bothered to use them. I simply transfer the JPG scans to my computer or my phone as needed and go from there. By the way. you can plug the scanner (or the SD card in a reader) directly into your phone (may need a USB-A to USB-C or whatever your phone uses adapter) and the SD card should show up like any other SD card where you can then move the files to your phone add them to your Dropbox upload them on the web somewhere or whatever else you normally do with JPGs on your phone without needing the specific Doxie app. Same is true on your computer. Don't like the Doxie application? Then don't use it. It is not required to use this scanner.On scanning:* This scanner is not a flat bed scanner so since things get pulled through it you can't or shouldn't scan anything that is delicate ripped or wrinkled that might get further damaged items that are too thick or of varying thicknesses etc.* You are also limited by the width of the scanner feeder itself which is a bit wider than a standard piece of computer/copier/notebook paper so anything larger than a sheet of paper or an 8x10 photo won't work. However it seems to scan long items just fine so long as their width fits.* Scans are single sided and for two sided documents (which you have to feed in once per side) or multiple page documents you will get one JPG file per page. If you want to combine them into a single document you will need the Doxie software Adobe Acrobat or many other apps that can combine multiple images into one file.* If you want a PDF (or any other file format) rather than a JPG or want features like OCR then you need the Doxie app Adobe Acrobat or another app of your choice.Summary: Small battery operated scanner that is great for quickly scanning items onto an SD card without the need of a computer or even any wires plugged into it. Small so easy to store and to take it where you need to do the scanning so long as the items you want to scan can feed through it (can not scan the pages of a book at a library for example). Great way to get rid of those little piles of paper work receipts photos bills statements etc. that you might have not been sure what to do with. Scan them all in and recycle the paper.
5,The Doxie Go SE arrived as scheduled (earlier actually) and we put it right to work.  Connecting to the scanner wirelessly was easy and worked really well so we had no trouble scanning and then downloading documents to our laptops.  We spent a little time (very little actually) trying to figure out how to connect Doxie to our home network but never succeeded.  Plus we realized that there's no need to do that anyway since we can connect each individual laptop to the scanner.  So all in all we're very pleased with our purchase.
3,Initially a 1 star review my scanner had visible lines in certain scans. Oddly enough not every scan but also the problem didn't clear up even with calibration but the seller reached out and offered to swap it out. The replacement arrived and doesn't seem to be any better but I appreciate the quick response from Doxie. I think if you scan something that's really bold the scan will look great. Anything with lower contrast might have lines in it.
5,I looked at several different options and decided on this one. I love it. Highly recommend. I scanned in 2300 photos in only a few hours time. I also scanned in like 100 documents like birth certificates and diplomas etc. Each picture only took like 3 seconds to scan. Great quality. I am so glad I bought this!
5,Love this little light weight scanner. I take it with me to the office and into the homes to scan paperwork that's needed
5,I always buy a scanner with good intentions and then never use it unless I absolutely have to and even then I procrastinate as long as I can. With Doxie it's almost fun but absolutely convenient. As an added bonus their customer service is freaking awesome. I got a form email asking me to complete a product satisfaction survey and in it I commented that the wi-fi was kinda clunky. A customer service rep emailed me with suggestions to fix my problem (and they did). That made an already solid product so much better. Can't recommend this scanner enough!
5,I can't find fault with the product. I have had several portable scanners over the years and this one is the first one to evidence great support and most importantly great functionality.
5,Doxie has really simplified scanning and sending my documents. It's easy to set up and import and the quality of the scans are excellent. I just scan rename and import to a shared folder and my docs are sent!
3,This was my first time using a portable scanner. I first found out about them from watching videos about living a minimal lifestyle and the tiny house movement. As an apartment dweller I had to get my hands on a portable scanner like this Doxie Go.My first issue with the Doxie was the difficulty feeding the paper into it. I had a stack of 8.5x11 pages that needed scanning. The paper tends to gear to the left or right as it gets pulled in. Additionally the scanner doesn't really catch at times. It is reminiscent of a coin machine that refuses to take your dollar.The other major issue I had was the importing process. It is mind-numbingly slow. I'm using a new 12" macbook laptop with the cable plugged into my Doxie. The pages take about 10 seconds each. This might not seem that bad but if you have a lot of pages prepare to wait around.Once the pages are imported some of them are distorted with dark corners and warping corners.I really want to like this scanner but I think the technology needs more user testing before I will consider buying a portable scanner in the future.
5,I was looking for a way to digitize thousands of business receipts and my Doxie scanner does exactly what its supposed to to.  I really like the way it saves OCR pdfs so I can do a quick search to find something specific.  Great customer service and product is very easy to use.
5,Great customer communicant! Super easy to use! Organizes all my receipts in one place which decreases the amount of clutter!
2,The scanner is pretty great! Simple to use very portable (has a SD card & charges with USB). The customer support is also fantastic - when I was having issues with my Doxie they have sent me a replacement pretty easily.The software however is pretty lacking. It looks great - don't get me wrong. But you can't zoom in on your scans it doesn't do anything to "automatically" adjust your scan and it's a pain to change them all one at a time with just a brightness & contrast slider. And after all that when you export the scans out of the software they end up looking different than they did in the software (better in most cases but still different than what I thought they were going to look like - confusing). I mostly scan receipts and it seems like something so simple could have some simple image processing applied automatically to try to optimize the adjustments for you to the best readability. Most other scanners can do this.This is why I gave it a low rating: because while it is a great hardware product the software is really difficult and annoying to use.
4,Great form factor. Scan rate is slower than I expected but reasonable. There appears to be some quality/color/saturation issues when scanned but can be edited with the software. Great product for small batch scans backing up important documents etc. Easy to store doesn't take up desk space. Happy with the purchase.
5,I have the Doxie Go SE non Wi-Fi model and I love it! Ever since I got it I have scanned more than 700+ photos! Scanning became fun again :-)
5,Easy installation compact user friendly
5,Small and compact easy to use.  I have several hundred pages to scan and this work well.  Scan about 30 pages at a time then transfer to the iMac.  The scanner stores the files on a SD card to be transferred to the desktop.  The software works well combining pages into one pdf file which I rename.
5,I couldn’t fit my cat in the scanner which didn’t help my medical diagnosis the dr said I needed a cat scan and I have no clue why
5,I can't say enough about the quality of scans I'm receiving from Doxie.  With it's portability I can scan anywhere in my house and send directly to my laptop via WiFi or USB.  I would recommend Doxie to anyone!
5,This little scanner has helped me get rid off all the filing cabinets full of documents! The speed in which this scanner scans documents is amazing! As a Realtor this has been the BEST little buddy on the road. I instantly write up contracts on the spot and scan them right over to my laptop! I never leave the office without it!
5,This is my second Doxie. Loved them both. Very easy to use and very portable. I scanned thousands of photos while watching TV.
2,I received a Doxie Go as a gift. When it worked it was great. Scanning without being connected to a computer saves so much time. After about 6 months it died. It powers on and pulls a document in then stops with a flashing red light. Troubleshooting steps the support site shows haven't fixed things. Essentially a paperweight now.
5,Likes:  portability quality of scanned images software / user interface and ease of use.Dislike:  WiFi setup and online help on this topic. WiFi works fine just was puzzling to get it going.
5,Bought this on a whim to scan receipts for our home and documents rather then saving and filing the old fashion way.  This is so simple and easy to use set up was easy and it works great.  Highly recommend so much easier then a scanner on a printer.  Nice software features as well for the scanned documents.
5,We have had the Doxie since it first came out. Our use is mostly for casual home business use and volunteer document needs.  I hung onto my original Doxie for a long time! then finally upgraded to the newer and so much faster Doxie.  This Doxie travels if needed.  Just bring it back home and load to your home computer.  Good deal!  Lots of choices now.  Our needs are simple and the ease & speed of newer Doxie works well for us.
5,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my Doxie!  I had a different brand of scanner but the install was difficult and the process was cumbersome. As a teacher I need a product that is easy to use. This product is an absolute life-saver!  I use it DAILY!  In a matter of minutes I can take a hard copy of a worksheet and upload it to my class website. Students can print off their own worksheet instead of needing me to do that for them. This is something that took time before...time that I didn't really have or that I had a hard time finding.  This makes my classroom more efficient!  Thank you doxie!Also as a parent of an extremely unorganized child I have also used it to scan my son's homework. When he forgets to turn it in or loses it we no longer have to redo the assignment (over and over); I just e-mail it to his teachers.In a high tech world it makes life easier...no more cluttery mess of papers.
5,I purchased this so I could reduce the amount of saved papers I had accumulated and it has helped tremendously. I have been able to scan and upload so many documents photos and receipts. Now I just need to buy a good shredder. The Doxie is easy to use and the battery life is perfect. Wireless or wired it's quick and quiet. The quality of the scans are great. The app integration for the computer is very intuitive and works seamlessly with the Doxie. Will recommend to others.
5,The Doxie Go SE is very small and easily stored. The picture quality is great and the app makes it easy to combine images that belong to the same document after scanning. This is not a great option if you scan a large number of documents frequently as you need to feed each document/photo individually but is great for those who only need to scan items occasionally for personal use!
5,I bought this Doxie Go for the purpose of moving towards digitally scanning all of our receipts and important documents to help us cut down on the paper clutter in our house and file cabinet. I also got an eye-fi x2 sd card so that I could have the scans wirelessly transmit from the doxie to one of our pc's that I would then either manually or automatically move the files to their correct location. So far it has worked great. Sometimes it doesn't quite grab squarely but that hasn't been a huge deal as it is usually readable and I usually scan it again anyways. The software is pretty good as well I have a few gripes as they force you to use their folder locations for scans or you have to manually import the scans everytime you access the software. I understand why they do this but hopefully one day they add some advanced settings so that you can have one folder (say a share) that can be accessed from multiple machines with their doxie software and be able to see the scans.
5,This product performs as described.  When the scanner started acting up I contacted the company for assistance.  Their customer service is best described as over-the-top and clearly puts them in a category of their own!  If you are looking for a portable scanner from a company that stands by their product look no further.
5,The doxie scanner is portable and easy to use.Connecting via WiFi is very convenient.
2,I use this for scanning my bills statements etc to reduce paper clutter.  I have it with a Eye-fi Card Pro X2 card as per instructions.It is easy to use. But important failures:1) CRITICAL - Reliability - It skips scans. It really angers and scares me because I have been scanning with it for some time now and didn't discover it until recently when I was at scanning with the computer right next to it. I will scan 10 pages at one go and realize that 1 or 2 pages are missing. I remove the SD card and mount it directly to the computer and it reloads the 8 or 9 pages it sent already but the missing ones are nowhere to be seen. So there may be documents that I have already thrown away that I didn't get a proper archive of. I'm dreading combing through the papers I haven't shredded yet and and cross checking against my computer folders and seeing how many did not make it. This almost defeats the purpose of this scanner.2) Scanning Quality - Actually the resolution itself is fine. The feeder however is not. Despite my best efforts including multiple tries 2 out of 5 documents will have a black top edge on the top where the feeder sucked in one side faster than the other. If you are only scanning receipts for yourself no biggie. But if you are archiving pictures or scanning documents that you will send to other people it really ruins the end result of the scan. And there doesn't appear to be a way of fixing it other than rescanning again and again and again in hopes of getting one that doesn't have it.3) Crinkly Documents - Has a lot of trouble with it. Takes at least 3 tries.4) Random Jams - Every 7-12 scans I'll have one that just stops in the middle of scanning. It's not out of battery and it isn't crinkled up and it made it through initial feel but just stops in the middle. Since I'm not always by the computer I always yank it out gently and rescan.I've lived with problems 2-4 above but #1 is the worst problem. I can't trust this scanner to use it anymore.
5,I like it very much I have been able to get rid of a lot of papers.
5,We use this to scan bills important documents and our kids home school work.  Works well for us due to ease of use and portability.
5,We have an older Doxie GO and we absolutely love it. Ours has been going strong for five years now and it's still scanning. Photo's documents even some cardboard stuff went through it. The Doxie software works great we can chose between pictures or documents and can send it directly to Evernote.We also got in touch with customer service because our Doxie came with an Eye-Fi card that died on us. Unlike most American companies they will send us a new Card (free of charge!) even though they have to ship ip to Europe.Great device great company. If we ever buy a new scanner we're buying a new bigger Doxie.
5,I had the older model for a few years before it finally gave up the ghost. I used it frequently and ran it into the ground. I reached out to Doxie support and they responded immediately to help work through my issue. Since the warranty had expired they offered me a deal on the SE model and I'm glad I took it; this one has been an excellent replacement. I use it almost every day and haven't had any problems.
5,The ease of use to scan quickly and export to a save file is a great time saver.  Great product to go paper free
5,Works great for documents now that I am working remotely.
5,Very good product. The WiFi does get identified and connects slowly but once connected it works great!
5,My life has changed since I got this little thing. Every important receipt business card check invoice I ever need to save is done in the matter of seconds. The software is incredibly easy to use and has all the features you would need to manage your scans (crop rotate magnify etc.). The customer support team is also top notch. They fixed a technical issue I was having right away. Thank you Doxie!
5,I send lots of Postcrossing postcards and use my Doxie to scan them. I use it for documents electronic records for taxes and sending signed forms by email. The staple feature helps with this. I don't give the user interface a perfect score because the Import button is active all the time not inactive when there's nothing connected and it's not ready for importing scanned images.
5,I love this little device. It is very useful and greatly reduced the paper accumulated on my desk. I use it daily for genealogy receipts and bills recipes and saving interesting info that I want to save.
3,Great concept but not quite refined.  I own both the original Doxie and the Doxie Go.  I find the original to be a trusty companion for scanning docs and my favorite scanner.  With that in mind I was excited to get the Go both because it promised to scan much more quickly (the one mild irritation I have w/ the original) and it would be more mobile (i.e. not required to be attached to a laptop to scan). I do appreciate the speed of the Go  but find the software to be a little unrefined (i.e. it seldom automatically recognizes the scanner w/o me manually launching the doxie software when I connect to synch) and it's a little odd that charging is only possible when connected to a laptop although it's recommended that you only scan when not connected to a laptop.  All in all I find myself reaching for the original more than the Go unless I have 20 pages to scan....
5,The Doxie Go SE has significantly cleaned up our desk top.  Receipts are easily scanned and filed - and then thrown away - so no we use three less cabinet file drawers.  Wish we would have had this years ago.  What a time saver and efficient organizing tool.
5,I bought this Doxie after researching several portable scanners. It is simple to use and the app is easy to navigate. I'm happy with the features and would recommend it to anyone.
5,This scanner is what I've been looking for. It helps us organize - no more piles.
5,I love this product! My wife (then girlfriend) bought this for me because I was using my multi-function printer to scan receipts which took a long time compared to the Doxie (I have just under 7000 scanned receipts so far.)  The Doxie software is also easier to use (rotate crop etc.) than what I was using before (Adobe Acrobat). Eleven thumbs up.
5,Set it to 600dpi and it just kept on scanning. Easy to just throw the pics in and then use the SD card to transfer onto the computer.Firmware update was easy to do as well. They make their directions simple and clear.
5,Probably the best customer service I have ever had. Great product Great Company
5,Super lite and portable. Scans are crystal clear.
5,I travel about 70% of the time.  In the past I was always looking for receipts that I had misplaced.  Now every evening I scan the receipts into my computer with Doxie.  It is light weight and takes little room in my lluggage.  I will buy again if this one ever goes.
5,The Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi smart scanner is so convenient! The app is a great way to connect scan and save crystal clear scans to Dropbox. I love it!
2,So I bought this Doxie SE from Amazon a few months back and have been using it USB.  But now I need it to mobile and remembered it came with Wifi.  Mine has the Wifi button in the back so you'd think it was the WiFi enabled model.  Nope.  I finally realized after troubleshooting for over an hour I think they sent me one that wasn't actually the WiFi model even though it has the button and all.  So are you telling me the only difference between the "not Wifi" and "Wifi" model is software?  Yep.  I found deep in their documentation that the wifi button and reset hole "will not do anything" if your model isn't the WiFi model!!!  What the heck!?  Not cool.  So now I don't know if mine's just broken or not enabled.  It's too late at this point to ship back to Amazon and the Doxie help and support is HORRIBLE.  Don't waste your money.  Just buy a normal USB attached scanner and avoid this whole WiFi fiasco.
5,Best thing about this is the convenience and ease of use. Not hard to feed a document through rename it for my purpose download it to the appropriate file. Great for keeping receipts for insurance and tax purposes. Its small size sits right next to me plugged into my computer and just waiting to help me.
5,Not only does the scanner work great all the time the company behind this product is extremely buyer-friendly.  On multiple occasions they've been generous as far as helping me get a new cord when the cat chewed it and trouble-shooting a one-time issue.I went totally paperless after a few weekends of pushing papers through my Doxie and tagging them in Evernote.  I'm actually trying to switch to OneNote instead of Evernote for the record but either should suffice your needs.Now all I have to do is take my papers pile every few weeks scan the lot trash the leftover paper and tag the scans as either tasks notes for reference or by project name etc.I can confidently say you'll be happy with your Doxie too.
5,There was an easy start color-coded (with simple pictures) double-sided card. Wow did they make it simple to use this thing! Just what I wanted and needed. For the simplification in sending my accountant documents fast has made it worthwhile
2,The scanner works great.Here are the problems:1. It takes forever to load items from the sd card into the doxie software.2. The doxie software is terrible clearly built by some keyboard cowboy. Hardly any of the needed functions are built into a right click menu like every other software after 2001.3. The file menu has both a close and an exit option guess what they do the same thing amateur.4. I cant just right click a document and say save as.... I have to click it then go up to the file menu and select what I want very painful.5. saving pictures is really slow6. Preview mode is non existant it is hard to make out what the document contains for proper naming.I pointed out all of these things and more to their support we exchanged a few emails about what could be better. Been waiting a year for some kind of update but still waiting. Not impressed.
5,Love the scanner. I do a lot of genealogy and I take the scanner to family members and scan old photos.
5,Great for a portable scanner. Very easy to use and set up.
5,This was the perfect answer to reduce the paper trail in my home. Very easy to use and fits on a shelf or in a drawer to be used when you need it. The memory card with its software makes saving your memories or tax returns as easy as pie.
3,It's okay small single page scanner for on the go needs.  Interface is a bit clumsy as everything is saves as a JPG first and have to go into Doxie software and change it to pdf.  I don't think I would buy again.
5,Awesome product. Have used the original and this makes scanning even better and more portable.
5,Great little scanner.  Love this little scanner.  I live in a small house with very little space and this is great because it fits just about anywhere.  2 options for pixels and great editing tool.  Very easy to use.
5,This is a high quality scanner that has become both my portable scanner as well as my go-to scanner at my desk. I use it for high res 600 dpi scanning of my artwork for digitization and I'm very happy with it! Great support too.
5,This portable scanner is helping me become more organized by having less paper scattered around. I can scan all the important documents into the memory card and transfer them to my computer easily.
5,So far like it alot scans photos quilt and at 600 dpi they are nice too.
5,I am a big fan of Doxie and really like their newest version. It makes it so easy to scan my documents wherever I am and is an integral part of my being able to go "paperless". I haven't finished the transition but the mile journey begins with one step and this has been a great first step!
5,The tech support was great.  It's so easy to use without a computer.  Terrific!
5,I am extremely happy with my little DOXIE.  It was so incredibly easy to set-up.  It is compact and doesn’t take up much room on the desk. Having the Wi-Fi option makes scanning my documents and photos quick and easy.  I can scan bills letters photos and save the files onto my computer now I really have a ‘paperless office’.  DOXIE help is also convenient and very efficient.  I love my DOXIE!
5,great product. very easy set up and awesome quality. highly recommended!
5,This is a great invention! I am in the process of dumping some paper baggage in hopes of one day having a paperless life. Also having a virtual file cabinet (dropbox or evernote) to keep the pieces of important information in one spot and not having to spend hours looking for it is so worth it! It has taken the headache out of paper filing.Here is what I love about this product:Wirelessportable- great for scanning receipts on the go!lightweight (I carry it in my purse take it to work. Use it at work and at home or wherever)good quality scansscans photos clearlysyncs well with evernote instantlyworks well with dropboxGood value for what I paidExtremely simple to userelatively quickCons:The first charge took at least two hours out of the box so no instant gratification when you first open itRequires lots of chargingbattery doesn't seem to last as long as I would preferFeeding is page by pageFeeding requires some practicewhen scanning a large amount of paper the doxie go seems to need a small 'break' it may get overwhelmed (40 pages or so)and pauses. I then have to restart it. Sometimes it just needed recharging.this could be me needing the break too??Overall this is a 5 star product simply for the portability and wireless factor. I have not tried the wi-fi portion of this scanner. When I do I will update this review. I am not a big fan of evernote but do use dropbox. Evernote is effortless with the doxie-go. HIGHLY recommended especially for those of us who are technologically intimidated. This is so easy to use and user friendly. If I could I would buy one for all my friends and family!GOODBYE paper and good riddance!
5,Super convenient and rock solid. My workflow has been to periodically:- Grab 20 or so pages of archived documents (important receipts contracts medical records etc.).- Feed them all through my Doxie.- Use the Doxie software to "staple" related pages together in order.- Save the PDF (with OCR'd text) somewhere that's backed up regularly. At the moment that's BTSync for me occasionally zipped up and burnt to DVD etc.I'm almost through my ridiculous backlog of archived documents and all new paper records coming into my house go through my Doxie and into the bin!My only hope would be for the bundled software to eventually run on Linux but given that it has good Mac and Windows support I'm making do just fine for now.
5,Doxie is the best choice if you are thinking about a powerful compact and fast scanner! I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable scanner! Plus the customer support team is super helpful and will be there to answer any of your questions. Thank you to the Doxie Team :)
5,We use with the Doxy is excellent. Once it’s on my computer getting to put it on a USB is mind-boggling
5,The only thing is I don't  know how many pictures I have on the card. Very easy to use.
5,I work with financial documents which include receipts handwritten notes contracts and business cards. My desk was being swallowed and I spent more time looking for my case files than working them. I have now scanned all the files with the Doxie Plus using the OCR feature.  Night and Day difference. My scans are better than the originals which I can get off my desk. I can now search for what I am looking for saving me hours upon hours of time. I was up and running within and hr after downloading the software and was amazed at how well it scanned the crumpled worn receipts. For the very bad ones I used the feeder sheet and it was flawless.
5,I've bought and tested others to great disappointment. This is the only scanner I will use!
5,Great software. Fast and easy to scan. Ideal for scanning papers to archive as well as for scanning homework after completion in case it disappears before making its way to the teachers inbox!
5,Easy to use straight out of the box.  Small and easy to move.
2,On the positive side this is sleek and easy to set up.  But it has to work to be of value.  The scanner worked initially but the second time I went to use it it will not feed anything (even the calibration sheet).  The rollers pull the paper in a fraction and then stop.  I have reached out to customer service and received no reply at all.  I am returning as this is for work and I can't wait days on a response for something I need to scan and send now.
5,This is exactly what we needed here in our fleet department to travel the country and hire drivers. We have to scan and save a LOT of docs so this is perfect.
5,Love everything about this little scanner!
5,Small size battery operated wireless transfer of files...This is just exactly the little scanner I have been looking for.
5,My Doxie is great! I use it to scan photos notes and important documents. It travels easily to and from meetings and school. The WiFi connection to upload documents is easy to use once you learn how.
5,This is our third Doxie! They just keep getting better all the time.Setting up the wireless connection was a little tricky because I did not know I had to use a wireless connection to do the setup. But their tech support explained everything cheerfully and clearly and solved the problem in no time.I think maybe the Doxie with the sheet feeder will be on my wish list this year.  :)
5,Doxie's wifi scanners are the real deal.  It's a sheet fed scanner so you can't do books or similar. But for expenses bills and organization of a messy workspace it is fantastic.  It's small enough to bring on a business trip as well.
5,I had an older model of the Dixie that was not working well. Contacted customer service and they were great about sending me this new scanner. This scanner is great love that it’s wireless. Quick and easy to use!
5,I use this for scanning paperwork around the house and used it successfully for five years.  No problems with the scanner or software.
5,I scan all my documents and keep them on file on my computer. Doxie is very easy and quick to use and I would recommend it to anyone. Also the company provides excellent backup for any problems.
5,Quick setup basically plug it in and turn it on. It’s speed of scanning is amazing. Looking forward to using it more.
5,I basically boughtmy Doxie to digitize my oldphotos from the yesteryears. And so far it didn’t disappoint.
5,Scanning reports.
5,I like the wi capabilities along with the portability.
4,This scanne is much better than I expected. I was pleasantly surprised to find out you can upgrade it to scan over wi-fi. Awesome! The batter lasts much longer than advertised and the unit can easily store hundreds of document.
5,Use this to scan receipts both at home and away and it does the job very well!
5,This is a great scanner.  It lets you get your scanning done without being tied to your desk.  Also Doxie customer service is AMAZING!  They are very helpful and super responsive.
3,I have had this scanner in use for 2 years.What I like:- Portable- No clutter does not take up any room on your desktop I simply store it in my desk drawer- SD card slot- no nonsense software (Mac)What I dislike- Frequent paper jams when the edge or tip(s) of the document is even slightly crooked. Even a document that comes out of a laser printer (and is slightly curved at the top) may result in the Doxie not taking the paper.- Battery life is limited (it would say around 50 pages instead of the advertised 100). The li-ion battery also looses its charge over a short period of time (1 month). I thought that the main advantage of a li-ion battery is that it keeps its charge for a longer period of time. I reported this issue to Doxie after 1 month of purchase and they said it was normal. My best advise is to always keep it plugged into a power source ready to go and unplug it when you need it.- You cannot drag a scanned document directly from the software to a folder or to your desktop I really find this annoying.I believe the Doxie Go is too expensive for what it is. If portability is no issue I would consider alternatives such as Fujitsu Scansnap ix500 or a Canon DR-C125 which is what I am going to do should the Doxie die on me.
5,Very user-friendly and great scanning quality. I love that it's so compact quiet and easy to deal with the scanned documents/photos. I can even send them to Evernote which is perfect for me!
5,This is awesome. Super easy to get set up and running. And when I needed support (due to user error...) the response was fast and super helpful.
5,A really helpful & reliable product (I should know I have three of them).It scans fast much faster than say my Epson Workforce WP-4630 all-in-one. It produces high quality scans & small file size.The built-in battery give it a long lifetime (though I would have preferred if it uses rechargeable AA batteries instead).And the wireless transfer to my Mac works without a glitch.I even take it with me when I travel: instead of bringing back receipts & other paperwork (like presentations) I just scan everything and throw out the paper. It saves weight (and space) in my suitcase.A time weight & space saver.
5,It’s exactly what site says it is.  I love it!
5,The scanner works great!!  Highly recommend it.  Also I have found their customer service to be outstanding.
5,I really like the simplicity/size/price of this scanner. For personal use it's all I need. The WiFi is really nice. I connect it to my home network and import scans wirelessly to my laptop. The software is simple and easy to use and allows me to upload the scans directly to my Google Drive account.
5,This meets my needs perfectly for organizing my 30+ years worth of photos.  It is easy to use and accommodates various sizes of photos.  It will also be good for organizing receipts and favorite recipes.
4,The delivery was punctual and well packaged. The setup was very easy without any problems. I have scanned about 100 pages without problem. It also scans store reciepts which is very convenient. This little machine does exactly what they say it would.
5,I love my Doxie Go. Doxie is definitely helping me become and stay organized in an environment where I would rather reduce then reuse before I recycle. I bought my Doxie to tackle the daunting task of digitizing and organizing about 20 years of curriculum student work examples and news articles from science and teaching magazines most of which I "inherited" from my master teacher. Charge it up feed all your documents and organize the digital copies. The charge on this scanner is amazing. I can power through  many days of scanning before I need to recharge. I also love the native Doxie program for rotating documents as well as "stapling" multiple pages together before exporting them to Dropbox and Evernote (both of which I have premium accounts to tackle all 8 moving boxes worth of materials).Recently I brought my Doxie with me on the expo floor of a teaching convention. As I collected fliers ads and brochures I slipped this little scanner out of my tote bag and quickly collected what would typically be a bag full of papers to sort through after the convention. Paired with my iPad I had more room in my luggage to collect samples and purchases to share with my colleagues.Doxie has also been helping me at home with my taxes.
5,We have a lot of these scanners.  We work with families out in the public and its great to be able to scan their information and load it on your system.
5,Perfect for receipts and bills and all things paper. No more filing cabinet!
5,Just awesome portable scanner. 600 dpi gives a pretty big breathing room if you want to scan something crazy detailed and ability to work from batteries is super cool comparing to the previous portable models where you had to bring a power supply everywhere you go.
5,I put a different portable scanner on my wish list but my husband got me the Doxie Go for Christmas.  I'm so glad he did! Doxie Go is very portable lightweight and easy to use.  I want to do away with all paper files.  The Doxie o is quiet enough that I can sit in front of the TV in the evenings and scan.  Soon I'll be able to sell my file cabinets!
5,Great scanner. Works great independently and connected to a computer. I've had issues with it breaking but they were always quick to fix the problem. Spectacular customer service.
5,Love the OCR software that comes with this portable scanner
1,From the day I purchased this device (two years ago) I have successfully scanned exactly two documents. I purchased it so I could scan and organize receipts and bills. I've never been able to do that because it actually does not scan! Today I spent over an hour just trying to scan one tax document so I can prepare my taxes. No success (no surprise). I've worked in IT for 20 years so I'm no technophobe. I actually can use peripheral devices pretty well. I'm using a Mac so maybe this is one of those dinosaur companies that doesn't make reliable software for Apple computers. That's possible I guess. So if you own a Mac definitely steer clear of this junk. Bottom line - this device is absolutely crap (the feeder now spins in reverse never grabbing the paper to actually scan it - that's fun!) and I'm sick about the fact that I wasted $178 on this terrible thing that is now sitting in my waste barrel. Please don't waste your money and save yourself tons of aggravation and regret. Trust me buying any other device will be better than buying this one.
5,Much improved document reader function.  New ability to open reader to remove jams.  New removable SD Card for data transfer while still retaining the wifi and USB transfer capability.
5,I am very impressed with Doxie's amazing customer service! I had posted a negative review of the Doxie Go since ours was temperamental and it was very frustrating and within a few hours the Doxie customer service team emailed me to apologize for our poor experience and offer me both a refund and replacement product! They did not ask me to update my review but I think their customer service team alone deserves 5 stars. I have rarely experienced such over-the-top treatment as a customer and it really makes me want to love their products too. I haven't yet had a chance to try out our new Doxie but my guess is that it will work great and that our old one was just a dud (which seems to be rare based on their excellent overall reviews on amazon). Thank you Doxie!
5,This little scanner is perfect. Exactly as described and not at all over-hyped. It is incredibly simple to use and virtually does all the work for you. The software it comes with is user friendly and does a great job optimizing and OCR-ing the scans and it easily links up with your cloud folders or imports locally. Occasionally a warped piece of paper will make it difficult to scan but that is a fault of the paper not the scanner and I have always been able to smooth out a document enough to successfully scan. Highly recommend.
5,Paper feed works so much better than the first edition. Quite happy I upgraded to this version.
5,Easy to use.  I have a scanner built into my printer but I use Doxie for short things.I appreciate the no-wires configuration now that I use Wi-Fi.
2,This could be a terrific scanner but it really seems to fall short in two areas.  I had high hopes when John Gruber had recommended this (or perhaps it was just a sponsor) but it fell short of my expectations to where I had to return it.1) It feeds crooked EVEN IF YOU USE THE GUIDE.  Yes ensure you are aligning the item against the left edge and that the guide on the right is adjusted appropriately.  However there were several issues that prevented me from being successful.  First sometimes the rollers do not catch at all.  Second sometimes the right-side of the roller would catch prematurely and then the document would feed in crooked.  Third the guide would get pushed aside by the paper itself causing it to start feeding crooked.  This is a pretty big fault and the result was forcing me to have to adjust every item I scanned.  The product is failing to ensure I can use it successfully due to some physical design faults.2) The battery life especially if you use an Eye-Fi card.  I fully charged the scanner before use and the battery gave up the ghost at 35 letter-sized pages.  I charged it up again.  It then lasted for 32.A minor gripe is the auto-contrast boost is a bit too aggressive by default.  If you have documents that were folded (i.e. tri-folded to fit into an envelope) some of the folds result in a considerable shadow region in the resulting scan presumably because the lighting ends up being uneven as a result.  This can mostly be mitigated by adjusting the contrast boost.This has a lot of promise but the first item needs to be fixed in a future iteration of the product.  The second item can be addressed with a more specific claim or increasing the battery capacity.  For me it's not a deal-breaker but it creates an unrealistic expectation of the product's performance.Apparent I know you can fix these problems.  Do so and I'll gladly give the next version a try -- I really want one but only if it meets my expectations.
5,I love the Doxie Go hardware it is slick functional and nicely designed. Scanning is generally easy although wrinkled paper can be tricky to start feeding. I also with the adjustable document guide was a bit bigger.To get the most out of the scanner you'll definitely want to get an Eye-Fi card and configure it to push directly to a Cloud Service (like Evernote).There are number of annoyances with the Doxie software- Requires (equally clunky) Eye-Fi software to be installed.- you can't auto-export to Evernote- you need to install Evernote to export to it (no direct Cloud connection)- scrolling is not smooth so it's easy to get lost- you can't view the scans in full size- landscape images aren't auto-rotated- you can't change the default manual rotation direction- fresh imports will block the UI instead of running in the backgroundPros:- Attractive design- Nice and portable- Decent scans- Wireless is handy- Doesn't require a computer to scanCons:- Software works but is primitive- Single sided scans- No document feeder option- Feeding wrinkled documents can sometimes be a little fiddly
2,The whole point of this thing is supposed to be convenience. Why then can it not just automatically upload files to a destination? Once you've scanned you have to manually turn on the wifi go to your computer open the program watch a progress bar while it imports select each file individually export to a chosen location then manually delete from the scanner.Sheesh... That workflow is seven steps longer than it needs to be. It's wifi-enabled! Just let me set it up to save to my Dropbox! Or Evernote or whatever!
5,Love so far!!! Scanning 35 and 38 yearsworth if my grown kids paper pictures. This thing rocks so far!!! Love it...
5,The Doxie scanner has been excellent. It is easy to use and does a great job. I have also been impressed with the Customer Service Dept. for Doxie. I have used the Doxie to scan family pictures and to scan receipts. Most impressive is how fast I can scan pictures and put them on a thumb drive.
5,Works perfectly. Easy to use & set up. Great customer service.
5,I was given one of these for free to replace my Doxie One that happened to be a dud. It's easy to use and I've zero trouble with it so far. I've also had a number of customer reps reach out to me to make sure the replacement was working for me. I'm happy to leave this review and expect my new Doxie Go Plus to last me a good while!
5,I received my Doxie Go scanner as a gift from my daughter.  I had been trying to find just the right scanner and felt rather overwhelmed with the many choices.  I love this scanner!  It is perfect for my needs.  It takes up very little room on my desk yet I can scan all my receipts and other documents in so easily to keep on my computer and not have to keep all that paper!  I did not buy it for photos but I was very impressed at how well it scans my old photos also.  Highly recommend this scanner.
5,Sorry if this reads like an advertisement but this is so awesome. I have had it for a year but I can't get over how low maintenance and perfect this thing is. I shipped it to someone else to use and it got broken so I contacted Doxie to see what a repair might cost and Doxie IMMEDIATELY contacted me back and once they had received my old one sent me an upgraded new one for free! Customer service great warranty service willingness to do repairs in the first place...all that stuff is important when you make a fairly large investment for a specific need and Doxie really delivered.
5,Product works extremely well. Feeds easily and links to computer well to allow one to get rid of loads of paper for archiving etc.I'd also like to mention their excellent customer service in dispatches. After 2 or so years of scanning happily my product stopped working. I sent an email ticket in and after suggesting a couple of ways of fixing the problem (which sadly didn't work) they shipped me out a replacement. The latency on their emails was <<24 hours and I had a replacement within a week.
5,Great portable scanner.  Feeds well easy to store great software. Great scan quality. Really helps me keep the office tidy.
5,Second Doxie Go I have owned.....LOVE them!
5,I love my Doxie. It is easy-to-use and helps me keep my paper under control. I keep a small stack of documents to be scanned. When I get 5 or 10 minutes I scan them and get rid of them. All cleaned up! I like that I can store the scans in the Doxie until I want to transfer them. This is a great product!
3,It's perfect at scanning.However it's slow to startup and it's even slower to connect to WiFi. In general the whole WiFi experience with this device is clunky.My advice: don't waste your money on the wifi. It's a novelty that quickly becomes a chore. I just use the cable now and I am very content with that solution.
5,Doxie is the best technological enhancement to my life in a very long time.  I have already recommended it to several friends.  It makes scanning easy fast portable and fun.  I got the wifi model because ultimately everything goes wireless AND it has the most remote storage capability.
5,Love my Doxie and love their customer service. Portable scanner holds a charge longer than I expected and software is super easy to use. Particularly like ability to "staple" docs together into a single pdf as needed.I travel for work and this provides superior resolution scans ( as opposed to phone aps) especially for legal docs and fine print. Does a great job and doesnt add much weight to my bag.
5,Great customer service. My older unit stopped working and Doxie sent me a new Doxie GO SE that works great.
5,I love this scanner it's light compact and easy to use.  I scanned a large box of photos in a couple of hours one afternoon.  I love it!
2,Charged battery.  Did not use immediately.  When I went to use it the battery was already dead and it was never turned on.The instructions for setup are overly simplistic and basically tell you to set it up and use it.  No detailed step by step directions for those who do not understand.  Not impressed at all.  How to connect Wifi..... turn it on enable wifi use same network start using.  Really?  Why even write instructions if that's all you got.  I'm considering returning it.  And unless you use the app it won't produce pdf files only jpeg.
5,I love this scanner!  It is portable and easy to use. I can take it wherever I want to scan - my studio my dinning room table or on a TV tray in front of my favorite chair. No cords. No wires. The best!
5,The Doxie Go Plus is excellent and functions exactly as claimed by Doxie's description. It is extremely easy to use and the results of each scan has been perfect. I would compare my satisfaction with the Doxie to that of the many Apple products purchased over the years: Beautiful design extremely easy to use and great value for money spent. Highly recommend to those looking for a great portable scanner and would definitely buy this product again.
5,great product!
2,Scans contain multiple vertical lines (even after cleaning) and yellow background. Some of the documents are also erroneously cropped. The app is missing several basic features and takes forever to connect to the scanner.
5,Amazing.I use this product for scanning in a few papers every week. The portability of the device is it's best feature.
5,It just works. Turns on quickly scans fast enough for personal use (I wouldn't try and use it in an office or anything). Software also just works and makes OCR effortless. WiFi + battery is great - no cables. Does have a maximum page length which can be exceeded when scanning really long shop receipts (just have to cut or fold them before scanning).
1,There's two modes you can scan one in 300dpi and 600dpi for the other. At 600dpi the scanner will stop in the middle of scanning and will not resume or it will not accept the picture to start feeding. At the 300dpi the photo scans fine however the scanner doesn't want to accept the pictures through the feeder. I'll present the picture to the feeder as per the instructions and the photo will just sit there. After poking the picture the feeder will finely realized there's a photo there and it will start scanning Very  disappointed I'll be reaching out to their customer support I may have just received a defective unit.
5,This is probably one of the better of my purchases. Be sure to get the "Eye-Fi Connect X2" or other compatible eye fi card. Originally go the Eye-FI Mobi but that does not connect to a network like the X2 (Ad-Hoc style or vice versa)Any receipt i just scan it in and organize into subfolders later. After a brief setup it is ready to go. about 100 scans (i'd say less) per charge.You can scan 300dpi (green light) or 600dpi (yellow light). 300 is fine dont worry.I've gone through my filing cabinet. threw away junk and scanned in the essentials. Not large enough to scan my Massachusetts birth certificate (too wide) or a car loan document (too long). but in general gets the job done quickly and efficiently.
5,These people know customer service.  A few days after receiving my device I received an unsolicited email asking me how the product was working and if I had any technical questions on how to use it.  I was pretty impressed since this item isn't a lot of money.  I did have a software glitch and they responded to my emails immediately offering me technical support.  When I say immediately I mean immediately within minutes.  The scanner works great and the images are very good quality.  I would have no problem recommending this product.  Tony - WA
5,Love my Doxie. Fast accurate easy. Helps me stay out from under piles and piles of paper. It's much better to hoard digitally :-)For the next version I'd love to see bluetooth and the use of microUSB for charging/recharging (like everything else in my fleet).
5,I really like the portability of this little beast.I am able to scan documents wherever I am and at the end of the day I upload them to my laptop or to iPad via wifi.The product looks great and feels solid!I had trouble understanding some things on how to operate the scanner so I contacted customer service; they have resolved all my questions over the phone and also sent out PDF manuals to my email so I can refer to them later.I really love this product! It will make my life (scanning) much easier!
5,Best device I ever purchased. Convenience simple fast easy and practical to eliminate paper work and eliminate the need to fax documents. One can print/sign/scan/email back. It scans photos quite well too. For the price and portability this is the scanning device for professionals students and everybody in between.
5,I bought the Doxie wireless 3 months ago and I found it easy to use however the feeder for scanner has malfunctioned and now it is useless.  I am awaiting a response from the company.  I am interested if anyone else has experienced this problem.  Customer service responded quickly and is replacing this with no questions asked.  I am delighted and can't wait to start using it again.
1,I have had 3 of these and everyone of them has quit working on the right side rollers.  One of them was replaced at no cost to me but now the replacement one has done the same thing.  I bought one for my home office at the same time and it has done the same thing.  Veryy frustrating trying to get the paper to feed the left side goes the right side doesn't.
5,Excellent portable scanner You are able to scan a multitude of different size documents including photos receiptsetc without the use of a computer. You have an option of using the internal memory or external SD flash memory. Charge the unit before leaving the house and you are ready to scan. Highly recommend it.
5,Absolutely in love with this little thing! The quality of the scans are amazing for what we need (scanning documents) and so convenient as we work outside of the office frequently. Would definitely recommend this portable scanner for anyone in the market for one!
1,Does not work at all and never has. Waste of $
1,My refund was processed faster than it took for the advertised “24/7” tech support to respond to my e-mail. No live person was available. I downloaded all the apps but this was not easy to set up and after a good 4 hours I gave up. Purchased on Prime day and now see why it was so heavily discounted.
5,Great product. Simple to use. Works as advertised. Only compliant no software for chrome books.
1,This might be the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. I dropped $200 on it (give or take) so I feel like I have to use it. However it misfeeds CONSTANTLY. If I'm scanning a five-page document I'm lucky to get away with just seven or eight or nine scans with two or three or four to be discarded because of a misfeed. And that's with crisp paper with sharp edges. Forget about scanning something a little wrinkly or with folds.Meanwhile the interaction between scanner and machine appears to have been designed by someone with severe brain damage. You can't actually scan while the device is connected to the computer. Why? Who knows? But if it happens to have been drained and you need to do a scan then guess what? You get to wait 20 minutes for it to charge.
5,Love this!  Easy to scan and quickly upload!  Small enough to carry with me.
5,awesome product. i recommend it for anybody on the go or trying to save space on their desk.
5,Such an extremely easy tool to use.  It made scanning old photos a painless process.  So QUICK....So EASY.
5,Very easy to use.  No problems with it.  I have quit using scan function on my printer - too slow too difficult compared to DoxieGo.
5,Exellent scanner! I can take it everywhere very portable. Just the perfect size. I can scan a various types of documents and fotos. Muy bueno!!!!!!
5,Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it. Easy for her to use portable. Great tool.
5,Doxie is fantastic.  Simple set up intuitive software. The quality of the unit and the scans can't be beat.  It's a no brainier purchase.
5,Small size battery lasts a long time wifi works well and overall I just really love using my Doxie. Highly recommended and no complaints!
5,It is very easy to use.  Quality to the scans are great and long battery life.
5,Great scanner! Love the wi-fi built in. Flawless getting scans into my iPhone or Mac.
5,Easy to use high quality plenty of features.
5,Love it!  It is a great scanner and high quality.  Great price and great customer service!
5,Great little scanner! Portable wi-fi and works wonderfully for documents and photos!
5,{I received a free scanner to review for my web site and am also sharing a review here.}This scanner has been so easy to use. Everything is built in so you really can just scan and sync. I love the size of the internal memory about 450 pages or 1800 photos and the battery life is excellent. Quality of the scans is great and the speed is perfect too. Highly recommend.
5,Great product. Easy to use very convenient to move around and it works!
5,This thing is great. My mom is a receipt police. there are always stacks of receipts on her desk and now she can view them all on her computer and find them easily.
5,Excellent.  Simple and effective.
1,This is the 2nd Doxie Go I've had already and it's still a piece of crap. The first one I received as a gift stopped feeding the paper on the left side. They sent me a replacement. The second one I have now does not feed the paper period. I can no longer use this scanner. I used it only occasionally and kept it tucked away in a desk drawer safe from breaks and falls. There is no reason for this scanner to fail after only 5-10 instances of use. I'm done with this brand and this company.
5,This Doxie Go has made scanning a breeze! I work from home full-time and need to print and scan and many documents every week. This scanner is easy to use and the customer service is fantastic. I contacted them to troubleshoot and immediately received a call back. The rep explained things clearly and I was scanning in no time - by the way the issues weren't the scanner's fault they were mine. Very happy with this product and company!
5,Great little scanner. Easy to use. Was exactly what I was looking for!
5,Simply said...I LOVE IT! If you want to go paperless this should be your next purchase!
5,The product was all it was adversitezed to be
5,The Doxie Go is a great little device especially when used with the Eye-Fi wireless SD card: open your mail scan whatever you need to archive and it just appears on your computer after a few seconds it really is that simple. Scan quality is great too - 300dpi is perfect for quickly scanning mail. Warmly recommended.
5,I originally bought the Doxie Go for portability between my two homes but use it 90% of the time even though my desk scanner is down the hall.  It's fun quick and the memory allows me to scan far more papers than I would have without it.
5,This is really well designed and very easy to use. Does one thing and does it very nicely. And the OCR software that's included works surprisingly well.
5,Amazing!
1,Doesn't scan the document straight.
5,When it first arrived I followed the directions but still couldn't get it turned on. I contacted the company who helped me determine there was a battery issue that couldn't be resolved and they sent me a new one with instructions and paid shipping for the exchange. They were fast to respond to all my questions shipping and had great customer service! The scanner is great too and I like the portability of it! The quality of the scans is also better than I expected for the price (and that's even on the lower setting).
5,I just got this scanner yesterday. Normally I would wait until I've had for awhile before writing a review.  However I'm very impressed with this scanner and I've tried a couple of cheaper scanners in the past.  Here are my current comments:1.  The instructions are very easy to read and understand.2.  The installation is very easy and quick3.  The operation is both simple and fast.4.  The scan results are very good  and usable.5.  The initial battery charge was only a few hours.6.  The learning curve is short.This another example of the old cliche' "You get what you pay for." The two previous scanners that I tried were cheaper than this Doxie and only gave poor results.  I'm mostly using this for sales receipts but may use it for some old snapshots also.  The OCR feature does work to search for words in a .pdf document too.
5,The scanner in my all-in-one printer died and I did not want to buy another unit given that the copier and printer still work. I do need a scanner in my home office though and after researching what's out there I decided to take a chance on this Doxie. I'm so glad I did! The set-up couldn't be any easier and the operation is straightforward. I did a few test scans and transferred the images to my computer using the USB cable and the Doxie software. I also tested the "staple" feature where you can take individual scans and combine them into one document. It worked flawlessly. You can save your scans in pdf format too which was important for me. Very happy with my purchase!
5,A really great product. I inherited two storage boxes filled with loose photos some dating from the early 1900s. I sorted and started to scan on a flatbed scanner. It was extremely time consuming. I saw this scanner and it had an automatic feed. Out of the box the scanner was extremely easy to set up. The instructions were easy to understand. I went to their webpage and it included more in-depth instructions and short videos to demonstrate some of the functions. I scanned hundreds of photos quickly and without any problems. The quality is good. I also scanned old documents which also came out good. I only wish I had gotten this scanner sooner as it would have saved me a lot of time and aggravation. A great price too.
5,Device performs its tasks very well.  I have been using it to scan in my photo albums.  I scan in an album in the device and then attach it to a computer later to transfer the files.  The doxie software works well and it is very easy to crop photos if needed.  I couldn't be happier with it.  Just found out it has a computer tether mode as well haven't tried it but it is good to know it can do it.
5,Using to digitize hundreds of family photos. Process is quick and easy and the quality of the scan files is outstanding. Unit is lightweight so easy to take where needed. The people at Doxie have been so friendly - proactively reached out after I received the product to make sure no questions about or problems with the setup. Able to export the scans to my iPad or PC then organize and upload to whatever Cloud storage I choose to use. The first time I used I scanned in over 300 pictures in about 15 minutes while watching TV!  Would have probably taken over 2 hours if I had used my flatbed scanner!  Definitely highly recommend.
5,We purchased this product to scan old photos.  Goal: to get rid of the many old photo albums collecting dust on bookshelves.  The Doxie works great!  Scanning each photo is quick and easy and the resulting digital picture is as clear as the original.  Highly recommend this product.
5,I purchased this scanner in order to digitize a collection of very old photos. So far it has performed flawlessly. I think the scan quality at 600 dpi is very good. The user interface is easy to use on my Windows PC. I liked that Doxie reached out shortly after purchasing to see if I had any questions or issues. I like this little scanner.
5,I have loved this little scanner.  It is portable so I can take it with me anywhere. I have scanned lots of tax documents and also some photos. I plan on scanning lots more photos very soon.You do need to make sure you place the scanner on a flat surface to get the best quality.I have imported over wifi and with the scanner connected to the computer. No problems either way.So glad I purchased this.
5,The Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi does a GREAT Job using OCR meaning it converts all my medical records into "Word Documents". I'm more than happy with this product...
5,This is the second Doxie scanner I have purchased. So I am a return buyer they are dependable and easy to use fits well in briefcase or backpack very sturdy
5,Very user friendly! Works with our phones and computers. Easy to set up!
5,When I had a paper feeding problem with my first Doxie Go SE I was promptly contacted by the company.  Doxie immediately arranged for me to receive a new scanner from Amazon.  The new scanner is performing excellently and I am especially impressed with the customer service shown by the Doxie company.  Only a company that has faith in its product quality would perform as Doxie has.Steve Tippett
5,I use the doxie for photographs and documents and it has been outstanding for both. They are not kidding about the software or the support both far above average. Very happy with this product  would buy it again.
5,I ordered this to digitize a few thousand old family photos. So far has been working like a champ! Ive already processed close to 1800 and have had no issues. My only regret is not getting the wifi version but I needed it fast.
5,I used Doxie for scanning photos. Great quality and the editing software was very easy to use. The company stayed in contact with me to make sure I had no issues and for feedback on there product.
5,Simple to use Let me eliminate a file cabinet. Everybody should have one!
5,The Doxie scanner is a great value for the price is easy to use and the customer support is great.
5,I did not have any issues with this. I did however edit each photo to the size I preferred. It worked out great. I was able to upload a lot of old photos very quickly.
5,Plug and play item.  So far quality has been good and it's easy to use.  Good quality for the price.
5,very good
5,I loved this scanner for lots of photos.  I scanned thousands of family photos very quickly with this scanner.  You can scan to 600dpi and they go in straight!  I had purchased a different small brother scanner like this and if you wanted to use auto-skew and auto-crop it would only do it at 300dpi.  I returned it and bought this.  It did the job and did it right.  Scans about one photo every 4 seconds.  Great product.
5,The scanner works great. It does everything I need. Thank you
5,It took me a bit to figure out the scanner on the WiFi end (that’s my technological in capability not the product) but it works so wonderfully. I purchased this to digitize my grandmother’s boxes of photos. The pictures come out crisp and clear. The scanner itself is so light and easy to use. The app that goes along with it is easy too! I’ve been using the highest resolution and it’s not too slow at all. I can see how many many full-size documents could be time consuming but the photos go through in a breeze! I’m so happy with this purchase. Being able to save and send old photos with such great quality is amazing. Hopefully the quality of this product will continue!
5,I was able to scan documents that I sitting around for years.
5,Easy to set up.  Works very well.  Great customer support & communication!
5,Easy to use. Very portable makes conversion of pictures and documents very easy
5,This little scanner is awesome. I’m scanning my mom’s old photos and it does a great job. There’s a blip every once in awhile where it makes the picture small on the screen but I’ve just rescanned. You do have to have a 32 gig or smaller SD card in the machine even if you want to send photos directly to a computer - it doesn’t work without it. So far so good!
5,We bought ours in November 2021 and used it right away to scan in a bunch of photos. We put it away and the next time we pulled it out it wouldn't charge or turn on. Turns out to be a faulty battery but Doxie support sent us a replacement Doxie and had us ship the old one back. The service was quick we even got the replacement the next day. Back to scanning all the old photos again!
5,I love mine. This is my operating system and other scanners would not work with my laptop at all. Doxie was a breeze to setup.Snapdragon (TM) 8cx @ 2.84 GHz 2.84 GHz64-bit operating system ARM-based processorWindows 10 Home
5,This is a great scanner for scanning in old photos.  It does all of the cropping which creates less work once you download them.  It is very easy to setup and use.
5,We use the Doxie SE primarily to scan photographs. Recently we have begun to scan saved magazine and newspaper articles for classroom use. The quality or the resulting transfer is exceptional. The support provided by the company is exemplary and the on-line manual is complete coherent and consumer friendly.  Considering the price it has proved to be a worthwhile investment.
5,Purchased this to scan photos for Father-in-laws funeral.  I created a slideshow from his old army photos and when he was a young man.  It is so easy to use and extremely fast.  I could not keep up with it.  I would load a photo it starts automatically and before I could pick the next photo it was done.  I would zip thru 300 photos at a time in just a few minutes.  Now we are taking the boxes of photos and scanning them so each member of the family can have them.Then I went back to work and used this scanner to scan documents which saved me from driving to the office.  It will scan photos documents receipts everything.  After getting it other family members fell in love with it and now it is the top of their Christmas lists.  Great company great product.
5,This is a great addition to my home office! Clean and easy interface and VERY easy to use. I use the SD card option. Good quality scans. Was looking at much more expensive options but I'm so pleased with this purchase!!!
5,Works great with iPad over WiFi.
5,Started out hard to work with but now I love it!
5,This is a great little addition to a huge family photo collection project.  Easy set up and simple to use.
5,Outstanding portable scanner.  I purchased this scanner when my Epson DS-40 failed after 3552 photo scans. The Doxie Go SE is much easier to operate the software is very intuitive and user friendly.  Additionally the scanner opens up for easy cleaning something the Epson didn't do.  Overall I am very satisfied with this device and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a scanner convert old photos to digital.
5,This little does exactly what I need it to do without being overly complicated. Works every time & you do not need a 4 year degree in tech to get it done. Only thing I dislike a little is the very thin receipts sometimes don't trigger the auto feed switch I just fold over about a quarter inch of the bottom of the receipt and it does the trick.
5,Works great. Customer support wasn’t able to assist with setup. I had to consult Apple. It wasn’t a Dixie issue. Works great. Love the photo editing tools❤️
5,I have gone digital 😀. All my recipes are scanned into my computer. So easy to find. Time efficient.  Next will be my receipts then family history with pictures. I love this easy to use product.
5,Scans perfectly!! Copy and paste into a word document edit and there ya go! Couldn’t be easier. Scanning multiple pages is super easy . Create a book and then you have all them pages in one file.Genius!!! Love it!
5,This is easy to use
5,Been putting off for years the need to scan a bunch of old printed photos.  Finally decided this year to do it and got the doxie. It is so easy to use.  Charge it. Put in the sd card.  Software download is optional but Ingot it and it is easy to use.  Just stick photos in it and off you go. I am pleased with the quality at 600dpi.  The scans are crisp and clear.  Probably takes 2-3 seconds to scan a 6x4 photo. I have found I can do about 700 photos per charge.  Had it about a month now and have no issuea.  This is a no brainer.  If you have to convert a bunch of old photos just get this.
5,I bought the Doxie Go SE to capture old pictures newspaper clippings and other documents.  I wish I had purchased it a long time ago.  The Doxie Go SE was absolutely great - easy to setup easy to use and had some very nice features like stapling documents together once scanned.  I was able to get through over 300 pictures and documents in a few hours.  I recommend the photo sleeves if you are going to deal with photos or documents that are older.  I also bought the carrying case and it was really useful.  The Doxie Go SE is lightweight and very easy to take along on a research trip.  A must have if you are going to go visit relatives with family documents or even archives that allow you to copy documents.  Highly recommended!ADDITIONI have been using the scanner on and off for about a year.  After not using it for about 4 months when I went to charge it the battery would not charge.  I contacted Doxie customer support explained the problem and they have shipped me a new battery!  No hassles just great customer support.  While I was disappointed that the battery had died I am being pleased with the level of customer support.  I will make sure to charge my Doxie every so often if I have a period of time I may not be using it.  The scanner continues to scan great.  Thanks Doxie customer support!
5,This is a super nice scanner. Lightweight portable easy user interface. I’m very pleased with the picture scanning they are sharp and produces true colors. It suits my needs more than I expected.
5,Easy to set up and use. I have scanned over 600 pictures and the quality of scan is great. Customer Service is awesome they go over and beyond to insure their customers are satisfied and happy.
5,I picked up this scanner after reading multiple reviews on Amazon. I'm glad I did. This is perfect for my needs and super easy to use. Their customer service is top notch too. The only thing that would be nice is an Android app for the scanner to hook to via WiFi to make sure the scan is correct if you have to leave the document elsewhere but I haven't had an issue with incorrect scans so it's really just more of a personal preference.
5,I’m really happy with my Doxie scanner. It’s easy to use and is perfect for uploading all of my photos. I love the portability and its small size and I’m impressed with the quality of the scanned photos.
5,It took me a while to push myself to finally organize and e-file all my paperwork bills receipts etc.  But when I did it was incredibly easy and fast.  I called tech support because I was having a bit of trouble with small receipts and she not only talked me through and emailed me how to rectidfy it she mailed me some plastic sleeves they sell to make it a breeze.  I also got a call from another customer rep checking on how I was doing who gave me another tip- set up OCR so you can search words off the pdf.  Finally I can get rid of the huge file cabinet and find things easily.
5,Scans great.  A little hard to keep the wireless connection but easy to transfer files via the SD card.  Overall a good tool
5,This is one little devil. Quite a workhorse. I liked the fact that it is handy and easy to scan.
5,This compact light and easy to use scanner works like a charm.  The wireless capability puts it head and shoulders over the competition. Tech support team is terrific!
5,Let me start by saying I own two other scanners. A multifunction copy/printer/scanner and a photo scanner so I certainly didn't *need* this Doxie scanner. But I'm certainly glad I bought it. The portability is superb and the software is incredibly easy and logical. I'm now scanning mail as it comes in and shredding it immediately making it digital and searchable is a huge plus. It's 2021 it's time for paper communication to go away but until it does at least I don't have to continue collecting it just in case I need to reference. Do yourself a favor and buy this and start going paperless yourself.
5,I've owned probably a dozen scanners in the past.  Most were complicated computer tethered and required a high learning curve to master.  Then along came the little Doxie and I fell in love.  Five minutes out of the box found me scanning documents and photos up a storm.  The Doxie is so simple and intuitive I barely looked at the manual. It fits comfortably in my brief case and doesn't require a computer or cord to scan. I scan on the go and download the results later as JPEGS or PDF files on my computer. Give this little giant a try. You won't be sorry. It's so easy it's fun.
5,You charge it out of the box attach USB from Scanner to Computer or USB charging port.  Will be at an event and having this portable scanner will make my situation easier.  Cardd paper saves to the 16 GB disk that comes with the product capacity is 32 GB nothing higher and if you want 32GB you'll have to buy that separately. Comes with instructions and link to website to download the Doxie Software to install.  Works like other scanners I've owned like it so far.  The battery is almost like a Camera DSLR square in shape when you 1st connect it to the computer light on front comes on RED which means its charging and turns off with the charge is complete.  Read the scanning instruction either online or the instruction card that comes with it for the different operations.
2,I typically have no problem connecting my peripherals to my computer (MacBook Pro); however everything I’ve tried doesn’t work. The main reason people get this is for its portability so when you can’t use it wirelessly it’s a big downgrade to the product.
5,Doxie Go SE is a Awesome product to have. Doxie Staff went Above and Beyond to make sure that I had a satisfying experience. I want to thank personally Charles Aguilar he helped me with the issues I was having with my Doxie. The  Doxie will definitely help me when I'm on the road and don't have my computer with me.
5,Great scanner. So easy to use and quality is excelkent. Live the portability and connection options for uploading. No issues. Wish I had purchased one sooner. Customer support is extremely helpful no matter what the question.
3,The scanner is generally an ok experience but there has been some frustration around batteries.The battery in the first scanner I received wore out over time and when left for an extended period (6 months or so) without charge it would not charge or power on.I was sent a replacement and transplanted the battery from the replacement into my old scanner and it powered on and appeared to charge. Charging on the scanner is a completely opaque process. It takes a really long time with no progress indicator. The only signal you have is that the red light will turn off when the battery is charged. In the case of my broken battery the light was never on because of precisely the opposite - this is not good user experience.The scanner is best suited for document scanning. I tested it with some photo scans and I had streaky lines from the rollers. After giving it a thorough wipe down with alcohol wipe and a microfibre cloth the streaks went away and I got some pretty nice high DPI scans. Note: The streaky lines were experienced on the brand new replacement not the old model.I found the scanner to be quite slow in general especially on startup. The built-in computer that runs the web server is quite underpowered. It took 5 minutes after it joined my WiFi network for the web server to start up.The best and fastest experience I have had is plugging in via USB (which negates standby and battery issues) and using the provided software to import scans (negating the WiFi issues).I originally hoped to use this device as an effortless solution to scan a letter or document and automatically send it to external software (paperless-ngx etc). This wasn't initially possible but maybe one day I'll get it working the way I like.
3,The Doxie idea is a great one and the scanner works as advertised.  I limit my rating to 3 stars though because it is very finicky with how paper is being fed into it.  If the pages have any creases or tiny tears on the leading edge (being fed into the scanner) be prepared for failed attempts.  Considering this is a portable scanner and is designed to scan receipts and other documents as you receive them it's hard to guarantee the quality of the paper being fed into it.  I'm surprised that someone at Doxie felt that this was acceptable.
4,This is my first scanner and its main purpose is to scan all my photos and documents so we can go paperless.So far I have scanned about 300 pictures ranging from size from a wallet size picture to 8X10's.Picture quality is good however every so often there will be a vertical white line over several consecutive scans.After about 5 or even up to 100 scans later it will still be there and then it'll go away.Then it will come back in another area.I referred to the Doxie web site and cleaned the lenses as per their suggestion with their microfibre cloth.  That worked.However vertical lines is not what I expect to see on a brand new scanner (it actually started on the 5th scan).So overall it's good.  But you have to keep it very clean from the get-go.
4,We have scanned several thousands photos so far and I love  the 600 dpi setting. I use the jpg's for electronic slide shows so resolution is important. I love the fact that it is portable and will scan to a SD card. Simple to use and it will scan up to a 8x10 photo. I can lend it out to others for pictures I need for a slide show for me or others. I have only used it for photo's so far and it works as expected. Very fast at 300dpi a little slower at 600 but a much better jpg file . Sometimes pictures don't go in straight  that is use error. The more time you spend doing scans the better you become and a level insert. Only dislike to toggle the power switch the light goes from green to red. As a color challenged male it's difficult for me to confirm the slight change. I dedicated switch would be great. Battery seems to last quite a while used it for a few hours in a one setting and it lasted. A little bit more than I wanted to spend but now I am glad I did.
4,This company has an outstanding customer service. They did communicate with me and tried to remedy my concerns to the fullest. Once I try the replaced product I may change my comments below.This product in one word doesn't work. It's not as it's described either. I bought it to archive my receipts on the go.1. It doesn't connect to the wifi. It's a little weird connection. Even if you can connect it and it should get connected next time automatically that doesn't happen. You will have to connect it each time through a very long troubling procedure.I am a reasonable buyer of Amazon this is the first time I have got a junk through Amazon.
5,I've been extremely happy with this product. I purchased it to scan through 1000s of photos taken before moving to digital. The process of using the Doxie for scanning photos is _so_ much easier and faster than using a flatbed scanner and the scanning resolution and quality is indistinguishable from what I was getting from a more expensive flatbed. I also love the ability to scan without being tethered to a computer. You can sit in front of the TV and scan dozens of packs of old photos in no time and then transfer them to the computer later. Good stuff.
5,Two years ago I inherited over two thousand pages of family paperwork (legal documents photos the works) and the responsibilities that went with it.Sorting through that mess and determining what was and what was not important was a potential nightmare so I started scanning and sorting things that way.Scanning every document naming them by date and content and using the PC to sort rather than sifting through boxes of unsorted paper seemed the way to go but with over 4000 pages (estimate) it was a daunting task.Originally I used the flatbed scanner on my printer but on a page-by-page basis it was taking over 45 seconds a page and required lifting the scanner cover flipping the page and starting the PC software to scan for each page. Given the amount of paper I knew it would be over year's work but that way would take many years and be exhausting to boot.With the doxie it's simply a matter of sticking the paper into the intake feeder. The scanner then grips the paper and pulls it through to the other others side. At this point the page has been scanned (the top side; you'll have to flip and rescan the other side if dealing with double sided material) and written to either the onboard memory or the USB thumb drive you attached. Since the scanner is portable and doesn't need to be connected to a PC I found I could easily feed page by page while watching a movie on TV. Doing this I was able to scan between 50-100 pages a night on average.There are some disadvantages compared to a flatbed scanner. Because it uses a feeder it works best with flat paper. So older documents which are crinkled or torn can be tricky. For the family photo from 1870 that looks like it would disintegrate if you breathe on it hard shoving it through a feeder may not be the wisest thing to do. There is a transparent photo wrapper you can use - put the photo in the wrapper and run the wrapper through. I've not tried it though; for delicate paperwork I still use the flatbed. It may very well work but I'm just a little leery of shoving irreplaceable photos through a feeder of any kind when there is a no-risk alternative available. I did run the few 1970-era Polaroid photos I had through it; there weren't any issues although the colour reproduction wasn't perfect it was still pretty good. It's as good as I would expect outside of a dedicated photo scanner.The scanner calibrates based on the top of the page so if the top of the page is cut or uneven loading the page from the bottom works better. Likewise bent/torn cash register receipts and the like often won't enter from the top but work fine from the side.I did have a problem with an overlength (as in longer than legal length) document. The page was simply too long; the scanner read 90% of it figured it was too long and then spit it back out. Given that the scanner supports "up to" legal size documents that's a fair cop. I folded that one and used the flatbed. I have scanned numerous legal size pages with no issues.Once scanning is done either hook the scanner up to the PC or use the USB to take the scans over to the PC. If using the USB thumb drive be sure that the scanner has timed out (ie. the light is off) before removing the USB. The scanner delays the writes to USB while scanning is taking place so if you scan a number of pages the USB will be behind by a bit. Everything is written to disk before the device times out.The scans are all in standard JPG format although you can use the supplied software to convert them to PDF. I did that a few times but given the nature of what I was scanning it really didn't add much value. For other people it may well be worthwhile.I did have a problem with the battery running down surprisingly quickly (in one case a fully charged battery scanned 200+ pages but another time it barely lasted 30 pages) and I contacted Doxie about it. Normally you charge the scanner from your PC via the USB; there is no supplied charger. When I asked about the battery issue I was having Doxie sent me a charger at no cost (there's a "no charge" pun to be made here somewhere) without my even requesting one (I'd simply sent an email asking if the battery life was normal and they took the initiative to send me a charger) and I've not had a problem since. Maybe my USB ports weren't supplying enough of a charge or something.I've been using the scanner for over 18 months and have scanned over 5700 pages and the scanner is still going strong.To anyone considering a scanner I strongly recommend this. There are only two limitations I can think of - delicate paper should not be used with any feed-based scanner and if your needs involve a sheet feeder this isn't the scanner for you. But as a general document scanner I can't recommend this highly enough.
5,Amazing product!We rarely have chance to buy a high quality and affordable product like this these day.Even the packaging is well thinked protective film around the machine instruction to download the software on top of the machine a small piece of blue tape over the "page format slider" to make sure you know this piece exist battery was pre-charged and at full charge when I received it. The software look and feel is great Even the sounds effect! and of course the result... I scanned a scrap paper that has been folded multiple time and the result is perfect the OCR text recognition was flawless the auto-rotate and auto correction feature was perfect the first time. At your first use you know that a whole team has spent alot of time around a table to make this product.I am a proud owner of a Doxie!
4,This thing is a road warriors best friend. It is even great for the office. If you have massive wads of receipts bills and misc papers you need to sort and organize this is the device that will save the day. Great invention in scanning. Good battery life.I removed one star because the photo scanning is a little dark and washed out (even after adjustments). Don't expect to use this to digitize your photo collection unless you aren't too serious about quality. As a document scanner this thing is second-to-none. As a photo scanner you can do better.
1,OK when it works. But it doesn't work most of the time - at least on MACs. I have run two versions (Sierra and High Sierra) on 3 mac devices 2 macbook air's and 1 mac mini. It's hit and miss. Most recently miss. Just doesn't recognize the scanner or we get a message saying its in tethered mode which it is not. Just won't scan so uh it gets a 1 star. Would not recommend for mac users. Life is too short for so many irritations!
5,This is a great portable little scanner. Works very well. I use it mostly for scanning photos with the hi DPI setting. Works great for regular text documents too. Would definitely recommend this scanner. I might suggest upgrading to the go wifi to simplify synchronization of documents to the computer without need of cables but otherwise this is great scanner worth every penny.
4,Overall a great product.  Convenient and fast.I'm using it to electronic-ify old papers  The kinds of things that I think I may want to refer to later but often never do.  Here the Doxie is great.  It lowers the barrier just enough for me to get through some scans.  It's actually kinda fun (for reference I've also done a large number of scans with flatbeds.  I do not consider those to be fun.)I will say that's it's hard to get the scans to come out perfectly straight probably because there's no document tray.  I watched the video and read the tips on the Doxie site and it has helped but I'd say 10-20% of the scans are still a little askew.  The most common problem for me is getting the top of the document to feed straight.  Often I'm left will a small black wedge in the top right hand corner of my scans.  I'm guessing that that's because the feeder has a higher bias to catch documents on the top left (for photos and business cards) so it's stronger than on the right.  The bottom of the scans seem even however (I don't know how this happens.)  It doesn't affect the readability and is very minor but is noticeable.  The software really helps here - make use of the rotation and trim (trim top trim bottom etc.) features to clean up the scans.  If you're a perfectionist this will probably drive you crazy and you may want to look elsewhere.  I'm trying to stay on top of everything and will happily sacrifice some skew for the heaping pile of convenience.I've used dedicated flatbed and scanner/printers in the past but haven't had any experience with portable or sheet-fed scanners so I can't comment on how they compare.I'm not a road warrior so I also can't comment on how well it works when travelling.I also didn't OCR my work so I can't say how well that works either.I've had this for a week or so and have done ~300 scans.
5,If you haven't much space on your desk or need a reliable easy to use portable scanner I highly recommend this one. It was easy to set up with the guide and ready to use as soon as it was charged.  It Is easy to scan and transfer to a computer to handle as you please. The Doxie website has support if needed.  Additional items such as a travel case and photo scanning sheets are available separately. Customer service is superior.  This is the first company that has ever reached out to me after purchase to say thanks and find out how things were working out with the scanner.
5,Takes a while to get used to but once you do it really made going through my whole filling cabinet very easy.The included OCR software is great and you can export your files to a cloud (I saved them direrctly then added them to Google Drive but it allows direct uploads).It can also scan thicker items like id cards and cards. You might have to give the rollers some help (I didnt expect it to be able to scan stuff like that). Just don't scan items that have glitter glue/ink/paint because it will make a mess (the kit comes with a cleaner).This is a great scanner and works great if you really take the time to use it. Also if you intend on making multiple scans at home I recommend you leave the wall charger plugged in.
5,Easy to use. Very fast scanning. Has made scanning work receipts so much easier. Only downside is the scanning software for Mac is frustrating to use. The software frequently needs to be restarted in order to preview or rename scanned files.
5,The process of scanning is really easy and quick.  The scans are clear and OCR works perfectly.Importing the scans to the computer is a little fiddly.  The WiFi connections is really slow to connect so I have been using the SD card mostly.  Importing the scans is also a bit slow.  Changing the names of the files can only be done before the import.Overall a great little scanner that is used every day and has removed our paper mess!
4,Excellent scanner pour l'usage quotidien quand vous avez à numériser plusieurs documents sur la route sans avoir à être connecté sur un ordinateur. l'autonomie de la batterie est très bien et l'envoi de fichier via WiFi est pratique. Seul bémol si vous avez plusieurs pages de numérisés le transfert peu être long mais c'est surement quelque chose qui peut-être amélioré pour le futur!
5,I have been looking for something to scan my old pictures.  This was it!!!  It's so sleek and portable.  I've done pictures documents and receipts.  I bought the recommended carrying case with it as well.  I would definitely recommend.
4,The Doxie Go WIfi is way more usefull than I initially expected it to be. The scanning process is fast and the fact you can scan without being connected to a computer is very nice.I was pleasently surprised to learn you don't even need Wifi to scan you only need it to transfer your scans which are stored in the device once you are done.The two small downsides to this device are the setup process which required help from their website and the sometimes hard to align receipt.I was buying it because I needed a scanner but I never expected to enjoy using it as much as I do.
5,If you operate your own business this is a must in keeping your receipts organized. Specially the longer receipts which cannot be easily scanned using your phone.It's very easy to use. A 6-year old is able to scan her drawings into the scanner without any adult supervision.
1,Now I’m trying to get a replacement battery & I cant get one sent to me.Another waster of money it can’t even hold a charge with the battery keeps telling me to charge
5,Je possède plusieurs scanners Doxie qui sont utilisés en milieu scolaire. Les enfants peuvent facilement numériser leurs dessins pour les transférer ensuite à l'ordinateur. La sauvegarde sur carte SD permet d'utiliser le scanner sans qu'il soit branché à un ordinateur. Il est plus simple et plus rapide d'utiliser un scanner Doxie qu'une grosse machine multifonction (ex. Xerox). De plus la qualité est bien meilleure.
5,J’utilise ce numériseur quelques fois par mois au travail. J’apprécie beaucoup la possibilité d’y ajouter une carte SD. Très facile à utiliser et très compact. Se range facilement dans un tiroir et facile à transporter.Le boitier de transport se vend séparément. À mon avis le boitier devrait être inclus comme il s’agit d’un numériseur portatif.
5,An excellent OCR scanner when coupled with the Abbyy Finereader an expensive software addition. It scans passable copies for printing but is not the quality of a higher priced scanner. Still for the money and the portability this is a very portable scanner that'll fill your every day scanning needs on the go. Be sure to purchase the Doxie A4 Case to protect your Doxie Go. A necessary addition. It's a great case and scanner combo!
5,We've purchased our 2nd Doxie now and I expect we'll continue to add them in to other people's workflows.  Super completely simple and fast setup convenient no hassle using the scanner.  On top of all that this is a company that really does care about their customers.  Great customer service.  Could recommend enough.
5,This is such a nifty little scanner. I love it way more than my scanner on my printer. You can take it with you anywhere. Scans faster than my printer scanner and the quality is just as good. Price is cheaper than most other portable scanners I looked at.Also I love the software that goes on your computer. The staple feature is great for joining multiple items.
4,Thus scanner works very well and the software interface is easy to use. The only thing I would rate against it is the difficulty of feeding sheets. The feeder can be finicky depending on the quality of the sheet. I've fully digitized all my records thanks to the Doxie.
5,This newer version of the Doxie Go is way better than the previous version. Scanning thin store receipts no longer jam. At least when it does jam the cover flips up so you can remove the paper. Great product.
5,Excellent portable scanner with many features that make scanning and creating packages easy. This product was recommended to me and it exceeded my expectations! It has more features then my regular scanner and they are much easier to use that I actually use them.
5,I use this scanner all the time with no problems. Great for tax time when I don't want to keep all my physical receipts. I just scan them in and put them on a flash drive. Easy to use. Sometimes I wish I had gone with the wireless one but I can't complain.
4,Love the product but having issues getting the color settings set correctly. Tried using the sheet included but was unsuccessful. Like how small lightand portable it is.
5,Is working really well. Just put 100 old photographs through no problem. The desktop app works really well and has more functionality than the iPad app which works well but has less bells and whistles. The wifi works flawlessly.
5,'Friendly' machine easy to use and handy.  Software is giving me some problems but the in-person online support is very helpful and friendly.
5,It's easy to use and compare to other scanner we actually use this because it's wireless with a battery so it sits in a place where it's accessible. So the first thing we come home now is to scan all the mail and receipt. Feels good to go paperless.
5,I needed a small and simple to use scanner for personal photographs and year end tax receipts. Doxie Go SE was my final choice and I am very  happy with the size simplicity and clarity of scans this unit provides.
4,First one had a bad battery that would not charge. Doxie stepped up and shipped me a new one free of charge in a matter of days. Wish I had been able to get the wireless version but none available at the time.
5,I use it every week it totally rocked my digital world it was the first step to my complete paperless shift. I keep all my bills for my taxes. Before Doxie it took me countless minutes every week to scan all my receipts at work woth the company flatbed scanner.Now it takes me just a few minutes to scan dozens of bills.I love it.
5,This is a fantastic little scanner well built and well designed. Everything about this is well made including the documentation and packaging. Really impressed with it.
4,perfect for what I need just wish it scanned longer receipts but that isn't a big problem love the software staple everything that belongs together neatly.
5,Awesome scanner.Using it to make backups of a ton of old photographs. The 300DPI setting is good enough most of the time for what I am looking for. 600DPI is even better but the scan times are pretty long.Only downside is that it will not scan while charging via usb.
5,Wonderful.  Scanning lots of old family photos.  Easy to use with automatic scan.  Will enhance and straighten out photos.  Battery powered so you can use anywhere.  Software is easy to use and you can upload to programs on your computer or just about all the most popular cloud services.  Doxie also has there own cloud service.  Ability to add your own customized upload settings.
5,Love it scanning documents and receipts is quick and easy. It might end up being the best purchase of the year.

5,Super portable and easy to use. SD card slot makes this a card reader as well if you need to transfer files to your PC.
5,Very easy to use and is quick to scan. A little troublesome when it automatically shuts off the wifi connection between long gaps of no activity but I actually like this because it saves battery.
5,It is so simple to use and works like a charm. Love it.
5,Had problems with WiFi but doxie service dept was great to deal with.  Highly recommended. Love the fact you can scan without a computer.

5,Great for tax season
4,Sometimes difficult to load paper correctly but generally speaking a fantastic device.
5,very nice quality
5,I was looking for a scanner that was affordable versatile and portable.  I read a positive newspaper review and decided to order through Amazon for the free shipping. Doxie Go works well as advertised simple to use high quality.
2,Fickle and error prone device. Regret the purchase. Scans okay......but feeding requires the hands of a surgeon. Importing...well that is something that needs patience and time that I just don't have.
5,This is precisely the portable scanner I was looking for; to work with my ipad on the road. I love it.
5,Excellent pour les vieilles photos de famille. Très rapide et simple à utiliser.

4,Works fantastic.Issues I had - poor guide control poorly handles crumpled paper often scanning the 2nd sheet caused an unknown error and I had to power cycle the unit work fine after power cycle.

5,Love it!
5,I really wanted to like this scanner.  I've read many blog posts extolling its virtues.  I have done about a 100 scans so far and more often than not find the scan to be skew.  The scanner grabs one side of paper more than the other and then pulls it in skew or alternatively it just "spins its wheels".  The scanner often grabs the item before I have had adequate opportunity to line it up - it is overly anxiously to grab the item.  I usually have at to scan an item several times before the result is acceptable.  When it does scan correctly the results are fine.I am considering returning it.***Update (8 Feb 2015)***:As it turns out I really do like this scanner.  Thanks to the great customer service at Apparent / Doxie I have a replacement Doxie Go Wifi and it works much better.  I have scanned another 40 or pages and the results are much better.  I have not experienced the paper slippage issue and the few skew scans were manageable (either correct via the software or scan the page upside down).  You do need to make sure the page is straight to begin with and don't lift at a steep angle either side (side to be scanned or side already scanned) of the paper while it is scanning as it might cause a mis-scan.  I make sure that there is ample space for the page the land and remove the scanned pages as they start piling up on the "done" side.Scanner features:The majority of my scans have been at 300dpi and the scan speed is very good.  I tried a few at 600dpi and yes the speed is much slower.  I will reserve this for the old (and some are rather small) photos that I collect from my family for my genealogy hobby.  The scan quality at 300dpi is more than sufficient for everyday documents.Importing the scans via wifi is easy and painless (once you set it up and that is easy also).Customer Service:I am totally floored by the care and attention from customer service and cannot help telling all my friends and family how fantastic they are.Note:The first battery charge does take a very long time (several hours) this (after some googling) would seem to be the norm.  I have not needed to re-charge it yet so I can't speak to the speed of that.
4,Pretty darn good but the price is a little expensive. Still takes a long time if you're trying to scan a lot of old family photos. Nice that you can do it in front of a TV while watching a show or movie at least. Hope Doxie makes a scanner where I can put a stack of photos down and it will scan them all automatically moving from one to the next. I would by that immediately.
5,It's a neat little scanner and I've used it frequently for the last couple months. It fits my use case very well (I scan lots of oddly-shaped and -sized documents and receipts).Additionally their customer support is stellar. Their representatives are very responsive to customer feedback and they helped me out with a couple minor problems that I had.
5,Great scanner and works super fast.  Only handles one page at a time and is a tad of a pain if there is a crease at the top of the paper but once you get use to it you will love it.  I use mine at least once a day and it works every time and the battery life is decent.  easy to carry if need be.  if you need a small light weight scanner to do some scanning jobs this is the perfect scanner to do so.
4,[Edit: After getting a replacement the wifi connection is working much better.]Don't buy the Wifi version stick to the USB one. Connecting to the device is a hassle. Setting things up if you're not on a laptop / apple device is near impossible. Connection to the scanner once properly setup is shaky. I'm trying to import ~100 documents the connection fails after about 20. Considering the price difference I'm very disappointed by the connection quality.However via USB there is no trouble. The scan quality is perfect for my needs. I wish I could have an input tray but that's certainly not a deal breaker especially if you like the small size of the scanner.But buy the USB one not the Wifi one.
4,Great little scanner it is not limited to one type of software so I was able to design a document management workflow that automatically pdf's and OCR's the content automatically.
5,too expensive  i have a free app that does the same
5,great product for scanning pictures
2,thus far (scanned about 20 receipts and pages) the scans aren't very high quality and some come through as vague smears (no idea even which receipts they were representing). The speed between scans is really quite slow - light flashes for a very long time. I'm not fully regretting my purchase yet but I'm close.UPDATE: I saw an email come through from the Doxie folks (nice to see) but I've lost it. However I tried to use the device again and it has failed me again. It seems that I have to scan to a USB stick or SD card only as the device will not communicate over USB to my computers (I have tried 3 Macs all of recent vintage). The scan quality is still quite poor compared to my old HP printer. The device will suffice in a pinch but this lack of ability to connect to the computer is incredibly frustrating.
2,I tried this out for a brief time. It worked well with the attached Eye-fi card to make it work wirelessly. But it was just too slow for my needs. I have lots of receipts and other paperwork that I scan to go paperless. Compared to the Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 this thing takes forever to go through a stack of papers. And you have to feed each item one at a time instead of putting in a stack of papers.This might work well for you but it wasn't up to the task for me.
4,I deleted a earlier one-star review. The item was defective (feeding copier paper sheets was near-impossible) and Doxie replaced it. Customer service was first class. Feeding of paper sheets is ok now: perhaps as good as it gets without a feeder mechanism. Connecting to WiFi is a bit slow but always works. Doxie CS compiled some suggestions for me on WiFi. Portability is the big plus. As a desk fixture a Fujitsu ScanSnap 1300i that I had for years was definitely better (perfect really) - but heavier and connected via USB.
5,Really impressed with this scanner. Had an older Epson all in one that refused to join my Wifi after changing providers (known issue with Epson so wasnt going to get another of their products). Took some time to review lots of scanners looked at flat beds and auto feeder scanners and initially dismissed the Doxie Go SE Wifi as it was "just" a portable scanner. Luckily I did go back and check reviews and read some more online and decided to give it a shot.So glad I did! Really small and portable and easy to use. The speed of scanning is totally great honestly I was used to waiting for the lamp to warm up on the Epson all in one then it did preview and then finally scanned which took ages and then I had to manually crop to fit the image then convert to pdf or image. Looking back now it was so much effort and time just to scan a few pages.The Doxie Go SE Wifi is really fast at scanning in comparison to my old all in one like about 5 seconds per page. Can easily just keep feeding pages one after the other and it handles the auto cropping and rotation automatically which is nice. Plus the software is easy to use has the ability to "staple" pages together to make multi-page pdfs scan to OCR etc. The Doxie website is also a good resource and help for getting used to the scanner knowing what the lights mean how to setup to join your wifi etc.The scanner comes with a memory card for storing the scans onto it and is plenty for storing thousands of scans. Then at some later date you can switch on the wifi on the scanner load up the Doxie software app and wait like 30 seconds to join the network then its ready to import all the scans. The battery is chargable via the micro-usb to USB-A cable provided - I attach to my PC to charge mine up.Really happy with this device. The people at Doxie reached out to say hi and offered advice and support if needed on using the scanner. So a really nice touch. Would buy again and would recommend it to friends and family.
5,Great product delivered on time.
5,GR8
4,Got here fast and will help allot.
4,This is a good product but as others have said in review it does leave a white line across photos it is easy to use I think because of the name Doxie is why this item is so expensive I have a small battery photo size doxie scanner which I have had for a few years now which is pretty good but batteries run out very fast but the new a4 size scanner is rechargeable and it did really last many many hours of scanning if I had to say anything negative it is that the price is too high and it is really is a treat you won’t be disappointed with this item if you can afford it
2,Erst die Dixi-Midnight-Runner dann das DIXIE-Klo nun kommt DOXIE mit Scannern. Die Sprache wird immer lebendiger…Das Aussehen des Scanners ist weiß matt Fingerabdrücke sieht man keine von der Größe her ca. 10% - 20% größer als Konkurrenz-Modelle sieht auf den ersten Blick relativ robust aus - macht aber bei näherem Hinsehen den Eindruck eines unlieben und klapprigen Zusammenbaus. Für den Preis muss ich sagen: leider.Schön ist was anderes und ist auch hier von der Konkurrenz schon mal überholt.Alle Stromisolierfolien entfernen - erst mal laden – vier Stündchen auch im Auto (USB 24 V). die (beigefügte) 8 GB (!) SD-Card rein einschalten und los geht's mit Scannen.Jo das geht relativ zügig.WENN der Bon von der Tankstelle noch relativ frisch ist - hier ist das Papier gemeint. Das Thermo-Papier ist nämlich relativ dünn und das gibt dann Mühe beim reinfädeln. Wenn die Bons dann schon drei Tage im Auto waren und Eselsohren aufweisen - Prost-Mahlzeit. Nicht zu feste reindrücken oder nachdrücken. Das mag das Sensibelchen nicht. Also vorsichtig zur Schiene führen - auf ein leises "Klick" achten - weil dann hat der Scanner das Papier erst erkannt/erfasst und wenn ich gerade keine Geduld habe und das leise "Klick" überhöre ja dann kann ich lange warten bis zum Einzug des Belegs. Dann iss nich.Also die Quartalsmalocher die Ihre Umsatzsteuer dann mit den welk gelegenen Bons fertig machen wollen haben dann ein wenig länger zu tun. Aber wozu auch warten? Die Kiste springt schnell an und der Bon ist schnell auf der Karte abgespeichert. Ausschalten. Beleg in die Tonne. Fertig. Dann nach drei Monaten (für die Quartalsmalocher) können die PDFs via WIFI oder Kabel am Compi ausgelesen werden.Dazu braucht es dann die Software - die ganz ok ist aber nicht so dolle. PDFs können angezeigt und ein wenig bearbeitet werden. Das war's auch schon. Mehrere PDFs können zu einer zusammengefasst werden.Aber dafür und für mehr gibt es wiederum Programme die auf sowas spezialisiert sind.  Die Bearbeitung in diesem Programm beschränkt sich auf hier und da ein bisschen Farbe klein/groß – ist halt kein Photoshop. Hat man Kassenbons eingescannt ist mit dem DOXIO-eigenen Programm auch kein hochzoomen möglich. Schade denn Bons die ich nach bestimmten Kriterien zusammenfassen möchte kann ich nicht lesen.  Abhilfe habe ich mir damit verschafft die ganzen PDFs in ein eigenes Verzeichnis (auf meinem Rechner) zu kopieren. So nur mal zur Verdeutlichung: ich sehe die PDFs im eigenen DOXIO-Programm kann dort mehrere PDF zusammen fassen bisschen mit Farbe spielen.Soviel zur „großartigen“ Software laut Überschrift. Was mich aber wirklich sehr gestört hat und wahrscheinlich zum K.O.-Kriterium führen wird ist der Gelbstich in A4-Dokumenten. Mich wundert dass das kein anderer Rezensent geschrieben hat. Das sieht doch völlig unnatürlich aus. Bei den Bons ist es auf Grund der Größe der Objekte nicht so auffällig und auch ziemlich egal...aber bei A4 Dokumenten ist von links (gelb) nach rechts (bis hellgelb) ein Blurr-Effekt der sehr störend ist. Die Dokumente sehen dreckig aus und ich würde sie so nicht weiterleiten wollen. Das gleiche Dokument einmal vom Flachbettscanner und einmal vom DOXIO ist wie Tag und Nacht. Da braucht man nichts schönreden: die PDFs sehen aus als wären sie auf vergilbtem Papier gedruckt worden. Es liegt auch definitiv an der gelben Schiene die ebenfalls unter der Lichteinheit im Scanner ist. Warum?  Hier wäre weiß angesagt gewesen. So wie bei meinem Flachbettscanner die gegenüberliegende Seite vom Vorlagenglas.Also der DOXIO macht seine Arbeit gut zumindest was mir vorschwebte: jederzeit bereit speichert Dokumente ohne andere Hardware und – WIFI. Ja wofür eigentlich? Sobald ich die Dokumente auf meinen mac übertragen möchte geht das mit (beigefügtem) USB-Kabel oder Drahtlos (was jedoch weder schneller noch bequemer ist). Die Sinnfrage zur Durchführung am Handy hat sich für mich deshalb schon mal erübrigt. Ich versuch’s gar nicht erst. Man denke dabei auch mal an meine Nerven.Man kann auch die SD-Karte rausnehmen und am Rechner via DOXIE-Software auslesen/kopieren/löschen. Falls man das Gerät im Auto lassen möchte (Ist im Winter nicht zu empfehlen da unter Umständen der Akku unter null Grad sterben könnte).Der Rest ist einwandfrei. Zurück zu meiner Frage Kauf oder nicht Kauf:Mit einer Akkuladung reicht es für ca 120 gescannte PDFs und dem Auslesen auf einen anderen Datenträger (nach der ersten vollen Akkuladung).Ich brauche nichts – außer diesem Knochen.Speicherkarte i.O. Die Größe von 8 Gig reicht wohl für Otto-Normalo eine class 10-Karte wäre nur schneller ist aber nicht unbedingt notwendig. Damit würde man allenfalls die Ausgabegeschwindigkeit auf ein anderes Medium erhöhen.Der Scanner ist für Belege gut so zack-zack zwischendurch. Es geht auch deutlich schneller als mit Flachbettscanner – ab dem Moment wo die Datei dann auf dem Rechner ist bleiben die restlichen Arbeitsschritte ob DOXIO oder Flachbettscanner gleich.A4 Dokumente sind grauenhaft (bei mir jedenfalls) eh nicht grau sondern gelblich und mein Wunsch ist es daß ich noch erfahre wie das mit dem Gelb zu vermeiden ist. Am liebsten bevor ich das Gerät vor Ablauf der 14-tägigen Rückgabefrist zurücksende.Ich tät’s gerne behalten…Und ich behalte es!!! Habe mir einfach ein anderes bestellt (ohne WIFI). Jetzt sind auch die A4-Scans tutti. Schön weiß…bis auf zwei hässliche gelbe Löcher bei gelochten Vorlagen. Macht ja nix. Kann man dann mit der großartigen Software weiß pinseln. Bin jetzt nicht ganz 4-Sterne-happy.Nachtrag ein paar Monate später: das Dingen geht zurück. Viele Dokumente vor allem Behördenpapiere auf recycelten Papier haben einen ziemlichen Blaustich. Ich finde das sehr schlecht. Die Rückseite schimmert so stark durch dass sie fast schon lesbar ist. Ein No-Go. Die Löcher von gelochten Seiten sind noch immer stark Gelb ist die Seite nicht exakt gerade eingezogen worden dann auch der Bereich das kein Dokument aufweist.Zudem habe ich verschiedene Rechner. Die Software (ver-)arbeitet dann teilweise so langsam dass es besser ist die Software über Nacht arbeiten zu lassen. Kein Witz!Wenn man dann nur die Speicherkarte separat ausliest liegen die gescannten Dokumente nicht im PDF Format vor. Und nur die Doxie Software kann sie dann umwandeln. Auch am besten Nachts dann.Nö geht wieder zurück. Zu nervig und dafür zu teuer.
4,Software does not auto file receipts.
5,I am so impressed with this company I had to say something. This small compact scanner is not only probably the best one I have ever owned but the company themselves go out of their way to make sure everything is OK and then they emailed me me to see if I’d like a free gift. I chose the protective carry case worth £30. No shabby case either. Absolutely brilliant. A lot more could learn from these guy.
5,I was looking for a portable scanner that was lightweight and would allow me to digitize my paperwork so that I don't have millions of folders lying around and so that I will always have access to my files on the go. After doing research on the internet this seemed like the best all-around product which fitted the bill. It is a bit more on the pricey side of scanners but the customer reviews seemed great and for what seemed like a good product I was willing to spend a bit more. It hasn't disappointed and I use it for literally every bit of important paperwork that comes in as well as to digitize my old documents like qualification certificates etc. What is great is that you can scan a stack as you please or one-by-one as they come in and then later on your can import them all in one go into your comp. For me this is much more efficient. The Doxie is easy to use and looks great. The instructions were really easy to follow and the software (at least for Mac) is a breeze to use. I will say that their customer service is second to none. Yesterday a Product Manager phoned me from the US to see how I was getting on with it. He ran through any feedback I had and said that this would all be implemented and they really care about how their products work for consumers. I totally believed him and for what is a smallish growing business this care and attention made me really happy that I had made this purchase and will make me think about continuing with the brand into the future. My main improvement was to say a double-sided scanner would be fab!
2,Awful- tempermental
4,The good - fast simple scanning without wires trailing everywhere no need even to turn on the PC/laptop. Good scan quality for documents (I'd use a flatbed for photos). No button pressing - just present the document and let go once it's started - very fast process.The not so good - simplex not duplex is a real pain as is not having a document feeder. And why is it soooo slow at importing images from the Doxie's SD card? I scanned about 500 documents this evening and it's taking 5+ seconds to import each one = about 40 minutes! It's like going back to 1990. From my cameras SD card that much data would have taken... 30 seconds? It's no deal breaker I can just leave it running (while I write this review!).So far very impressed. Got totally fed up of my (2nd) Scansnap - confusing unreliable software having to have wires trailing everywhere laptop on press buttons after every single scan... it just drove me crazy and willnow only be used for large (over 10 pages) documents.Well I have no more to say just yet and the import is still only a third of the way through very odd. If it takes this long to transfer a few jpgs how long is it going to take to convert them all to PDF and OCR them?!UPDATE: Day 2.... Preview of scanned images - it would be really handy to be able to see what I'd just scanned to make sure it scanned correctly. I've now done over 800 scans and there have been a few duff images but only two where a document was messed up. That's a great success rate but even the low failure rate is enough to mean I have to check every single one before converting to pdf. I would definitely have paid the extra £25 for the Wifi one if (?) that gives you a wireless preview after very scan.Software - it's pretty simple/intuitive and a billion light years ahead of the Scansnap's overly-complex nightmare of confusion and often simply refusing to connect.Would I buy another? Yes 100%.
5,AMAZZING
4,Does what it's supposed to.  It sits neatly on top of my printer and its lead plugs into a USB socket on my desk top.  There is an app which goes with it but I have not yet found a need for it.The set up instructions were not very clear - they would good on switching on and feeding in the originals  but not helpful on how to access the resulting copy.
5,Ich habe den Scanner jetzt schon eine gute Woche und bin sehr begeistert. Ich wollte auf jeden Fall den Bergen an Papier an den Kragen der sich über die Zeit einfach ansammelt. Das Ziel ist also ein papierloses Büro und dafür brauchte ich einen neuen Helfer.Ich hatte zwar schon davor einen relativ guten Canon Scanner der gute Ergebnisse lieferte aber so wirklich Freude hier seitenweise Briefe/Rechnungen einzuscannen kam nicht auf - wurde eher nur dafür verwendet Bilder oder auch auf die Schnelle Dokumente für den Mail Versand zu scannen. Das lag aber auch hauptsächlich am relativ mühsamen Workflow - das Prozedere Deckel auf Scannen und dann mit der Software das Dokument verarbeiten und speichern. Das funktioniert zwar auch macht aber keinen Spaß...mal abgesehen davon dass der Scanner einen gewissen Platz am Arbeitsplatz braucht.Ich bin dann schon vor längerem auf die Scanner der Firma Doxie gestoßen aber es gab nur den Weg sie zu importieren und sie sind auch relativ teuer. Am Preis hat sich nichts geändert aber zumindest sind die Scanner jetzt über Amazon Dritthändler sicher verfügbar. Die Lieferung kam sehr schnell bei mir an und auch die Inbetriebnahme ist völlig unkompliziert - auspacken aufladen und loslegen. Im Lieferumfang ist alles was man braucht - Netzteil USB Kabel Kurzanleitung (mehr braucht man auch nicht) Kalibrierkarte eine Scanhülle für Fotos und ein Reinigungswerkzeug. Die Kurzanleitung beinhaltet eigentlich alles was man braucht Aufladen (Scanner kann auch verwendet werden während des Ladens) Kalibrierkarte einscannen und schon kann es losgehen. Die Bedienung ist simpel es gibt auch nur einen Knopf - etwas länger drücken schaltet das Gerät ein und aus. Ist der Scanner an kann man durch kurzes Drücken zwischen den 2 Qualitätsstufen 300dpi (Taste leuchtet grün) und 600dpi (orange) wählen.Ich kann bestätigen aus anderen Rezensionen und Reviews es braucht etwas Übung um die Zettel gerade einzuführen. Der Einzug startet ca. 1 Sekunde nachdem das Dokument eingeführt wurde - es ist also von Vorteil das Dokument zügig einzuführen dann liegt es gerade an der Führungseinheit an und wird gerade eingezogen - geht man zu zaghaft vor kann es passieren dass der Einzug schon startet und man das Papier noch nicht wirklich gerade angelegt hat. Ist es ein A4 Zettel und man ist wirklich schief dann kann es schon vorkommen dass der Zettel am Ende am Eck abgeknickt wird da der Einzug in der Breite nicht all zu viel Spielraum hat. Ich finde man hat den Dreh aber ziemlich schnell raus und nach ein paar Zettel kein Problem mehr.Das Arbeiten mit dem Scanner ist wirklich sehr simpel - das liegt vor allem daran dass man keinen Rechner braucht um den Scanner zu verwenden und an der guten Software. Man kann ohne Rechner seine Dokumente einscannen - egal wo ob ich mich am Abend vor den TV setze oder das lieber am Balkon mache. Hat man alles gescannt kann es an die Verarbeitung gehen und der Scanner wird mittels USB Kabel an den PC angeschlossen (er kann auch mittels USB Adapter am iPad verwendet werden das habe ich aber noch nicht testen können). Die Software erkennt den Scanner automatisch und zeigt die darauf befindlichen Scans an. Hier findet auch die Verarbeitung statt - man kann schlechte Scans direkt löschen und es gibt auch die Möglichkeit die Scans zu bearbeiten (zB. Helligkeit usw.). Dokumente die zusammen gehören können gestapelt werden. Hat man das gemacht können die Dokumente lokal am Rechner gespeichert werden (als JPG PNG oder auch PDF) - die Texterkennung funktioniert wunderbar. Stapelt man Scans in der Software und exportiert es als PDF hat man automatisch ein PDF mit mehreren Seiten - man muss nicht im Acrobat die Seiten zusammenfügen.Zusätzlich hat man die Möglichkeit die Scans an Programme weiter zu schicken - wie Evernote Photoshop oder direkt in die Dropbox legen.Zusammengefasst kann ich den Scanner nur empfehlen da er alle Punkte erfüllt die ich von ihm erwartet habe. Vor allem die Größe Bedienung und auch die Haptik finde ich sehr gut.Negative Punkte habe ich selbst noch keine entdeckt - man könnte hier den Preis nennen. Für das Geld bekommt man auch schon gute normale Scanner- aber die sind auch um ein Eck größer. Den Doxie habe ich in der Schublade und wenn ich jetzt zB. eine Rechnung bekomme die ich zwecks Garantie aufheben muss dann wird die gleich eingescannt. Man muss die Files ja nicht gleich verarbeiten sondern man scannt einfach und alle paar Tage steckt man den Scanner an den Rechner und sichert sie.
5,No power outlet required or a computer needed this portable device is convenient and delivers great results. The WiFi connects seamlessly to my Hub or Laptop making document transfer a breeze. I am retired and bought this scanner to email important documents in Adobe format and scan old family photos into Apple Photos for safe keeping in the cloud. I have found other uses over time such as uploading my 4 year old grandsons school drawings and important documents which be filed in Adobe OCR enabling me to search the files. I had a problem with removing the battery but found the Customer Service to be outstanding and they resolved the problem with a replacement in no time. After sales service is exemplar.
5,This is a great scanner for photos and documents it is mostly very easy to use the scan quality is excellent and it was easy to scan lots of photos in an evening whilst watching TV.  It is much quicker and more convenient to use than the type of flat-bed scanner function which we have as part of an all-in-one printer and the Doxie is light in weight portable and we are glad that we bought it.However the one downside is that we found the WiFi function to be difficult and unreliable in use.  It is extremely slow to start up it doesn't connect properly (and gives the error message 'No Internet open') and when we used WiFi to upload scans to a standard Windows-10 laptop the WiFi suddenly shut down half-way through.  When we replaced WiFi with a usb cable the cable worked very well but we seemed to get duplication of scans.So once again it is a really good scanner and we wouldn't be without it but the WiFi function could do with improvement.
5,Ordered this predominantly for scanning business receipts but now using it for documents and all sorts as it is a great little scanner although not tried photos yet but should imagine based on the quality of copies of documents so far should be good. The two resolution settings help as well as I tend to save in .pdf and so can create copies of a smaller size as these are mainly just used for record keeping. The Doxie software is easy and simple to use (I use it with a Mac) and the built in manual is always there if I have a question. Do recommend the WiFi version as is just so simple when uploading scans that I have done when away from the Mac. I bought the case to go with it as I do use it away from the Mac and this is just as good. As for customer service they are great considering they are in the States I had a little trouble at first putting receipts through but went online and chatted with the live help and they were so helpful and sent me a pack of sleeves fo help for me then only to find it was my mistake and I was feeding them in wrong!! They feed in absolutely fine. They even followed up with a courtesy call to ensure all was good. No need to look anywhere else this is a great product and service 5* all round.
5,Does what it says on the box  very easy to use  very pleased with it .
5,Excellent for the size and price. It's incredibly easy to use and you don't need to hook it up to a computer before use. It is battery powered (rechargeable) and stores scans when on the move. You just upload to a computer when it's convenient. I don't use it in a mobile situation so it's always on the desk where it takes up so little space. The scan quality is great for document archiving.
5,It is definitely one of the best things i have every purchased. I only meant to scan a few receipts and a box of loose photos but it is so incredibly easy and quick i scanned several thousand items in the first week and am now literally digitalizing everything in sight photos receipts documents letters - everything. It was easy to setup i can scan for hours and it doesn't run out of power and it doesn't run out of space. i expect it does eventually but i can easily scan thousands first. It is incredibly easy to line up phots and documents and they come out perfectly lined up and the correct size. Even extremely faint letters can be easily enhanced once scanned.  It is a handy size and the software is easy to use and if you can scan a mix of documents and photos you can easily select the ones to save a jpeg and the ones to save as pdf. I really really love this scanner. Previously it would have taken hours to scan a few dozen documents now i can do it in minutes - all while watching TV. Wonderful purchase!
4,I bought this scanner as a very portable scanning solution to scan all of my receipts letters documents etc into my mac (and recently directly into Evernote). I was amazed at how small it was when it arrived which makes it perfect if you want an ultra minimalist space saving solution.The scanner has built in software so it was very easy to switch on and attach to a computer to transfer the scans. Because there is built in memory and battery it is a completely portable solution. You can leave it next to your computer take it to the office take it whilst out and about visiting clients etc and scan on the go then upload the scans when you return to base and connect it to your computer.The software that comes with the device is intuitive and simple to use. You can stick several pages seamlessly into one document and there is the option to send the scans direct to Evernote or share via email straight from the software. It all works very well.There is an option to buy a wireless card for the device which allows you to wi-fi the scans to your computer without connecting the lead although Amazon reviews seem to be be mixed as to how well this works. The battery in the scanner charges quickly when charging via USB and has lasted through some pretty major bulk scanning sessions.In terms of the downsides: for me the only key area for improvement would be to allow the paper to feed more easily. if the sheet you are scanning is not flat it can be a bit fiddly to feed it into the scanner (perhaps because the feed gap height is very narrow) but with documents in decent condition it's not a major problem. The other thing to note is that there is no auto/ bulk feed capability.Overall this is easily the best home/ small office minimalist scanning solution I've found. If you only get standard documents (A4 or very slightly bigger seems to be the limit) and reasonably low daily volume this could well suit you extremely well. It's easy to charge scan carry on your travels with you and has good software - highly recommended.
3,I've been using my Doxie Go for around 6 months now.  In theory this is an excellent product - decent battery very portable and convenient.  I've spent the last few months going paperless and I now scan any incoming mail receipts and shred.Here lies the main problem with the Doxie Go:  The feeder.  It's extremely temperamental and I would say it works around 50% of the time unless you have a perfect crisp piece of paper that's fed.  This means that any fresh mail that comes in the post feeds and scans fine.  Anything slightly less crisp - such as a receipt causes problems.  Even if I leave some documents in my messenger bag for a week and it gets ever so slightly crumpled it will become difficult to scan in the Doxie Go.  I'm currently going through my old documents going back 5-10 years and you can only imagine the success rate these.  During these temperamental events it requires 2-3 attempts to feed successfully into my Doxie Go but they will scan eventually.  For such documents I have my doubt over any speed improvement over using a traditional flatbed - but ultimately the portability wins.My second problem is I wish the support for mobile devices were greater.  As part of going paperless I scan each document then tag them in Evernote.  The Doxie Windows software (havent tried Mac) offers a fairly good workflow to see all the documents scanned to Doxie's memory then send them over to Evernote then tag them within Evernote.  What this effectively means is that I have to turn on my computer every time plug in the scanner import the scans send to evernote tag within Evernote software.  I've tried variations of this workflow such as scanning and then only plugging into the computer once periodically (which is what I do now).  The problem with this is that by the time you get round to tagging your documents you may have forgotten what each one is or which pages need "stapling" together.  In my mind the solution would be to be able to quickly do this within the Doxie app on the phone/tablet so you can immediately send to Evernote without the clunky import then send procedure.  Unfortunately the iOS app doesn't really support anything of this nature for the Doxie Go as far as I can tell.  This isn't to mention that Apparent offer no Android apps - and I only own android Phones and tablets.It's my impression that the Doxie Go Plus and Doxie Go Wi-Fi improve on both these aspects respectively.  In the end I do not regret buying an Apparent product but I do regret buying a Doxie Go - and wish I had opted for the superior models which have now arrived (and presumably fix the problems but I don't know this for sure).  It is a shame that Apparent have made no indication of whether they intend to support Android either so I'm not convinced I should upgrade unless this happens.
2,En premier lieu les réglages prévus par le constructeur ne sont pas simples de surcroît les instructions ne sont qu'en anglais de plus ce que ne dis pas le constructeur c'est qui n'existe pas d'application pour Android ainsi impossible de pouvoir recevoir les documents sur une tablette Android ou sur un smartphone Android alors que le vendeur précise la mention dans son texte : surtout vos appareils.Étant donné qu'il est compliqué à paramétrer et qu'en plus la notice neck en anglais retour à l'expéditeur pour ce prix-là il aurait pu rajouter un écran LCD et un peu plus de touche pour pouvoir naviguer plus aisément pour paramétrer l'appareil et le wifi sur cet appareil vendu sur amazon un seul bouton sert à paramétrer la résolution du scan ainsi que le paramétrage wifi
5,Best portable scanner I've used. I'm mostly doing photos with it and its great.even the software is easy and does everything you could want. Im using it on windows 11 pc and all connected with no issues. Takes up very little desk space which is a great bonus.Very well made and sturdy Would recommend to anybody.
5,Compact dynamic quick and easy to use and such great results I wish I had discovered Doxie Go SE Wi-Fi sooner.I have digitized a large pile of photo albums in a fraction of the time it took to do others previously as the Doxie sits so neatly on your desk there’s no jumping up and down or twisting and turning for every copy.  Documents and old historical photos can all be done in moments as well with the same excellent results.When compared to previous scans I can see no compromise on quality.It is so portable I’d suggest getting the case as well for travelling or for keeping your Doxie dust free and out of sight when not in use freeing up valuable space.Very easy set-up instructions.  I got it to upload to Dropbox directly so there were no delays and I could access the Doxie folder instantly as well.Customer service is a pleasure very responsive to follow-ups and queries.  Highly recommended.
5,Really easy to use but sometimes photos seem to scan darker then the original
5,I was in need of a document scanner for archiving bills uni notes letters etc.  If money and space were no object then perhaps I'd go for a all singing all dancing Scansnap.  But both are tight at the moment so I wanted something small and relatively cheap.After getting advice from the good folks on Google+ I plumped for the Doxie Go.I ordered it on Amazon using the free shipping and it arrived in a couple of days.  The scanner is boxed really well.  It includes a quick-start guide a calibration card a cleaning brush a photo holder and a nice poster.  There's no installation disc so you need to download the software from the Doxie website.  You also need to charge the scanner.Once the scanner is charged you're ready to go.  You can only scan one page at a time and single sided.  But it's really fast.  The lack of multi-page or duplex isn't an issue for me.  There is a document guide.  Occasionally though this moves which can cause your document to 'slip' as it scans.  Also sometimes if the paper has got a bit tatty it can be difficult to get it through the scanner.  When this happens I just put it through the other way and deal with it in the software.  Being able to scan wherever I want is a joy.  I haven't counted but I reckon I get between 30 an 50 scans between charges.  Then you have to plug the scanner back into the computer.  You can buy a charger from Doxie.  I just use my iPad charger and the enclosed USB cable.  You can charge and scan at the same time.The software is easy to use.  It has some nice touches such as stapling noises and the ability to save as PDF with OCR and to export to a number of programs including Evernote.  If there was one improvement to the software that I would make would be to have a right-click menu.  I know I said "one" but I've thought of something else.  The crop tool is clunky.  You have to adjust each side individually.  Why not have a crop tool where you select your area - like every other crop tool?Build quality doesn't feel brilliant.  But for the price it seems reasonable.  I genuinely enjoy using the Doxie and its helping me in my quest to go paperless.  If you're in a similar situation to me I recommend you give the Doxie Go a try.
5,I wanted to reduce the piles of papers I had in my study - particularly business cards flyers and meeting notes that would otherwise hang around in piles and therefore be considered 'lost' or at least difficult to find. So I did some research and opted for the Doxie Go. I didn't have unrealistic expectations for what I was getting having used a Fujitsu Scansnap at work for many years which could eat a pile of 50 A4 sheets in next to no time. The Doxie Go doesn't claim to do that but what it offers is brilliant and realistic for someone who wants to wander round their home clearing piles of useful clutter.I just wanted a simple solution that could sync easily and that is what the Doxie Go does brilliantly.Being so small literally just wider than an A4 sheet light and battery operated you can walk around your home with it in your hand and crank through a pile of paper. The battery lasts a good while which means that you can happily munch through 100 sheets and not worry too much about it running out of battery. Then simply plug it into your computer via the USB cable and it syncs beautifully to the Doxie software which is perfectly simple in its approach and regularly improved. The scans transfer to the app where you can edit crop rotate and export as needed.I usually just transfer the scans into Evernote so that they are on all my devices and searchable there however you can save to pdf jpeg and all the usual formats including word - which means that a scan can become an editable document in no time at all.I really like the build quality of the Doxie Go and you can happily upgrade the storage capacity if you feel that the included memory isn't enough.The standard scan resolution is absolutely fine for most documents but you can quickly change the resolution by holding down the scan button... the only button on the device. You now have something that can archive treasured photographs at a quality that can display or print well.There is a useful slider on the document feeder which will keep the edges from wondering if it is a business card or an A5 flyer for instance. It provides straighter scans which cuts down editing time.I have never in all the time I have used the Doxie Go had a jam. Business cards need a little push to help the thicker paper go through however that is not an issue.This is a very useful scanner to have to hand that does what it does really well and without fuss - it always sits within arms length of my desk. It is quick and easy to get scans onto a computer at a realistic price - why have anything more complicated than this? I love it!
5,Honestly? I am so so glad I bought this. I am sick of having so much paper everywhere but I also live in a tiny house so this tiny scanner is PERFECT for me. I can store all my medical info payslips etc online and shred and recycle all the paper that my lazy self left everywhere. I personally prefer to use it with the cable in - it takes me a minute to work out the WiFi method even if it's pretty simple too but I just like being able to plug in and scan away. The memory card it came with stores a good amount of scans plus the battery life is good too. I like the software for Doxie it did crash a couple of times when I first downloaded it (I'm on a Mac) but that was because I didn't move the application to the application folder. Everything's been smooth sailing since. Scan quality is good - nice and clear. Customer service team at Doxie are also fantastic when I had a query about the software.
5,Il scanne silencieusement rapidement et la résolution est de très bonne qualité. Le mode haute résolution est très bien pour les photos papier que l'on veut numériser pour sauvegarde ou/et correction. Le résultat est très bon.L'application qui gère le scanner est très simple à utiliser et offre de multiples choix de format en sortie (jpg png pdf etc.).Le support en ligne du produit est très pratique on y trouve toutes les informations sur le scanner.  Ayant  eu l'occasion de l'utiliser je peux dire que le SAV est sérieux et très réactif.Ce petit scanner qui ne prend pas de place et est très léger peut être emporté partout.Je suis totalement satisfaite de ce produit que je peux recommander sans hésiter.
4,This is my second Doxie - I had one of the older models and wore it out. I scan a *lot* of old documents and my Doxie Go SE is generally excellent. Between the simple hardware and the intelligent software you are unlikely to find a better portable scanner.That's not to say it's without its flaws - if you are scanning something thicker than a few sheets or with staples or frayed edges be prepared for a little frustration and compromise. Documents that are yellow in colour can confuse it too as the hardware/software uses a yellow background to decide where your document 'isn't'.However you can get round most things with a bit of ingenuity. For simple scanning of A4 and below it's perfect. Spare batteries are also very cheap (I found a generic NP-120 camera battery works fine).
5,dieser Scanner ist so klein und handlich damit ist das scannen nicht mehr so lästig...er startet in null komma nix die Qualität der Scans ist super auch die Software ist toll man kann die Scans in durchsuchbare PDF's umwandeln und danach Texte daraus kopieren (super praktisch bei Rechnungen um die IBAN für die Überweisung zu kopieren) Fotos habe ich noch nicht eingescannt aber das kommt noch....der Preis ist zwar etwas hoch aber ich sehe es als Investition um meine Akten zu digitalisieren...vor allem muss man nicht extra den PC anmachen um zu scannen er speichert alles ab und man kann es später in den PC ladenErgänzung: Besonders praktisch find ich die Möglichkeit durch die Doxie-App die Fotos (in JPEG) bzw. Dokumente (PDF) direkt auf's Smartphone zu laden. Wenn ich zum Beispiel ein Dokument per Mail verschicken muss lade ich es auf das Smartphone und verschicke es von dort.... so muss ich nicht extra den Laptop anmachen und später kann ich das Dokument wenn ich es nicht vom Scanner lösche auch noch mal auf den Laptop laden.Die Optimierungsmöglichkeiten (Kontrast Helligkeit zuschneiden usw.) beschränken sich in der App jedoch auf Kontrast Verstärkung und Drehen. Aber für den schnellen Versand reicht das vollkommen aus.Fotos kann ich so auch schnell scannen und per whatsapp verschicken...super easy ;-)!Den Akku musste ich bis jetzt selten laden benutze ihn jetzt schon seit Monaten regelmäßig.Man kann auch eine SD-Karte im Doxie zum speichern benutzen und diese dan nin den PC oder Tablet stecken und so die Scan's auf den PC oder Tablet laden.Das einzige was ein bisschen stört ist dass man das Wlan immer ausschalten muss um das Smartphone oder den Laptop mit dem Doxie über das Doxieeigene Wlan zu verbinden. Also am besten den Doxie mit dem Netzwerk verbinden [...]!Hab auch noch das praktische Case für unterwegs so bleibt der Doxie staubfrei und ohne Kratzer (kann ich auch empfehlen).
5,This is a brilliant scanner very easy to used great for scanning legal documents contactsand photos Perfect for business meetings and so quick to set up just take it out your briefcase and go . Has save me so must time closing deals and sending all relevant documentation to the right people . 10/10
5,I have a 3 in 1 printer but always end up putting stuff on top of the scanner.Because the Doxie is portable I can use it anywhere and it's helping me get finances organised by scanning receiptsAnd I scan paperwork for a charity I volunteer for.  It really is so easy to use..
5,Most all of us get a ton of paperwork; bills statements payslips insurance docs receipts to mention a few.  We know that we should actually keep a hold of them in case we need to return something under warranty query something in the future refer back to the payslips or just need to keep track but it all mounts up - files full of paperwork most all of which is now out of date meaning that when we do need to find something it's a huge trial to get what we need.This is a neat little answer.  It's a standalone battery powered scanner.  Simply switch on and feed in the paperwork which it grabs and pulls through (paper as narrow as receipts are fine as are A4/letter pages) scanning to internal memory and saving it there until you connect to your computer to move the scans off.You can access it just like an external drive but the bundled software is really where the solution shines and makes sense - the software connects to the scanner and imports the scans.  It automatically corrects for skew and gives a little contrast boost which is useful for documents.  You can tweak these settings if you like and once you're done can "staple" pages together into a document and then export as PDF (or JPG or PNG or even a PDF with the text having been "read" by optical character recognition and embedded in to the PDF).It all works seamlessly as you would want it to - by default as you import to the software scans are removed from the scanner memory and as you export from the Doxie software to PDF they are removed from the software.  The scanner charges fine from your PCs USB port and you can get an optional mains adaptor if you want.Of course you could always do something similar with your printer's built in scanner an imaging program like Paint or Photoshop and a PDF writer like Acrobat Professional but realistically that is extremely laborious and time consuming compared to the Doxie and you're not likely to bother.Over all this is excellent.
5,Not being a tech expert and having used and set up many printers and scanners I rarely can be ar8ed writing a product review.  So I only got this last night and have already completed the main task I bought it for. Scanning photos for my mum to email to her friend.  Super easy to set up and use no specific software works with all my devices ithings being my preference.  I’ll be able to take things on the road and get copies of all the old photos lurking in my families lofts.  The scanner itself is cool neat and quality looking I like my gadgets and this is a talking point.  I’m also thinking it will be so handy for important docs like insurance forms and the items my wife putS somewhere safe   never to be seen again.  Not cheap but ease of use means I’m likely to use rather than stick in a cupboard and never look at.
5,Bought this for my husband. He is delighted with it. Easy to use good quality scanning.Six months on and he is still raving about it! He has recommended it to several friends. Best birthday present ever!
4,Easy to use. WiFi configuration took a little while to work out how to do it. The WiFi connection is slow to connect - it's nothing like the speed of a blue tooth pairing. The power button has an icon that lights up when powered on ... But the icon is in the middle of the button which is obscured by your finger when you press it!Despite these niggles it is a very nice scanner that is easy to use and produces excellent results.
4,bought this portable scanner so I could just scan letters documents and receipts ect as they arrivedit works very well and very east to use the scans are pretty good I use it in 600 Dpi modethe software that comes with it is very usable just the thumbnails are a bit small which matters when you are trying to Identify individual pages of the scans to staple together into a PDF document I have stapled together pages from other documents buy mistake because of this I think the software needs updating to make this task a bit easierI would like the scanner to have a scan to PDF feature built in I would like to be able to press a button and to be able to keep putting pages in through the scanner and when you have finished doing that press the button and it converts them to a PDF document this would make life a lot easier than having to search and select the pages manually  which is very time consuming especially when you have dozens of pages to look throughEven if you could select a folder to put the scans into so as to keep them separate so there easier to find and convert to PDFIts a very good scanner and would recommend to others just bare in mind the issues I have highlighted.
5,Well first I have the easy bit!  What do I dislike about the WiFi Doxie Go SE - Portable A4 Document Scanner?Answer:- NOTHINGNow for the wonders of the "WiFi Doxie Go SE - Portable A4 Document scanner"Small footprintEasy to set up.  I have it available to my iMac & my MacBook Air both running Big Sur 11.12.1 (at present) my iPhone 8 @ iOS14.4.  all working A1.The scanning is fast and clean at 300dpi and 600dpi for photo see attached real scans. 1st is a book cover I need for the "badge" @ 300dpi and the photo is of my mam & dad in 1946!Excellent fat for A4 documents and when stapling them together if multiple scans are able to build into 1 document as .pdfs.Would I recommend it?  YES.Fantastic purchase.
5,I bought this scanner to scan documents to the cloud and my mac and it hasn't disappointed. I don't have an office but its compact enough to keep in a drawer until needed. It rapidly boots scans quickly and gives good quality images. You can use it as a standalone item saving scans to the SD card or connect directly to your computer. The Doxie software is simple but effective and intuitive. From here you can save to your computer or upload directly to your cloud account. You can scan at lower and higher definition.  I've been using it a month now on the high definition scan setting to scan well over 100 pages and haven't had to recharge it yet.  Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. I looked at a number of scanners but I'm glad I chose the Doxie.
3,Points positifs :- Petit- Léger- Pratique- Rapide- Bonne autonomiePoints négatifs :- Qualité bien inférieure à un scanner ordinaire même en 600dpi- Horribles traits blancs sur les scans- Cadrage à retoucher à chaque fois manuellement dans une autre application- Importation extrêmement lente depuis l'applicationEn résumé c'est un bon produit d'appoint mais un produit d'appoint ne coute pas aussi chère.La qualité le rend impropre à un usage sérieux je le renvoi donc.
5,...der 2. Generation des Doxie. Der Papiereinzug und die Handhabung mit den Blättern wurde stark verbessert auch etwas gewelltes Papier kann man nun gut einführen. Weiterhin gefällt mir sehr gut dass man nun auch bei am Mac angeschlossenem Doxie scannen kann. Die bekannte Doxie Software und die OCR Funktion sind ein Traum zum bearbeiten und exportieren der Scans - ich hatte noch nie so eine einfache und intuitive Software...Auch habe ich noch nie so einen herausragenden Kundenservice erlebt wie hier - man wird per Mail angeschrieben und gefragt ob alles in Ordnung sei und wie die Erfahrungen mit dem Scanner sind aber ohne dass der Kundenservice aufdringlich wirkt. Man hat als Kunde hier das Gefühl dass man gehört wird wenn es mal Probleme gibt und Verbesserungsvorschläge fließen in die Entwicklung mit ein. Bei der ersten Generation kam es ab und an vor dass der Scanner Seiten verschluckt (nicht gescannt) hat wenn man schnell nacheinander mehrseitige Dokumente gescannt hat. Das war ärgerlich da es keine Vorschau gibt und man das erst beim Einlesen der Scans in die Doxie Software gemerkt hat. Als ich das dem Service mitgeteilt habe bot dieser mir sofort von sich aus an den Scanner kostenlos umzutauschen und man hat mir sogar als Entschädigung ein Transport-Etui zum Tauschgerät dazu gegeben. Dieses Problem wurde hier bei der 2. Generation vollständig gelöst denn mit Doxie Go SE hatte ich nie wieder verschluckte Seiten die nicht gescannt wurden...
5,This product has changed my life. A long-time user of Evernote I have been striving to go paper free for a couple of years. The Doxie Go is the final piece that has allowed me to achieve this goal.Every single bit of post receipts or anything that comes across my desk is immediately scanned and then shredded. A quick review and staple in the excellent Doxie software then it's straight into Evernote for tagging and filing. It is small enough to keep in my work bag so it's always with me. The battery life is excellent although I don't know how long it lasts as it hasn't run out yet. I have tried it with a USB stick but I prefer the convenience of the capacious internal storage.All that said the product isn't without its minor frustrations...It definitely prefers paper with a laser-straight non-crinkled edge. Try to feed in something with a less than perfect edge and you'll likely fail first time. Over time you learn what will and won't work first time and just accept it.It also does some odd things when you scan photographs using the provided carrier as the odd image comes out slightly rotated (anything between 5 and 20 degrees) or looking like a parallelogram. It is easy enough in the Doxie software to undo this but when you're scanning a load of photos it is inconvenient when you have to fix 1 in 20 that have been mis-scanned.I would like a cover/carrycase for the scanner but think that £22.80 for the Doxie case is ridiculous. I would love to get a recommendation on an alternative.
2,I am very disappointed with my Doxie Go's battery performance. I want to warn other buyers who may be interested in purchasing this product and who plan to use it as I do.It has been less than 18 months from the date of purchase (12 April 2013) and the performance continues to deteriorate. I was a big fan. My Doxie Go was (stupidly in retrospect) my 2nd purchase. About a month before in March 2013 I had purchased a Doxie One also from Amazon.As Apparent (the manufacturer) points out in their FAQ now (http://help.getdoxie.com/doxiego/faq/scanner/battery/) if you plan to use Doxie with an Eye-Fi card and in 600dpi mode then the battery should last (only) about 30 pages of scans.Mine barely makes it for 10 pages and turns itself off. To make things worse the battery takes a long time (over 30 minutes) to charge on mains power (much slower via USB) — not exactly delivering me the efficiency and productivity gains the product advertises.A very very poorly designed and manufactured product from the battery suitability perspective. (I am not impressed with the paper feeder either but that's a different story.)When I purchase a product such as this (even in these days of built-in obsolescence) I do not expect my scanner to stop working within 12-18 months.So caveat emptor.I have written to Apparent about my displeasure. I will loop back if there is a at least a mildly satisfactory response. :-)UPDATE:Apparent's customer service is top notch. Soon after receiving my email they sent a replacement unit (a newer date of manufacture of the same model) directly through Amazon. The new unit performs much better on two counts: the battery lasts significantly longer and the paper feeder behaves better.Just on customer service alone and the better peformance of the unit I would now give 4 stars. The bottom line is I would buy this product again (and am considering it as a gift for a friend's birthday). Hope my painful but satisfactory overall experience is useful to others considering buying the product.
5,This scanner and software are great. The staple feature is first class for combining multiple pdf documents into one overall pdf document.Usage: Scan all your documents first then click the import edit or delete before saving as pdf etc.
5,What an excellent scanner I needed to collate all my paper work & my wifes businesses paper work to store in the Cloud.Its quick & simple to use great customer service available software a breeze to use I like the stitch pdf for invoices. I am still doing a lot of work but will be able to reduce the paper work. I would recommend the Doxie scanners plus took out extra 3 year warranty as this little scanner will be doing a lot of work.
5,After comparing a lot of other portable scanners I chose Doxie's SE wifi and I am happy with my choice. I have finally gone paperless both at work and at home. The price tag was a bit high but after researching online it seemed worth it. The portability and the ease of having your scanned documents even on your phone when you are on the move is really a big plus. Lastly I am impressed by their customer service who go to great lengths to follow up on your experience with the product and offer their support. I believe this is unique to Doxie and will make you satisfied that they won't leave you on your own after you have bought their product. Based on my experience I highly recommend this product.
5,Ero alla ricerca di un piccolo scanner per casa/lavoro e che fosse portatile.C’erano diverse opzioni disponibili ma alla fine ho scelto Doxie GO SE Wi-Fi e devo dire che i soldi spesi valgono assolutamente il prodotto acquistato.Estremamente user-friendly veloce e di configurazione istantanea permette anche l’integrazione con il proprio cloud storage preferito.Batteria di ottima durata e capace di sopperire a un notevole numero di scansioni continue (magari accendete il Wi-Fi dopo aver scannerizzato tutto).Il servizio di assistenza mi ha fornito utili consigli per usarlo al meglio e all’interno della confezione ci sono tutte le istruzioni necessarie.Quindi decisamente consigliato!
1,J'ai dû effectuer 250 scans maximum et l'appareil à encore ses étiquettes de protection c'est dire. Stocké dans mon tiroir il n'a pas vraiment connu la poussière. Article acheté le 11 mai 2020 et ne fonctionne plus à ce jour... même après recharge. Je déconseille cet article et surtout de mettre si cher dans un scanner qui au final ne fait pas mieux qu'un autre qui serait beaucoup moins cher et peut être pas jetable au bout de 2 ans...et quelques jours après la fin de garantie!
5,I purchased this scanner to digitise documents and the odd photo. It's a joy to use - so much faster than a traditional flatbed scanner because you can scan everything in one go and then import & organise it later. I especially appreciate the easy 'stapling' of scans together into multi-page PDFs. It's really obviously that Doxie have put a lot of care and attention into the product rather than simply 'tick the box' for a feature - highly recommended for anyone who wants a scanner that takes up hardly any space!
4,I purchased the Doxie Go to help me go paperless. I have countless receipts etc. that stick in my wallet for months and then either be binned or put in a receipts box.The Doxie Go and bundled software means I can quickly scan all receipts letters etc. and either store them on my computer or in cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive. This functionality means that I have access to my scans wherever I am.I don't use the Doxie as much as I thought I would - that's probably because I haven't embraced the paperless game as much as I was hoping but on the occasions I do use it I do like the ease of use and many features in the software such as stapling multiple pages and scanning to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to create searchable PDFs.If you want to get organised digitally and get rid of paperwork lying around the Doxie Go is a good choice.
5,Very compact and easily stored easy to set up and use clear copies made
5,Ok this is not the fastest nor does it do double-sided.But if you can live with that it has much to recommend it.  It is light easy to operate and has not complained with about 1000 sheets through it in the past day.  I have not encountered any issues.Being able to use the scanner without a computer or an adapter makes it very easy to take places (I don't know conferences etc or the kitchen while you're watching the kettle boil and want to scan a recipe book...).  I haven't really tested the battery life so your mileage may vary.The software is a cinch to use (Mac) and does a decent job of allowing you to 'staple' related pages together quickly into one doc.  It would be nice if there was a feature on the scanner to automatically collate related pages together while you scan but it only takes a few extra mins to do that on the computer.The transfer from the scanner to my computer could be a bit quicker but the software has a nice 'character' to it (if you can believe that!) where it lets you know it's going to be a while.  Probably the easiest bit of kit I've used in years.I have not used the OCR capabilities as I send my scans to Evernote and Google Drive which both have that.Recommended.
4,Manque une notice plus detaillee en anglais ou francais
5,Mittlerweile besitze ich den Doxie schon ein paar Monate habe über 1500 Scans gemacht und der Doxie läuft wie am ersten Tag.Den Akku habe ich ehrlich gesagt noch nicht an seine Grenzen getestet. Da ich immer mehr Seiten auf einmal gescannt habe hatte ich immer gleich das Netzteil benutzt. Ich habe als zusätzlichen Speicher einen 2GB USB-Stick angesteckt obwohl der interne Speicher bis zu 450 Seiten speichern soll. Das hat den Vorteil dass ich den USB Stick mit den Scans direkt an den PC anschließen und mit der Doxie Software importieren kann das geht schneller als wenn die Daten vom Doxie direkt importiere oder sie vom USB Stick durch Doxie durchgeschleust werden müssen. Somit muss ich auch das USB Kabel nicht immer parat haben.Die Papierzufuhr ist manchmal ein kleines bisschen fummelig. Hier wäre ein Anschlag mit einer kleinen Führung hilfreich aber wenn man den Dreh mal raus hat ist es kein Problem auch mehrere Seiten nacheinander zu Scannen.Der Kundenservice ist hier vorbildlich und hat sich mir sogar nach der Registrierung per Email vorgestellt. Man hatte gleich das Gefühl dass man hier gut aufgehoben ist und einem im Notfall (wenn man denn mal einen haben sollte) schnell geholfen wird.Alles in Allem bin ich sehr zufrieden - sowohl mit Doxie als auch mit dem Customer Service.
1,Scanning worked like a wonder. Via cable provided the images appeared on my newish iMac and could be viewed in and exported from Preview.  But... The instructions tell you to download at getdoxie.com/doeiegoSE the allegedly 'brilliant'  Doxie software.  That allows the user  to 'staple' images together in a pdf. A message during installation advised me to select automatic transfer of images via the 'brilliant' Doxie software to my Mac.  I did exactly as told and from then on NOTHING worked.  Manually or via the software.  The message I have got is "DOXIE_SD” couldn’t be mounted".  Total dud. Maybe it works with an iPhone but I don't see how you can use the usb cable provided with a newish iPhone. Similarly a newish iPhone does not have an SD slot (the alternative means of importing the images).  Oh and before I forget. I removed the Doxie software but this did not allow a return to the previous position where I could import to Preview.  Still no way of accessing the images.
5,L'utilisation en mode connecté ou non est très facile. Le fait de pouvoir scanner sans connexion est très pratique.On peut enlever la carte SD du scanner et elle peut ensuite être reconnue aussi bien sur un Mac muni d'un lecteur carte SD interne que sur un hub muni d'un lecteur carte SD par le logiciel Doxie.Je n'ai par contre pas pu connecter ce scanner sur mon réseau Wi-Fi mais j'ai 38 accès Wi-Fi à proximité et on ne peut pas maîtriser le réseau Wi-Fi sélectionné par le scanner. Par contre la connexion sur le réseau Wi-Fi créé par le scanner fonctionne bien.
5,For anyone looking for a small portable A4 scanner this is the one to buy. Great value works flawlessly and gives remarkably good scan quality. Scan speed is very fast... overall it is far quicker than placing sheets into a flatbed device. The bundled software does not have to be used but is very useful for collating scanned images into folders rotating/flipping images etc. It is well-written. I would like a larger 'thumbnail' view though.The device charges via its USB connection but those travelling away from a computer would be advised to buy the (low-priced) power adaptor since the image capacity far exceeds the battery capacity/One small con... it does not like papers that have creases or damages at the beginning i.e. top of the sheet. It is liable to misfeed. Can usually overcome by scanning the other way round and flipping the image afterwards. Comes with a transparent 'wallet' for holding small frail or damaged items so they can be scanned.For the best versatility the device can be used with an 'Eye-fi' SD memory card. Scans then automatically go (wirelessly over the local network) to a designated folder on the computer. This works amazingly well and is really a must-have!Summary : Pros - just about everything! A great device and very good value. Con (only one!) - struggles with damaged media more than would be expected.
4,seit ich den doxie go besitze sind die papierberge von meinem schreibtisch verschwunden.kurz eingescannt und fertig. das papier gerade in den schacht zu bringen ist anfangs etwas gewöhnungsbedürftiggeht einem nach kurzer zeit aber leicht von der hand.was ich in der software vermisse ist es die scans mit schlagwörtern zu versehen (wie bei evernote) da ich es aber eh mit evernote synce ist es eigentlich egal.die verarbeitung ist sehr gut und die scans sind gut aufgelöst (300/600dpi zur auswahl).die texterkennung arbeitet bei gedrucktem text hervorragend mit handgeschriebenem habe ich es noch nicht versucht.einziger makel:bis die sandisk eye-fi sd-card funktioniert hat hat es etwas gedauert.nach der ersten einrichtung lief es sehr gut nach dem nächsten start des doxie ging aber gar nichts mehr!der doxie hatte sich aufgehangen und musste mit einer büroklammer an der unterseite des gerätes resetet werden.die sandisk eye-fi karte wurde von der eye-fi software nicht mehr erkannt.ein formatieren der eye-fi-karte hat den fehler beseitigt. seitdem läuft alles fehlerfrei.was für den fehler verantwortlich war (doxie oder eye-fi) lässt sich im nachhinein nicht sagenallerdings ist das problem auch nicht mehr aufgetreten.
5,This Portable A4 Document Scanner with Rechargeable Battery is very easy to use.  The first one I ordered I had to send back but Doxie & Co could not have been more helpful.  I received a new scanner in days and all is working correctly now.  I even bought the case to go with this product.  If you are working from home this takes up no room and PDF quality is good.
5,Since moving house last year I've wanted to go paperless. The droves of paper coming through the front door day-after-day to my mind is totally unnecessary in such a digital age.And you may think paying nearly £200 for a scanner is ridiculous when you can find much cheaper options (c. £50) on Amazon. But honestly the size speed and intuitive performance of the Doxie is just f-ing fabulous. It's tiny; can be slotted into a drawer for safe keeping when not in use and doesn't need to be hooked up to either a computer or charger to function.Yes scanning hundreds of old documents is a ballache but it’s just part of the process. Once that initial phase is done things couldn't be easier if you stay organised.Highly recommend the Doxie to anyone if you're looking for a compact and easy-to-use scanner to help quell the tidal wave of post and paperwork.
4,Been using it for a few weeks. Very portable light weight and small. It has helped to reduce the volume of papers that I need to carry around for my work and to store like receipts and invoices for tax purposes for example.Has a good rechargeable battery. Main drawbacks so far are its feeding mechanism which is a bit fussy. It may stop half way when scanning documents that are longer than usual.The bundled software can be improved to make it easier to use and the OCR function/bundled software was poor at recognition standard text therefore I had to purchase another OCR software. Scanning photos is easy but the quality/resolution is not as good as I hoped.In all this is a good product and I am happy to recommend it.
5,Great little scanner. I had a few issues with the Wi-Fi as I am using it so far from my home router but I can still import via USB . I contacted Doxie about the Wi-Fi and they have been absolutely brilliant with their support. It's always nice if you don't have any issues with a product but in my view the way to tell a great company is how helpful they are if you do have an issue.
5,Easy to use  great quality totally portable and excellent.  it's superb picture quality.
1,I hardly give reviews but I need to tell people about this! Awful! Really difficult to transfer from the scanner to computer. Claims usb not working  then you try with the card and noting getting recognised. I bought this so it would be an easy quick task of scanning  waste ofTime and I’m getting money back
5,Nachdem ich bei mir privat mein Büro auf minimales Papieraufkommen umstellen wollte war ich auf der Suche nach dem optimalen Scanner für diese Aufgabe.Dafür mussten er folgende Punkte erfüllen:- Einfache Bedienung- klein uns handlich  damit er in die Schublade einer Kommode passt.- autark ohne PC benutzbar damit man schnell Briefe oder sonstiges einscannen kann- incl. einer guten OCR- einfache SW zum verschicken an Evernote Dropbox...Diese Arbeiten funktionieren hervorragend. Es macht richtig Spaß alles einzuscannen und weiter zu verarbeiten.Man schält ihn ein legt das Papier ein und er scannt in recht schnellen Tempo das Papier durch.Im nächsten Step verbindet man den Scanner mit dem PC liest die Dateien aus. Dann wählt man aus wie man die Dateien weiterverarbeiten will. Ich habe bei mir PDF mit OCR für Evernote voreingestellt. Dann drückt man send to Evernote und die Datei ist in Evernote.Bis jetzt konnte ich noch keinen negativen Punkt finden.Klar gibt es schnellere Scanner  bidirectional mit Stapelverabeitung. Diese Scanner passen jedoch nicht in eine Tasche oder Schublade.Zum Scannen von privater Post oder kleinen geschäftlichen Umfang ein toller mobiler Scanner.
5,Bought this for work and I am super happy with the product. We are moving to digital documents and to be honest I don't know if I can do without. I scan hundreds of documents per day and the Doxie is very easy to use and pretty quick to scan the images.I like to OCR option when exporting documents it makes it easier to work with files (pdf mainly). I hope it will be able to handle heavy scanning but after 3000 images already scanned I am pretty confident it will last for a loooong while.Thanks Doxie
5,The portability and speed of use of this scanner make it so quick and easy to scan receipts or paperwork without even needing to wait for a PC to start up. Scan quality is very good and the paper feeds in very smoothly and evenly.
1,Spend 40 minutes trying to get this to work. Waste of money
5,Doxie’s scanners are not only the smartest on the market their customer service is INCREDIBLE! I am bowled away by the customer care and support that has been provided by Doxie. This is the best customer service I have ever received and I would not hesitate to recommend this company to my family and friends. Not only impressed but genuinely moved and heartened by the humanity and kindness shown by Charles. Thank you :)
3,Pros:- Compact- Easy to use- Works with SD Cards internal memory or usb keys- Excellent software with very good OCR and pdf creation software.- Integrates with Evernote / Onenote etc very well.- Optional ability to work with certain Eyefi SD cards. Haven't tried this yet but certainly a bonus.Cons- Cannot handle the slightest kink or fold on the paper edge. Unless the paper is PERFECTLY flat at the edge it fails to suck it in or does so at an angle.  This renders the scan useless.Scanning bills and letters straight out of the envelope should be fine but scanning older documents - or even those that have been left in a pile for a few days is a PITA.  Constantly catching inside the unit.I am almost at the point where i get the iron out to allow me to scan some older important documents simply smoothing out the edge of a document is not sufficient.  ALMOST RETURNED PRODUCT DUE TO THIS.
5,Fits in my (large) handbag or laptop bag!  Great when moving from place to place for work.  Great images and very user friendly software.  I've had my Doxie for a few years now and have done over 23000 scans on it and it's as good as the day I bought it.When I bought it first I had some problems with it and got in touch with customer services and the help I received was just excellent.  I have bought others since and for my staff and everyone is delighted with the product.  An excellent mobile scanner.
5,A great product very light and portable very neat very small and very fast when you turn it on. It's very simple to use and the software is a great addition: it has a clear layout and can save the scans in different formats (PDF Jpeg and others). One of its best and unique features is the possibility to save them not only on SD cards as other scanners do but also on USB drives!I bought it from Italy with an excellent service from Amazon.co.uk fast shipping and great customer care both from Amazon and the seller Apparent). I decided to buy also the Doxie A4 case -- which is a great addition to protect and carry the scanner around -- as well as the World Power Adapter sold at a good and reasonable price and which is very useful for me and my work habits. I also got the great Color Skin pack for free (thanks for the chance to Amazon and Apparent!).Go get it for it's worth every single penny.
5,What a brilliant little compact device scans are quick and easy very good build quality and good packaging. Comes with free simple to use software. I would recomened the Doxie case. Very pleased
1,well needless to say I did not use it until about a month after the purchase and it was already broke and can not return it. my fault but really could use a portable scanner sooooooo. if you buy this test it out right away
5,Das Teil macht genau was es soll: Klein schnell weggeräumt oder mitgenommen Dokumente werden schnell und gut eingescannt und organisiert. Anfangs dachte ich die Möglichkeit des Anschluss' von USB oder SD-Karte wären das Beste muss ich sagen daß man die gar nicht braucht der interne Speicher reicht locker so daß ich das kaum benutze außer ich scanne mal jemand anderem etwas oder möchte ein Dokument nur auf dem Stick haben und mitnehmen und braucht so den Umweg über den Rechner nicht.Ist zwar teuer aber allein die Größe lohnt sich für mich schon da man nicht wieder ein weiteres Teil rumstehen hat mein All-In One habe ich mal entsorgt für die doch recht seltene Benutzung bei mir war das einfach Platzverschwendung so kann man auch mal etwas faxen oder ein Dokument ausdrucken unterschreiben einscannen und wieder zurückschicken per Mail oder Fax ohne große Geräte.Sehr speziell aber für meine Zwecke genau richtig und ist das viele Geld wert.
5,The first unit shipped to me was faulty but the replacement was sent immediately. The scanner is simplicity to use as is the software. As a standalone item it was possible to scan years of paperwork whilst watching the telly. Made a job I have been putting off for years simplicity. Next will be the Doxie Flip to attack the family photo albums. The customer service is superb too. I have no complaints at all.
5,I intend to use my Doxie for scanning all business and personal documents but since I received it I have been catching up on hundreds of old photos that I want to store on my PC.  I had searched for a suitable scanning device and luckily I found this perfect answer for what I was planning to do.  The Doxie is so easy to use and is very fast; I can get through boxes of prints all while watching TV.  The software for organising the scanned images is well thought out and invaluable for dealing with so many pictures.
4,Good product
5,Good size for mobile use nice easy to use software. Scan quality is very good.
5,Really portable and easy to use great features to edit the size and colour of scans overall really pleased with the product.
4,Bought this to scan a lot of documents and now use it to scan all my post and receipts.  It's very easy to use and the supplied software is actually useful.  The OCR function works great and there is an option to save onto the cloud (dropbox evernote etc).I've not found the photo scanning quality to be the best - the colours seem to be a bit washed out.  It can also be quite tricky at first to feed documents which can lead to some very odd skewed scans.  If there was a tray feed attachment that would be great.
5,I thought the price seemed a bit steep for this but eventually went for it and I'm so glad I did.The Doxie Go is so easy to use (not just hardware but software too). I bought the power adapter too (  Doxie Worldwide Power Adapter (for Doxie Go)        ) which (I assume) charges the unit faster than USB. The quickstart instructions tell you to fully charge the unit before using (never was there so much suspense caused by wanting to scan some documents) but after that wait I was away.It takes a little practice to get documents to feed through completely straight (although this doesn't really matter because the Doxie software -  a download from their website - is so quick and simple to use).Finally the integration with cloud services (Evernote and Dropbox to name the most prominent) is very good. Before long I'll be able to get rid of the boxes of old paperwork I have lying around!
5,This is a brilliant scanner it is small enough to fit in your bag starts up in seconds & scans in seconds. The best feature for me is the simplicity of Doxie brilliantly simple but nice clear documents. I honestly don't know why I didn't get one sooner.
5,This does just what I need.  I like the quick start cards that come with it.  Software easy enough to use.  For home scanning this works well enough.  If I had a very high volume of scanning I might think differently
5,★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ✅
5,Excellent little gadget. Easy to use and fast. I scanned around 200 photos in no time at the higher quality 600dpi.I’d recommend this product to anyone for all the old photos you have lying in a box somewhere (pre-camera phone days).
5,The Doxie Go is very small easy to carry around and (after a couple of practices) easy to get good quality scans with. It does a surprising amount of scans with one charge. I've been using it to scan a few years-worth of old documents to shred them and free up space and it's been incredibly easy. I just sit on the settee with papers to scan one side of me and put them the other side when done all the time watching TV. Much much better than having to stand at a scanner to do them. Once they're scanned you can convert to JPG or PDF and it will add OCR to the PDFs if you want. (Takes a little longer with OCR). In my experience to date the OCR has been fantastic quality (for printed text). Highly recommend this I'm very glad I got it. It. Just. Works.
4,Pratique dans un case petit et rapide mais un inconvénient majeur si vous ne passez pas par le programme Doxie vos pages restent fortement grisées en PDF la correction n'est pas directe.
5,Batterie vide au bout de 3 scans pour le reste sa va mais très déçu de la tenu de chargemais tres vite remplacer par le service client qui est au topsinon tres bon produit tres pratique tiens bien la charge avec la nouvelle batteriepeu encombrant indispensable pour commerciauxmerci au service client de sa reacivitée et de ses cadeaux en plus
5,I bought this product for its claimed ease of use however the first scanner received was faulty. I returned it and was very pleasantly surprised by Doxie’s after sales support. The replacement unit was sent quickly and it is now up and running perfectly.
5,Ich war anfangs sehr unzufrieden da ich Probleme mit dem Einzug hatte aber durch den Top Service von Apparent konnte alles gerichtet werden. Mein Scanner wurde problemlos umgetauscht. Zusätzlich erhielt ich auch noch Scanner Folien in die man zerknitterte Papiere oder kleine Kassenbons tun kann dies hilft ungemein und macht das Scannen viel schneller und zuverlässiger.Im grossen und ganzen ein super Konzept- mobil interner Speicher und man kann auch später erst auf den Computer HochladenDas spätere hochladen auf den Computer ist mein Lieblings-feature. Dank internem Speicher kann man den Scanner an machen Kassenbon rein und dann Scanner wieder aus machen. Nach einem Monat kann man dann das ganze hochladen kein nerviges ankoppeln wegen einem Blatt Papier.
5,I did a lot of research into portable scanners before deciding on the Doxie Go. I contacted the company in the States ( Apparent ) with several questions and in each case these were answered the same day. I read all the reviews on Doxie and 99% of these were positive. It works great with my Mac downloading the software was a breeze. It is very user friendly. Very fast scanner with a choice of 300 or 600 dpi. Quality is very good and certainly helping me achieve my goal of going paperless. Takes  a bit of time to get used to feeding the paper in straight but these can be corrected before downloading anyway. The World Wide Charger used to be an extra but is now included. You can scan whilst it is charging. Extremely pleased with my purchase.
4,Da ich ein begeisterter Evernote Fan geworden bin und meine Dokumente alle digitalisiere. War ich auf der Suche nach einen geigneten Scanner mit Texterkennung und einfacher Bedienung. Glücklich geworden bin ich mit Doxie. Denn er nimmt nicht viel Platz auf meinem Schreibtisch ein und schaut dabei noch sehr gut aus. Was mir besonders gefällt ist die Software mit dieser kann man die Dokumente kinderleicht nochmal bearbeiten. Zudem kann ich Ihn auch auf Reisen mitnehmen und alles auf eine Speicherkarte speichern und später hochladen! Und genau die Punkte sind seine Stärken!Wer allerdings einen Dokumentenscanner sucht der eine große Anzahl innherlab kurzer Zeit scannen kannist besser mit einem ScanSnap beraten. Das einzige was ich misse ist ein Duplexscann dann wäre der Scanner perfekt. Deshalb gibt es 4 Sterne.
4,There was a problem with the battery door not closing on my first Doxie SE however the seller replaced this promptly.Having tested I'm impressed with its simple operation and ease of handling scans using the downloaded software.
5,Je viens de le recevoir .Construction robuste et très bien fini. Simple d'emploi. Très bien expliqué. Complètement autonome. Scanne les documents jusqu'a 600 dpi. Les documents peuvent être convertis en texte très rapidement grâce à un O C R  intégrés multilangues.Cloud Doxi gratuit pour transférer fichiers par mail.Je suis très content de mon achat. Seul défaut: 1) ne scanne qu'une seule face il faut faire 2 opérations pour le recto verso 2) l'étui n'est pas compris il faut l'acheter en plus chez amazon.
5,This scanner is compact and easy to use the scans are of good quality and the space saved by reducing my paper filing is amazing.  Would definitely recommend :)
5,The 5 stars is for the product and customer service. The Doxie is perfect for my needs which are the desire to reduce the amount of stored household paperwork and to make information retrieval quick and easy. I had a large 3 in 1 before and the Doxie has meant I could retire it and free up much needed space.I had a battery issue with my Doxie. It would run off the mains but wouldn't turn on when not plugged in. I contacted apparant well in fact I responded to a customer service email. They had mailed me a replacement plus a free travel case that afternoon and I recieved it the following day. Customer service doesn't get much better than that. The replacement has worked seamlessly..
4,La portabilité et l’autonomie en font un produit top que je recommande mais.... dommage le mode d’emploi est très succinct et uniquement en anglais.Quelques difficultés de connexion wifi avec mon mac.
4,Was extremely happy with it for the two weeks I had the Doxie - unfortunately the power socket on the unit collapsed inwards and Doxie had to go back. Wasn't always easy to feed items through - some things especially slightly more dog-eared sheets - could take three or four attempts to go in. Other than that it does the job and the software (on Mac) is great.
5,When I received my new Doxie Go scanner I was pleased with the functionality however I noticed white streaks down every page which was obviously not acceptable so I contacted the manufacturer who suggested a few things including a 'deep clean' using rubbing-alcohol.  I've never heard of rubbing-alcohol let alone have any in the house so they ordered me some from Amazon!  I tried cleaning the device with it and it failed to resolve the problem.  So they promptly sent me a new unit!  I'm so impressed with their prompt and courteous customer-service.  I now have my second unit and it works perfectly so I'm pleased.  I would thoroughly recommend the product but even better I can advise customers that they will be well looked after incase of any issues.
5,Scaner très fonctionnel je le recommande à tous
5,Ich habe mir den Scanner angeschafft um endlich mal ein "papierloses Büro" umzusetzen oder zumindest teilweise zu realisieren.[+] scannt schnell[+] gute Qualität der Scans[+] einfacher Wechsel zwischen 300 und 600dpi direkt beim scannen[+] sehr einfach zu bedienen[+] Anschluss für USB-Stick und SD-Karte[+] 500MB eingebauter Speicher[+] scannt in jpg-Files kann also auch ohne Doxie-Software benutzt werden[~] die Windows-Software hat manchmal ihre Tücken so hängt diese manchmal während der Verarbeitung. Trotzdem gut benutzbar wenn man ein wenig aufpasst (zu große Dateien bringen Anwendung zum Absturz während der Verarbeitung hängt die Anwendung teils extrem)[-] etwas schade ist dass man mit einer Akkuladung maximal 100 Seiten scannen kann. Da ist es doch sehr zu empfehlen das passende Netzteil noch zu kaufen da man während des Ladevorgangs ohne das Netzteil nicht scannen kann und dann immer pausieren muss.
5,This product is amazing. Its so easy to use and the quality is great.The software makes it easy to rename docs staple them together and file on pc or cloud.The Doxie customer service is also fantastic. Ever question is answered quickly and to the point.I've used my Doxie for about a year and use it a lot. It still works like new.
4,Ich habe den Doxie Go Plus gewählt weil ich nur selten scanne und das Gerät schnell und platzsparend verstauen können möchte wenn ich es nicht brauche. Gleichzeitig ist mir die Qualität des Scans aber wichtig ich möchte nicht im Zweifelsfall doch wieder zum Copyshop rennen müssen.Beide Erwartungen erfüllt der Doxie Go Plus wie gewünscht leichte Abzüge gibt es a) für die etwas unhandliche SW (macOs) und b) den manchmal etwas hakeligen Einzug.
5,This is a life-changing device. Battery lasts for a while scanner works beautifully letting you scan and organize your expense reports (my purpose) or other documents in a very easy fast clean way. Its portability means you can take it with you on business trips and scan your receipts at the end of each day. I bought this for expense reports and the software is so good easy to put together scans save into pdf form that I've used it for ALL my scanning needs - obsoleting the scanner on my HP all in one. Highly recommended especially for those challenged in doing their expense reports. Scan .... stitch together your month expenses and save then all in one pdf document in three clicks.
4,Das Ding gefällt mir eigentlich ganz gut. Zwar ist der Papiereinzug erwartungsgemäß etwas fummelig dafür aber verschwindet das Gerät auch einwandfrei in der Küchenschublade. Von dort kommt es schön brav jeden Tag einmal hervor und frisst die eingehende Post. Näher werde ich dem papierlosen Büro vermutlich nie kommen!Einziges Manko ist die nicht ganz so gut gelungene Software: Vom Einzug bis zum fertig gescannten und sehr gut mit OCR analysierten PDF sind es einfach zu viele manuelle Zwischenschritte.
4,Guter Scanner mit einer sehr guten Auflösung. Installation war kinderleicht. Beim ersten Ladevorgang wurde - nach 7 Stunden Ladezeit - der voll geladene Akkustand nicht angezeigt. Der Online - Support (auf englisch) war super 24h.Der Grund warum ich nur 4 Sterne gebe ist folgender man kann über die App (iPhone) leider kein direkt Scan machen. Mann muss die Dateien alle einlesen und dann importieren. Theoretisch kein Problem aber mich stört das ein wenig.Grundsätzlich super Scanner mit einer extrem guten Auflösung.
5,Love it. Very easy to use.
1,Ich habe meinen Doxie go schon vor ein paar Jahren gekauft und war anfangs sehr sehr zufrieden. Eigentlich ein geniales Produkt und genau richtig für mich Scan-Gelegenheitstäter. Ich will kein großes Teil rumstehen haben. Benutzt habe ich ihn selten... in den letzten Jahren habe ich insgesamt nicht mehr als 200 Seiten gescannt. Also eine moderate Nutzung alle paar Wochen bzw. Monate mal ein paar Seiten. Im Normalfall lag er im Schrank und war dort weitgehend vor Staub geschützt. Dennoch macht der Einzug jetzt Probleme zieht das Papier überhaupt nicht oder nur noch schief ein. Die Sensoren spinnen ein wenig und die Mechanik greift nicht richtig. Jede einzelne Seite benötigt locker 5 Scanversuche und dann haben dennoch fast alle oben einen schrägen schwarzen Rand oben. Das Ding ist nicht mehr in der Lage halbwegs saubere Scans zu machen – die nicht völlig schief und krumm wie ein Fax aus dem Jahr 1995 aussehen. Der Akku ist ebenfalls wohl langsam am Ende – vielleicht hängt das aber auch mit der unregelmäßigen Nutzung zusammen. Der On/Off-Knopf hakelt. Das Gerät wird wenn angeschlossen nur noch manchmal erkannt und klemmt sich auch mal mitten während dem Import ab. Auf jeden Fall stehen mir die Haare zu Berge wenn ich mal grob ausrechne was ich pro Scan an Hardwarekosten hatte bei dem Teil. Ich werde es nun in einer feierlichen Zeremonie an der Wand meines Büros zerschellen lassen nachdem ich  soeben über 2 Stunden (!) brauchte um 20 Seiten Formulare so einzuscannen dass sie halbwegs ordentlich aussehen. Blöd halt wenns mal dringend ist.
4,Wenn man bedenkt wie schnell Scanner heutzutage sein können hätte ich wenigstens die Geschwindigkeit meines 5 Jahre alten kabelgebundenen Scanners erwartet. Leider ist der Doxie nur halb so schnell. Diesen Nachteil gleicht er aber durch seine Portabilität wieder aus.
5,Very easy to use best thing I have bought in a while
5,Not a budget scanner but worth the cost. Scanning pages certificates etc so easy on the go. Transfer via the free app WiFi web page cable connection direct from the sd card. Options to suit everyone. Would recommend the storage case to keep everything together.
5,Next day delivery was exactly that.The scanner is great.  Very easy to use and much smaller than I had anticipated.  I had not intended to carry the scanner away from home but now having seen it and used it I will.This is not a multi-sheet scanner but I have happily sat and fed it a series of documents as I catch up on my mail after a trip away.The software (on a Mac) is very easy to use and the ABBYY OCR is a great addition.I may sometimes have multi-page documents to scan and wish I had a sheet feeder but my normal use will be domestic documents personal certificates for work work documents and receipts.  For those the Doxie is perfect.
5,Bought at the end of 2015 and has proved to be last year's best buy. What a fantastic machine.I keep it at the side of my desk these days and as soon as I've read my incoming mail whatever needs to be recorded is immediately scanned then shredded and at long last I've managed to get on top of my "filing".It is very simple to use and has immediately solved the "problem" of masses of bills/letters etc. lying alongside my old scanner/printer to be scanned "one day". With the Doxie I scan *immediately*.More than a good buy it has been a very good investment.
5,Great product does everything you need and more and excellent customer service on top A*
4,Pour scannés en PDF il faut d'abord scannés en jpg et convertir en pdfBatterie ne tient pas bien et pas de possibilité de scannés direct sur le pc
5,Der Preis ist etwas zu hoch aber dennoch würde ich es immer wieder kaufen da die Qualität stimmt und schnell überall einsetzbar ist!
5,Very early days with this rechargeable scanner but first impressions are that it is an excellent piece of equipment that suits my needs perfectly. I selected the Doxie Go after some excellent reviews elsewhere (as well as on Amazon) and wanted something that could help me achieve my goal of eventually going paperless at home and in the office: enter the Doxie Go! If you aren't *that* bothered about the risk of paper being fed through crooked (I am lazy and have been scanning on my lap rather than on a flat surface like a table!) then you will be really impressed with the simplicity of the equipment and the software too!
4,Easy to use really fast and accurate. Good quality.For a personal use is perfect. I'm scanning all mu docs (invoices ticket etc) since a long time and this product is perfect for me.My "negative" points are:- price that is honestly too high- forget to import large amount of docs. It is really boring...I do reccomend this small qty of scanning
5,Before this was a not so good review. My Doxie Go lost documents and the battery was weak all the time. After two days I sent it back but after reading this review someone from Doxie got in touch with me - yes great customer service! It seems I had a faulty device. They sent me a new one for free which works absolutely fine. I like the software very much. It is easy to use and well designed. I send my files to Dropbox. There is an Evernote link as well. Scanning quality is great. It takes about 8 seconds for a page. You can "staple" documents after scanning and save as PDF or other format. Really great gadget!
5,The Doxie Scanner is actually what I needed to scan in receipts and documents for tax purposes! What I like about the product is not only does it work well the customer service is outstanding! I had a couple of questions and they emailed me right back with the instructions. Great product works well!
5,Got one to go paperless so I could ditch all my old paperwork. It's brilliant. The device itself is small functions well and charges last for ages. It's not the fastest scanner because you have to feed paper one sheet at a time but then I've found that scanners that feed themselves often don't work well with old dog-eared paperwork because they end up skipping sheets or scanning wonky.The free software is simple and great - one of the main reasons I got it. And the customer support has been brilliant (not had a problem yet but friends have found them very helpful).
4,Very handy scanner.I only use it at home. Works fast and easy.The only disadvantage is that when you use the Doxie with the WIFI SD the battery is low after a few scans. So now I just use the Doxie without the WiFI SD.Very good tool for your administration in combination with Evernote.
5,I just have to say it... OMG! It is the coolest gadget I've purchased lately. It is good looking fast easy to use easy to set up etc. It feels like very good build quality.I can recommend this Doxie Go to all people who wants to get rid of all those piles of paper - or just want a cool gadget. I use it for scanning all incoming letters at home. And at work it's a network scanner with an eyeFi card. Cheapest network scanner EVER! The coolest function ever! Everybody at work can scan - and then Doxie just sends the documents to a central server.Buy it! - Anders
5,Compré uno igual que este pero sin wifi hace unos años y por desgracia se me cayó al suelo y se rompió. Compré otro de otra marca en teoría mejor pero ya lo tengo a la venta porque no es como este. Es el mejor scanner que he probado gran calidad de imagen buena batería muy útil su app para smartphone y lo puedes guardar en cualquier lado que para una persona que viaja mucho como yo te salva la vida si hay que escanear facturas tickets fotos o páginas de catálogos. La carga de la batería ha mejorado una barbaridad comparado con el que yo tenía.Una compra segura si buscas movilidad portabilidad y calidad.
5,Great product efficient and simple design.Customer service is excellent.
1,Der Doxie GO SE konnte weder am MacBook Pro PC noch am iPhone eingerichtet werden da kein WLAN erkannt wurde. Scans werden nur als jpeg gespeichert pdf Umwandlung nur umständlich über die ausbaufähige Doxie Software. Bildqualität ist ok mehr aber nicht. Für diese "Leistungen" und Fehlfunktionen leider zu teuer und unzuverlässig.
5,Fantastic little scanner if you're trying to go paperless. It's really nice being able to scan incoming mail without having to start up the computer.The software could be a little more intuitive but it works as promised and it's easy to "staple" pages together and save as a single PDF. One nice feature in the software is the ability to save as a PDF with inbuilt OCR text.Can occasionally be a little frustrating feeding in pages (especially when a little crinkled) but not enough of an annoyance to mark down.Best scanner I've owned by a long mark.
5,Der Doxie Go Wi-Fi ist ein handlicher kleiner Scanner (kleines Manko: keine Transporthülle)er ist gut geeignet falls man- wenig Scanvolumen hat- ab und an mobil scannen möchteDie WLAN Funktion ist praktisch aber leider nicht in ein existierendes WLAN integrierbar. Der Scanner baut sozusagen ein eigenes WLAN auf in das man sich dann einwählt zum Scannen.Besonders hochwertig finde ich Qualität der Texterkennung wenn man über die Doxie Anwendung ein durchsuchbares PDF erzeugt. Hier traten bei mir keine Fehler auf - anders als z.B. bei der Texterkennung meines Multifunktions-Druckers.Klare Kaufempfehlung
4,Très bon produit Dommage que la langue française ne soit pas pris en charge sinon j’aurai mis 5 étoiles
5,This is one of the most useful pieces of equipment I have. I travel a lot and being able to scan documents is so much easier than photographing them and it means I don't have to carry a lot of papers and documents around with me. I scanned a whole training manual the other day which meant I didn't have to carry the manual home. I can't recommend more highly. The only thing I wouldn't bother with is the case I also bought as that makes it bulkier. A fabric bag is perfectly ok.
3,In the main this works well but I just wish the EyeFi card didn't protrude out of the scanner.It means you can't keep the card in when you put the scanner in it's case - so more faff when using it.Quality is reasonable but it does take a bit of practice to get the paper aligned right for a scan - also if there are any creases they show quite clearly.
5,Its great easy to use and portable
5,Great product. The portability is very convenient.Also Doxie has some great support.About a year after my purchase there was an issue with my unit and customer care sent me a new one right away.Since then I've been using it quite regularly (about 3 years now)Were I to get a new one I'd get the Doxie Go SE with Wi-Fi but since my unit still works so well I haven't done so yet.
5,I considered other pricier scanners tried using my MFD's flatbed but ultimately it's convenience and NOT features that will get one in the habit of getting and staying paperless.If you need a high quality scanner this is not the one you can get higher resolution flatbeds for a similar price.If you need something simple to scan daily correspondence receipts etc for storage with Evernote or other similar services don't be put off by the low specs it's more than sufficient for the job and the ease of use is what matters so get one.
5,I spent a little bit of time looking for a portable scanner by which I mean say an hour and settled on the doxie. I'm often a bit skeptical of hardware without a well known brand but the Doxie Go is bang on. It has a nice simple paper feed it works well isn't fussy and comes with excellent simple software for PDF documents Dropbox upload etc. When I say "it comes with" for the software I mean you need to download it from their website (no physical media) but this is hardly a problem. It's saved me hours this thing thumbs up.
5,Genau der Scanner den ich wollte: klein und mit optimalen Qualität beim Scannen
4,Als mobiler Scanner perfekt. Akkuleistung ist erstaunlich gut. Arbeitet perfekt mit meinem MacBook zusammen.
1,the scan worked quite ok but the software inwas using was not ok. Also the wifi connection takes a long time to setup. its quite complecated to change from direct readout to sd card readout
4,Really great scanner.So easy to use great software that comes with it.Online manual is very clear.Internal memory SD card USB stick: you can scan to whatever you like!The best thing is the integration with Evernote/ Dropbox and other cloud systems through the Doxie software.
2,Syncing via WiFi is clunky and unreliable. Looks like it doesn't natively support uploads to Google Drive (only via Drive's file system mount). The whole experience reminded me of bluetooth with sounds like a good idea but doesn't actually work.
5,Looks good nice size and compact.I thought that the print quality could have been a bit clearer.
4,Erfüllt seinen Zweck speziell offline unterwegs Dokumente zu scannen perfekt. Mit Evernote  etc gut für s private Dokumentenmanagement.Die empfohlene Eye-Fi Karte  ans Zusatz für die drahtlose Anbindung an Laptops etc. ist NICHT zu empfehlen. der dafür notwendige - fehlerhafte Einrichtungs & Registrierungsprozess könnte einem den Spass verderben . Siehe auch  Review zur Eye-Fi karte in der online FAZ.==> Scanner allein ggf mit der Hardshell tasche kaufen in den Rucksack werfen und unterwegs nutzen. ggf Abends per Kabel die Scans in den Computer downloaden.
4,A première vue appareil super seul bémol pas de notice d'emploi en français donc je tâtonne sans savoir quel est le résultat
4,Positiv:- einfach zu bedienen und mit dem eingebauten Akku flexibel einzusetzen- relativ flotte Scans- Software arbeitet sehr gut mit dem Mac- sehr kompakt- Qualität der Scans gut- "Zieht" auch kleinere Dokumente wie z. B. Visitenkarten einNegativ:- Einzug ist etwas fummelig man muss das Papier schon sehr genau einführen- Das Papier darf kaum einen Knick oder ähnliches am oberen Rand haben dann funktioniert der Einzug nicht mehr korrektInsgesamt ein guter Kauf.
5,The device works well. It's small so we can leave it on the kitchen table and scan the mail as it comes in. Whenever we have a moment we can plug it in to any machine and pull down all the scans (shared folder in Dropbox). The OCR makes the PDFs searchable and I particularly like the staple feature (combine scanned pages into a single PDF). I can't fault it.But I wouldn't bother with the Eye-Fi for wifi. You can only connect to a single machine you can't use 5MHz on your network and I had to turn off QoS. The software for the Doxie is excellent but the Eye-Fi's is terrible.
3,ich habe mir den "Doxie go" gekauft aber schließlich trotz tollem outfit und wirklich absoluter Winzigkeit wieder zurückgegeben:++++ ultra transportabel (ca. 5x5x26cm HxTxB)++++ scanen überall (da Accu-Betrieb und interner Speicher) - toll!+++ sehr gute Software (mitgeliefert)++ scannen auf SD-card+++ WLAN (über eine entsprechende SD-card)++ wertige Verarbeitung---- der Einzug war zu fummelig---  teuer für dieses Gerät (200- €)Gesamteindruck:- absolut super klein- optimal mobiles Gerät (mit optionalen WLAN)- etwas "verspielt"- sehr teuer- nur geeignet wenn man wenig scannen will- für mich also nicht geeignet(ich habe dann schließlich den "ScanSnap 1500" gekauft: der absolute Hammer für meinen Zweck - aber auch teuer)
5,Ist ok tut seine Arbeit. Keine deutsch Beschreibung.Habe Ihre a-Mail erhalten . Und bin erstaunt das es noch Unternehmen gibt. Den der Kunde bzw. die Zufriedenheit des Käufers liegt. Ich bedanke mich bei ihnen für die Gutschrift. DankeFür Kundenfreundlichkeit kann ich 5 Sterne Plus geben.Noch mal Danke
5,Ich mache es kurz: Ich habe den Doxie gesehen bestellt und geliebt. Ich arbeite viel mit Evernote und versuche auch im Privatleben alles zu digitalisieren der Doxie Go macht alles mit. Die Software ist auch gut und OCR funktioniert super. Das einzige was mich etwas nervt: Man muss mehrseitige Dokumente in der Software "tackern" das ist schön gelöst aber wenn es über ein kurzes drücken auf den Power-Knopf z.b. auch ohne Software ginge wäre ich noch zufriedener. Vielleicht kommt es ja noch mit einem Firmware-Update.Fazit: Super Gerät nicht ganz billig dafür aber auch super im Handling.
5,I have been using the Doxie scanner for over 3 years now and it stopped working. Even though it was out of warranty they sent me a brand new one next day delivery!It does exactly what it is meant to do at a good quality!
5,All of my personal and business life is in Evernote iCloud Google Drive and Dropbox and this 'talks' to them directly. I can't believe how easy it is to have a pdf or jpg go to a specific Evernote folder just by naming it (ie. VAT Receipt @Business @Receipts would put it straight in that sub folder).There is so much more I could gush about but others have done it here so I won't repeat. Just another essential Mac peripheral (and Windows too I'm sure...)
3,I love the idea of this compact scanner and I've used it quite a lot. Ideal for scanning receipts newspaper cuttings you name it. But the paper feed is sometimes very fussy and it can be a pain to get something to feed and scan if the paper has a curled edge. Overall good but not brilliant.
5,Perhaps somewhat expensive but REALLY useful if you want to digitize really fast all the paperwork old photos ...  This is an equipment that makes real the paperless home.  Also is very small.Only thing is that apparently you can not scan if you want to charge the battery at the same time (I have not found information about this in the web site of the manufacturer).  Also there is a need for a more complete user manual.
5,This is a very good machine and does exactly what it is designed to do.Very good value for money.If you need a scanner this is the one to have.
3,Ne tient pas la batterie et après 500 Scan commence à faire du bruit au niveau du moteur qui entraîne la feuille je sais pas combien de temps il va tenir dommage car le concept est bien pense
4,good for on the go scanning items but feeding the paper can be difficult at times need to improve on that
5,Works like a charm and the customer service is great helped me to go paperless within 2 hours. Battery is incredible and the quality of the scans are great use it in conjunction with an EyeFi card so my scans are transferred to my Windows machine over wifi automatically.The doxie software is clean and easy to use I was connected and up and running in 20 mins.
5,What a brilliant little piece of kit this is. I do a lot of work at client's homes where I have to see copies of things like driving licences and Registration Documents and this is ideal. But I have now discovered another major plus; it is faster than my Canon LIDE scanner even when the Canon is in 75 dpi greyscale the Doxie knocks pixels off it at 600 dpi as far as speed goes and in colour too!
5,Doxie Go is brilliant. I have been waiting for ages for someone to invent this. No more lugging about a flatbed scanner and a laptop. This does it all and is about the size of a Toblerone. The design of the hardware is great and it couldn't be simpler to use. It doesn't even need to be plugged in.
5,Das Teil scannt wirklich alles. Man kann die Scans  dann einfach auch in diverse Cloudspeicher ablegen; ich nuzte zum Beispiel evernote. Vorher kann man auch Seiten drehen zusammenstapeln oder anderweitig anpassen. Meistens funktioniert es aber vollautomatisch.Ist nicht gerade billig aber die Qualität ist gut und man ist auch tatsächlich mobil: der Scanner ist ziemlich handlich.Durch die Dokumentenscan Funktion werden auch durchsuchbare PDFs generiert.Ich möchte den Scanner nicht mehr missen (nutze ihn übrigens am Mac mit Mountain Lion)
5,Ich benutze den Scanner nun seit ein paar Wochen und muss sagen ich bin super zufrieden damit. Nicht nur das Scannen von Dokumenten sondern auch von Fotos funktioniert perfekt. Die Qualität hat mich sehr positiv überrascht und würde diesen Scanner jederzeit wieder kaufen. Super Produkt. Auch das Speichern auf USB Stick oder SD Karte funktioniert ohne Fehler. Allerdings sollte man wirklich beachten den Scanner vor dem ersten Betrieb wirklich komplett aufzuladen da es sonst zu Problemen mit der Erkennung kommen kann.
4,Verbraucht kaum platz und macht genau das was er soll.Ich setzte Ihn im Zusammenhang mit einem MAC ein. Die Software ist einfach und übersichtlich und wirklich von jedem zu bedienen.Einziger minus Punkt: Wenn ich den doxie lade kann ich nicht scannen. Schade.Ansonsten ein herrliches Gerät für Menschen die kein Papier mögen aber ständig damit konfrontiert werden.
4,Been using this a while and I use it to digitise everything.
5,i have a lot of family photos and need to share them with the family some want digital copies I have a large open top scanner that would take ages to scan This one I can take anywhere as no need to connect a computer the rechargeable battery lasts very well and the quality is excellent Would definitely recommend
4,Really easy to use and makes scanning of papers effortless compared to my ols HP wireless all in one.Now i scan everything
5,Although pricey the Doxie Go is just the tool I needed to get miscellaneous correspondence and documents into one place and ready for filing.  The point is that stuff can be scanned as soon as you get it - no need to wait until you are at the same place your regular scanner or your PC is or to start up a program on the PC.
5,Superb very pleased & the software is so easy to use i.e. editing sizing & saving. Amazing piece of kit!
5,Doxie est facilement transportable. Je le protège dans une boîte en cuir.Parfait résultat de scan (notes de frais papiers administratifs photos pièces d’identité) 300/600dppi. Rapide bien que élément par élément.
5,Good product and Customer service is excellent
1,The battery is not charging. Immediate return to amazon.
5,Great for scanning in the post as it arrives no computer required when scanning scan straight to a SD card and transfer to a computer periodically. The only negative I have on this is the same as others it's sometimes hard to scan paper that has a folded corner etc.
5,Fantastic product does what it says on the box and does it well
5,I love this little gadget. If you don't like complication and you hate paper cluttering up your life then like me you may find this office tool ideal.I am very happy with the practicality of the Doxie Go.  It works great and looks great. More convenient than a flatbed scanner.
5,Dieser Scanner ist sein Geld wert. Alles an ihm ist top!!! Kann nur zum Kauf raten.Schade ist nur das man den Scanner nicht direkt ansteuer kann mittel Twain. Aber die Software erledigt alle für einen. Man brauch nur scannen und Speichern fertig!
5,Petit compact car se de 8. Go pour rapatrier mes docs scanner sur l’ordinateur et ce n’est pas lordi l’application iOS permet d’envoyer les docs mal mail etc
5,Thank you for your service I got my order in no time. Scanner is small and comfortable to carry around scanned more than 400 pages already and have no problem. Also fits great in the car glove compartment. Easy to clear paperwork on the desk. :)
5,Cela fait un moment que je cherche un scanner rapide autonome que je peux emmener partout et grace a Doxie j'ai enfin trouvé le produit parfait !
5,Does what it says on the tin
5,Product does what it says. Easy to set up great software and outstanding support.
4,Had a little trouble getting started but once on the way I had no problems what so ever. I do recommend.
5,Nicht billig aber genial weil nicht so ein Monster Scanner herumsteht. Würde ihn mir wieder kaufen und kann ihn sehr empfehlen
2,Lieferung erfolgte schneller als erwartet. Gerät in Ordnung ABER es ist keine SD Karte dabei! Ein wichtiges Teil ohne dem das Gerät nicht funktioniert. Leider erst gemerkt als ich schon alles ausgepackt habe - konnte daher nicht mehr zurücksenden.
5,Meilleur chose que l on est inventer sa m evite d acheter un ordinateur portable
5,I'm trying to go paperless and this is making it really easy! It's so quick and simple to use. It's such a sleek little thing it's hard to believe that it's so powerful! I really love this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a scanner for personal use.
5,Scans easily well built and simple to use. The software is good editing the scans stapling and performing OCR is very easy. The only downside I have found is that it can take ages for the software to recognize the scanner (and new scans) on my Mac.
5,Excellent scanner  fiable léger pratiqueExcellent service après venteJe suis enchantéJe conseil vivement
5,What a superb bit of kit. fantastic excellent worth every penny. Fantastic reproduction on all my old photo's. very easy and quick to use. You can't go wrong with a Doxie. I went for the 600 dpi one great.
4,Very good but a little fast won't will do good.
4,Very good. Scans high quality just works.
5,Der Scanner ist ok. Das er nur in JPEG und mit 300 dpi scannt ist verschmerzbar besonders da darauf hingewiesen wird. Über die SD Karte ist die Datenübertragung auf den PC problemlos. Ein super Gerät für unterwesgs vorallem mit der orginalen Tasche.
5,Great little scanner that I use with colour photos
3,je suis très satisfait de ma commande
5,Der Scanner ist perfekt für das tägliche oder wöchentliche „Wegscannen“ von Belegen und Unterlagen. Die Dokumente können eine Weile auf dem Scanner verbleiben sodass man sich nicht sofort um die digitale Sortierung und Archivierung kümmern muss.
5,Very simple to set up and use and not needing to be attached to a computer while it is scanning is a real bonus. The doxie software is easy to use too and does the job well. I'm very happy with it!
5,Je l'aprecie spécialement car je peux l'utiliser hors de chez moi sans problème.
5,Tolles Gerät. Einfach zu bedienen. Ich nutze es für mein papierloses Büro und wende Doxie zusammen mit Evernote und OneNote an. Aber auch alte Fotos lassen sich mit guter Qualität digitalisieren.
5,Buongiorno questo scanner è ottimo piccolo e non ha bisogno di essere collegato al pc ha una buona batteria che permette di fare scansioni ovunque...ha accessori per scansionare foto in formato 10x15 e 13x18 in più per le diapositive lo consiglio ottimo prodotto
5,Good Product
1,Favourable reviews encouraged  me to purchase. First one to arrive was supposedly new but looked second hand and wouldn't switch on. Second one has faulty wifi so it's also going back. Rubbish.
5,My husband loves this little machine it is so easy to use and take with you. We use it for our Heritage Group to copy things people loan to us.
5,Ein tolles Gerät durch die software war es sehr einfach an den START  zu gehen.Im täglichen Geschäftslenem nicht mehr weg zu denken.dA ES VOM Gewicht leicht zu transportieren ist habe ich es immer dabei und möchte nicht mehr drauf verzichten.
5,Useful and practical scanner leave it on the arm of your chair and watch tv whilst scanning all your paper bills (which were previously stacked up in the corner of your spare room.
1,Rien en Français pas de manuel traduit un chat toujours en anglais qui confirme que rien n'existe dans la langue de Molière... Quand on veut conquérir un marché on se donne les moyens. J'ai renvoyé l’article sans le déballer.
5,Excellent product and so handy to have around I have now digitised all of my important documentation with great ease
5,Easy to use and works well.Only improvements would be a better battery and to put the wifi in the unit rather than the memory card.
5,Unglaublich so klein und soviel power! Kam außerdem am nächsten tag. Und der wagen ist sofort angesprungen kann es immer noch nicht fassen
5,Schnelle Lieferung. Artikel ist wie beschrieben. Der mobile Scanner ist vollkommen einfach zu bedienen und praktisch. In Verbindung mit der Wifi Speicherkarte können die Bilder direkt an den PC übermittelt werden. Einfache Handhabung!
5,Simple to use. Brilliant device . Ideal for home office and home. Easy to use. Paper overload is a thing of the past. Great integration for Dropbox and Evernote.
5,Have use it to scan many of our ancient family phoyos and it has done a very good job.
1,..andere Male scheint er Scans zu verschlucken!Im Moment funktioniert er überhaupt nicht mehr.Die Qualität ist O.K. Mehr aber auch nicht.Das Beste am Scanner ist dass er auch scannt wenn der Pc ausgeschaltet ist.
5,Brilliant. Fantastically easy to use and the software makes it child's play to import the scans as images or PDF files.
5,everything fine
5,Funziona bene ed è abbastanza comodo in mobilità. Istruzioni chiare ed ho richiesto informazioni al supporto  su di una modalità particolare di utilizzo; l'operatore è stato gentile ed attento aiutandomi con le indicazioni.
5,this is a fab little scanner that is simple to use and works. easy to carry around and then connect to my computer to upload scans
5,Excellent piece of kit to help you go paperless.
5,excellent product coupled with the eye card wifivery satisfied by :- compacity- scan quality- and automatic web upload service
5,Excellent mobile scanner would recommend anyone getting one of these.
5,An amazing bit of technology. Fantastic value and super fast delivery. Very pleased.
5,Questo scanner mi ha risolto molti problemi di mobilità è affidabile la durata della batteria è sufficiente per la scansione di parecchi documenti.Sono riuscito a scannerizzare interi album di famiglia in pochi minuti. Per ora l'acquisto della schedina SD-Wifi mi sembra superfluo.
1,Didn't work
5,Cumple todo lo que promete. Cómodisima para mi ha merecido la pena el wifi incorporado. Plug and play. Y dos palabras mas
5,Reliable tool for my work. Definitely recommended.
5,Very good
5,Comodissimo praticissimo facilissimo da usare ed affidabile. Consigliato soprattutto anche per chi viaggia. Da acquistare senza esitazioni. Ottimo collegamento Wi-Fi
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
5,Excellent product excellent seller
5,It does a great job!
5,Good product
5,This is the second Doxie I've owned and it works very well for all my scanning needs (mail/bills receipts etc.).  What sets Doxie apart is the it-just-works software that produces clean B&W OCR'd PDFs with minimal fuss.  Everything is very well thought out.I haven't had the occasion to use the WiFi features yet because it's so easy to just pop out the SD card but I know from my previous Doxie (the original Go) that these are also well thought-out.
5,I have been using my doxie for 2 weeks.  It is a huge time saver for quickly scanning and saving receipts.  The scan quality is excellent. i had been utilizing the scanner on my canon printer.  After looking at the huge pile of business receipts I needed to scan I started researching scanners that would hopefully make my life easier.  The doxie scanner certainly met my needs.  You can scan in dozens of receipts in no time flat.  Once your scanning is done you have the option of stapling scans that are part of a multi page document.  Doxie software also gives you the option of saving your scans in a range of formats.  Up to this point the software has worked well.  The other nice thing about the scanner is that it is very portable.  Shortly after I made the purchase I was contacted by a doxie rep making sure all was well.  As a toankyou for the purchase doxie sent me a carrying case that is of excellent quality.  Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
4,Wonderful time-saver compared to traditional scanner but disappointing that you must save to an SD card and cannot save to a thumb drive as it has no USB port. Scan quality is good at 300 or 600 dpi. Glad I bought it and would do so again.
5,I've been looking to get a portable scanner for years now and finally bit the bullet and purchased the Doxie Go SE after a lot of research. So far I am extremely happy with it! It works perfectly on my WIndows PC and my Mac and doesn't even need to be connected to a computer at all to scan things which means I can scan from anywhere that is convenient for me. The battery charge lasts a long time too which means I don't have to be tethered down when using it.The packaging and instructions it came with were wonderful and easy to understand. Setting up the Doxie was quick and easy. It came with a 32 GB SD card which holds a ton of files.The actual process of scanning items is quick and efficient. I have so far digitized hundreds of papers and I can't wait to fully digitize everything and declutter my home. The software it comes with is very useful and the fact that you can create searchable PDFs and staple items together into one file is very handy. It will make organizing my digital files so much easier!On top of that Doxie's customer service is the best I've experienced in years. They reached out several times to make sure everything was going OK and I was happy with the product and provided helpful tips and were there to answer any questions. They have been phenomenal and I am 100% certain that if I were to experience any issue at all with this product they would be there to help resolve it immediately. I haven't felt this confident in a company's customer service in a long time. Kudos to them for supporting their customers and standing behind their products!
5,I’ve had a printer/scanner/copier machine for years. The scanner used to work a long time ago both on windows and on linux but doesn’t work anymore (maybe because of O/S upgrades?).As a work around I would snap a picture with my smartphone and after a few tries to get all the corners in and the text in focus (my hand occasionally shakes a bit) no shadows and no bright sun-spots with one hand holding the phone one hand holding down the document and one finger pressing the button on the phone…  And then to transfer the image file to the PC I used Bluetooth or email because the phone doesn’t connect to the pc for file transfer with a usb cable. And then I would usually forget where the scan was on the PC.Time to stop wasting time.Doxie is amazing. It’s as simple as can be. Feed the paper or photo use the supplied software to build muti-page pdfs if needed send the scanned document to the cloud. It automatically cleans up and it’s quick as can be.  It will work without a computer too (it saves to an SD card).Currently we’re scanning important documents scanning old letters scanning photos  storing all in separate folders in the cloud and getting rid of the originals. I've never been so organized in my life.
5,Great little scanner.  Love that you can walk around to scan then upload them all
5,This scanner is perfect for receipts/ accounting. It's been a dream. So easy to use and cuts my scanning time in half! Before I was using a scanning app on my phone such a pain. Thanks Doxie!
5,This product is great. It scans incredibly fast compared to a printer scanner. I would have been scanning my family photos for years with a printer scanner. With this i was able to scan thousands of photos of different sizes in a matter of weeks (a couple hours 2-3 days a week). It is easy to adjust the scanner to different sized photos and easy to edit them afterwards if required. I even scanned old family recipes as it isn't limited to photos. Even better than the product was the customer service. Back in January I was scanning photos for a slideshow for my father's funeral. The scanner would not work so I contacted customer service to see if i could troubleshoot it with them. They got back to me right away but unfortunately it could not be fixed. However even tho I was a couple of weeks outside of the warranty they quickly shipped me a replacement unit (received it in a few days) and only asked that i send them back the old one which they paid the shipping for. Overall I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to back up their family photos.
5,Scanner is so easy to use downloaded the app for my MacBook Pro charged up the scanner and scanned a bunch of 8X10 photos in 600 dpi jgp mode.  Extremely please on how fast the scanner worked in comparison to my old flatbed scanner.  Attentive post sale contact to see that everything was working and I was happy with the scanner.  So far no issues.
5,I bought this scanner to digitize many years of photo albums. It is perfect. Lightweight small and easy to use. I am Apple based and have had no issues with software or connectivity.  The WIFI feature is awesome albeit a bit finicky (slow at times to connect to network). I have since used it for newspaper clippings in order to digitize scrapbooks. It's much easier and faster to use than scanning documents through my printer. I highly recommend this scanner. There may be more inexpensive scanners out there however I feel this is a great device for the money. Grab the carrier sheets also as it will make grouping items together a breeze.
1,This product was supplied with a dud battery so could not function..On contact with Doxie they denied warranty and refused to replace the battery. I managed to obtain a replacement battery from an another battery supplier at addition cost to get the scanner operating..Appears that Doxie chooses to ignore consumer rights so please be aware if considering their products.
5,It does what it was made for
5,I love my doxie.  It is so easy to set up and use.  I have scanned over 5000+ pictures in one week.  I would definitely recommend  the doxie scanner.
2,We bought this to scan receipts and family photos. The receipts scanned well easily smoothly. But when we scanned photos there were digital vertical and horizontal lines on the photo. The color of the photos was dark the texture and lighting did not come through as it would in a flat bed scanner.  They looked as if the photos had been significantly compressed even with settings set to maximum quality after recalibrating machine and several other troubleshooting tips. This was not the quality we expected at 600dpi. We will be returning product.
5,I have been very happy with this purchase.  It does everything that I need it to do.
5,J'ai acheté cet appareil pour scanner des photos à la maison ou sur la route. Il est compact. J'ai eu un peu de confusion avec le WIFI car le manuel d'instructions est fait pour les 2 types d'appareil (avec et sans WIFI). Le mien ne le possède pas. C'est ce que je voulais.
5,This is my third portable scanner and by far my favourite.  The quality is great.  I love that it can be used wirelessly and the customer service is amazing!  I did a lot of research before purchasing this and it always comes up as the top scanner and I can see why. A+++
2,The scanner was very compact and portable two features I was looking at in this device. However the pictures scanned grainy because I was unable to determine what dpi adjustment was being used because it was all on one small button with no other indicators. Probably would be sufficient for scanning documents but not pictures which is the main reason I had ordered it to use. The software was very easy to install and very easy to follow. I returned it for the reason of wanting scan all my pictures.
5,I use the Doxie scanner at home (I am retired) for all my tax documents any papers I want to preserve online and any document I have to sign by hand and send to someone.  The scanner is easy to use and it produces good quality pictures.  Since it offers the option of scanning to its own card it doesn't depend on the operating system of any computer.  The files can be moved from the card to a computer using a USB cable and then converted to any format desired.  Having said that the scanner has seamlessly connected directly to my Mac running Catalina.  Also the small size and light weight of the scanner make it easier to store it and move it around when and where necessary.
5,Easy to set upQuick start instructionsWorks great !
5,Task: scanning over 6000 family snapshots going back over 80 yearsProblem: incredibly time consuming and complex using my flatbed scannerSolution: my Doxie ....simple setup straightforward software very fast scanning.Very impressed with the design and build quality; has a solid feel about it suggesting it'll last a long time.Customer service has been exemplary; not that I needed it but Doxie initiated contact to ensure I was satisfied with the scanner.Scanned over 2000 snapshots so far quality has been excellent.
