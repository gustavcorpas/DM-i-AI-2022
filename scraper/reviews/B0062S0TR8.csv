4,Pros: Does not interfere with the sounds of the environment and don't interfere with answering a phone that they aren't connected to. (Work phone) pairing was very easy.The battery life was average but it was my first use.Very surprised that the whole world couldn't hear what I was listening to.Cons.  While I prefer physical buttons to touch controls these little plastic buttons feel a little cheap.  I feel as though they will be the first thing to fail in the future especially if used often.The charging cable is proprietary and there is no alternative method to charge these so don't lose it.These come with a storage bag which is very large and very padded.  I would prefer a small hard case in it's place.Also these make you look really cool...or maybe a little of the opposite.I purchased these more out of curiosity but found them pleasantly surprising.  I really like them.
5,I've had these about a day so I can't speak to longevity but they work as advertised. Others can hear if they are turned up but really only beat not lyrics. They fit my very thin glasses and I've got a note for all the reviews saying they won't ESPECIALLY the video- THEY CAME WITH RUBBER SPACERS TO FIT THIN FRAMES. The spacers are one width on one side and a wider width on the other- one for thin one for thinner. My frames are pictured with the speakers and spacers installed. I have nearly flat frames these fit fine with the spacers. Read the instructions... The button functions are a bit hard to remember but that's not unique to these. My only real complaint is that if you only have one turned on you only have access to those functions- e.g. if you are only using the left you can't pause.
4,I was pretty happy with these at first but they died after only a few months. They had a few moments where they worked well but overall Im not thrilled with them. When they worked they didn't work well. They'd frequently have connection glitches where one would turn off randomly.Follow-up: I have to give Jlab credit their customer service is top notch. They replaced the defective pair and made the situation right
4,I like these. Once you get used to the fact they are not noise cancelling over the ear headphones. I had no issues talking to people and having the music play in the background. Could hear both easily and the people around me could barely tell they were on. I definitely think they were worth the 19.99 sale price.
5,These are amazing. I bought my first pair and it's incredibly nice to hear audio that is loud and clear while still hearing my environment around me. A nice alternative to regular earbuds or over/on ear headphones. Audio quality isnt the best but it still sounds pretty good you wont get much bass as these are just tiny speakers. These fit my thick plastic glasses fine they come with rubber sleeves for the clips for thinner frames. Pairing these are horrible i followed the instructions to reset the device and repair but one side keeps pairing  and the other is stuck in pairing mode. The trick i found was to pair them like instructed (hold down the button on both at the same time for 3+ sec) one of them will connect while the other is in pairing hold down the button on both at the same time to turn them off then turn them both back on. Both should connect at the same time. I was ready to send these back because the instructions were horrible but figured it out.
5,I have used quite a few of the smartglasses and various bluetooth headsets. These are my favorite for daily wear. Under normal circumstances the volume is sufficient. The ability to answer and end calls with a button is great while driving. Call quality is clear and the other person doesn't know I am on a headset. Not the strongest speaker for music but very sufficient. They are a bit bulky on certain frames and I had to notch my glasses for a good fit.  They are also really good at ripping hair out of your head when you move them (also why I notched my glasses). Overall these are the best option I have found for everyday use.
4,Keep in mind that these little speakers are exactly that. Do not expect AMAZING audiophile type sound because you will be dissatisfied. The sound is loud enough in a medium noise warehouse type environment. And they prevent me from having earbuds blocking my ability to hear things around me at work. Even ANC earbuds don’t work exactly right for me at work. And forget about using it for hands free calling where I work because they allow way too much background noise but in a quieter environment they are acceptable for calls.The bass is basically non existent even with the “bass boost” set but the sound is clear and adequate enough. For me these will not even be able to replace my Sony WF-C500s on a regular basis because the feel of the music just isn’t there. BUT they will be my hands down choice if I want my music but need my ability to hear things around me. Just be aware like several people stated you may need to use a rubber band or something to secure them to your eyeglass frames because the clips are not adjustable so they may slip or fall off completely. For the price they are pretty good little speakers. And for me they definitely fill a need. I do not regret this purchase.
5,Product is perfect for certain situations where you needs to hear your surroundings but want to have a podcast on. These are not loud as an in-ear piece but affective.Battery life is great! Product descriptions states 6 hours but I have 7-8 hour constantly.Rugged as they have fallen off my glasses at times and didn’t break or malfunction.
5,The battery life could last a little longer.  They don’t make it through my entire shift but close.  The sound is pretty decent to not be directly in or over the ear.  But for the money I paid for them I do give them a 5 star.
5,I don't enjoy using regular headphones or ear buds because it feels disorienting not to hear the sounds around me and I also don't like the way they feel on my ears. I picked these over the other audio frames because of the price since I wasn't sure if they would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked them. When I watched tv it sounded like I was listening to the audio from a regular speaker in the room instead of headphones. Phone call quality was fine and the control buttons were easy to figure out. I like how I can use them with the prescription glasses that I already own but I wish that they attached more securely. The clips just slide over the arms but don't attach. They've already fallen off a few times but it should be fine since I'm only planning to use them at home. I'm happy I finally found a type of headphones that work for me.
