4,I bought these to use in my old bluetooth Apple mouse. The alkaline AA batteries I had been using were not lasting very long so I thought I would get some rechargeable batteries and rotate them through as each pair got too low to use.When I looked at the rechargeable brands I picked the Amazon batteries because of the lower cost and the assumption that there would be enough to cycle through them recharging the used ones when I replaced them with fully charged ones and that has worked well for me. They don't last quite as long as the Duracell alkaline AA batteries I had been using but they do a good job and last long enough that I am not constantly changing batteries.I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend these batteries to others.
5,These rechargeable Li batteries are replacing all my throw-away ones in order to help the planet.  I've noticed they always come "uncharged" or dead--but they charge up nicely when I charge them for the first time.  Charging with my inexpensive charger takes about an hour or two but there may be faster ones out there.
5,I have previously tested the   AmazonBasics AA Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries         (in white wrappers) and concluded that they are just rebranded   Sanyo eneloop AA Batteries        . When I first heard about the new   AmazonBasics High-Capacity Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries         my immediate suspicion is that those are rebranded   Sanyo eneloop XX batteries        . That's why I purchased this product for testing just to satisfy my own curiosity.I measured a set of those AmazonBasics 'high-capacity' AA batteries using my   La Crosse BC1000 Battery Charger/Analyzer        . Here are my findings:- Right out of the box the average remaining charge was 1204mAh or 48% of the rated 2500mAh capacity. Date code on them says '2014-02' but just like other eneloop batteries they were not fully charged when then left factory.- After just one recharge/discharge cycle the average capacity jumped to 2547mAh.- After another two more recharge/discharge cycles the average capacity settled at 2555mAh. The spread is very tight between 2510 and 2610mAh which indicates good quality control.The above behavior is nearly identical to that of the Sanyo XX cell which I have previously tested in 2011.Mechanically the AmazonBasics high-capacity cells appear identical to the Sanyo XX. Refer to the photo I uploaded to the 'Customer Images' section and you will see that they have exactly the same shape for positive terminals same texture on their wrappers even down to the same 'vent hole' design.I should note that the   Duracell 'Ion Core' AA Rechargeable Batteries         also have identical electrical and mechanical characteristic as the Sanyo XX and AmazonBasics High-Capacity batteries. The Duracell batteries are marketed as just 2400mAh even though they were tested to be over 2500mAh in capacity. I believe this is done for price differentiation purpose.Bottom Line:As of this writing you can get an 8-pack of Amazon High-Capacity AA batteries for less cost than a 4-pack of   eneloop XX         batteries. So obviously the AmazonBasics version is a great bargain. My advice is to grab them - before Amazon gets greedy and jacks up the price.One important note:The AmazonBasic High-Capacity AA (or Sanyo XX or Duracell Ion Core) is fatter than a normal-capacity NiMH AA cell which itself is fatter than a typical alkaline AA cell. So it may not fit if your appliance has extremely tight battery compartment.[Update on Dec 10 2014]Long-term self-discharge data: Tested one pair of AmazonBasics AA high-capacity batteries after 5 months in storage. The average remaining charge is 2175mAh or 85% of the original capacity. This is even better than my previous 5-month test result for Sanyo XX batteries which showed 2040mAh or 78% of original capacity.
5,I use these batteries in the Base Station for my SimpliSafe security system.  If the house power goes off these batteries continue to power the Base Station and maintain the functions of my security system.So to say that these batteries are important is a bit of an understatement.How long do they last?  For this application I can expect the base station to continue working after the house power is off for at least 48 hours.All rechargeable batteries have a life expectancy.  And since this particular application is so important to me I change the batteries in my base station every 4 years.
5,I have had these batteries for almost 2 years. They are rock solid. I use them everywhere in the house including an Xbox controller - which these keep going for hours - and then they recharge like new! I bought a 24 pack and just cycle them through the house. I use a “battery daddy” (have various rechargeable batteries to manage - ps compared to a lot of other brands I have used - these are the best)  for storage. Simply buy a few extra batteries and keep them in the battery storage (charged) ready for next use. You’ll save money and do your part! I recommend both the AA AAA. Buy the performance ones if you can.
4,I'm still testing them out but there has been a few that seemed to drain a bit faster than expected.
4,Works just as good as an rechargeable out there.  Only thing it loses power suddenly and a lot sooner than an alkaline like any other recharbeable.  Still a good value.
5,Comparable to 2400 mAh Duracell rechargeables.  Can't tell a difference actually.  Waaay better than a set of 1400 mAh Energizer rechargeables from walmart I bought without reading the label.  These seem to be as good as any other rechargeables on the market today.  I'm happy and I recommend them.  If you run your rechargeables like I do remember to let them cool off before you throw them in the charger.  Works fine with Energizer and Duracell charger.
4,I forgot extra rechargeable batteries on a trip so ordered these sent to my hotel. They arrived in two days and were almost fully charged. They worked fine in my Olympus camera. However when I tried them in my trail cam they would not work. I assume they are 1.2v where the trail cam is looking for 1.5v batteries. My EverReady rechargeables work fine in the trail cam.
5,For $1 each these are a no brainer. They claim 2400 mah but that’s probably at 100 ma current draw. I tested at 500 ma and they came in above 2300.These are Amazon Basic brand not Enerloop or other brand.  They’re manufactured in Malaysia if that matters to anyone; it doesn’t to me. I only care that they are reasonably close to the stated capacity- and they are.They say they are pre charged I found that most needed charging. I classify every battery I buy so pre charging is irrelevant to me.I’m pleased with the quality and price point of these batteries. I can find no reason to deny them a five star rating.
5,Used these batteries to replace my solar flood light batteries. Installed the batteries in the morning let the solar panels trickle charge them throughout the day and at night full brightness from my flood lights. Perfect awesome buy.
5,They are great quality I highly recommend them
5,I have been using a lot of rechargeable batteries for the last 12 years this one are powerful and cheap.
5,They seem to hold a charge better than energizer rechargeable
5,Husband uses them for hunting and equipment
4,I purchased a set of these batteries a couple of years ago based on a YouTube rechargeable battery comparison and showdown. They are still to this day incredible batteries that we use for VR controllers. A heavy drain situation. So I bought a new set to work in tandem and replace the aging original set but with a singular concern. Although the new batteries are the same in power rating and are performing good so far they are made in China now and not Japan. The reason I bought these again is because of the solid performance and manufacturing by a Japanese company. Had I known of the switch I might've went with a different brand. That said so far the new set has been fine but time will tell and we'll see if this lateral move is good or a cost saving bust.
5,This batteries last me a long time  I use them for flashlights. I also have them on an electric fly seater and the have not need to be replaced yet
5,We have used these before and feel like they are a good price and work well.
4,Used yhem for outside solar lights & they held their charge longer than expected
4,Work just as good as name brand I’ve had them several years now
