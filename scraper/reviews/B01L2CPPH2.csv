4,el cable de dobla mucho cuando esta colocado en el adacptador
5,i need to merge audio from a radio scanner radio (using its headphone output) with video on my hero 9. it's pricey but there aren't many alternatives i'd wanna trust.noteables:- when it's connected the go pro shows that power is passing through the adapter and is charging to battery. sweet! but once you press record the charging symbology goes away. i paniced thinking it's no longer using the external power--i was doing 8hr continuous recording sessions. turns out that the go pro is actually still using external power. battery was still @ 100% at the end of the day.- i found that the only reliable way to have the external audio recognized as present in is to start with the audio plug not connected to the *adapter*. i press record on the go pro and only then do i plug the audio cable into the adapter. if you start recording with the external source already plugged into the adapter there's a good chance you'll just record from the built-in mic.
5,Not compatible with GoPro hero 2014/2018 modelsCheck your compatibility list for GoPro before purchasing.Not an issue with seller or product
5,So I've had this Mic adapter for a few months now and it works fine and all.First I wish it wasn't 50 bucks. I mean that's not terrible but it feels like an after-market kick in the shin to me.As I'm editing a video I now see that this mic adapter was slightly unplugged from the gopro and i've lost all of my audio. Now that's my fault I guess. Still terrible. Although I do find the plug in to be kind of loose. I'm talking a few thou off of a smooth satisfying fit. The connection wobbles and it just doesn't feel good. There is no other option to convert audio without this device. Relating back to the 50 dollar kick in the shin.Go Pro. Guys if you're listening I don't care if you have to make the next go pro twice as large I would still buy it if I could just plug in a microphone without having to buy this adapter. I really hope the age of making devices smaller and smaller is over.  I don't care if its the size of a Gameboy color. I buy your cameras because they take more of a beating than my DSLR. That and I really like your passion for 60fps.. I think you are lacking in universal simplicity when it comes to this part. I reluctantly bought this. I didn't jump to buy this.I gave you guys 5 stars because I still needed this thing. It works fine but I'm not very trustworthy of its craftsmanship when considering reliability and longevity.  Of course I bought the case to hold this from dangling. Which makes me think I would have paid you for a whole package anyway. Why isn't this adapter just a case in itself? Like something I can slap my go pro into and a mic port is all I have to worry about.It's just an idea Go Pro. I'd rather you be built like an old gameboy or a nokia in some ways. I still love you but you don't need to be so tiny. Throw a mic port in there. I don't care if you get a little fat.  I still gave you a good rating.
5,Using this adapter with a Purple Panda mic setup. Got tired of wind noise when making moto and auto videos so bought a mic and reluctantly had to buy this too because GoPro dropped built-in 3.5mm.
5,I bought this via Amazon and had trouble getting it to work consistently so I called GoPro's customer service who did some troubleshooting determined I had a defective unit and promptly shipped me a new one that works perfectly.  I can forgive the occasional "lemon" product (it's going to happen sometimes) when the manufacturer is so quick to replace it without any hassle.  As for the product itself it has a form factor that's impractical for most GoPro users especially ones like me who are mounting their camera/mic setup to a motorcycle helmet but it will do the job just not as easily as could have been the case.  However it's also the only option if you want to connect a mic to your GoPro 7.
5,Used with Drift 3.5mm mic. Didn't change any settings and it just worked.
5,Great add on for those that want to use an external mic and would rather not purchase the mod for your hero 9 or 10. Just remember to update your Hero 9 to the latest firmware so the camera will detect the mic adapter!Only con would be the price.
4,The only issue I keep noticing is that all of the 3.5mm jacks I plug into this adapter feel very loose. Makes me think that it's the female 3.5mm TRS on the adapter that's simply not tight enough.I would be concerned that my mic would wiggle or shake loose while riding on the motorcycle.Otherwise it works fine on my GoPro Hero 9. I didn't have to do any firmware updates or anything like that. Plug n play.
5,I used it on my GoPro 5 black to connect to an external mic. It worked very very well and is superior to the built-in mic. The adapter is a bit stiff and short so it sometimes get in the way. Other than that it works well. With the 5 I can't charge it while recording which is annoying but stopping the recording lets me charge it without unplugging the adapter.
4,Updated no audio issues fixedAugust 2021This GoPro adapter only works with mics with 2 RINGS on the tip not 3 rings on the tip should be on the packaging and the descriptionIf you are using a mic with 3 rings on the tip like a purple panda mic you will need this extra adapter or you won't get any audio from your mic this is GoPro.s fault not the mic.s fault.2 ring tip mic.s work fine 4 microphones 2 adapters and a camera replacement later I can moto vlog now....AGD TRRS to TRS Male to Female 4pin 3pin / 3 to 2 Rings Adapter for Small Mini Lavalier Lapel Omnidirectional Condenser Microphonehttps://amzn.to/3jYO4gROriginal reviewJuly 2021So remove this and you have audio....  Plug this in and no audio....On my second one and still no audio...On my second mic and still no audio...On my second GoPro Hero 8 Black and still no audio...Now I cant return the camera or the mic or this adapter because its been past 30 days waiting for the gopro replacement to arrive....These adapters are faulty....  I should've just kept my new camera now I have some refurbished cameras. Maybe I should've just ordered a refurbished to save money on.
5,It only gets 5 stars because it works great. Go pro gets 1 start for requiring it.
5,I'm thankful i got this mic adapter for my hero 7. I was super tired of carrying around a big DSLR camera for short and quick vlogs but also worrying about if my DSLR would be safe from any water or even worse drops... I highly dislike the internal mic of the go pro's so improvised and bought a cold shoe for my go pro also with a mic. It works super great and its quick to just throw in my bag and not carry to much things on my travels. The only thing i'm kinda worried about for not myself but for others is the sound quality and durability of the cord. In one of my videos i recorded i long video which was my first time using the go pro mic adapter. The sound was kinda making a high pitch static noise which was odd to me but i'm not sure if it was the adapter or the cord was to stiff to bend to connect it into the go pro which made it not connect all the way in. The price of this adapter also seemed a little bit more pricey than i expected for a small mic adapter box plus i had to improvise to find a way to keep it secured from hitting my go pro while i'm vlogging. The new Go pro hero 8 also came out and i'm worried when i get it I won't be able to use it. But other than that i still have this product and it works well with no issues at all! Highly Recommend!!!
4,I was about ready to absolutely trash this device in a review and then return it. After spending forty bucks I was really disappointed. It didn't work at all. But then I thought I'd be fair and try a different approach.If you plug this GoPro Pro 3.5mm Mic Adapter into the camera along with say a lapel mic and then turn on the camera to start recording it won't work. Not at all. It's not that it will record poppy scratchy bad or poor quality sound. It won't record sound at ALL.However if you power up the camera then plug the adapter and mic in it WILL record high-quality sound (assuming that you've got say a high-quality lapel mic). Garbage in = garbage out (so invest in a good mic). But don't blame the adapter. I tested this device not only with the new GoPro HERO (2018) but also the GoPro HERO5 Session. It worked with both cameras. However it would appear that the cameras need to recognize the adapter and then the insertion of a 3.5mm mic or other input before it will allow recording with an external device.I do have one complaint though and that's the reason for the 4/5 star rating. This thing is overpriced. You know it I know it and GoPro knows it. They could have built a mic jack into the camera or sell this adapter for five bucks. They are gouging us but they know they can because no one else makes a reliable and working GoPro mic adapter.Still I'm keeping mine. The internal GoPro mics are horrible and this gives me crystal-clear audio using a lapel mic.Cheers.
4,I bought it for my hero6 black and it’s perfect along with the Ulanzi housing that I got for the hero6 as well. I have a Saramonic 3.5 inch mic that does not work with it. I thought the adapter was faulty and ordered a replacement. While I was waiting on the replacement it dawned on me going back through GoPro mic settings via the GoPro app (now Quik app) that it may be my mic. The Saramonic mic works just fine with my iPhone but not the GoPro so I went to Walmart and bought a $14 battery powered shotgun  mic with same 3.5in connection and it worked perfectly. So I kept the original and replacement adapter. Always good to have a spare.
4,it works. as it should. could be a bit cheaper though
5,Good tidings person reading thisLet me tell you the story of my purchasing experience. So nowhere does it say this thing can't work with a Hero 7 White right? At least nowhere I was looking at least anyways. I get this big ol bad $50 hunk of plastic and plug that bad boy into my 7 White right? Doesn't work. Well shucks what am I to do now?I didn't want to return in I bought a purple panda mic and a case to hold the adapter and the camera all in one so I couldn't do that.Did I wait until 7 Blacks dropped in price? NopeI had to go bargin hunting for a GoPro. Well I found one. It was a Hero 5 Black and it did everything I wanted it to. I drove 2 hours to a sketchy neighborhood bought it off a guy who spoke not a lick of english had to figure out how to understand Dutch real quick and switch the settings back drove another 2 hours home just to find out that this adapter did EXACTLY what was promised and allowed me to use an external mic.TL;DR it works yo
5,I have two Media Mods for my Hero 9 cameras. Worked great with or without external mics but it was a headache to swap batteries when they died. I got the SmallRig cage and the mic adapter and I have no regrets. Great sound and quick easy battery swapping.
5,Si no tienes el media mod este es tu accesorio sirve para prácticamente todas las gopro con puerto usb C se le adapta cualquier micrófono y el audio mejora mucho; vale la pena pronto subiré un video en mi canal configurándolo con la gopro 10
5,It’s a high cost for the adapter which I’m not thrilled about but it has worked really well with my Rode VideoMicro on my GoProHero 8. Overall I’m happy with the purchase.
3,It still bothers me greatly that this costs so much and you have no reliable alternative if you want to use an external mic. Especially since it’s a USB-C connection. There’s absolutely no reason for them to not make GoPros capable of using any external USB-C mic other than greed. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it works. It lost one star for the price and another because of the size and weight.
5,This adapter is very useful but a little bit expensive I’m very happy about this purchase and I will suggest you to do it because is very well done 👍
4,The mic adapter is a must have for improved audio.While the onboard mic's work the sound is somewhat muffled. With the adapter I am able to setup the shot and record the audio closer to the source. It also helps eliminate the sounds created by handling the camera.
5,Good stuff
2,I used the GoPro Mic Adapter with a new Hero7 camera.All in all I was very disappointed and felt I got gouged$50 for this $5 adapter is asking a lot or think of it as 25% of the cost of a Hero7 ............ but if your the only game in town what can you do?Not only do you need the adapter to use an external mic you also have the additional cost burden of new housing to hold the adapter with the camera.How did it work?  I'd have to say intermittently.Sometimes it would not switch to the external mic and use the camera mic even though all the connectors were solidly attached.  This is very concerning if shooting a video and not know for sure if the mic is in play.The camera on-screen menu does report a mic is plugged in but one is never 100% sure it's actually the source of the sound.Also the short cord from the adapter to the camera is thick and no very flexible.  The cable is at such a bend that it tries to push the adapter out of the housing (that additional piece of kit needed I mentioned above).The sound quality was fine when it did work.I'm going to assume here that the cameras missed connection to the external mic was a problem on my end and assume for most people it would consistently work hence I'm going to give the adapter 2 stars due to the exorbinant  price and awkward installation..
5,Works great if you set it up properly. The adapter is bulky - no doubt about that!  It fits well and it works well. No sound issues and the mic I use (Rode) sounds amazing with my Hero 6.  There are a LOT of other reviews on here that say you can use some cheap headphone adapter that works with Moto z or other devices - WRONG!  DO NOT listen to those reviews I made that mistake and just got my refund after wasting my time ordering all kinds of products that do NOT work.  It sucks because this is way over priced and it's bulky but it works and there are no sound or connection issues.  Sometimes the seller changes the product without updating the listing so they can keep the reviews but if that was the case I think this seller would have been better off listing this as a new product.  A lot of people mentioned using this with their session  or hero 4... I don't even think that's possible because this adapter is USB C.While I hate the size and price I had to write a review that clearly explains who this is for and what to expect.  That is the reason I gave it 5 stars - because no one else did. Ignore the other reviews because they are very misleading.
3,Gopro really knocked it out of the park with this one. Hobbling their cameras so you have to purchase extra accessories to use basic common devices like a microphone with their device.And it's not even that good.People note that the audio can cut out.They make no OEM mounting solution for this dongle--so it just flops around in the wind.And they could've added a second headphone jack for audio-monitering--and oh I don't know--and rheostat control or something for the volume levels?For $50 I'd expect something other than a glorified Y-splitter.This is some real bs.And don't even get me started on their "Media mod" for the GH8--which they've ditched again for the 9.They think we're just going to buy all new accessories every time they fart out a new model--while the new model's the same as the old model--I'll pass.BlackMagic will destroy them if their price ever comes down.All GoPro really has these days is the name.
4,Work as described
5,I've ordered 2 different microphones and use different adapters and it will not work the moment I plug it in to the go pro the go pro does not record sound its a hero 7 black
3,But you do if you’re planning to record any type of audio with your GoPro. Why GoPro went this route is beyond me and if it was a good solution I’d probably be on board. However I’ve personally had 1 go bad on me and a friend who’s also had the same issue. So all told with the replacements I’ve seen 33% failure rate on these.Then add the fact that without aftermarket parts you can’t run these without your battery door open on the new models and you have an absolute FAILURE from a design perspective. Maybe GoPro will go back to good design on the 10…
5,Love it! I've read a lot of negative reviews about the size the way it plugs in etc. While it's apparently not ideal for action shots with a lot of movement it does exactly what I need it to - bass play-through videos at my home studio or with a headphone practice amp.  I use it as a line-in to mix audio in real time with the video. It saves me a lot of editing time and it sounds terrific - no need to worry about the mix in post production. I'm mostly doing static shots so I have no complaints about how bulky it is. I can fit all the gear I need in a small case.I have nothing but good things to say about it but i would not recommend it either for videos with a lot of movement since it has a 1/8" input or for anything near water (you have to open or remove the charging cover to use the adapter)If you can find the smaller version without the USB-C charging extension port it would be a much better option for a wireless lav mic or whatever floats your boat. Just don't float it in your boat. The inside is not water resistant.
5,Es un accesorio costoso pero vale la pena para los que queremos hacer Vloging mejora mucho el sonido de los videos compatible con mi camara Gopro Hero 9 Black.
5,The wire is kind of thick and stiff and doesn't hold it's shape well. I'm afraid that the constant pressure from the wire will damage the port on my camera where it plugs in. Otherwise it works great and doesn't seem to distort sound.
3,This does NOT include a mic so that's another purchase! A couple annoying things about this - standard USB C connection but you *must* use this adapter and no other option to connect a mic AND at least on the Hero 4 Black you can NOT start a quick capture because the mic will not work. You have to turn the GoPro on then begin the capture for the mic to work. Is it a value? Not for $50. Sadly it is a necessity. Sound quality should not be a rating as your mic will come into play as well but thankfully my videos sound a lot better now!
5,This is a definite must have when you want to use an external microphone with you smartphone vlogging setup or with your gopro.
5,I bought the hard plastic direct mount one and it didn't work it shuts off the mic totally. This one works great once you change the setting in the GoPro. Pretty good quality has been holding up well. I'd buy it again
2,To be fair I didn’t buy this to use in the traditional sense of plugging in a a better external mic for better audio.  For my application I needed a way to sync the video to my externally recorded audio and the only way to do that was via a 3.5 input.  So I needed to purchase this GoPro  proprietary part.  Since this is the only way to add 3.5 on the new GoPros the company kinda has you be the...  Hence they can crank out whatever they want from some sweat shop in a 3rd World country (unverified) and it’s your only option.  On the first unit I received the actual 3.5 port was total garbage.  With just the slightest movement the cable would fall right out.  Amazon was very quick to send a replacement but even though the new unit was better it wasn’t by much.  Since I’ll mainly be using this adapter only in a controlled environment the lack of a secure fit for the 3.5 jack shouldn’t be much of an issue.  However if most of the units (2/2 here) are contracted like the ones I received I’d never considered using it say for biking and surely not for any type of extreme sport.  Nothing would riun the take like crappy on camera audio because the jack fell out in the first 5min.  I’ve read some reviews on this and don’t believe I’ve seen others mention it which is odd.  Now having said all this if you don’t mind putting a bunch of tape on your brand new overpriced audio input then I’m sure you’ll be happy with this.  Sorry I can’t comment on the audio quality as that’s not how I’m using it.  On a side note there are YouTube videos and reviews griping anikt the size of this thing.  It’s not a monster but it’s about 63.7% the size of the camera.  Not the most compact thing.  It is rubberized however and other than the shoddy jack it seems fairly well constructed.
5,Yes worth it.
4,This cable is exactly what YOU HAVE to have to run an AUX mic on a GoPro. Simply put nothing else works that I know of and I have seen other try different cables to no avail. THey end up spending more than this for nothing.I would give this cable 5 stars except for the price and the fact there are no real hacks for other cables.Now that I have that out of the way the cable has no issues and the sound transfer is as good as I will get using my field recorder. The Hero7 talks about all of the upgrades in-stability and other items but does not spend enough time talking about the excellent audio. I shot in RAW audion and this cable moves every bit and byte of sound to the cards with no clips or glips or gobbly's.
5,I see some low-rated reviews. Many users have different cameras and configurations. I use this mic adapter with my GoPro Hero 7 Black along with a Rode Microphone and it works wonderfully. The sound quality is superior.Here are my settings: Once the Rode Mic is plugged into the adapter go within the GoPro settings and set the “Audio Input” to “Standard Mic.”(You could also set to “Standard Mic +” and you will get a boost in gain but also a boost in noise which you could eliminate in post. The “Standard Mic” setting works fine.)
4,This product works as advertised but it too expensive for what it offers. However I don't think you have a choice on the price.
4,It works with the mic (mine is Movo vxr10 pro). A bit expensive but because the internal mic of gopro hero 6 sucks so i kinda need this adapter to plug in external mic. If you need to vlog with the adapter you might need a gopro case which can also hold the adapter otherwise you might need to take it on the hand all the time. overall no complaint at all.
3,First one I got stopped working within a month so I exchanged it.  Second one I got stopped working yesterday.But because I'm a derp I thought it was something else going on outside of my control.I had previously made a review post putting this down pretty harshly but I'm changing that because I realized it was user error and feel like a derp.Apparently QuickCapture can interfere with it.  So if you suddenly find you're not picking up audio turn QuickCapture off.  It resolved my issue immediately.It works as intended.  But honestly it's still pretty dang expensive for what it does so I'm still not keen on paying almost 50.00 for an adapter.  That's an absolute ripoff.  But it works. Hopefully long term.
3,For 50 bucks I expected it to last longer. No sound at all on two days worth of videos! Silence static some clicking. I tried it with 2 different mics and on two different GoPro Black 9s. (with updated firmware) so it has to be the adapter.
5,This worked perfect you need this for good audio on anything GoPro I just wish it wasn’t this pricey GoPro had a lock on this no way around it. But do admit with a good mic this makes GoPro perfect review/vlog setup
4,It works. It's too expensive for what it is. But at least they give you an option for external audio. I wouldn't recommend buying a gopro at this moment they seem to be having some serious issues within their company and keep making really stupid decisions that only hurt their customers.
4,It works but I hate that we have to buy this! I use mine for motorcycle blogging. The one issue that I have with it is that it is kind of bulky hanging off to the side so you have to figure out someway to mount it. I end up using a large rubber band and attach it to the back of the GoPro waterproof case that I use. The sound quality is really good and there doesn’t seem to be any lag at all between the audio going in in the picture
5,You need this adapter to run an external mic on your GoPro Hero 5/6/7/8READ THIS***** Once plugged in make sure to go into your GoPro settings and select what kind of mic setup you are running. Also make sure your mic set up comes with the right jack at the end or it will not pick up any audio.This should be a bit cheaper but hey
4,This product is best described as a necessary evil. It’s needed to be able use any external microphone on the go pro products including the hero 8. I didn’t want to spend 80$ on the media mod so I decided to get this instead.For $50 it’s ridiculous price gouging but that’s what you expect from Go Pro sadly. Wish there was a better alternative but they are the kings for now.
5,I have it mounted on my helmet for motor vlogging. Installed it with a frame that places it right under the camera. Gives such a nice and clean setup.Connect a Purple Panda microphone and you have one of the best setups you can get.
2,I use this with a GoPro Hero 5 session with mixed feelings...PRO:1. This allows you to add an off-camera mic which greatly improves the sound quality in your videos.2. The adapter and cable (pigtail) are strong and very durable.3. Allows you to charge the camera while using an off-camera-micCON:1. It's actually bigger than the Hero 5 Session - seems ridiculous to add this much bulk just to plug in a mic.2. The USB-C cable is EXTRA thick and does not easily bend.  It's too short to attach to the tripod and too thick to bend around and velcro to the back or bottom of the Hero Session.  It can only dangle off the side and honestly looks pretty stupid.3. The GoPro is designed to be water proof which directly impacts the sound quality.  An off-camera mic solution really should have been built part of that design. The fact they missed this in the Hero 5 and still did not address it in the Hero 6 is absurd.4. When using an off camera mic the GoPro is no longer waterproof.Bottom line:GoPro was designed for sports and other intense environmental use.  Sacrificing sound quality was necessary to keep the camera small and waterproof.  The built-in mic is really UNusable for anything you would post online. While this adapter greatly improves sound quality it does so at the cost of loosing what the camera was was designed to do.1.  If your record extreme video - adding this adapter will make your camera less adaptable to the elements and less versatile.2.  If you do NOT record extreme video and want to start a vlog with better sound... sell your GoPro and buy a camera that does not need a $50 adapter.
4,This thing works and it works well. however i do not feel like it is worth $50. this should be a $20-$25 item.something i was unaware of that may be useful: you need to power this for it to register for your camera. At least thats what it took for me.Plug power into the adapter then plug the adapter into your gopro. As new updates for the cameas become available that may change.something else to be aware of: this cord is short. i measured it at 3.75 inches including the 90 degree plug. you will most likely need a usb type c extension. i managed to get it positioned where i do not need one but my situation is limited.overall this works just wait for the price to drop if you have the option of waiting.
3,Like many other GoPro Hero 6 users I wasn't too happy about the price and size of this dongle just to add external audio to the camera but bought it to make use of my Rode Video Micro for a vlogging rig. I was able to secure it to my camera by zip tying it to a cheese plate with a threaded grip mounted to an aluminum housing a complicated but effective and solid solution.Pros:-Huge improvement in audio quality - (Be sure to enable Standard Mic + for best results with the Rode)Cons:-USB C on dongle does not pass charging to the GoPro can't charge while in use and the male USB-C on the dongle is quickly becoming loose from constantly unplugging it to charge the camera-Cost $50 is a lot for a dongle-Size You have to be creative to add this to your rig-Short cable limits mounting options and puts strain on the USB-C connection on the camera-Camera is not waterproof with the dongle connectedUpdate: Just came home from a vacation to find a 1-hour video totally silent it seems the USB-C connector is now working intermittently. Check your audio can't re-shoot a vaction pretty bummed.
5,I have a GoPro HERO 5 unit.  The built microphone is far from exceptional.  This is a necessary accessory if you are going to use an aftermarket external mic.  This unit came as promised works flawlessly and offers much improved audio from my GoPro HERO 5 unit.  I have a Rode mic and a Saramonic mic that I use with the adapter.  Both offer very good audio.
3,Returned and got max mod cover.
4,I have to wiggle it just right to get it to work. Once it’s working it’s fine. Just seems a bit ridiculous it requires so much wiggling to make it work. I mean it is a GoPro product for a GoPro camera. Oh well what can you do? It’s a must have...
3,First of all yes it works. Do I think it's $50 worth of "yes it works" no I don't because you still have to buy a microphone with it and in my case my mic is cheaper than the adapter. The mic is great and sounds great but it's not the adapter doing the work. I wish these were $20 and under because all they are is an adapter. Yes I wouldn't get the audio I crave from my GoPro if I didn't use it but the price is a little much almost to the point where it's hard justifying buying one.
5,IF YOU'RE USING AN AUX JACK ON THIS ADAPTER FOR GOPRO HERO 5: Make sure to use a double ringed aux jack NOT a triple ringed jack! The stereo audio won't align properly in the adapter and you'll record hours without audio. (You're welcome I just saved you hours of research).First pic: doubled ring jack second picture: triple ringed jack.
3,As is the general sentiment it's annoying to need to buy a $48 add-on to make a $400 camera work with your standard external mic - and even then it doesn't accept TRRS inputs from microphones like RODE so you need another adapter on top of this one to convert TRRS to TRS.However I was pleased to learn that it accepts a USB-C connection so you can charge the GoPro with this adapter connected. That solves a problem I anticipated wherein I want to have many GoPros mounted to my motorcycle but was worried about needing to stop every hour (or less) to swap batteries - since I already planned on using external mics with windshields on those GoPros now I can also mount external chargers to the bike so that I'll never need to stop to swap out the batteries on those cameras.Still this is an annoying necessity by design and GoPro knows this and knows that we'll buy it anyway as GoPro seeks any way possible to generate profit to recover its abysmal stock - which is fine from a business perspective but as a consumer this only gets three stars from me.
5,As someone who wants to record as much as possible as well as someone who likes to:-Motorcycle Camp-Camp-Backpack-Hike-Mountain Bike-Trail Run...various other outdoor activities where I need to carry my gear...I had to make a decision on what gear I wanted to carry. The GoPro being waterproof was very compelling but didnt have great audio. The other options were a cell phone or a large camera with an external MIC. While backpacking the last thing you want to do is shuck more gear so the GoPro was the easy choice. I carry a GoPro a GoRad Selfie stick (go see my review on that) a Rode Video Micro MIC and this adapter for when I need audio and this setup has worked very well. Search my name on Youtube to see my vlogs where I have used a slew of technology.
5,Albeit a bit cumbersome and clunky it is a must have for any decent audio out of the gopro line. why they cant add a proper mic in on the side of the camera in the first place I simply will never understand but this little device is prob another way to make a buck since they have to sell it separately. But alas it is the only option for us that need real audio.
4,This product does what it claim. I have it connected to my digital piano and the audio is clean. The camera can be connected to a power supply via the adaptor whilst simultaneously being used as a line-in source for my recordings which is convenient.My gripes with it (similar to what other reviewers have stated):1) The form factor is pretty bulky. I have the camera sitting on a tripod and it doesn’t move around much while I am using the adaptor. But I can see that it would be rather inconvenient to use this in other situations.2) This adaptor is overpriced for what it does! Unfortunately one is stuck with this being the only option.
5,Does its job but costs a bit. An make sure you have a mounting place for it. The cord is not so flexible so the ULANZI cage works well for a GoPro with this adaptor fitted. It is a little large too I am sure something like this can fit into a far more compact form factor of less than 1/3 the size (and price). If other companies could make this smaller and cheaper we may actually get a product that is really great. In terms of its function it works perfectly everything else about it is crap.
5,Bought this to use with my hero 5 black and a lav mic on my motorcycle helmet. Camera is mounted centered and low just in front of my helmets chin used industrial strength Velcro to attach the adapter just to the side of the camera on the jaw of helmet. Small size very light weight works like a charm and using good Velcro allows me to easily swap it over to my Tripod when I have the camera set up for non helmet uses.Idk why go pro would need to make us all buy this $50 brick on their newer models but they do and the onboard mic is junk. Do not buy off brand usb c - 3.5mm stereo adapters as a go around it’s a waste of time just suck it up and buy this
4,I like that it gives an option to add external mic. I don't like that it add bulk and you need a case to accommodate it.
4,What needs to be said that hasn't already been said about this necessary evil?  Since it is the only way of connecting an external mic to a Hero5/6 you are at GoPro's mercy.  Yes it works.  Yes the cost is steep.  Yes the adapted is ridiculously large.Fortunately it is black and matches the majority of accessories and hey at least you can run an external mic and a power source through the same unit!  :-)  So should it get 5 Stars for working exactly as you would hope yes.  But for all the things I said above should it be worthy of "I love it"?  Definitely not.
5,The 3.5mm input is a TRS type. It will not work with TRRS fittings. If your microphone or cables are of a TRRS variety you will likely need to get a TRRS to TRS adapter. It would be helpful for the seller and/or manufacturer to make this information and solutions to frequent problems known.
5,I bought this for my GoPro 5 so I can hear audio better with the Purple Panda mic works very well use it for my motorcycle helmet to make videos
5,Go pro locked this device down. Hard to use (if at all) to use a different source for external mic.Works great.When buying this you should look into the Ulanzi go pro case as well. Comes in handy when you have this block connected to your gopro.
3,In terms if adding a mic input the adapter works well enough without adding noise but without an output so we can monitor the audio as well it’s all but useless. For the cost it should really have both an in and an out otherwise it’s just a cheap USBC adapter that GoPro hopes to make a money grab with since you can’t use an external mic without it. You’ll need it if you want to use a lav or capsule mic but you won’t be happy about how limited it is not the price.As a comparison the Rode iPhone Mac adapter has two mic inputs and a headphone output  sure it’s more expensive but it’s every bit as clean and has way more features for about $20 more. Why GoPro can’t do more with theirs is beyond me.
1,I am giving this adapter one star not because it doesn't work but because it shouldn't be needed in the first place. An external microphone connector should have been built into the camera. If there is a legitimate reason it could not be built in then this adapter should have been included for free with the camera. Preferably a smaller adapter with a means to attach it to the camera to keep it from flopping around.PROS:- I have tested my adapter and it works.CONS:- It costs $50. It should be free.- It is large and awkward with no built in way to attach it to anything.- There is no way to secure the USB connector to the camera therefore it is prone to becoming disconnected and falling out.- The side door on the camera has to be left open thereby removing any safeguards against water damage.I resisted buying this adapter for months but I finally reached a point where I really needed to connect an external mic. GoPro makes one of the best action cameras out there so why did they make this clumsy adapter requiring people to make DIY mounts to keep it secure? This is a horrible solution but as far as I can tell it's the only solution available.Come on GoPro! At the very least you can reduce the cost to a reasonable amount or better yet give it away for free since it should have been built into the camera to begin with. If you are going to inflict this thing on us at least make a way to securely attach it.
4,Great accessory. Just wish the cable was more flexible.
5,This is a must have if you plan to use your gopro as audio is more important than video quality in my opinion.  Works as intended but my only complaint is its a $50 adapter and I think GoPro should have made a audio jack standard.  Very APPLE like in charging extras for 'standard' features.
4,This is 100% necessary if you want your gopro audio to not be total garbage. Unfortunately it compromises the waterproof status of the GoPro and yes costs $50. It'd be so much better to have a 3.5" waterproof jack on the side of the gopro the way some phones do but then they wouldn't make $50. I wouldn't expect it to maintain good audio while the jack is submerged/wet just keep the parts from getting destroyed.Taking a star away for this design issue + cash grab.
3,...you gotta pay cuz it's the only way to go.This adapter certainly does the job. Is a bit bulky for what it is IMO. And definitely overpriced for an adapter.  Gopro has you locked in for this one though. Don't get me wrong Gopro accessories seem to be a good "step above" generic options as far as quality goes (kudos to them for that) but their pricing margins are typically a "giant leap" above generic options.
4,Works perfectly with the Hero 6 rig I have built up and I’m absolutely pleased with the purchase. Everyone complains about having to purchase this piece the upgrade audio and I admit it’s a little pricey for what it is but it works and GoPro accessories are always high quality. It allows for several different mic settings and mic types (powered or unpowered) I use a Rode Videomicro and it sounds just as good as when hooked into my mirror less camera. It’s defintitley a must for better audio and it’s a GoPro accessory so don’t worry about the quality.
4,Only complaint is that I think it does leech battery life a small amount. Haven't proven scientifically but lose about 25% record time while using. However it can be used to external power the cam so might be moot.
4,This allows the use of audio mics and accessories to be used with the GoPro Hero cameras. There in not much to it and the price is ridiculous for what i is which is basically a rip off. It also is a heavy kludge hanging off the side of the camera when it is used. Poor design and greedy GoPro but it is the only choice I have seen to use a 3.5mm audio accessory with the newer GoPro cameras. It works well which is the only reason it is getting the Stars it is getting.
1,Like me you will be confused when you purchase this and figure out the only way to use it is with the door off of your go pro.  The battery will fall out there is zero protection setup like this.  You would think for the price of this item they could include the very important door with a usb c port.Bravo GoPro on a failed high priced over rated product.Someone send me a link to an aftermarket usb-c to microphone adapter that works on a hero 10.What a joke.
5,This is a sole choice for connecting an external microphone to GoPro cameras regular connection tools do not work at all.
5,It looks like to doesn’t works. I googled issues en regard to why it won’t connect properly and why it create static sounds and I see that many people experience the same issues. I checked some YouTube videos about how to fix the issues by adjusting some settings in GoPro and it still doesn’t works. All I hear is static sounds or maybe it is adapter came defective.
5,I was surprised to get such a good product for so little money. When recording with this the sound quality is great and you can even talk to the person in front of the camera without it being recorded. The range is plenty large. I use it for recording YouTube videos.
5,I've read multiple reviews on how GoPro's adapter is the best without sacrificing quality. I could buy something for half the price but if it makes the sound quality worse I can just use the stock mic on the GoPro.I can tell the difference and it's great for vlogging and video recording. I just with there was a way to make the GoPro slightly more water resistant. I don't like how the contacts are exposed like that.
1,GoPro is cost cutting. I bought a new one because I lost the old one. Then found it.My old one dates from when the GoPro 5 first eliminated the 3.5mm. It has never failed me regardless of what I stuck in or in what order.The new one fails all the time. Complete garbage.In the pictures you can see that they’re different model numbers and see that the original mic input uses gold plated contacts probably a better spring design to retain good contact. The current is non plated poor contact springs and more expensive???Internally I suspect even more clues of cost cutting but I’ll leave that exploration to someone else.
4,Does what it's supposed to do. Make sure the external mic you get has a plug with only 3 segmentations (tip/ring/sleeve) and not 4 (tip/ring/ring/sleeve) when using gopro hero 6 (I dunno about the other ones). A TRRS mic won't work unless you have a TRRS to TRS converter (the power dewise external mic comes with a converter and works great).My only qualm is this thing is bulky af... they couldn't come up with anything more discrete and easy to hide in/around a motorcycle helmet...
5,lo recomiendo buen sonido
4,using with Ulanzi case nice set up though. have had no problems at all. use to power GoPro from Talent external battery lasts for days.
5,This is a must have for GoPro Hero 7 Black. It allows for multiple microphone options and third party holder units are readily available for creating a great portable set up for your recording events. Can't recommend it enough.
4,No problems with the item it worked just fine. Only two issues first is the size the adapter is a little bulky  so atraping it out of the way is a little dificult at times. The second problem was the price not a knock on the seller as Gopro makes the only adapter that works with the hero 5 at the moment so they get to set the price and Gopro has set a little high for what it is this should be $20 adapter at most not a $50 adapter.
5,So I’m using GoPro 7 and it works fine no complains. I have 3 different mics and all of them work good with this adapter.. the only thing is.. I wish GoPro would make a direct mic connection. Besides that is totally worth it and don’t regret it!!
4,well... it works without any problem. However the built quality seems a little bit rough... which is kind of abnormal for Go Pro original items. And then I've been using it for a few months now and still totally works fine without any problem. Just the built quality seems a little bit odd to me.
5,Good for use
3,It’s heavy and bulky. Trying to attach it to a motorcycle helmet is not an easy task.
5,Great product I will buy again. I had no problems at all.
5,me agrado
4,I noticed that if I press the record button which turns on the the GoPro and starts recording with this adaptor plugged in that the audio will not record. I have an external mic plugged in. You must use the mode button to turn on the GoPro then it will recognize the plugged in microphone. Also unplugging and replugging back in the adaptor while the GoPro is on will help reestablish connection with the plugged in microphone.
5,This is awesome connected to my audio interface and also my E-Drums phones output and the audio is great. It’s a little bit price but I’ll save so much time on editing
3,This item should cost no more than $20. It actually costs almost $50. It's a huge price gouge. Inexcusable. GoPro holds you at virtual gunpoint over it because it's either this or no external mic. It's a galling corporate money grab. Deplorable. On the plus side yeah it works fine.  It's also bulky and difficult to manage in my applicationmoto-vlogging. Make sure your mic has either the TRS style plug or comes with a TRS adapter. TRRS will not work.
5,If you are using gopro you should get this
4,Expensive dangly bit. I wish Gopro would incorporate this into the camera and just offer a mic jack ready to go.
4,It's works great for the most part but I feel the price tag was a little too high should've been 49.99 instead of what I paid. And sometimes the sounds just cuts off but luckily it doesn't happen all the time.
5,I wish it was built into the go pro but it's not so this is the next best thing. Once you plug it into the go pro you'll have an option for your mic in the go pro settings.Small works as intended.
2,Does not work w the newer GoPros
5,Reviewer used this with a Hero 5 Black and a Shure Lavalier Microphone (Powered and wireless)Works great but be sure to read instructions.  You must update your GoPro and use a microphone from the list on their website.  You can't just use any plug and play microphones.  GoPro stop making it harder to use your product.  You are in the lead don't give us a reason to go to the other options.  If Inwas to rate this based on business practices it would be a 2 star.  Because you have no choice in the microphone game when it comes to the Hero 5 Black.
5,WORKS WONDERS ~ Not sure of battery drainage but it is a GREAT PRODUCT... Fitting snug inside the ULANZI frame (for the GoPro) ~ very impressed!!
5,We bought this so we could use out Rode Go wireless mics with the GoPro and it works perfectly.
3,It works but it's ridiculously overpriced. GoPro trying to be Apple.
5,The products that GoPro produce are good quality and work just fine.  I am not sure why it costs so much though.  If I could have found a cheaper alternative I would have bought it.  Anyway this device enables you to add an external mic to make up for the poor mic that the GoPro has in it.
4,The price to value ratio is not good.  a Bit expensive as this is the only one that works well with all the mics on the market.  all the generic cheap versions does not work.
5,A must for any GOPRO audio as the internal mics are terrible. This allows you to tap into the unprocessed .wav capability of the unit. I attached a wireless receiver to it and works great
4,Go pro sucks for making people buy this inorder to get better sound quality.  the new updates on the go pro had forced people to buy this so second party products won't work like it used to. Overall it works fine
5,Works well with my gopro hero 8 black! Good sound quality don't need to use my tascam dr05 anymore less wires for me. Kind of expensive yes but adds convenience specially during video editing.
5,I love this product. Worked perfectly with my new GoPro Hero 9
5,El dispositivo es original por lo que la calidad es muy buena creo que no hay otra opcion para conectar un micrófono a la Gopro.
5,Its works as intended sonetimes with the extra usb type c it seems to not make connection at times could be loose which is not unheard of but go pro does usually take care of it may try it but so far gets done what it is needed for as far as mic hook up.
3,Minus 1 star for the high pricetag. I can't believe I gave in and bought this dangling dongle for $50. Minus another star because its form factor is just a mess. You can't bend the wire in a way to make it nice and neat. It's not long enough and it's to thick. They should have made it a 90deg attachment but who knows who came up with it.I like the ability to connect external mics and there are 5 settings that open up when you plug this in. You have standard standard plus power mic power mic plus and line. The plus settings give you a 20db boost in audio. It's nice to have better audio with the gopro but this is just a dangling dongle dilemma. Other than that it does work good for external mic inputs.
3,With GoPro being a top company that sells super quality products it's crazy to think that something as simple as an adapter for USB C to 3.5 mic Jack should cost as much as this does. Why they couldn't have just worked this into the construction design of the camera so we could just plug our mics directly into the camera is beyond me. The built in microphones are not that good because of the water proof design so anyone serious about sound quality would be using an external mic.This thing is huge add weight and ruins the compactness design of the camera. If Apple Samsung and the rest of the cell phone manufactures could design a slim light weight USB C to 3.5 mic adapter why couldn't GoPro? And what is worth $49.00 in this item?
5,It works and it works well. Turned GoPro on then plugged in adapter then swiped down for settings and found mic adapter settings and was able to adjust for my sons Vlogs he does. Must have if you actually want to use the GoPro and have sound that you can understand. Does it cost a lot oh yeah. Is it worth it kinda. It’s a must have to use for external mics. Would be amazing if it were cheaper but I’m not gonna down grade stars for price.
5,Since GoPro makes us buy this item in order to use a mic I guess I didn't have much choice. However the item is of great quality and it fits my adapter mount like a glove.
4,Well there is no way of getting around the mic situation for the Go-Pro so this is the solution. This piece is made by Go-Pro so there is a lot of quality and durability. Down side to this is that it is a bit bulky and you have to get creative on how you mount it on your Go-Pro. I used Velcro which works great!
3,It's a shame that Gopro forces you to buy their official stuff anyway but the main issue with this is that the cable is just a bit too short. Using the stock cage for the Gopro Hero 7 Black if you are on the go and want to fix this to your cage somehow (I use sticky velcro) the cable is too short for you to mount the device without crimping the cable. Sure you can invest in another cage but why won't Gopro just send you everything that is needed for a good setup? My only like about this is that you can still connect another C cable to it so you can charge simultaneously.Check my website for more gear reviews.
5,Works Good One thing I did notice is you have to plug in the Microphone to the adapter and the adapter to the Camera before you turn the camera on for it to work right. I plugged in the mic after I turned the camera on and it didn't get any audio. So just make sure everything is plugged in before you turn on the Camera. Other than that it works great and you can charge the camera with a power bank simultaneously with the external microphone recording audio!
3,Great adapter just doesn’t cancel out sound being transmitted as suggested on all the forums for GoPro.
5,Fast delivery.  Works well on my Hero8.  Paired with Rode mic. Sound quality is good.  No hissing or background noise.
5,Do not use it on a DJI Osmo gimbal with gopro adapterTo much weight and heats up your motor.  However Gopro adapter box so biggopro screwed over their customers with this boom box size adapter. All it needs is a speaker....and we can break dance.  By the way I lost it due to the box being heavy on the gimbal and why moving around the football field it fell off.  Now I can't buy another one to expensive.
3,Cumple su función pero go pro debería modificar la electronica y no tener que valernos de adaptadores.
5,I order this for GoPro Hero 5 video camera & purple panda microphone bring sound in better! I purchase the GoPro 3.5mm mic Adapter for all of this make it work better!
5,I didn’t like price. However it works like a charm and is a real benefit to have.
1,I liked the idea of being able to connect an external microphone and that’s about it. When I purchased this item it worked just fine for a few videos until I started connecting to my computer through the adapter. I didn’t realize connecting the GoPro through the adapter to the computer was destroying the GoPro adapter. Each time I used it it kept getting harder and harder for the GoPro to connect through the adapter And finally quit working all together.  I removed the adapter and I could download directly to the computer with no problems and I can charge the GoPro’s battery through the computer or wall charger usb with no problems at all.The GoPro adapter comes with “No Instructions” “No Warnings” at all. I searched the internet and found others who had the same problems. One of the reviews had the adapter check to see if it could be repaired and was advised that with the parts used that hooking it up to a computer would destroy it. So with that said if you get one don’t connect to a computer through the adapter. I returned it and use the GoPro mic to record and if I need better sound quality I use a digital recorder and sync which is very easy. And the adapter isn’t what makes the sound it’s the mic.
5,Hasta ahora funciona bien... Es bastante funcional... Lastima que gopro lo venda por separado... De resto bien
4,It's def needed to get better audio but it sucks it's so expensive & bulky. Hopefully GoPro will redesign it soon. Otherwise it works as expected.
4,This is basically a dongle for a mic input and a usb c connection for power. Allows you to power the GoPro while using an external mic. If the mike is not powered it will drain the battery fast. The dongle is not large but it is awkward because it’s size is large compared to the GoPro.
3,Sadly there is no other viable alternative for motorcyclists. I could run a dedicated audio recorder and sync the audio to my GoPro video later but then you deal with another set of batteries and a whole different set of wires.At first the adapter seemed horribly overpriced and now that I understand what the device is really doing I have a little more forgiveness for GoPro here but still I must admit it's extremely disappointing that this was the best they could do. The single is huge and awkward and really doesn't lend itself to an action cam type use case scenario.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Auténtico entrega precisa y a tiempo muy util
5,Its shape is rather awkward. It can get in front of the camera at times (should have been better designed and with a longer cable). I use in to record the aircraft's intercom. Other than that it works fine.
5,Will need to do more testing with this item.  This item is needed when hooking up a external mic on Gopro 8 camera.
2,I purchased for my GoPro 9 and I notice it makes that BUZZ 🐝 sound on the videos. I got three different microphones and they all great quality (rode) but test almost 10 different brands and still.Slightly recommended.
3,5 stars because it works perfect for converting Analog to Digital audio......but actually scoring it 3 stars because it shouldn’t be needed when using an external digital audio record because all it is is a “yes” box at that point.Ill explain.  With an analog mic this is absolutely a must as it converts the audio to digital.  Inside the box is a pretty complex circuit board.Now when you have a external digital recorder there is nothing to convert....therefore when using something like a H1N its nothing more than a box that says “yes” you can talk to our beloved piece of GoPro.  Ive lost some love towards the folks at Gopro for this.  Customers never forget.
5,El cable es perfecto lo que necesitaba para la go pro. Llego en perfectas condiciones.
5,Very happy with this product! Does exactly what it says it does sound quality is amazing! I've seen others complain about the price. The price is the price don't give it a bad review over the price! If you don't want to pay that much don't buy it!  But me I knew the price going in and I'm just glad it's available now. I've waited a good six months for it to become available! Very happy! I use it to record DJ videos. I hook up my system through a 3.5 Jack. Works great!
4,I figured a very low tech way to attache a mic. Pics are using an inexpensive Saramonic SR-XM1 mic and a rubber band. This wouldn't work for sports but works for me. I agree with others this is overpriced and a little big. The first one I got was defective the replacement works fine. Sound is improved over GoPro audio.
5,It works exactly like it's supposed to. I've had mine for going on 2 years now zero issues. I find it pretty greedy that GoPro makes you buy it to use a mic though as if you didn't just spend hundreds of dollars to buy the camera to video your activities (I mostly motovlog while riding my motorcycle) that's pretty dirty imo.
5,During receive i found package is already open but product inside is save and good condition
5,Saweeeet it is
3,So I do Motovlogs and I was getting tired of always having to separate my external mic and GoPro at times it can really use up a lot of editing time occasionally. So I bought this. It is a good mic and clipping is minimal I guess it really comes down to how you’re trying to use it. For Motovlogging it’s good. I still use an external mic to get sounds of my bike more clearer and louder but for vocals this adapter is pretty decent. Bulky but decent. We don’t have much choice when it comes to this. It’s either this or an external mic. I use both.
1,Save your money!! I tried two different mics with it and it just doesn't work. (the mics work just fine with all my other devices). I have no idea how or why gopro thought this thing was a good idea. If I could give zero stars I would but 1 star should tell you everything you need to know. UGH!
3,This is a little on the expensive side.  I'm going on a bike tour and can't wait for a third party adapter to come out.  As of this writing there are some that put a mic out but not a mic out and power and I need a mic and be able to plug it into a large battery on my bike so I don't have to keep swapping batteries.  If you don't need one right away I would wait for someone else to make one for a smaller one to come out or this to drop in price.  It works but it is $50 at the time of this review and if I didn't absolutely need one I would have waited.
5,It’s a little expensive for what it is but it works great and the materials used are high quality. I liked it a lot.
5,I like that I can put an external shotgun mic on my go pro.
5,Good quality
3,Muy bien lo único que no me agrada es que es muy grande y también de que el cable tiende quedar con presión cuando se coloca el adaptador en una carcasa y eso hace daño a la entrada de micro usb
5,Good product.. but amazon needs to tell the drivers that delivers stuff to people’s homes/apartments.. to stop throwing it and to find the door bell. That’s how stuff get damaged
4,This item works great. I just wish it wasn't so bulky.If the cable were a little longer I wouldn't worry that it is putting so much tension on the female plug on the camera. It is rather pricey too but what do you do it's a GoPro product?
5,Excellent for getting good clean audio from my rode wireless go.
5,Muy bueno. Funciona genial. SIn problemas
1,This adapter is TERRIBLE.  I'm running a GP Hero7 Black and purchased the adapter to connect a Ride microphone setup.  It's been a flat out horrible experience.  I'm getting no sound horrible popping noises or white noise when my setup is connected.  I've tried changing my settings around in my GP7 to Mic and Mic+.  GP Quick capture has been disabled.  My GP7 Black has recently downloaded it's latest update.  I still get no sound horrible popping noises or white noise.  This adapter is USELESS.  I know it's an adapter issue because my internal GoPro microphone works fine.  My Rode microphone is stellar when connected to my Canon camera.  So it's definitely an adapter issue I like very many am experiencing.  I thought I was getting the best possible upgrade for sound quality.  I spent the extra money and completey wish I hadn't.  What a waste and what a headache.  I do not recommend making this purchase and if you do I wish you better luck than myself.
5,Good quality hooks up well and strong! It’s just a shame you have to buy it for audio or charging they should already have a place for that on the camera! But worth it!
4,This product works just fine the only downside to this whole thing is how much it costs
3,The mic adapter for the gopro 5 works great but the large size makes it difficult to rig. No matter what tripod or mount that I use it's hard to figure out where to put the large adapter. It seems to be in the way no matter how I got it.Unfortunately this is the only device that will allow a mic to be used with the gopro 5 or 6. Earlier models had aftermarket adapters but Gopro has made it where only theirs works now.If this review was helpful please hit yes below!
5,Nice addition to my gopro set up. Works well with my rode mic.
5,Must have accessory for external mic input on GoPro
4,This thing.... Worked fine on my Hero 5 Black but man... The price is a joke.  I needed it so I had to suck it up.  Everything works good and the audio quality with my rode mic is much better.  Still - GoPro is legit jacking the price on this thing.
5,It’s stupid this doesn’t come with your GoPro. I also bought a Rode wireless mic and the sound quality is so much better than the internal mic. If I’m not dunking my camera underwater I’m using an external microphone.You absolutely can’t use one without this adapter.
3,The product works fine. The reason for 3 stars because GoPro is stupid enough to make a CAMERA that they know needs good quality sound to enjoy overall experience of a video but require this adapter to achieve that good quality audio. Why didn’t they just at least make a microphone if their own? Instead we have to modify the damn camera with this dangling equipment. How stupid GoPro engineers are? Doesn’t take rocket science to realise that. If I want just video with bad audio or no audio for editing I’ll buy a cheaper action camera. GoPro you need to get your head out your a$$e$.
1,Worked for about 16 recordings then stopped working defective/cheap product.Was fine then it died now it does not pass through audio to the Hero 8 black.I am stuck with crappy Hero 8 internal mic now.Waste of money.
5,My new GoPro 7 needs this adapter to add a microphone so it is practically necessary to buy. But ohhhh... the price hurts the wallet so bad. If it never fails all it good. And at this price it better never fail!
5,The Good: it is small fits a few models of GoPro cameras and finally that it actually works as intended.The Bad: The price is a bit steep for what you get but when it is the only show in town...The Ugly: It is awkward at times depending on the rig set up. You have this dangling adapter that has compromised your water tight seal to a $400 camera...Yeah.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Work great for me with my gopro hero 8!
5,I ordered a cheap adapter adapter for $10usd but it wont work. Using this on go pro 6. Very thick cable so this will last a very long time. Just wish it wasnt so big. And so damn expensive bro. Like wtf.
3,PROS:-Only product that allows a 3.5mm microphone to work properly with the HERO6.-Can still utilize the USB-C(charge/sync content).-Plug and play simple.CONS:-COST; over priced for what it is.-Hard to keep the blackbox out of the way when moving around and it kind of just hangs there unless you do some DIY mounting.-Mine has a poorly fitting USB so I have to treat it it like an old phone charger where you have to position it juust right or it wont work and you can't tell until you play back the video.(I used a rubber band and an extra arca-swiss mount)
5,i like it
5,fucc gopro for making it only possible to get audio from 5/6/7 by having to buy this block as a external use 🙄 other than that this works PERFECTLY FINE. people swear it’s difficult to use or install. if you’ve been thinking about buying this just do it not only do you need it but it will work 👍🏽 i love it lol
5,WHY go pro WHY must you put absolute garbage mic's into your products. This adapter does very well has a charge pass through so you don't need to disconnect it. I use it with a Rode mic and it seems to perform very well. Don't expect any sort of water protection when using this being you need to keep the door cover open or off to use it.
5,I am soo excited everything works together perfectly
3,Hi to others who are looking to purchase item my experience not great but I do appreciate flawless customer service by Amazon. I'll start by saying my 1st mic came defective tried all troubleshooting even to the point of  ordering  additional mics I thought maybe mic was problem  but that was not the case even tried friends go pro at the end it was actual adapter some are coming out defective so if your are going through no sound or just buzzing sound you know why so have to exchange it just got my replacement and it worked perfect.
5,Smart and great idea well worth it but i did see for $20 cheaper after i paid for it at $60
1,It’s crap I have to spend the 50 bucks on this after buying a new GoPro. But hey every dollar they can make! Oh yea you have to get a special case to hold it as well so more money again. Worse off after all that I got it and have used it a few times the plug that goes into the GoPro wiggles lose and I lose all sound. It don’t go back to the built in mic. You just lose all sound. That’s aggravating having to check every single video to make sure it had sound. Or if it’s a one time recording then you miss the audio all in all.
3,Too clunky. I ended up going with a Zoom H1 to record external audio. I originally bought this item to connect my lav mic inside my motorcycle helmet to the GoPro mounted on the outside of the helmet. This adapter has a rubberized exterior and NOTHING sticks to it - Velcro tape epoxy nothing. Finally found a way to mount it to my helmet but it's just a hassle overall. And when I'm off the bike I don't need an external mic because the wind noise isn't that bad. The connecting cable is stiff and short and just awkward. Do not buy. Not worth it.
5,Works well with gopro 7. I tried cheaper ones but none of them worked with external mic.
5,It's expensive it's huge but it gets the job done. Works just fine and unfortunately this is the price we pay for the slimmer and more featured Hero 5. The hardware was eliminated to make room for other advancements. I'd venture to say that GoPro's data indicated that most users didn't use 3rd party microphones. So this was cut. I assume that over time cheaper knockoffs will hit the market but right now this is the only game in town.
4,I fly general aviation aircrafts and I use this adaptor for ATC recordings for my videos. It works great. No issues with quality of recordings. The only down side is that it's quite overpriced like most GoPro products.
5,Este adaptador lo uso para conectar con el micrófono externo de mi GoProTrabaja muy bien  me gusto
5,Necesariamente o ligado para grabar una mejora de sonido con gopro
4,The product do the job. But expensive.
5,Works perfectly nothing more to be said.
3,In all fairness I haven't totally troubleshot the mic...so I will revise if the static noise goes away.
3,Not sure why when they can make a whole 4K video camera so small that this device is so large and expensive.  It was a necessary item for my setup so I felt a bit forced to pay too much for it.  All in all it works well though.  I feel GoPro pulled a proprietary stunt to force sales.  Maybe someone will make an aftermarket version of this - smaller and for a fair price (around $20) they would do well.
5,Works good with my gopro H8!!!!!
