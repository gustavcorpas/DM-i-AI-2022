5,I purchased these stands because I work on a computer with two large screens all day. I‚Äôm tall and was having upper back and neck issues because the screens were not eyelevel for me. These stands solved the problem helping me sit up straighter and be much more comfortable while I work. These are so easy to put together - the adjustable metal legs screw in easily. They are mistake-proof.  The sturdiness of this product is very impressive and support the large screens with room to spare. I measured the built in screen stands before ordering to make sure they would work. I can also use these with a laptop - I extend the legs fully and the laptop sits at a much better height for ease of use with a separate keyboard.  The stands free up desk space since I can put items under them. I‚Äôm super pleased with the high quality construction of these and I highly recommend them.
5,These are crazy sturdy and I was pumped to get 2 of them! I find the most random things to do with the second one but the first one is perfect for my monitor (I use a small flat screen TV for a monitor) üëèüèªüëèüèª
5,We have two monitors at work. We stand at our register while ringing up customers but our monitors were so low that we were slouching and bending down to see our screen. I thought I would have to adjust these riser stands to the highest level but on just the first level worked perfect for all our different heights. Simple easy to use and built sturdy.
4,First off if you can open a twist cap bottle you can assemble this stand. It's THAT easy!Secondly the stands are made of a sturdy metal and good design. They're lightweight yet feel solid. I found the adjustable heights to be perfectly spaced.The only issue I had with these stands was the cord slot. In my picture you can see I  removed the plastic insert which wasn't hard to do. However the slot in the metal was BARELY big enough to fit the plug for my monitor's power cord through. The little "barrel?" on my webcam cord also was a tight squeeze.I think the metal slot needs just a few centimeters more width and the plastic insert is just trash. I was very pleased with my purchase overall and would definitely buy these again.
5,These monitor stands are SO easy to install and super easy to change the height on the fly.  Highly recommend!
5,Easy to use and stable
5,I used two of these to get my old 27" iMac level with my thunderbolt display. They work perfectly for that though you may need some material to make the exact heights match. To this day I wish Apple had made them line up better but this helps get you more usable space on your desk and they improved my posture. They aren't expensive but they are well made and have held up very well over extended use.
5,I use them everyday and they are very sturdy
5,Very easy to assemble
5,I like these very much.  They make a tall enough structure so I can see the clock that sits behind my sewing machine.  I'll probably place other things on it later  but for now it's a great place for the clock.
5,These risers were super easy to put together. They worked perfectly to raise my computer monitors to a comfortable viewing height.
5,I have bought several of these to use as TV stands around the house.  They allow for a standard DVD player to fit underneath and the fact that the height can be adjusted is an added bonus.
4,I was looking for an economical way to raise my monitor height - this was it. The stands were easy to assemble.  Bonus: I did not anticipate the additional room it would give me for storing desk items.  The only downside was one leg was slightly off when installed.  Overall I would buy again.
5,This is a must buy!! Easy to assemble.
5,Very sturdy and does the job!
5,This does exactly what I need it to plus it clears up the space on my desk so it looks neater. I love the notch for my phone to stand up.
5,Nice sturdy and unobtrusive
5,Easy to put together an does the job. The ONLY issue I had was that my monitor has the big flat base so I had to pop out the little holder in front so it would sit level and not wobble.
5,I bought these for my monitor and laptop in my home office. They are easy to assemble and work really well so far!
5,These are high quality super nice!
