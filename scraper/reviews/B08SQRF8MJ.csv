5,My old ram had 1 of the 4 fail. So I upgraded from the the 32gb set to these 128gb and they work great.  Installed with intel 10900k and Asus rog z490 mb. Surprisingly I notice the biggest difference when browsing photos on my hard drives. The thumbnails and previews used to need buffer time and now it's near instant as I scroll. Second difference is apps load faster. I normally sit at 12-17gb utilization. Opened every app on my pc (adobe suite including Lightroom all of ms office topaz neo dxo steam VR tos and trading view plus 10 websites) and was "only" using about 47gb while rendering a video. Obviously I'd never have everything open all at once like that in normal use but was just curious what it would take to use up 132gb.  My pc did not slow down. Granted the gpu (2080s) can only keep up so much with all that. The render time would suffer bc the VR had priority over the video. Second gpu though and it would be unstoppable. That is next on the upgrade list now just to test playing VR while rendering videos.
5,I’ve heard the horror stories of Corsair Vengeance Pro sticks and I’ve only ever seen one pair fail and they were my buddies new ones that arrived malfunctioning from the start. But he got another pair and they worked fine. I’ve had about 4 different sets now and they haven’t failed me yet.The Corsair iCUE software for controlling the lighting is easy to use a little difficult to navigate creating custom patterns at first but once you learn you got it.These specific models were for my secondary mini pc build because the original Vengeance PRO rgb sticks are a bit taller and risk blocking some parts such as coolers especially in a small form factor build  these newer models are a lot more stylish for one a good amount slimmer and out of the way. And run great so far.  No complaints overall.
5,The Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB 3200MHz sticks of ram were something I was looking into buying to upgrade my PC's ram as I wanted something speedy and aesthetically pleasing.  Since I have an older 2016 era PC I didn't have a motherboard compatible with DDR5 ram so this DDR4 set was the next best step.  Upon researching which ram sticks would have the best looking RGB lights I decided on these as I saw videos comparing different brands and I can confirm that these look pretty in my case.  The Corsair iCUE software is simple to use and offers a variety of different lighting packages that you can customize to your liking with several different patterns.  Compared to my old 8 gb ADATA sticks I have noticed an increase in overall speed when multitasking.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase as after being skeptical with which ram sticks I should purchase buying these made me happy with how my PC looked and performed.  I plan to buy a new set whenever I decide to get a new PC.
5,I bought the 32GB have not put them in my new pc build yet since parts are still shipping. When it's all here I'll come back and say if they work good. ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝ They're really pretty I feel like they're going to look great. Might buy 2 more.୭ৎ ࣪ ׅ ♡
5,Son hermosas  y su funcionamiento es exelente  su brillo está muy buena  si frecuencia es uy estable  y vas a empezar en el mundo de los juegos te las recomiendo un 100% no solo por su apariencia que es hermosa  si no también por La simple que si frecuencia es exelente
5,I could not confirm that this RAM was compatible with my system.  I took a chance because Amazon returns are easy; it worked like a dream.  I bought the 128 GB set and they were matched.  Booted right up and XMP worked without a hitch. Stable fast and good lighting.  Will buy a second set for my backup PC.
5,RGB +50 Horsepower.No really These went right in worked instantly iCUE isn't a thorn in the side the same way Mystic Light is and they don't argue with me when I tell them what to do. I had to push them to capacity in BIOS so they didn't run undervolted but that's typical.I don't have them overclocked nor undervolted. They hold up well don't put off a bunch of heat the lighting doesn't act weird or erratic. I should've gotten a bigger kit and I likely will in the future.I'm a huge fan of Corsair products and haven't had any let me down in the past or present.(2x8gb/16gb) kit works very well.Build :MOBO: MSI B550 Gaming PLUSCPU : Ryzen 5 5500RAM : Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB)Storage : Samsung EVO 980 M.2 1TB Samsung EVO 860 SSD 500GBx2 WD Black 4TB HDDCooler : Corsair iCUE H100i Elite CapellixFans : Deepcool CF120 (5v ARGBx6)Case : Deepcool Mattrexx 55-ARGB-WCableMod brand Braided extensions - White-16 year IT professional
5,I no longer wanted to RAM my head into a wall from all the windows errors I was getting before with my 8gb of 2666 ram. Haha get it?
5,I just upgraded my CPU and Mobo and my old ram was out of spec. Picked these up and they are great! Have always had great luck with Corsairs products.
3,Review - CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB RS 64GB (2x32GB) DDR4 3600 (PC4-28800) C18 Memory-This memory is acceptable but as memory that portrays itself as the best money can buy I expected better.-DISAPPOINTMENTSWhen AMD DOCP (xmp) is turned off Corsair Vengeance RGB RS ram runs only at 2133 mts not the 2880 advertised right in the product name.-Configuring the RGB software for an Asus motherboard combining the Corsair iCue application with the Asus Armoury Crate application is a truly painful experience. Corsair doesn't provide any assistance either. Only after many web searches and finding discussions on some 3rd party tech forums was I able to figure out the RGB setup process. The iCUE software must be installed first and the RGB must be set in the iCue software before being recognized by the Asus Armoury Crate RGB software.-When using Asus Armoury Crate RGB software alone the Corsair RAM is not recognized. I've used other brands of the RGB ram that are recognized without additional software such as GSKILL and ADATA XPG.-When using 2 packages of 64GB to achieve 128GB my Asus ROG Strix X570-E mobo and Windows took 4 tries before it stabilized. On first boot Windows went BSOD before ever getting to the login screen. Only after turning off DOCP then getting into Windows then rebooting and turning then on DOCP in the uefi BIOS and then booting again did the memory finally train and synchronize correctly.-OTHER THOUGHTSUnless purchasing a pre-tested package of 4 RAM sticks it seems to be pure chance to be able to get 4 sticks of RAM from 2 different packages of 2 sticks to run together regardless of brand or price.-CONCLUSIONSBe forewarned that if you think buying expensive "fancy ram" will avoid setup and configuration problems think again. Even with expensive Corsair fancy ram expect to work at to get the RAM to function optimally.
5,Research determined that the C18 is optimized for AMD whereas the C19 isn't  Yet the assembler of my new computer installed the C19!  Got a refund and purchased the proper ones - these!!  There is a significant enough difference to have installed them.
5,I'm sure these work great but I'm not using them. I need 128g 3600hz but I saw the price and pulled the trigger before thinking about it. They showed up on time so a 5 star rati g is well deserved.
5,Does rated ram speed even when paired with older set
5,Excelentes memorias
4,Worked perfect with a Gigabyte b660 and runs at cl16 3200 dual rank using the auto detected xmp profile in bios. Runs very stable spent no longer than 15 mins troubleshooting. Another bonus it looks great using iCue and integrates with my other RGB components seamlessly.
3,So I bought a kit of this a while back at microcenter and they worked great and even could hit 3733mhz and had metal housings... you can see where I'm going with this.Adding this new kit into my pc (which they cheaped out and now and the housings at least for me were plastic) went okay except since the housing was plastic it had peeled away meaning I had to take 3 sticks out to push the plastic back together. THEN...With both kits in my pc xmp caused windows to immediately bsod so I had to run all of the sticks at just 2133mhz (stock). disappointing. tried upping voltages and everything and they wouldn't even manage to get up to their rated speed. (although i'm not going to hold this against corsair for now as my older chips are most likely slightly degraded and my motherboard BARELY likes to run 2 sticks at that speed as it is so i'm not going to say it's corsair's fault until I get a new motherboard.)
5,Can't wait to buy more
5,Easy to install and fit perfectly
4,This ram didn't fit my PC
5,Needed an upgrade for my desktop from 16gb. For my Alienware aurora it was an easy switch and install. Enough space to fit. No problems since the first install. Computer runs a lot smoother. Would recommend.
5,These are great ram sticks. The RGB options are nice and somewhat easy to change in the software. They probably could've made the software a little less confusing but it's still something you only really need to use occasionally when you want to switch up some colors. My advice is to go with the SL version because it offers the same speed with a cheaper price and no little plastic bracket near the edges that blocks some of the RGB lighting. The SL version just looks much more slick. Other than that the item works as intended and I plan on buying 2 more 8GB sticks to max out at 32 GB of RAM relatively soon.
5,Great ram. Had issues with XMP on previous ram. So I bought a 64gb set. Unfortunately I can't run this ram at 3600 so it might actually be a MOBO issue. Still even at 3300 it's running great. Would like to have rma'd the item to be sure.But with Customs in my country I'd rather not deal with the hassle. Giving a preemptive 5 stars until I can change my mobo.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very nice ram kit be sure to enable XMP / DOCP in your system BIOS after installation.  Otherwise you may default to 2166 or something like that. Depending on the chips in your specific memory kit you may be able to get away with tighter timings or slightly higher frequency with the same C18 timing. But do that at your own risk. Make sure your MOBO can support 3600 MT/s as well. Quite happy with the kit as it helped with my FPS 1% and .1% lows
5,Great memory for the priceYou can set the LEDs to run in various directions and colorsNo complaints
5,I really wanted the white sticks to match the rest of my set up however if it's on I'm not really focused on the plastic casing. If you don't care what it looks like when it's off I would suggest going with the black ones if you'd rather save a few dollars. I've had to do a forced update for the lights to work with iCue a few times but I'm pretty sure that could be user error. (I'm newish to RGB stuff and have a few different things going on here.)
5,You can't go wrong with Corsair.  I don't mind paying a little more for the quality.I only wish I purchased it first.
4,RGB slow to load color profile saved.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very satisfied with purchase would recommend for first time build

5,Make sure you install these in the slots it calls for in your motherboards manual. I installed mine next to one another in slots 1 & 2 and had poor performance. Installed in 1 & 3 after reading the motherboards manual. Restarted and entered the Bios. Clicked a checkbox or something like that in the RAM area of the BIOS (easily find on YouTube) and you're good to go. Lightning fast and looks great.
5,Nada del otro mundo buenas memorias ram
5,This kit is quite impressive. I had 4x16 3200mhz cl14 and even tried 4x8 cl16 3600mhz by another top brand and this kit is noticeably ‘snappier’. Call me crazy all you want but yes this kit which is spec’d  at 3600mhz 4x16 cl18 feels a bit more smooth and just super stable and robust. Crazy to me bc not only are the timings 18-22-22-22-42 which are technically ‘slower’ than the previous kits I tried but I also could not get 3600mhz to run. I was however able to get 3534mhz with infinity fabric at 1767mhz to run smooth at butter keeping the voltage at 1.35v. Low and behold it runs super smooth and everything so far is very stable. Also doesn’t hurt that it looks really nice the icue software isn’t terrible to work with and the non sharp edges were much more pleasant to push down on to install over the kits I previously tried. Happy customer so far but will report and update if anything changes.
5,nice color i like it

5,Great ram nice compatibility and nice argb
4,It’s all around a great product only problem is i paid for it brand new but got sent used ones
5,Very satisfied with product
5,
4,Works  like it should but I can get the rgb to stay the same pattern go to red everytime I turn it on.
5,Espectaculares y hermosas
5,I bought this RAM a few months ago and absolutely love it. It looks great it’s fast and is a great price for the speeds you receive from it. For anyone who doesn’t understand pc gaming and your wanting to get into building your first rig I strongly suggest this RAM. Just make sure it’s compatible with all your other hardware before buying do your research. This is an amazing product and I’m about to buy more.
5,Bought this for my rig because I swapped motherboards for an MSI Z590 MPG Carbon. The ram I had was not clockable to its advertised speed due to not being on the QVL (Qualified Vendor List). Actually being one of the cheaper sets to poke out to 32GB and 3200MHz. Works as it should. With any RAM it will default to a lower/default speed if not set in BIOS to XMP for intel or the equivalent in AMD rigs. RGB is a nice touch or it can be turned off if rainbow barf isn't your jam. Stays nice and cool... averages 34c on my rig while goofing around.
5,No problems with it I've checked the stats and it is what it says I can recommend
5,Pretty simple thing to install and colors are great!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Solid product as what we've come to expect from the brand. Great for high performance applications rendering and gaming.  Rgbs are awesome. Was a bit on the high side at the time of purchase. I've seen the price bounce around quite a bit. If you're looking for a stylish yet great performer you can consider the oloy Warhawk. Again nothings wrong with this but I can Also recommend Oloy. Happy building.
5,Works well.  Rgb looks good
5,These Ram kits from Corsair are boss! I love the RGB schemes you can customize with the IQUE software. Soild RAM for the price! GAME ON!
5,Me gustan mucho la gama de colores
5,Solo puede decir que es un magnifico producto excelente rendimiento y estabilidad. El único problema que note es que estas memorias solo se pueden controlar con el software iCUE lo cual es un problema en mi caso pues mi board es ASUS con Aura Sync el cual no las detecta. y no es buena idea tener dos software controlando ARGB. Solo funcionan alternando colores de forma genérica.
5,I installed this to give my pc some extra ram and I’ve had no problems since! This product is great
5,Funcionan a la perfección incluso cambiarlas de color es súper sencillo con la aplicación
3,Web page stated AMD and Intel certified. I run AMD and received Intel certified item. No options or clarification of what exact set to select for AMD just size and color.
4,Looks great works great decent price. But ascetic software needs some work
5,Great price! And easy install!
5,Quick delivery and exactly what my console needed. The RGB lights are a great touch. Went from 16 at 3200 to 32 and 3600. Huge difference noticed immediately. Highly recommend.
5,RGB lights are amazing. Performance is even better. Enable XMP in your bios and the speed goes right up to 3200. If I can reconfigure my CPU cooler fan I'm going to buy another 16 mb kit. Can't use 4 chips yet because my CPU fan covers the first RAM slot.
5,Great value

5,I am a 73 year old retired Chemist and my son is a gamer. so we both bought these RAM RGB memory.  He uses it in a different way than I do.  I love the RGB lighting also as it goes with my new RGB case fans and cpu cooler fan.  Regards
5,
5,Perfect for my gaming pc and I highly recommend this to anyone look for ram.
5,Perfect for mid level build on AMD chips
5,The ram looks really good and the icue app is very easy to use and looks great with my Corsair fans
5,Awesome I’m definitely going to get another pair so I have 64!
5,MUY BIEN PODER RAM LLEGO BIEN GRACIAS
4,The last item I had with several blinking lights on it was my toy robot ... when I was 4 years old. The RGB LED craze to put flashing lights on every computer component for the most part seems absolutely asinine. I only purchased this particular model because I needed two 32GB sticks and I have used Corsair Vengeance in the past with good results. I mounted them properly and they work just fine in my Gigabyte Aorus Master Z390 motherboard. By default the LEDs are set to a slow "breath" cycle that changes to another hue every 5 seconds or so. If you want to take full control of the LEDs you need to use Corsair's monster bloatware program iCUE that will likely #### up more things than it fixes. I went into iBloat and set the LEDs to map to the dimms temperature sensor so I could tell if they got too warm. Once I made this adjustment the voltage regulator on my Corsair HX1200i PSU started clicking. Two days later and I am still troubleshooting the LEDs (the HX1200i has been rock solid for more than 2 years). If the LEDs are set to off the clicking disappears. I am still fooling with finding a compromise. Stay tuned ....
5,Very nice looking aesthetic these are also the slim version so if your using like a stock amd cooler you can fit ram right next to it
5,The title says it all! Couldn't be happier with this 32gb 3200mhz ddr4 kit... met and exceeded all of my expectations
3,I plugged them in as soon as I received them and they aren’t the same. I changed the color to white for both of them and one is slightly more blue and the other is slightly more orange. It’s not the end of the world since I can adjust the hue of them to make them white or match each other in any other color. But it’s just the hassle of having to do so every time that I want to change the colors. Or if I want to use any of the rainbow effects you can tell they aren’t the same. Other than the that they work great and do the job!
4,Easy to install like most ram goes well with my white aesthetic of my case I’m going for and the rgb is easy enough to control through software.
5,Glowed flawlessly good memory for the price.
5,Came quick. Clicked right in. Worked.
4,Upon receiving the kit my new system would constantly hard restart itself only to find one of the sticks was dead even though it showed a full 32gb in windows. Went through the whole RMA process through Corsair which was very simple and received my new kit all in all just under two weeks. Corsair handled everything in a timely manner and I am extremely satisfied. The only part less than ideal was the whole kit had to be sent back despite only one stick having failed. This left me without a working system for two weeks.However with the working memory my board detected the XMP with no issue and was working at the rated speed no issue. RGB Looks stunning and is easy to configure in ICUE. Overall this kit works great and is possibly the nicest looking out there.
5,The memory does not register as 4000 out of the box. You have to reconfugure for full speed in the bios. After this you will see the full benefit of this memory. The corsair icue software is also easy to use and allows you to customize lighting for your memory in your rig. I am pleased with the performance  so far.
3,I have a ASUS X99 Deluxe II Motherboard with 16GB Corsair Vengence RAM sticks (4 X 4) and spec's state I can install 128GB up to 3300MHz. However the Corsair RGB Pro SL's did not register as expanded RAM in any configuration. I've reinstalled Corsair Vengence 32GB 3200 MHz (2 X 16) and now have 48GB RAM. There is Web talk about this particularity with ASUS X99 motherboards and RAM sticks expansion. I cannot give more rating about the Corsair RGB Pro SL's than this. I have a loyalty and respect for Corsair products and use their PCU water cooler and it works exeptionaly well temp regulating. So if I rate it's the quality and reliability of Corsair that extends to the RGB Pro SL's. The RGB lighting was excellent through my Tower glass and I only wish I could have the RAM upgrade with those.
5,Definitely worth the price. Easy to install and the manual provides optimal spots to place the ram sticks for best performance. Would continue to buy this brand!
5,Corsair always delivering quality products
5,I needed to upgrade the RAM in my workstation (MSI TRX40 Pro Wifi motherboard AMD 3970X CPU Nvidia 3090 GPU OS = Linux Mint 20.1 64-bit Xfce). I did not really want RGB LEDs but during the installation I found this feature to be helpful because when the machine was booted I could instantly see which of the DIMMS were illuminated. In fact I needed to re-seat the RAM a few times to get all of the DIMMs to register. At first the machine set the frequency to 2133 MHz but after going into the UEFI BIOS and manually setting the frequency to 3200 MHz DRAM voltage to 1.35 volts and timings to 16-18-18-36 I was able to run the RAM at its rated speed. Installation was relatively easy and considering current prices this RAM was a fairly good value for the money.
5,It's RAM so I feel like there's only so much you can really say but I love this particular brand so much.  Aesthetic wise it's only beat by one other in my opinion and price wise it just cannot be beat.  The RGB aspect is incredibly easy to program and change I've set up several different profiles that all sync and change on a single click with other corsair tech that is in this build.In terms of performance I've never once had any sort of heat issue with them I monitor everything in the build fairly regularly to make sure temps are running as expected.  Installation was easy as well each card slipped right in with some solid pressure.  I've been able to run games like warzone overwatch and dbd alongside discord videochat spotify google chrome and programs like ICUE and Synapse in the background with OBS and it's never once even stuttered.
5,just bought an additional 16g for 32gb total from corsair vengeance. i have it clocked at 3200mhz through bios. i7-8700k and 3060ti i have a good time running all modern games in high if not max settings
5,As if gpu price scalping wasn’t already hard enough on its own... RAM prices have seen to go up buy an absurd amount over the last month or two. I paid $120 for 16gb of 3200mhz ddr4 in 2021.(that didn’t even arrive to MY HOUSE) had to buy more. This is insane in late 2020 you could easily pick up a 16gb ddr4 kit 2666-3600mhz for around $60-$90. Although $30 dollars is a lot less of an inflation rate than triple the price for most 30 series nvidia cards it’s still an unfair price gouge that people have to deal with. Nonetheless the Corsair products never disappoint great looking great performance. Corsair vengeance rgb pro is definitely top 3 best looking ram kits out there. Definitely recommended picking one or two of these kits up for any gamer!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Teniendo una de las mejores iluminaciones ARGB en memorias y estando optimizadas para Intel esta es una de las mejores inversiones que le puedes hacer a tu PC. La luz se ve muy bien aunque cada una de los led se nota de forma individual eso se puede mejorar agregando más leds más pequeños.
5,
5,A lot of reviews here are just pointless since people don't know how to use XMP and dual-channel memory install. Most of the time you want to install this memory in slots 2 and 4 (check your mobo for order). And ONLY then switch the XMP profile.
1,Corsair has always been my favorite company for gaming memory and storage. Unfortunately I will not be buying from them again. This gaming memory chip has been working well for about a year.  Then it starting to fail and caused "blue screens". After confirming with memtest that the "blue screens" are indeed memory related I reached out to Corsair support to replace the memory since there is limited lifetime warranty.  Unfortunately they have been slow to respond.  After multiple days support responded and requested info on serial numbers and receipt which were promptly provided.  Now it has been 8 days since I heard from support after repeatedly requesting for an update while my machine is "blue screening" everyday.  I sent one last email to support this morning and if I don't receive a response from them I will never buy from Corsair in my personal and professional life.  It may not be a big deal to Corsair but if this review sways someone away from buying this or other Corsair products due to support then this review has served its purpose.  Thanks for reading my frustration and disappointment with Corsair.
5,Runs great on my Ryzen R9 5900X and an RTX 3090 ROG Strix!Works at full speed with XMP turned on.
5,Cool RGB Great Speed.  Corsair is premium memory at a fair market price.  The RGB is just an extra goodie!
5,If you're going for looks and performance... but mostly looks then you've come to the right place. There are better budget friendly DDR4 RAM out there so please take that into consideration.
5,Soy de Chile y se tardo prácticamente una semana en llegar el producto venia en Excelente Estado
5,Easy to install and worked perfectly.
4,The product really looks good but really don't notice any difference moving from 3000Mhz. Was able to set the static color and uninstall iCue which is very nice. Overall very happy with the purchase and since DIM prices are so low right now for such good memory take advantage and get something speedy that may be useful in the years to come.
5,You won't be disappointed.
5,Best ram you could buy for a really good price even looks amazing in my build!
5,Todo bien.
4,Working from home?  Is your desktop not giving you sufficient motivation?  Not enough warmth in your life?  RGB is the answer!  For almost the same price a normal DDR4 3200 you can get 64GB of memory goodness in two sticks.  The package is detected at 3200Mhz for DOCP as dual-channel running at CL16.  It is not the fastest RAM but it is one of the taller ones.  It may not clear with Air Coolers so AIOs or waterloops are the best.  Even with an AIO the USB plugs come very close to the 2nd stick which skips of the empty ones.  Effects can be controlled via Corsair iCUE despite eating 5% of your CPU the mesmerizing Rainbow mode provides a fascinating distraction outside of your monitor.
5,Works
5,Going on about 2 months now and they are still working fabulously after a super easy install. When we go to upgrade instead of buying a completely different set we plan on buying another set of these to fill our remaining 2 slots of RAM. We play VR with no problem RPGs with no issues and often tend to have multiple things going at once which these handle with absolutely no problem. As for the RGB portion I haven't messed with it yet since my liquid cooler motherboard and all 10 of my fans are also RGB but they run on a different program than the RAM does. So that was literally the only thing I thought was odd about them that and they default to rotate rainbow.
5,Muy buena calidad y envío
5,EL Prodcuto llegó bastante rápido y sin problemas. El tamaño si es una ventaja en comparación con PRO. Tienen un buen rendimiento.
5,Corsair Ram is usually more expensive because it's has a good looking design Works with lots of motherboards and most importantly RGB. Mine work perfectly paired with my 3700x on a B550 Motherboard. It works great with the ICUE software but it can be a bit slow when first starting up. Colors are bright and if your sick of it you can either dim it or turn it off. Overall great but expensive.
5,I use the adobe suite and the more memory the better!
5,They work good. No complaints.
4,Yes the technical specs of these are great but you can turn to amazingly informational reviews on certain video sharing sites for that.If youre here youre here for a highly simplified review from a highly un educated person.That being said  you ever been on a date?Like a really fancy one where someone takes you to olive garden and while youre there the staff sets the mood but placing fake non harmful battery powered tea candles on the tables?Yeah these are like that.It's like your PC is taking you on a date to a  Cyberpunk world and these RGB ram sticks are the tea candles and set the mood of your extremely weird date.Ps. They're easier to install if you loudly play The Prodigy and think broody thoughts.If you need to change the settings on these after you install  power on your PC press the delete key while your system is booting and softly say "I never asked for this"  everything should work perfectly after that.I give these 9 deeply disturbing Adam Jensen out of 10
5,Works as intended
5,Don't be a fool reset your BIOS/CMOS/UEFI to defaults before installing this kit! Who has two thumbs and installed the RAM without verifying the timings had been updated? This guy! :)The RAM runs great paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and Asus ROG Strix X570-E Gaming motherboard (BIOS version 2407). I ran Memtest86 for ten hours (2 full passes) to verify the RAM was fault-free before booting into Windows 10. Ran a couple of 3DMark benchmarks to make sure the RAM could handle gaming as well.Though the default Rainbow RGB pattern makes lovely colors it gets old fast with how bright they are. iCUE quickly fixed that.Over the next few weeks I will keep burning them in with gaming Chrome tabs virtualization video editing photo processing and more. Should I come across any adverse findings I will update my review appropriately!
5,These also work with a pair of Ven. Pro SL 3200mhz. Just fyi. In case you accidently purchase diff stick size.
5,producto excelente
5,Upgrading a store bought computer to maximize the available memory.
5,Este producto se los recomiendo 🙋🏻‍♂️
5,I got these a few weeks ago and I had no problems what so ever. Just keep on note that these stick are going for around 90$ with tax* I suggest you’d go with Team force it has better cost/value…unless you want good looking sticks.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just got a new pc with 16 gigs of ram. It was already pretty good but I wanted to go all out with this pc. The lights were fun to customize. I wound up using the rain pattern. And speed wise its great. I’ve been playing half life alyx and my old pc made it a pain to play taking multiple minutes to load a save. Now it takes about 20 seconds on max settings! The cost is a lot to take in for such small parts but the boost in power is worth it if you’re playing games that take a lot of resources and/or vr
3,I ordered it this originally and it came in the mail with a hair tie and nasty hair in the packing.  The parcel was missing. So I ordered another one and some how magically Amazon can send it two days but the previous order was like a week or so. Shipping and theft for computer stuff is kinda crazy right now.I would purchase again.
5,Easy to install and worked great with iCue.
3,The ram is amazing handles everything I throw at it delivery needs work. They sent it in its package alone not in a box but the package itself with a shipping label on it. I live in an apartment complex and was worried that it might get stolen.
4,Could be slightly sturdier
5,Paired with an overclocked Ryzen 5700g and have had no issues. Good value for the speed/timing. RGB is diffused well. Corsair iCue software isn't great but most RGB software isn't.
5,Funciona tal cual lo Anunciado. Corsair es una marca en la que confiar plenamente. Llegó fácilmente a la velocidad anunciada con la configuración xmp 2.0 desde la BIOS. La función rgb funciona bien aunque el software es muy básico.
5,Out of the box the sticks were able to boot up with the specified timings (returned previous RAM from another source because of they did not boot up to the specified timings) so win there. Will try to tighten the timings and see if I can get a little more out of it. It is indeed Samsung B-die so I'm hoping for a little bit of overclocking room but besides the performance the RGB looks amazing. The lowest brightness settings still lights up all of the pc case and the preset options on iCue make it really stunning to look at. The colors look really good and give the case a great aesthetic feel.If you're looking for RGB ram look no further. The fact that they are b-die make it that much better.
2,Las luces fallan se desincronizan en el icue el dispositivo sale con un aviso en rojo y solo se soluciona al reiniciar. Es difícil instalarlo.
5,Excellent quality easy to install
5,amazing product
5,64GB Ram never looked so good. It looks great temps are great and no issues with cable management. Cost is perfect in this range.I had some trouble setting the RGB up with my Asus ROG Strix MITX motherboard and this came down to an issue syncing Corsair CUE with Armory ASUS’s new lighting solution. It’d be awesome if Corsair could look into that because it was not an easy googlable fix.I’ve relied on Corsair Vengeance for my last build which is still running eight years strong and I’ll rely on them here too for my new more powerful one. Great work.
5,These are super great memory cards for PC! And they light up for those who want that. Great for all applications and gaming. Just make sure you get the right size etc. that support your motherboard.
5,
5,Previously I've had 2 4GB stick for around $75 that wasn't really able to handle my games. I wasn't able to play many games because I needed more memory for them to run smoother and I search for a few weeks and found these. The price is a little more than I was hoping to spend however I'm so happy with this purchase. I 100% recommend this for anyone that wants a little boost to there games! If your looking into streaming and gaming 32GB would be great I tested it on high settings and still have 10GB left over on high setting and runs so much smoother now.  It's the sweet spot! The best and cheapest upgrade I've made for a lot more performance! Also they look amazing in the PC!
5,
5,I am using this in my new Ryzen 7 / ASUS ROG Strix X570-E motherboard.  I had to manually set the BIOS of the motherboard to use the DOCP memory profile to get it to run at full 3600 Mhz speed because it was running at a much slower speed before I did.  It has been flawless since then.  Works great and got it at a great price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m in love with these sticks of ram! They look so amazing and really add to my build. My one issue with them is the rgb for $250 I’d expect to have more customizability but you don’t. You can address each individual led but the color is static their slow to change when I change profiles but that could be because of the bottleneck they put on my gpu and cpu. Other than that they’re really good. Also my cpu only supports 64gigs up to 2666mghz witch is annoying but it’s not the end of the world.
5,Corsair packed product without RAM - Amazon replaced the it with RAM. Can happen. Appreciate quick replacement. Thank you Amazon.
1,I like these Dimms I really do.They are prettyThe Lights work well.And like most Dimms are easy to install.but (sigh) I had one bad stick from a pack of 2 (2X8GB) which started causing game crashes.I checked both sticks individually in different slots. One was brilliantly bad the other had no errors at all. Yay one to get me by.So I reached out to Amazon and customer service was great. They worked something out with me so that I could get 2 new ones which arrived next day.Well after putting those in (yes I turned off power and made sure everything was unplugged and done properly) the computer blue screened right away booting up it even froze on post! I didn't panic I took a deep breath and super nerd powers activated.I could barely get it to go to windows before it BSOD again over and over. Why can't they just make it a green screen? Or a Pink one? ugh blue screen of death just looks so bad on bootup.Onto testing.I ran MemTest and it was so bad it froze the tests. I ran them individually and first failed in the most amazing time 7 minutes. Saved a lot of time there I'm glad I didn't have to focus on that one to much.Second one took about a half hour before hitting 10000 errors. (thats still very bad)Fortunate for me Memtest ended the tests early because of how quickly they were failing so I didn't have to waste to much time on it but.....So now I'm stuck with 4 dimms and only 1 of them is working properly.So sorry Corsair you've been my go to RAM choice for a long time but I'm considering a different brand this time.Not sure why these Dimms decided to fail so brilliantly but 3 out of 4 isn't good.Hopefully this big fail photo helps someone make a decision on this product maybe the RGB one isn't that good. I've had a good time with Corsair before just not this time.
5,works great when you first install the ram it’s at the completely wrong speed But once you go into the bios and enable XMP it fixes all the ram speed to spec after I did that the product is great works amazing
5,Ok
4,I don't know if this is an issue with the ram or possibly the CPU and motherboard I'm pairing it with. I'm currently running a Ryzen 5 5600X on an Asrock Phantom gaming 4s mobo and can only clock my ram speeds up to 3200mhz without my computer crashing and removing any ram overclock I had previously applied.EDIT: After some BIOS tweaking I was able to successfully run it at 3600mhz.
5,So far so good
5,
5,Solid performance upgrade and easy to install.
2,I purchased 4 of these 2x16s and 1 pair lasted a month before becoming unusable then the other pair 5 months later and corsair has made the warranty program impossible to get my money back without jumping through hoops. Great for the price if they work just make sure you have a definite extendes warranty or return policy in case
5,This review is for: CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB PRO 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz C16 LED Desktop Memory - WhiteWorks great in my Mini-ITX case.  I have them on an asus rog strix z390-i gaming motherboard and they work perfectly within no issues on a brand new build.  Also - after numerous patches - they just started working on the Aura screen creation panel.  (now within the Asus Armoury Crate software package).  Initially the software could not find it but after numerous BIOS patches and a bit of magic (they just showed up on the detection panel a week after the build was done) they work flawlessly with any light pattern I have setup.  I cannot take credit for it showing up... so magic it is..!
5,Love it rgb can be changed and looks pretty good
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Combina muy Bien con mi case Corsair sin problemas para el realizar oc
5,RAM is often overlooked at being the root cause of a slow PC but it's honestly one of the easiest things to upgrade and gain performance from. Great RGB colors plenty of customizations with iCue software works fine out of the box paired with MSI X570 motherboard + Ryzen 5 3600 enabled XMP in the bios & this thing flies @ full speed.Temps are around 39 degrees on normal usage. Overall a great memory kit for the price performs well out of the box easily pumped to max speed by just enabling XMP profile in your MB bios & a beautiful looking kit. The colors duke...the colors.
3,They are pretty when powered up unfortunately not sure if they were the cause of my computer issues but I'm planning to rebuy when Mobo/ processor refund is fixed.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 working great without any problems. I love it.
5,It’s pretty good ram especially if you’ll be lucky enough to get it with Samsung b-die it’s easier to overclock the ram. I manage to oc it from 3200mhz 16-18-18-36 to 3600mhz 18-19-19-39 running stable. Not the best ram to oc but good enough for the price.Also you might have problems with led color bleeding when you set it to white color (example on my 2nd screenshot) you’ll gonna have to tweak red and green colors a little bit yourself (example on screenshot #3) for every stick.
2,I bought 4 sticks of ram. 1 is causing my computer to crash had to take it somewhere to get it looked at. It’s going to take a couple of days to get my ram replaced. Corsair won’t refund anything bought on Amazon. They even suggested that if I need ram sooner to just buy another kit off Amazon  and when I get my new ram to return it within the 30 days back to Amazon? What kind of a business model is that? Also the 150$ it cost me to find out it was their ram I don’t think they will reimburse me for. Don’t know that I will buy Corsair again. It looks great but wtf is up with customer service these days?
5,Actually bought these a couple of years ago for my sons gaming computer. But just now doing a review. They were great! Never had an issue with them. Will definitely buy again. Would definitely recommend.
3,There is not much I can say for the memory itself it's well built and crushes the competition. As for the software that is a different story. I have an ASUS current motherboard and the Corsair iCue software requires that I have ASUS Aura installed so it can control Aura RGB lighting. Well if you want everything to work well together then you better have all RGB hardware baring the Corsair name. If you don't then good luck my friend because you are in for annoyances and difficult to find solutions. First noticeable annoyance is a hardware disconnect sound every time the iCue software starts. Secondly you will not want iCue to control Asus Aura devices if you have other name brand products in your system (Like a Coolermaster AIO cooler). Other name brand RGB product's lighting can freeze up especially if they use a 5V addressable headers on the motherboard. In the end I could not get rid of the Disconnect sound but I was able to disconnect iCue software from controlling ASUS Aura devices by deleting the ASUS plugin from the Corsair Plugins folder. If they fix their software and give clear easy instructions that are easily accessible and easy to read then I will gladly give a 5 star rating.
5,with this much memory i finally wont need to upgrade for many years.......came super fast installed easy everything worked easy as any stick i have ever used.....simple.  very colorful as well blends right in with the rest of mobo colors and fans keyboard mouse......all in all an excellent long overdue upgrade.......now if only i could locate an nvidia 3080 card......life would be grand.  Dont hesitate if you need memory and can afford this bundle.....you wont be sorry.  Not even once.  Bring on the virtual world!!
5,Unstable when initializing first to be able to get it to 3600 mhz but eventually did get it to 3200 with asrock motherboard steel pro legend still a pretty good decent amount of speed and fast for what the speed of ram I did get it at for ddr4 memory although a bit on the expensive side still not too much more than an average ssd
5,FIRE BRO
5,Six years ago I built an X-99 Haswell-E box using the 2400MHx non-RGB versions of this DDR4 RAM.  Super reliable the whole time earning more than it's cost in freelance work and I expect to keep it in service for a few years more at least..The 3600MHx 4x32GB RGB version of this RAM now inhabits my new Threadripper auxiliary workstation and just passed 2  full Memtest86+ cycles.  Nobody's perfect in the RAM biz but there's a reason why Corsair is a perennial denizen of motherboard OVL compatibility lists.
5,The iCUE software allows you to configure the color of the led based on the detected sensors.  In the picture from left to right:  cup/radeon card/ Ram Temp/ Z490 sensor #1.  I think that is super cool.  128g ram is sweet too.Now the developer stuff.  I don't need a cloud provider to practice my  job...how long does it take to spend 2k in the cloud arena....now I'm just paying for electricity.Motherboard: Z490  Aorus Master (XMP enabled) 128g 10850k.
2,I purchased 4x8Gb 3200 thinking they would run 3200 out of the box but they do not.  You have to overclock them like using the XMP1 to get 3200 out of them and then my system will sometimes not boot.  So it is not very stable at the advertised 3200 speed.  CPU-Z says it is DDR-2132 memory even though I bought 3200 memory.  I don't know if this is normal or not but I do have to run either XMP1 or XMP2 to get the 3200 speed I can also just over clock the memory to 3200 to get the advertised speed but you will not get it out of the box and in my case running it at 3200 makes it unstable on boot.  I have not had any problems after boot running it at 3200 but it will not always boot.I am going to try and replace it with the 3600 and see if that helps.However I must say the memory itself is beautiful with the RGB lighting and that is why I am trying the 3600 and returning the 3200 because I absolutely love the looks of the memory.  I just wish I had know it has to be overclocked to get the advertised speed.  Maybe I just don't know how 3200 memory works but it should tell you in description that you must over clock to get the advertised speeds.
2,What can I say?  I have unable to reach the advertised 3600 no matter what setting I do with the Bios.  It says it can make the 3600 speed according to XMP but it lies.  It only reaches 3200 at best and that is not even true when I run CPU-Z where it clearly shows its only running at 1066 Mhz.I am using the ROG STRIX Z370F Gaming MoBo and I updated the bios thinking that was the problem.I will have a better idea if this works and will update my rate when my new MoBo Vid Card and other things make it here.  Then I will try that same RAM in the new build and see if it can reach advertised speed.
4,This ram is amazing but I gave it 4 stars because this is not for the enthusiast. What I mean by that is that you cannot overclock this ram and other things. Great ram but if you are an enthusiast I would go for some crucial ballistix ram.
4,I'm using these with the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X on an ASUS ROG STRIX TRX40-XE board at the full XMP speeds DDR4 3600. Unfortunately the first kit I received was defective and memtest was throwing errors no matter what tweaks were made. Replacement kit is much better no errors at all - only thing I needed to do was enable the XMP profile and adjust SOC voltage to 1.05v.The RGB lighting is fully controllable through Corsair iCUE software so there's that too. Latency on these is a tad high but I guess that's the trade-off for 32 GB sticks.
5,beautiful color and brightness.Great gaming performanceI do have docp set to an OC of 4200 running 4x8(32g). no ram issues everI play and use a lot of ram hungry games and programs and have no issues.Icue integration is great. i did have to change a few settings so it didn't bug out when Asus Armoury crate was controlling my case and mobo lights.Once I figured that out. it's  been smooth sailing.
5,Best ram I’ve used to date. Can’t wait to get my hands on the ddr5 edition of these.
4,High quality! Speed as advertised. (Enable In bios)My only complaint is that the LEDs show some hue when going to an all white setting in ICUE especially when compared to other potential rgb elements in your build.
5,These are so amazing I love them so much! They're quite expensive but worth the money.
5,Son bellísimas sobretodo si posees un PC mayoritariamente de colores blanco y negro. Muy recomendadas.
5,DIseño a simple vista muy agradable
5,Fast for gaming. Love the lights
5,Beautiful ram. The white sticks fit perfect in my build. And icue is by far the best rgb software I have used. Very impressive control of Corsair products and beyond.I haven’t had any stability issues. I run 2 sticks of 16 at 2600 and 2 at 3200. So 48 down clocked to 2600. Butter with a i9 9900 k.Would buy for any build utilizing argb tech
5,Great ram and decent RGB granted you didn't get an inconsistent batch.These sticks are standard not really meant for overclocking as they've already been configured.Beware:The drivers this ram uses for RGB has a very slow refresh rate and isn't compatible with fast RGB syncing.If you intend on syncing other peripherals I suggest keeping the motion to a minimal or it may appear sluggish.
5,Me animé a comprar estas memorias porque me parecen de las más lindas que hay y combinan perfecto con el build white & black que buscaba. Al tocarlas notas el material premium instalarlas es súper fácil y el RGB es sencillamente bello. Lo instale en una placa Aorus B450 pro wifi y hasta ahora no ha habido problemas de compatibilidad por más que no encontré este modelo en la lista QVL de dicha motherboard. Por default viene en 2133 mhz pero con sólo entrar en la BIOS con un par de clicks reconoce su velocidad real de 3200 mhz.Como detalle traten de usar el software de Corsair para controlar el RGB. El software de Gigabyte el RGB Fusion limita mucho los efectos. En general hasta el momento muy satisfecho con estas memorias.
5,They look amazing and you just know when you open up the box it's 100 percent pure quality. This is my second pc build and both have corsair ram. I have no problems out of either one.
5,great ram provides awsome RGB
5,I happened to have two kits of this ver 4.41 and ver 5.49Figured it might be helpful to post the IC information here as Corsair ver designations for 16Gbit dies are not well-known yet.
5,Cool RGB and they run at advertised speeds.
5,La luminosidad del RGB es la mejor del sector si te interesa el RGB esta es tu memoria RAM ni lo dudes.En cuanto a llevarla a 3200mhz no fue facil ya que el perfil XMP no es compatible con ryzen 5 3600 por lo que tuve que hacerlo a mano buscando en google informacion.Si bien quedaron estables en 3200 una vez por semana me da pantalla azul de la muerte pero nada grave.
5,I've tried overclocking other RAM modules but these Corsairs worked like a charm. I'm pairing this with an AMD Ryzen 3950x and unfortunately the G.Skill Trident Z (4x16) configuration ran into problems and didn't allow a full overclock. Also the RGB of the G.Skill would always go out of sync with eachother. The RGB on these Corsairs always stay in sync and I like their effects. I would highly recommend these!
5,
5,Purchased the 2x8 (16g) 3600mhz to see if this was a good option and it was.This pro version is smaller which can give you more cooling options for the top if you have a smaller case.I really like the RGB and the white coloring along with the triangle design that goes with my 5000d airflow case.
5,I bought these for my new gaming rig because the other ones I ordered were too bulky to fit (interfered with the CPU Liquid Cooling lines).  These popped right in and worked with zero issues.  I've done some stress tests and I wasn't expecting anything to fail but these DIMMs work really well.  I highly recommend them!
3,Unfortunately even though the motherboard said the ram was compatible it wasn't had to return and get something else.
4,A bit taller than other DDR 4 customized where one of the cpu fans sat in my Be Quiet case to accommodate them.Had to buy this twice the first set had a dead stick of RAM.  2nd set worked within 5 minutes.  Returned first set for refund.As long as xmp is on in bios they should work out of the box.  Perfect for multi monitor video editing.
5,They run great and I love that with the download of the corsair program you can set them up in a lot of different ways.  It is kind of weird that even when I put my computer to sleep that they are still lit up but since my system isn't having any heating issues then I love them.
5,Easy to install. iCue software is easy to control colors and free. 32gb total shown here. Didn't think I needed that much RAM but when playing COD the system uses around 17gb. Looks cool and would recommend.
5,Great RAM I have a previous version of this ram that is a few cm bigger than this one. This one is SLI=Slim so it is smaller and takes up way less space on the motherboard.The bigger version seems to be sold out and more expensive on other websites.Atta he'd is an image of the SLI ram and the previous version. It might be hard to tell but it is smaller
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These are beautiful and easy to control down to the individual led with corsair's iCue software.  I'm having difficulty getting them to work with ASUS Armory Crate but I'm glad to have these and will hopefully fill out my dimms eventually... not that I really need to with the capacity of this pair!!
3,Customer supports was easy to use and with ease of stress was able to get a replacement and fix my computer
4,got these for my bf on his new build very cute aesthetically and do what they need to do.
5,I have never had an issue with Corsair ram. I use it in my more important builds. This is not the best ram for gaming but Corsair does make faster kits with lower latencies. If your into RGB this kit looks nice.
5,Value for the money
5,Came in on time exactly what I ordered got me up and running on warzone
5,The first thing I did once installed was turn of all the RGB feature.  Other than that the RAM has been excellent.  Video Editing now has a ton of headroom for rendering in RAM.  My DAW work has also improved as all of my virtual instruments load into RAM.  128GB felt like overkill for me as I purchased but between editing 6K footage and composing songs with a lot of instruments these have turned out to be perfect!
4,Could not get these to clock over 3400 and be stable.
5,Great for my new build
5,I bought this RAM to upgrade from DDR3. It’s obviously MUCH faster and also looks so much better in my new build! Super easy to install and the ICUE interface makes all changes to the RGB incredibly easy. The price is high but it’s for a great brand with too many pros to be upset over.
5,Love this RAM set the white looks so good and the RGB is super bright following in line with the rest of Corsair's RGB products iCue is a little difficult to deal with if it's your first time. Just a little learning curve. At the end of the day I highly recommend these
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Llevo 7 meses usando estas memorias y todo perfecto el rgb es hermoso y le da mucho estilo a mi setup volvería a comprar sin duda.
5,
5,
4,Was pretty but the price went way up so had to change brands for the sec pair saved me 60$
5,I bought these because the ones I wanted were out of stock but boy was I pleasantly surprised. They turned out to be the centerpiece of my computer build. Lots of nice custom colors and patterns too. Just make sure you install the latest iCue software to get all the features.
4,I used this for my first PC gaming build i had no problems the RGB is customizable. A really good pair if ram.
5,Corsair is one of the most reputable pc part manufacturers for a good reason. These parts are very good has excellent build quality feel to it rgb looks amazing in any color the “white” ram sticks match my white pc case perfectly. 16gb 3200 MHz pairs perfectly with my rtx 3080 and i7 10700k. Don’t cheap out on your pc parts. You will thank yourself later.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was cheaper than others and came faster than scheduled. Plug and play baby. Purely for ascetic purposes the RGB is awesome an the Corsair Icue app is so simple! And they have a whole youtube channel of help videos!!
5,Love the Corsair ram there are cheeper options but for the RGB it’s the best now Corsair if you see this go back o the 3.0 on the ICUE app we all don’t like the 4.0 very much
3,RGB white is a warmer than most Corsair RGBs.  I have the iCUE H150i 7x iCUE QL120 fans even my LIAN LI RGB STRIMER cables and LIAN LI O11 Dynamic XL RGB light match the same white color.  It's like comparing an incandescent bulb to a cool white LED bulb.It's hard to show in a photo but IRL it's super noticeable.
5,It's only 3200cl16 not the fastest. I got Micron rev.b die on my kit but ymmv. I ran memtest86 overnight with the whole 32gb kit and it passed 0 errors. If you are upgrading an existing pc that has iCue since this model is so new it wont show up unless you update it.
5,Not much to say other than I love them! They look super nice were easy to install and the ICUE software works great with them. So many colors and so many effects to choose from! To get them working at the correct speed you have to change it in your bios but other than that they are great!
5,great ram for gaming and for looks. it works perfectly fine am able to have 1 game open spotify 3-4 tabs on chrome and other applications with no fps problems (i have a 1660 with ryzen 5 2600 btw )rgb looks nice and is easy to customize with the Corsair Icue Softwareit also has great performance would recommend
5,love them went nice with mt build
5,Awesome for all white build
5,does the job
5,The RGB on the ram is clean easy to customize with ICUE and passed all the quality control test.
5,2 and a half years ago I hated iCue now it's tolerable. I wish it was compatible with my Gigabyte motherboard as claimed to be but oh well. The LEDs can get really bright and XMP is working fine according to my BIOS. I mainly bought these because they're white and G.Skill Neos weren't in stock on my purchase date.
2,At first I thought it was a bad sticker it came looseBut I saw that the metal bit of the ram plug has been inserted it should be the 2nd hand the old one is sold as a new one
5,I got this for my latest PC build which is mostly made up of Corsair items so this matched up perfect for the color and RGB look I was wanting. It was a great price installed quickly and seems to perform very well. I’ll definitely add another set.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Yes this kit of ram is stupid expensive for what your getting... but its 3600mhz of 128gb ram... so far I've notice 2 things. One.. 128gb is alot of ram and secondly games seem to use less of it the more you use. But anyway this kit is pretty dang cool. It works with ICUE to sync the colors of your whole system!
5,Calidad es lo que ofrece corsair
5,These modules are 53mm high. That severely limits which heatsink/CPU air coolers will fit next to/over them depending on how far outward the heatsink pipes spread before curving upward.Aside from that they work with perfectly as advertised and iCUE customization is fun to play around with.
5,
5,Love these new low profile sticks from Corsair finally I can have the best ram and mount an aio on top while using them. Very fastGood quality and the lighting software is top notch.
4,Buen producto 👌
5,Works great. Got the 2x32gb. Read review thinking it would be Hynix but I did not get Hynix I got B-Die? On my 3900x I was able to get 3600mhz at cl16 stable. 64gb at 3600mh sounds pretty good to me! Now I can finally have 3 chrome tabs open.The RGB is pretty good bright and shiny. Wish the white variant was easier to get though...Running on a 3900x/Strix B450 I board and a 2080ti.
5,Works perfectly. The RGB lighting is nice but still looking to see if I can sync with fanetc. lighting so they aren't independently doing their own thing. A little pricey but you get what you pay for and I've never had a problem with Vengeance Corsair RAM.
5,This ram is great for the IBUYPOWER Mini computer!!!!!!!! Plus many more that can take the 32GB power.the colors are jjust  beautiful and once the software is installed from Corsair youll see what i mean. The a mount is aliitle high but well worth the power. BUY IT!
5,I do video production work that runs my computer to its max and I also game and since I got these RAM sticks my computer stopped glitching and crashing. Great but wish they were alittle cheaper
5,Great product! Easy to install and looks super cool in my pc! It was a good upgrade from my 8gb ram
5,so fast wonderful
5,This ram is great. Looks awesome in my mid tower. Some people had complaints about dim rgb lights. This was not the case for me. They are bright and easy to control with the icue software. Would recommend for anyone looking for more rgb.
5,My build needs to last me for 8-10 years each time so I'm hoping a REALLY FUTURE PROOFED this build with this much RAMM in regards to 128GB and PRICE.  Wife about lost it when she saw how expensive it is.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Llegaron súper rápido y la instalación muy fácil!
5,Let’s be real at this price point you’re paying for the RGB customization and white accents. And let me just say it’s entirely worth it.
3,iCue is required to customize the RGB but it can also be used to take over just about everything. It's invasive can take up over 1gb and secretly installs 5-7 programs that consume resources and can noticeably affect performance on budget rigs. All I wanted was to change the damn RGB lights I didn't know buying this RAM was gonna subject me to unwanted monitoring and marketing by Corsair. These modules are also high profile which aren't compatible with a number of popular aftermarket CPU coolers which sucked to learn after the fact. I'm returning these sticks right now RGB is overpriced and not worth the nonsense for just RAM. Also done with Corsair they're too greedy and have disappointed me for the last time.
3,Bought my first kit of these a few months ago from Microcenter. Installed and booted up but ran into system stability issues and constant bluescreens a classic sign of bad RAM. Bought a second kit off of Amazon (because that was going to be faster than making another long trip to Microcenter) installed it and it worked great.Enter present day. I decided to take my system up from 16GB to 32GB RAM (thanks Flight Simulator). Ordered another kit off amazon and eagerly awaited its arrival. Got it installed fired it up and boom system stability issues and constant bluescreens. With the first faulty set I thought "that's fine sometimes it happens" but now here I am at 2 of the 3 of the kits I've purchased being faulty and it's no longer a minor excusable thing.
5,Corsair CUE works with the RGB and lets you change it to match your system. If you have a white build are an RGB fiend or already have Corsair CUE for your keyboard or fans or anything just grab this. The RAM speed is as advertised and they've never given me any issues. Just make sure your mobo sets the ram speed correctly. I had to manually set it on my Gigabyte mobo. Just go ahead and toss me a "helpful." tyty
5,These are absolutely gorgeous! I'm so glad I got them! Can't go wrong with DDR4-3600! And these fit the look I was going for!Make sure to set them to 3600 in your bios because they don't automatically come that way!Other than that pretty easy install fast ram with good quality!
2,They work they do what they're supposed to but I was running these sticks (2x8GB) for a little over a year and then one of them died on me. Going through Corsair support for a replacement and will update review afterwards. This is the 2nd set of Corsair RAM I've rain into issues with.
5,These are out of stock now and I feel evil bought them for 90 bucks which is awesome and I see people selling them for 200 now so that’s cool they work as advertised just make sure your motherboard can support them did have some issues with Ique but they work just fine.
5,Beautiful and Fast!!! 16gb at a great price! All worked fine! Highly recommend it if you love some rgb in your life! I have all my LED lights from corsair using icue is very easy and control everything from a single app have profiles stored in the keyboard for easy change or to turn off when going to sleep.
3,Mine don't have any issues performance wise But half the time I turn on my PC ICue doesn't recognize one of the Dimms and that causes the lighting to go out of sync.
5,These were a fairly easy install. Getting them working correctly was different as it was my first actual build and hadnt messed with PC's in over a decade. So it was great!
5,Got a pair of these to go with my Ryzen 2700x hoping they would be b-die but they weren’t. I got a pair of Hynix CJR.I went into my BIOS and chose XMP Profile 2 for 3200MHz at rated timings and it worked flawlessly. They are 100% stable. I even got them to boot at 3466MHz but they weren’t stable enough I’m assuming with a little bit of tinkering with the timings and it could work but I’m happy with 3200MHz.The RGB lighting and control was better than I thought it would be but you need Corsair’s iCue software running in the background to keep the RGB lit up.
5,Funciona de manera excepcional.
4,My ram is only running at 2133mhz. I expected it to run slower but i didn’t expect it to be THAT slow i tried overclocking it but anything over 2133 would crash. Rgb looks great and I’ve never had any issues just can’t get it to run faster.Ryzen 5 3600Asus rog b-450f gamingRx5700 XT
5,Muy buena calidad puedes notar la diferencia en tu pc tan pronto la enciendes los reviews que lei hablaban mal de los rgb y les digo que están buenos brillantes y con una calidad de color bien intensa en las fotos se veían los colores como aguados pero no es así muy buen producto.
5,Easy to use interface for configuring the color schemes integrates well with the other corsair iCue peripherals runs like a dream colors are nice makes your PC 10000x faster because you know RGB...
5,If you didn’t know the big difference and the other vengeance ram is the height. Allowing a little more flexibility when choosing a cooler for your cpu. Was easy to install. Looks great! No problems so far!
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Beautiful RGB effects and very functional memory as well. I have a mainly Corsair set up using their Crystal white case and LL120 Fans so these RGB RAM fit right in nicely with the them in my case. Very happy with them and caught them on sale for 84 bonus!
3,The DDR4 3200 RGB Pro 16gb I could not get it to run at 3200 I also have DDR4 3200 Lpx 16gb which runs flawlessly at 3200. I tried different timings maybe if i ran it without the Lpx in the pc it would work but that would kind of defeat the purpose of adding memory. I am able to get it to run at 2933. My son also has corsair vengeance RGB pro ddr4 3200 only in his pc and also can not get it to run at 3200 either. Shouldn't have to struggle to get it to the listed speed it should hit that and anything above would be bonus. Yes my bios and drivers up to date.
5,Great RAM super fast. Remember to go into your BIOS and change the RAM speed to 3600 because it defaults to 2133!
5,It was easy to plug in but my computer was dialed in for my 2 16 gb sticks and it wouldn't even turn on with this ram plugged in until I went into the boot up and had it read any type of ram because of the sequence.
5,The RGB lighting on this RAM is beautiful and the iCUE software is easy to use. I'm running this on an ASrock x470 Fatal1ty and unfortunately I'm not able to get it to run at 3200MHz at 1.39 volts. The highest I'm able to run it at is 2933MHz @ 1.35. I'm not blaming the RAM for this though. It's more than likely my motherboard which isn't the best overclocker according to reviews and the RAM wasn't on the QVL. I still bought this RAM knowing this so I'm not disappointed. Just be sure to check your motherboard's QVL if you want to run it at it's rated speeds.
5,Works great and looks great. Make sure to check with Corsair's memory configurator and your motherboard manufacturer for compatibility.
5,I bought the x2 16gb for my wife and I when we were building our gaming computers. They're excellent. The software for the lighting is easy to use and colorful. The performance is excellent and Corsair has good support. Will be buying future generations for further builds.
5,Looks good and functions as it should. I run a green theme on my rig and it's definitely flows.
5,en una sola palabra espacial
5,Great product but way over priced your paying almost double just for the rgb heatsink so unless you just want to be able to use corsair icue for the rgb its a waste of money just as good products if not better for cheaper
5,The price tag for this item was a bit high but still understandable considering the shortage of microchipsThey were super easy to install and have been working flawlessly since.
5,Works fine however I needed to manually set the advertised ram speed not a huge issue but for first time builders you will not get what you’re paying for if you don’t manually clock to the advertised ram speed.Other than that. Rgb is nice I haven’t tried to change it with software yet will update after that.
5,Love this RAM the RGB is a nice effect.
5,Easy to install and the RGB is amazing
5,x570 MSI MEG ACE board. Was running bios 18 and it wouldn’t do 3600mhz. Upgraded bios to 19 worked perfectly. 128gb for a Ryzen 12c workstation is amazing. Rendering in AE reconfigured for it mind blowingly fast. I do use a 3rd party script BGRENDER MAX but this ram makes it possible.
5,Works great in my rig with all my other components Corsair its easy to change the RGB through one app. Great product
5,Used these on my build and so far they have been pretty good. Satisfied for sure!
5,perfect!! super easy to install and its just enough for my games. ill probably buy another set in the future as well. also the color customization is incredible and each one shows up so well.
5,lights are annoying at night but other than that no issues
4,Great product runs hot tho.Performance is what you can expect high quality product but the LEDs or something add extra heat.Makes internal pc get full of hot air pretty quickly
5,Works grate in my PC build.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like how the rainbow effect is smooth when transitioning. Would have to find a software to be able to customize the color.
3,Easy and quick to install and works perfectly with my Ryzen 5 3600 on my Asus Tuf Gaming Plus (WiFi) motherboard.It gets 3 stars for false marketing by them saying the rams argb will work with Asus Aura and it does NOT. After looking into this I found out that it works with the non-pro version of the ram sticks not the pro version which was only meant for iCue and I have the pro version. Now I’ll be working on 2 different softwares to get the colors to sync as closely as possible.
5,It’s been a year since I got these and I can say that I do not regret spending those extra 20 bucks for the rgb. Corsair is knows for having the best rgb out of all the companies and this ram is no exception. As for the speeds it works just as expected.
5,Awesome
5,I only used these for a little bit traded them for 32 gb of ram to my friend who wanted white ram. So I just got an upgrade but for the sholrt time I had them. they were good.
5,I really would like to have components that don't use RGB. Yet it seems that most people spend time watching how their components pulsate breathe and so on than using them for what they are designed: working playing...
5,Solid as a rock works great with my ryzen  7-3700x. Smooth and absolutly great rgb look in the case. i Love it. Great satisfied customer.  Eventually i will get more of this ram. Its very nice to look at. no regrets.
5,Beautiful RGB paired with B40M PRO4- F and 1600 AF.Having issues getting 3200MHzUpdate: B450 PRO4-F does not support the 1600 AF!!!! Bios update required and if you don’t have an older CPU you cannot update the bios. The B450 PRO4-F will not function properly!Conclusion: This RAM 5 stars!
5,M fallo la memoria la teste reuní evidencia la envié directamente a corsair y m enviaron una nueva muy bueno de parte de corsair ( en cambio Amazon se desentendió  ni pasó una semana y m dijo ve tú con la marca no tenemos nada que ver)
5,Ram is great! No Need to buy anything faster because you can truly utilize the speeds in most applications. Just make sure when you install it that you go back into your computer BIOS and set the speeds properly. Makes a massive difference!Also it is beautiful. Never seen white RGB ram so it was an obvious choice and Corsair is good stuff.
5,read the title.
5,I am not on the RGB bandwagon. But these after install are a work of art. I had the ram up to 4k mhz with 1.45 volts but have since backed it down to stock 3600 at 1.34 volts. Makes my computer a very enjoyable experience.
5,i went with a full rgb build (ram fans cpu cooler & led strips) i am finding that when i play around with the corsair icue that i have multiple presets that im pretty much dimming every other led except for the led on these. they just look SO good. if i build another pc i would absolutely be ok with having no RGB anywhere except for on these ram sticks. they seriously are my favorite part of my build. i cant wait to add another 2 just for the cosmetic value
5,They really are great one of my best investments.  Special for editing programs and games.  The perfect aesthetic.Realmente son buenísimas una de mis mejores inversiones . Especial para programas de edición y juegos . La estética perfecta.
5,Does the job amazingly and looks great while doing so! The lighting options are exceptional and you can even change the colors by singular led!
5,I did not install it and I dont understand tech stuff enough to say anything about its performance but the programmable rgb sure is pretty!
5,As advertised.
5,Corsair of course it's good stuff. BE AWARE. Like one other person said the PRO version of this memory is NOT compatible with Asus Aura Sync.  The other link provided in the questions/answers is linking you to the information for the non pro version which IS compatible.All that said this stuff still looks great just using a setting through corsairs own iCUE software that matches your asus rgb. I personally use "rain" on corsair and "breathing" on asus aura sync and it all looks rocking.
1,I ordered 2 kits of 16gb 3200. First set would not run at 3200 at all. Pulled one kit out of PC and tested the kits individually. Would boot at 3200 but would not open any games without them crashing almost immediately. Sent those kits back and had Amazon send me two new ones. These kits lasted together for about 30 minutes with no issues at XMP settings.  Stress tested on prime95 large ffts( or whichever one tested the RAM) and it went for 15 minutes with no errors. Then played Star Wars BF2 for another 15 minutes perfectly fine. Then out of nowhere blue screen Computer rebooted and as soon as I signed in blue screen rebooted again and as soon as login screen loaded blue screen again.  Then windows went into recovery mode. So I pulled out the ram and put my older corsair vengeance kit in that runs at 3600MHZ and no issues I also have another vengeance kit in another computer at 3200 that is the same specs as these white rgb ones and it runs perfect at XMP. Both kits also run perfectly fine together in the same computer at 3200mhz CL16 so I know my motherboard and cpu can handle 4 sticks 32GB total at 3200mhz no problem. So I do not know what corsair is doing to pass these kits off as "3200mhz" but clearly they are no longer capable of actually running at those speeds with whatever batch I ended up getting. Shows that corsair doesn't actually test the ram for long enough. Sending these ones back for a refund and ordering a g skill kit to try that out.
4,look great the only problem is my motherboard wont got up past 3000mrhz so its basiclly stuck there which is fine
5,I don't know how to tell the difference between speed and timing between normal memory and faster memory while using Word web browsing playing video games or watching YouTube videos. I like the RGB and the flat black look for my all black build.
5,I only had to reset my BIOS to make these dimms work. Bought them when it was on sale and the shipment was quick only took a week to arrive. So far it works as advertised.
5,great quality but does not fit with noctua nh-d15s on atx motherboard and corsair 570x case. better of going with the low profile none rgb.
5,Works as intended. Sucks that the RGB doesn't sync with MSI Dragon Center but that's more of Dragon Center's fault than these RAM sticks.
5,Excelente ram quiero comprarme otro par para los 32. Son bonitas buen software y rápidas.
5,These are absolutely great. With a persistant Ramdisk I can install Firefox on on the Ram drive and browing and streaming are incredibly fast! I love it. My core I7 is now running 72GB with the stock 8 GB work along with these!
5,For anyone curious mine were Micron B-Die and had no problem running at C16 on an X570 Crosshair VIII Hero using voltage and everything else at D.O.C.P.. Had 4 sticks plugged in.Pricy but better than expected!
5,Got this a few months ago when I started building my gaming PC After my other set of ram wasnt doing as good as I thought.  Ever since then Ive seen a noticeable improvement in my PC.
5,Works as it should.. looks AMAZING. Easy to install.. and the software to control RGB is easy to use. Overall a great experience.Bought another 2x8gb 3200MHz for my set up. Updated last picture.
5,good quality works great no issues. lights look great good for gaming.
5,Best white sticks of ram I can find that won't break the bank works extremely well and looks amazing
3,It crashes when I try to load it at the advertised clock speed need to run it 300mhz slower. Not amused
5,Typical excellent performance and stability. Nice RGB effects Good value.
1,I was sent a small white plastic bag with what looked like a small piece of wound wire or rope inside.  No memory sticks to be found. The small plastic bag did have a label that said it was the 64gb RGB memory but the bag was far too small for it to ever fit in.I know i will get a refund but what the hell amazon?  where is the quality control here.
5,Easy to install. Run great for gaming
5,I recommend it although make sure you enable XMP in your BIOS settings to fully utilize the 3200 MHz.
5,These are so pretty and work as intended!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Looks amazing and works fantastic nothing better for the price guaranteed!
5,The RGB is stunning as expected from Corsair. Using their iCUE software you can have a wide array of colors and apply various effects to them.As for the technical side they perform exactly as they should and are quite easy to install. If you're looking for flashy white RAM sticks then I highly recommend these.
5,not much to say. corsair's ram is in my opinion the best out there and the rgb is delicious.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,If you have all iCUE RGB it will all look amazing and this just adds to it
5,Works as advertised
5,These saved my computer from lagging and the white is beautiful in my pc
5,Looks great runs great had no problem. Works well with iCUE just remember to enable software control so that you can get the RGB color changes faster.
5,I love Corsair and these memory cards are amazing! They look great in my computer love the color and the memory is amazing. Recommend for newbies and veterans who build computers!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Its Ram! In my latest build with:-Win 10 Pro-Ryzen 9 3900X-Asus Crosshair VIII Hero Mobo-Half Dozen HHD/SSD/NVMEOh Rgb too!
5,it is by far the best ram i ever buyed works great with all m corsair hardware and periphericals  with icue? i love this!
3,Bought two 2x8GB 3200Mhz C16 RGB Pro sticks two weeks apart.  Prior to this I was running Corsair LPX Vengeance 3200Mhz C16 NON RGB just fine at 3200Mhz timings.The first batch of RGB Pro was great I was able to get advertised 3200Mhz. Ran this for two weeks and no stability problems. However on the second batch of sticks I got BSODs and a very unstable system at 3200Mhz timings. After trying many different 3200Mhz timings I just could not get it to work.  I wasn't about to waste my time switching and removing modules and going through all that hassle along with MemTest86.What did work was going down to 2933Mhz timings 14-16-16-16-34. This on first gen Ryzen 1700X and X370 MSI Titanium motherboard with latest 5/19 BIOS.
5,I am writing this review just to let everyone know that they don't turn off when pc sleeps but if you hibernate the PC.. they do turn off and come back on when you wake up the PC..
5,Works really well Great specs. No issues with install. RGB looks amazing
5,From what I’ve seen these are by far the best looking RGB Rams which is why I got them for my first PC build. Unfortunately these were not compatible with my motherboard. My PC was constantly crashing and turns out these were the problem. Just a heads up for anyone planning to use these on their first builds check your motherboard specs before purchasing. If your motherboard can handle 3200 mHz these are definitely worth going for!
5,Value for money
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love the way this ram looks and performs. Icue software is really easy to use.
5,Not as stable as my old Gskill Trident Z 32gb kit in terms of Cas and latency but took the XMP 2.0 profile without a problem OC'd fine and looks great. No issues.
5,esteticamente hermoso
5,I ordered this for my son and he built a whole gaming computer by himself. He loves this product!
4,Everything about these ram sticks are amazing.Speed looks.Biggest upset with it is software. eventually RGB will be out of sync and the only way to fix it is to force close it in windows task manager. corsair please re make your software and only then would this be a 5 star product.
3,I really liked product's skin it has RGB and white cooler it's perfect for glass cases but doesn't work properly with my setup. I used processor as AMD Ryzen 7 2700x with Asus Prime X470-pro motherboard and system always freeze up. At first I just think that it happens because of my BIOS is not updated. Then I updated my bios to last version it works for two or three days. After that last things start to happen again. So I have to change my RAM with Gskill Trident Z RGB version. If you want to use that ram with AMD processor please check your motherboard's producer compatible device support specifically  "Qualified Vendor List" which called as QVL. Now I'm trying to sell my corsair ram kit as "used" in despite of I can not use it.
5,An absolute wonderful set of ram my only complaint is that I didn't buy more! The colors are bright and vibrant just be sure to check if your motherboard manufacturer supports them in their proprietary rgb software. Unfortunately ASRock does not yet.
5,beautiful product shipped and handled perfectly worked just fine
5,Easy to install software is easy to navigate good product. I like that you’re able to change the colors very easily. The ram is also very speedy and very appealing!
5,The ram is fine but 3600mhz does not work of the Gigabyte x570-pro wifi mobo fastest I can get with 32gb dimms is 3266.Not sure if i'm going to return or not.
5,Llegaron a 3600 MHz con facilidad los colores y modos que tienen son geniales y el precio estaba bastante aceptable las recomiendo
5,Están hermosas pero tengo dudas de la velocidad se supone son 3200 pero no me da más de 2600 tengo placa Asrock b550 m steel legend ryzen 5 3600
5,El producto es demasiado llamativo y en cuanto a su utilidad funcionan excelentemente.
5,Works as advertised no issues. Not a gamer so I thought the lights would be a distraction. I set them up to give a visual indicator of system temp using Corsiar's software and I really like the result.
5,It's the brightest part of the build but after that it's just RAM at the end of the day. Corsair is the gold standard for RAM.
5,First set I ordered would not go faster than 3466MHz ordered replacement works fine. Must have been defective IC.
4,Works well with Ryzen. No issues running at rated speeds. My only issue with them is the LEDs have inconsistent color when set to white which is a real shame.
5,love the rgb and good performance
5,El envio llegó un dia antes de la fecha indicada en perfectas condiciones.Antes de comprar verifiquen cuantos Mhz maximos soporta su placa Madre y su procesador.
5,easy to install works great
5,Built my white setup pc and this thing is nice. One complaint is the light I wish it was a little bit more brighter but works fantastic
5,Pretty cool product. Love the RGB there are no Hotspots and the colors are bright.  The ram works perfectly fine and are reliable for gaming
5,Rgb looks really nice wish I would of went with faster memory these don’t overclock very well but definitely worth the money
5,Great
5,Works good and looks nice for a good price.  I'm using it with an original Ryzen 7 and an Asrock AB350 ITX.
5,Very aesthetically pleasing and with the icue software adds a great touch! I had to go into my bios to ensure that my OS was using the full potential power but that's more on my end than the RAM.
5,Very happy with this purchase. It goes great with my see through glass case and It beams and shows good aesthetic.
5,One of the best rams to get! You won’t be disappointed
5,Best looking ram for white or any colored rgb build!
5,llego sin problemas pronto se instalaran.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             All four sticks working so far with no errors and the lights too have no issues so far  after a month of daily use.
5,Are you looking for beautiful-looking ram well this is it the colors are accurate there are many different lighting features and they run great!
5,Se adapta muy bien a mi placa base MSI X370 SLI PLUS no he tenido ningún inconveniente y carga el perfil de 3200 MHz sin ningún problema tampoco generó conflictos a la hora de realizar overclock a mi procesador AMD Ryzen 1700
5,MB can go up to 128 GB but the 64 GB I have is performing great. I don't game so can't say how well it works for that
5,Bruh! I was so happy to finally have this much ram! Playing solitaire has been the same!!!
5,works good withe ryzen 7 1700 at 2666mhz it could arrive at 2999 but crash some times
5,The only issue I had with these was they really had to be shoved into my motherboard. Not sure if that's a normal thing as this was my first build or maybe I was just being way too careful.  I like that they have RGB lighting as well. They look nice and work well!
1,Ordered 4 8gb sticks i was so happy to upgrade my ram then I received the package and was not so happy to open and find out that I revived two false sticks and two sticks that have no Corsair label on them
5,This kit runs perfectly fine at 3600 MHz on Asus ROG Zenith II Alpha motherboard. However it's more expensive then G.Skill 3600 MHz 256GB kits you can find elsewhere.
3,This is a good set of ram and for about a week I had great performance until I started recieving BSOD and after troubleshooting with Memtest 86 I discovered one of the sticks was no longer any good. This was very frustrating seeing as though I build the PC for gaming and RAM is essential now im down to 8GBs. This is still a good looking set of RAM just seems like a got a bad set. :/
5,Very pretty
5,My son picks out all my computer parts and these are perfect for gamers!!
5,The rgb is beautiful to look at and they work perfectly
5,Pretty flashing lights
5,Been using Corsair's DDR4 RGB RAM for PC building.  Customization software for the RGB is simple to setup with a variety of patterns and colors for every user's preference.
2,First order had a bad stick do not recommend.
5,Love the way it looks in my white themed build.  A little pricey compared to other brands but you can't deny it's the best looking white memory on the market.  Only the best from Corsair.
5,Does the job you would expect. Advertised mhz when set to and of course the rgb is very nice. A bit of a High price although just for a white edition and rgb.Would highly recommend if for aesthetic white builds
5,Amazing fast beautiful
5,The lights work great on it. I've had it for about 2 months and its working great.
5,Muy estables y buena calidad el RGB se vuelve loco a ratos pero con el icue se soluciona
5,Looks good with white buildOC’ed to 3200mhz on Ryzen build with asus x570 tuf mobo and is stable 👍🏼Always use Corsair or g skill RAM in all my builds always good quality!
5,No complaints.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love these RAMS excellent performance at 3600MHZ aside 10900K. perfect combo i would say.
5,Very good!
5,Simple and easy install.The lights are bright and exactly what I wanted.Paired with a Prime Z390.Box came in good condition. No worries.
5,bought for 64gb of  RAM and produces all 64GB as promised. produces all 64GB as promised and makes my build run very smooth!
4,excelente muy bueno visualmente y se puede controlar los colores
5,Gorgeous rgb ram.  Would go great with an all white build.
5,Was easy to install and use rgb worked fine was a great buy for gaming.
5,I’m very pleased with my purchase :)
5,They were easy to install and the lights are cool.
5,Good product and easy to click in. Looks cool when synced up.
1,After a year of having these sticks they worked wonderfully. Now after a software update from icue they're flashing red and unable to be configured from icue. I've done everything under the sun to fix it from reinstalling icue to reinstalling windows. There is nowhere to download old drivers/firmware on the corsair site short of opening a ticket which you need the product number for....so just to open a ticket you have to remove the ram and copy the number down...hopefully the computer you're using isnt the only way to open a ticket or you're screwed.My whole rig is corsair but after this absurdly and unnecessary string of hoops you have to jump through to fix the product will keep me away from the brand forever.
5,Muy buen producto y software de manejo
5,A good fitting rgb for my pc build
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Wonderfulamazingperfect astronomicalgreatnicegoodexcellentperfectI’ll stop lmao
5,It’s very very awesome and in and in video games it goes super well
5,These are really tall so make sure you accommodate that in your build. They do follow whatever RGB settings you set for the rest of your computer.
5,Very easy install looks amazing!
5,used it for my white/black setup and it came out nice (:
5,Muy bueno el producto de calidad original 100% recomendado
5,Litte pricy but no issues runs well and easy to install.
5,It was very easy to install.
5,It's Corsair...and it lights up your Tower..works flawlessly...all Pros no Cons
5,This was for a black and white build. Both worked and I'm happy with it.
5,A must have!!
5,It is what I expected. Satisfied with this product. Would recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to install and good price!
5,Worth every R G B
5,Please remember  seems perfect.
5,Excelente! Me encanto muy buena calidad altamente recomendado.
5,Very easy to install and aesthetically pleasing!
5,No problems plug and play
5,That's about all you need to know for RGB RAM right?  It met the advertised specs and it looks good in person.
5,Fast shipping and nice design. Looks amazing on my pc.
5,Look good and work even better
1,1st picture shows initial install I thought it was the RGB being dead ok I can live with that no problem. 2nd picture goes into Icue sure enough the dim in a2 is not even recognized. 3rd picture windows 10 shows 8gb of ram.I decided to use A1 and B1 maybe I somehow botched the installation. Nope same deal and even worse my A1 is now dead.I put my original ram back into the rig and used A1 and B1 somehow this ram killed my A1 slot. 4th picture I reverted back to my original A2 and B2.  5th picture I have my old 16gb back.Thanks Corsair?Update:Amazon connected me with a Corsair rep they need to examine my board... if I had a backup board I would've agree to it; since I don't and I don't have 18 days to waste without a computer. All I can do is return the product since no one is going to help with my damaged motherboard.
5,Bien cumple con todo
3,Overall good except for faulty led
5,Good product I’ve had no issues.
5,nice RGB and performance. Good to overclocking
5,Me gusta su manera fácil de instalar. Además de que son buenas para el uso de gaming.
5,RGB software is great is really powerful Ram
5,Easy to install for gaming
5,Very fast and looks great
5,Works as described.
5,Dope colors and patterns!
5,Corsair never disappoints when it comes to rgb. Ram works great and the smooth rgb transitions look very nice.
5,RAM does it what says but look so nice in your case. The colors run down the top and have a "unicorn" feel to them. That is to say that the colors are very bright but soft. Good buy to add some RGB to your system
5,Really nice rgb u can change it to any color depending on ur motherboard but they hold up and work good
5,Works well clocks to 3600mhz
5,Works great fast and reliable with nice addressable rgb with the iCue software.
5,Quality ram from a quality company.
5,Even though  the RAM was not on the approved list I took a chance based on a user experience.  It works great with no issues.
5,Great product it looks amazing in my pc
5,Great company quality product looks great in my pc build.
5,XMP and all is well. Looks great in my machine.
5,Great company . Plenty of led bling and performance
5,High quality like all Corsair products. A little expensive but it just looks so clean.
5,Absolutely an improvement from the original RGB Vengeance.Colors stand out Amazingly when coupled with RGB everything.Easily set to the 3200mhz by setting XMP profile on in BIOs. My favorite ram so far. Highly recommend for precision tuning and easy to set colors though iCUE still sucks.BUY THEM if you want the best.
5,Great and beautiful memory
4,Good service
5,My first pair failed on me kept getting the blue "memory_management" error page. But I decided to give these RAM another go but this time I bought 2 pairs. Haven't had a problem since and also....these are gorgeous.
5,Good quality and worth the money. Using this product for my music production.
1,I ordered this product initially in black for a Z590 board and the part worked perfectly.( I will note this part is in the QVL list for my motherboard )Vanity got the better of me and I ordered another set in white.Ever time I boot the second set of memory windows blue screens.If XMP is disabled the memory loads but is running in limp mode.I've updated the settings in the UEFI and it still doesn't help.So one set of memory works perfectly and the same part with a W on the end fails.A 50/50 failure rate is not acceptable for memory.-------Sadly the original set will no longer work with the default XMP settings.I am getting random system freezes in FS2020 and in DCS World.I do not overclock and am not interested in anything but the rated performance.
2,Bums me out.  These looked absolutely gorgeous in my case and did a grand job giving me Red Dead Redemption 2 in all of its beautiful Ultra glory alongside my RX580.  They're dead now though.  Just like my favorite horse who got to close to the railroad track.  And like that horse just kind of a waste of money for such a short time period of looking pretty.
5,Works Great Looks Great.
5,Easy to install and customize using corsair’s software. A bit larger than my older ram due to the heat sink but a simple reroute of a few cables fixed the issue. I would easily recommend these to anyone needing some fast great looking ram.
5,Amazing RGB and looks really good inside my Lian PC Case Paired with my White PSU cables!
5,XMP to 3600. Super bright and colorful. It a nice bling for memory.
5,10/10
5,The ram works as expected. The only problem was configuring icue to have the slots in the right order. Rgb looks great and it performs well.
5,These sticks are so bright and vivid. They have a really neon color and look wonderful A picture wouldn't do them any justice. I will buy 2 more for a total of 32GB and 4x8gb sticks. It works well with my Ryzen system.
5,Look your going to be paying a premium of about $20 for the rgb glow. But corsair has the brightest ram out there and if its worth it to you you should get it.
5,Cheaper than buying 4x16
5,Beautiful RAM in an all-white system. Corsair's software makes customization a breeze.
5,High quality ram
5,I really love it♥
3,One of the ram stick doesnt turn on dont know if its the software or the ram. I did however updated software multiple times and the one ram still doesnt turn on.Fyi ive have the ram for roughly 4 or 5 months. I was going through amazon purchases and noticed i never wrote a review for this product.
5,These are simply amazing stunning and even the software that comes with them works perfectly.
1,Funcionaron bien las memorias un tiempo. Una se dañó y empezó a salirme pantallazo azul. La página de Corsair es confusa. No se puede pedir garantía directamente desde Amazon y por lo que estuve leyendo me van a enviar memorias usadas porque la garantía es solamente de 30 días.
5,Is good
5,Love these color ram and the RGB it's not really necessary but it is nice looking if you want to pay the extra price for them
5,Nice Samsung b die memory got it down to 3200mhz cl15 but not 3600 CL16 probably coz I'm a noob at it.  Use the Corsair plugin to sync with Asus Aura motherboards.
5,Great look and a number of great options using corsairs icue software.
5,love the rgb
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,Set these right to 3200mhz and it booted without a hitch! They arrived in perfect condition and have complimented my build nicely with the vibrant RGB lighting. only complaint is that they took a while to receive.
5,Works perfectly
5,Good
5,This may be the best-looking ram of all especially in white
5,Very high quality and the rgb lighting is amazing. It’s pretty much the same installation process as any other ram sticks. The Corsair software is alright (icue). It takes a bit for the lighting settings to load in and actually show on the ram sticks.
5,Very easy install
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM.
5,It's great for it value.
5,Worked right out of the box with XPM on my 2700x and the lighting gives my atx case a nice aesthetic. Wish ram was a little cheaper but I guess thats what you get for leds.
5,Works just as expected!
5,These beautiful babies look nice in my case with my rgb fans. They work great. I do minor gaming on my pc nothing major but still no complains at all!
5,Muy bueno
5,I loved the product and the colors
5,One wasn’t working I have returned 3 time
5,Works great with my intel i-7
5,because of this RAM
5,Msi b550. Hits 3200 with profile 1.
5,If you want good looking ram to match your Corsair components then pick this up. It also performs really good!
5,Perfect for what I needed. No issues what so ever. I purchased these in January
5,De las mejores rams
5,It's very beautiful to glance at once and a while. Pairs pairly with a white setup. Very fast ram!
5,Looks great works well!
5,The best RAM you will ever buy. Classy elegant and does more than you need
3,I went out because an ice storm was expected and something else was to be delivered there.If I hadn't  300 dollars of memory would have been frozen.
4,10/10 would buy again
5,These are beautiful and also performance champs. Love my purchase. Haven't played many games after getting these because I get lost staring into my case at the hypnotic rgb effects they produce.
5,Very fast RAM with bright RGBs. The only probably I had was that the shape prevented me from being able to use a top mounted radiator as the edges protrude some.
5,Corsair vengeance rgb pro memory  worked perfectly. The RGB looks amazing and is vary bright.  I bought  the white 16 gig kit 2x8 3200mhz  I would recommend this product to anyone  that likes rgb.
5,buenicimas  yo las uso para videos juegos y las uso en mi pc stream
5,One of the best ram I have purchased
5,These are so amazing and a nice look!!
5,Amazing Quality and BEAUTIFUL! Hope it will last.
5,The run is beautiful and ram is just so easy to upgrade.
5,Love it
5,I would say this is the best ram in the industry if you are looking for rgb. It’s quite pricey but that’s expected since you are paying for the rgb.
5,Works good and looks good. No problems with the ram and with icue software.
2,I love the ram just isn't the correct ram to fit motherboard
5,Great
5,Clean looking ram
5,It’s pretty and fast. Great RAM.The RGB increases your FPS by 5-15. Would definitely recommend.
5,Splurged on these - not mad that I did! These are gorgeous and easy to change the color modes with the corsair app. Might end up getting another two when the time comes to upgrade.
5,Perhaps I was lucky but its running stable on AMD x570 at 3600mhz CL16 (hynix chip)
5,Requisite memory and linked to MB for led control. No problems with this memory
4,I like the look really sweet RGB it doesn’t quite work right with my Asus z370-G WiFi and I don’t know why. It’s only marginally faster than the ddr4 3000 i already had installed.
5,Exquisita la wea.
5,Bout two sets and I have 32gb so I can’t complain for 200$ going in a white build I’m doing
5,Looks good. Runs fast. Memory to spare.
1,I run an XMP Profile on this for what the RAM is rated for and it constantly crashes due to memory issues. Running a RAM quality or "Mem Test" shows that the RAM is faulty and throws error codes. I've bought 4 of these RAM modules with a failure rate of essentially 50%. I returned the first batch and everything looked fine until it began crashing and crashing more frequently (due to memory handling issues) after only a year of owning them. Mind you I don't overclock them as they're fast enough to run what I use them for.All in all save yourself the trouble and go for a better set of RAM modules.
5,Great product
5,works great i have this memory in both of the computers in my home
4,works
5,Fast 3200 DDR goes well with my 280x Micro ATX vibrant colors and great customization options through iCue just make sure to turn on your XMP profile on your Bios.
5,excellent I like how my setup looks
5,Super easy to customize and stylish as well. Another gem from Corsair.
5,Love this and my PC loves it more. Easy video editing!!
5,Looks great in my pc easy to install just might get another 2
5,One of the best Ram sticks you can get for the money use in all of my computer builds.
1,We purchased 2x8gb memory for my son's new tower build. Only 1 of the 2 memory sticks was working. AMZ customer service transferred me to Corsair support where the rep informed me that we had to return both. It's my son's virtual school computer and we need to have at least the 1 working ram stick in order for the computer to work. Corsair rep said that if we wanted to keep the 1 ram stick and return the other then we'd have to go through a lengthy RMA process that involves leaving a deposit for the full amount of purchase. Crazy!! Horrible customer service from Corsair.
3,This ram is very good and fast. It is very easy to overclock it. Unfortunately after a few weeks of using it I started blue screening and so I ran a memory test in memtest86. It turns out my second ram stick was defective.
5,Awesome
5,If you’re looking for rgb rams these are one of the best. Colors are very bright and can be customized to your needs. Ima buy another pair sooner or later
5,Excelente inversión y con la 470x prime de de Asus funcionan muy bien!
5,It took some BIOS editing on my motherboard to edit the RGB be mindful of that.But ram looks great and performs great.
5,installed and changed bios setting runs flawlessly at 3200mhz
5,Rgb= More FPS
1,Cant believe seems im the first one to notice this - the description says 2x8 gb  which is all well and good but then they put a (2pack) on the image which made me think - its actually 2 packs of 2x8 gbs for a total of 4x8gbs.  which is a great deal! cause i was wanting 32gbs total - well this is not the case and now i have to send them back and order 32gbs from someone else (ordering 2 of these from this seller would put it at approx 160$  i can get 32gbs of same for 130$ from others  (maybe this is just me but i don't see a reason to put a 2pack image on the product image if your not offering 2 packs worth of what the description says)
5,It has lights.  Lights is better than speed.
5,Works as advertised and looks amazing
5,I love they way these look and perform. I wish Corsair allowed their RGB products to be controlled from sources other than iCue.
5,Espectacular
5,As advertised works great. Only downside is in the Corsair iCue software you can layer led effects on the ram but really not a big deal at all.
5,nothing to complain about.
5,Very fast great for Intel and gaming super happy with this item
5,They’re amazing looking. I bought 2 packs and do not regret my decision. LOL
5,Ram works for the rated speed on the x470 board i got even with 4 sticks and people said it wouldn't looks sick in my white case
5,If you are going to make a white build with RGB this is a must need. The sleek design and amazing RGB this makes everything look perfect.
5,Works fine fast looks great. No issues after 6 months of use
5,It’s memory that works with icue. Lots of rgb choices looks good. And it works at 3600 if u wanted it too.
2,Many people are trying to find out who is the manufacturer of the die.well ? here is the answer. ITS not a Samsung die. Not B-die and not E-die.its either Hynix m-die or Micron... the problem is when I bought it 3 weeks ago it said clearly it was compatible with X470 motherboards. a few days later that note was Removed. I'm not saying its bad Ram. I will say if buy an X470 motherboard like I did .. (Gigabyte X470 Auros gaming 7) you could run into problems . it mainly made for Intel .AMD CPU's are sensitive to RAM impeccability....I can't say how runs on Intel since don't own an Intel with DDR4
5,Works great looks clean
5,Looks amazing
2,One of my ram sticks had come defective and I couldn’t boot my new built pc for over an hour trying to figure out what was the problem and why it kept failing. Once I finally took the ram stick out only then was I able to use my pc. The sticks are beautiful but caused me to waste my time. Very dissatisfied in Corsair and I’m afraid to buy or recommend these sticks for my next builds or to my friends.
5,Look good..
3,These.are all set to white yet 2 sticks seem to be purple. Will replace the product and see if it gets better.
5,They’re bright and performs very well.
5,Love it
5,Love the look great addition to my gaming PC
5,Best looking ram imo. Fast with a ton of different lighting options.
5,Love the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB ram. The color shifts beautifully and works flawlessly with all of my other components.
5,they work wonderful
5,Very nice
5,Not a necessity but Worth for the rgbeast
3,bought last july its now june. i dont play alot of games nor do i use my computer heavily.the rgb has gone out on both sticks. not sure why.
5,Perfect ram
5,Fast and great looking. Love the rgb custom cycles with the app. Definitely planning on getting another 2x 8g sticks later for 32g.
4,It's great but I'm biased.
5,This product looks super clean and the rgb is amazing!
5,Great RAM the RGB is awesome and easy to control really nice touchy to my pc
3,Product looks nice and clean but only goes to 2166mhz when I bought 3200mhz and my rgb is already going out after a little over a month.
5,it was easy to install works out of the box really good purchase that I got another set
5,Works great easy Install been a few months no issues  and beautiful to see at night love these!
5,Like : Very beutiful and fantastic RGB led performance.Dislike : Some Motherboard cannot suppprt Corsair RGB setting program as like AMD B450.
5,Memory sticks are memory sticks but the lighting feature is pretty cool. I can make it do different patterns.
5,Works like it supposed to and looks good doing it. Would buy again.
5,Not much to review on.Product worked for what I wanted it for.No issues otherwise.
5,Looks and runs great!
5,Awesome product. Stable fast and looks great. Totally worth it.
5,No tuve ningún problema en nada
5,I use this for gaming and it works perfectly! I am super satisfied!
5,the lighting is simply amazing. i love being able to control what they look like through iCue
5,Everything works well except this sync things. It just doesn't sync with my asus mobo. Except this 10/10
5,GRACIAS
5,Bought 2 months ago still going strong
5,The rgb looks much better than I expected and it performs beautifully with my 2700x.
5,RAM works like it should easily integrated into iCUE the lights look wonderful and bright.
5,Looks and works great
5,Love everything about them. The look the quality the software.
5,Worked perfectly! Great RGB!
5,Good looking pair of Ram.And the software is good as well.
5,Nice fast stable ram
5,Fast ram. Great rgb. Love the white.
5,It works exactly as advertised. The Corsair software is a little clunky but that's not news.
5,Worked perfectly and got it up to 3400mhz. I haven't tried any further yet.
5,Good
5,Good looking RAM
5,I always love corsair's choices of memory and style.
5,Good fast ram best looking RGB in my opinion
4,👌🏿
3,Pretty good
5,Love Corsair ram
5,Beautiful!!! Awesome part. (:
1,I bought 4 sticks 2 from different vendors both the same gb/MHz and RGB the only problem is these specifically added caused me to have blue screens consistently. Reset my Windows and the problem kept happening with memory errors. I bought two 16GB sticks instead and they work fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Nothing to dislike Just needs more rgb !!!
5,Amazing
5,Good for ryzen because it needs faster ram
5,Amazing product and gets the job done nicely
5,Great tbh
5,Love the aesthetic.
5,Perfect product!!!!
5,gorgeous rams  thanks.
1,No honestly just no.-Rgb will not sync with the motherboard-You will have a hard time installing RAM literally spent over 6 hrs trying to get pc to start-Speed maxed out at 3200 so idk why they label it as 3600-Chances of getting faulty product are HIGHI really with I read the reviews before wasting my time and money. Luckily I’m still in the return period. Disappointed to say the least. I have an Asus B550-F mobo paired with 5600x.
5,Good to use
5,Great
1,3rd time ....one of the cards broke blue screening the computer within a week .. had to return it...total junk
5,Beautiful and works like a charm. 5 stars no doubt.
5,Highly customizable with RGB effects and good asthetic.
5,Easy settingStable performance
5,Runs great and looks even better in white case.
5,Pulenta la wea.
5,Great
5,Looks great works great.
4,I liked
5,Best ram for the buck
5,you get what you pay for
5,Very good quality and fast delivery 🚚 thanks.
5,Awesome
5,Nice looking
5,Creo que todo bien
1,The ram itself is nice though I ended up getting it somewhere else as the set I ordered from Amazon got sent to me with the previous model ram and black not white but if you can avoid that the ram is great
5,Perfect
5,It is a so beautiful and fast !
5,5 stars
5,Got stuff
5,Rgb lights are amazing.
5,Fancy
5,Looks good with my build. Runs fast
5,XMP is so easy and LED is very good.
1,Are you serious? This RAM is faulty. It can't even support games like Overwatch and even made my minecraft crash. I thought it was my power supply at first so i upgraded it. No. It was these rams. I figured it out because my boyfriend took my old ram and he gave me his ram. He installed  my old rams into his and his computer starting crashing too.It barely lasted me a year and this ram is faulty. enough said.
5,It is same as expectation
5,gooooooooood!!
5,works well
1,I ordered this product February 28th. It was great ram the color fit my build and the lighting effects were awesome. It worked great until today April 13th. My rig began experiencing MEMORY_MANAGEMENT Blue Screens of Death every 15 minutes making my computer unusable. I decided to run a Windows Memory Diagnostic and sure enough it discovered issues. "Hardware Problems were detected. To identify and repair these problems you will need to contact the manufacturer". I'm going to try and get this resolved but BSOD's after just over a month? Do better Corsair.
5,Good
5,Good
5,Good
5,Husband loves it
5,10de10
5,Awesome!!
2,My system would not boot with these chips on DOCP. solid yellow light on the MB and no boot. Had to go back to my old ram.
5,WOULD RECOMMEND!!!
1,I bought this ram back in April and recently had a problem with it and had to open an RMA with corsair so they can repair it. I sent it back to them and they lost it in their warehouse. Now they are saying they will not help me. So now I am out of my ram and wasted a lot of time during this process. I have bought corsair case fans keyboards and ram but will never buy from them again. You cannot rely on corsair if you have any problems outside of the 30day amazon warranty. Horrible experience!
5,LED is beautiful
1,Installed ram it booted blue screen switch it for my other ram. Didn’t have no prob. RMA THIS RAM. I would not recommend this ram to ANYONE.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Not only the RGB the system cannot detect the memory as well.
1,
5,pretty girl
5,good
2,BSOD after BSOD until ICUE was uninstalled. Corsair's K95 keyboard then died and now I'm getting crashes because of issues with RAM. Avoid Corsair products
1,Ordered first set just fine but 2nd set keeps getting stolen replaced with random object hair ties
5,Everything is good no problem. Definitely recommend
2,Purchased less then a year ago caused blue "memory management failure" screen had to remove items in order to get my computer to cut back on.
4,I bought this locally at Bestbuy because I was pretty sure it was going to have to be returned. The package says it is designed for both the intel and AMD platform. When using it with the ROG Maximus XIII Hero (WiFi 6E) Z590 it fails after 3066MHz. At 3200 system will post but will cause corruption on the file system. Testing the RAM at this speed caused lots of errors when testing it. +3200MHz to 3600MHz including using XMPII settings causes the system to not post with a 5d error. This might work well on with other systems but the ROG Maximus XIII Hero (WiFi 6E) Z590 is a failed combo.I might test this RAM in a few other systems before it goes back and will report my findings in an update if I do. I didn't buy this here but thought I would warn others that have the same board to stay away if they are wanting to hit the rated MHz. I love the look of the RAM by default system boots with rainbow effects until the system is booted and the Armoury Crate software is loaded. There is a plugin from the manufacturer to allow the RGB to work with Asus' Armoury Crate software. I will say Corsair's RGB software is a tad bit better out the gate than the Armoury Crate. Corsair's prebuilt lighting effects are better. I am not looking at setting my whole desk up with their RGB lighting kits for your desk. The movie mode looks epic and I am looking to add that to my home theatre room. If you haven't looked at it you're missing out on what RGB can really do and Corsair has outdone themselves in my opinion.As for RAM for my system I may have to choose another brand as it looks like the only stable RAM they offer is 2666MHz from what I can tell. This RAM is not bad at 3066MHz but you're not going to hit the support for 3200MHz for this board speeds over 3200MHz are considered the overclock range.
1,Got another set while Corsair RMA'd the first set due to not cold booting to advertised 3200mhz the second set showed the same issue despite being on MSI's QVL page published for this specific mother board.Cold boot crash to BIOS/F1 prompt to adjust settings.  Change no settings and hit F9 save and exit and it boots to 3200 in Windows 10.This stinks.  It will cold boot to 3000 but not a tick higher.
2,DOA. Is there any quality control with these or did I just get unlucky?
1,The box of these memories arrived in bad condition open if they had told me that the box arrived like this I would not have bought this item
1,I have really never had any build give me this much pain.New Install froze up I tried many things Finally swapped the memory and the system is Stable.Not sure why this would cause an issue but it did.Memory is however beautiful I wish it had worked
2,The Rgb is good than you think.
1,The only plus I can give this ram is the rgb looks nice.  Unfortunately it will run even when your pc is asleep or shut down.  Most users won't know how to configure XMP to get past 2133mhz out of the box and the Corsair Link and ICU are horrible with compatibility and even detecting my ram.  I have not even seen a benchmark difference between this and my 2133 team elite.  Could not be more disappointed.
1,one of the sticks died within 2 months of having it
1,Bought the 3600mhz kit. Refuses to run past 3000mhz. Asus B550 A with updated Bios and Ryzen 3700x. I have tried the xmp profile as well as manual OC. Absolutely nothing will get it stable past 3000mhz.
1,
5,If anyone knows if I can run my computer with these I’m very new to pc and bought these ram sticks because I was told it would help I didn’t realize I was supposed to get 3200 so I just want to see if it’s compatible it’s on its way right now
1,AMAZON IS SO BAD AND THE PRODUCT BAD ENOUGHAMAZON IS SO BAD AND THE PRODUCT BAD ENOUGH
1,Will not boot at all at 3600 mhz highest is 3200 mhz so there is just no point for this speed sticks if it will not work for my board.
5,So i bought a Alienware prebuilt and it came with 8gb of hyper x ram. and it was so slow and i couldn’t game at all. But i bought these 2x16 gb corsair vengeance because i’m gonna build a new build over time but bought this first so i could use it and i’m absolutely loving it. i can run all my games without lagging now along with stream at the same time! I’ll post a picture of my final build later.
2,I disappointed that it didn't applied to Asrock Polychrome despite Mystic light and AuraSync can be used on this memory.
5,Llego 5 días antes de lo planificado y funcionando de maravilla
1,I received this order undamaged through usps but one of the the 32gb modules would not post. Corsair was unwilling to replace it.
1,One stick is great the other defective but the seller doesn't exist on Amazon any longer so I can't get refunded or a replacement.
1,Didn't even have these for more than a month and one of the sticks burned out. Weary that the second might do the same as my pc performance seems to be decreasing daily. Maybe this is just a bad batch since corsair usually makes good products
1,Even when I have it running way under the recommended speed the cards overheat.
1,Dead on arrival
1,Now than i have move out of us to singapore to assemble my own gaming rig My PC wont even boot up. Tried with another ram and it works. Most likely faulty ram.
4,I have had the pair of RGB Corsair Pro for a little while now (about a year) with absolutely no problems at all. I have an all white build (as much as possible of course) Ram case water cooler fans (6 total rgb). Most of my components are Corsair and I am very pleased!  I could talk all kind jargon that only a few would really have the understanding of but trust me. These sticks are well worth the money! DS
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Note: Video was made prior to lighting being synced fully.Great product I purchased this RAM in 2019 as two 2x8gig 3200Mhz sets. I have since just completed a new build and now have them linked up with my new iQue RGB fans and AIO. I did manage to have issues with the RAM RGB syncing with the fans but since the newest update they are all synced up even with the RAM not having the same lighting effect in the list that I currently have set for my fans thanks to the custom profile set up that controls all lighting and links it regardless even my ASUS x570 Gaming motherboard.RAM calc and tested with Ryzen programs running without a single error at 3400Mhz  with all four on a x570 Asus gaming strix Motherboard and new 5600x chip. Runs perfect and no errors at 3600mhz and could go higher but 3200Mhz - 3400Mhz is the sweet spot with latencys.
5,What can I say this RAM has the performance and reliability of the Corsair Vengeance Pro line and now comes in a more SFF friendly option. Looks great and performs great too. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Wtf is this? It doesn't even go 3600mhz...
1,Doesn’t run at recommended speeds.
5,Son excelentes memorias cumplen su promesa.
5,Easy XMP setup with my Asus Prime-A z490 mobo. Like all ram will run at 2166 out of the box and you need to enable the higher clock speeds in the mobo bios settings. Very nice RGB can actually be a little TOO bright for my taste at times. I’m running 4x16GBs of these and my computer runs smooth as butter. Considering all I use my computer for is to edit some powerpoints and play some games I’m over killing it with how much ram I have. But the RGB is pretty so it’s totally worth it!
5,Es buen producto color tamaño y funcionalidad
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Wrong sized ram package upc mislabled instead of 64 gigs I received 16 awesome !!
4,Im not giving it a 5 because at least for my ryzen 1700 buid i could not use xmp i had to manually input the numbers because trc in xmp was set to 54 and made the pc to bsod every time. I just had to manually put 56 and all the other inputs as voltage blablabla and worked perfectly.Thats why im not giving all 5 because otjer than that it looks amazing and when you set it to run without the bsod it runs really good.Sadly i think is only xmp optimize for intel and it didnt said it on tje description.
1,Does not work at advertised speeds on ryzen 3000 only buy for intel builds
5,Thought I would grab a set of these 16 GB 3200 (8x2) DIMMs to include in my new build Ryzen 5 3600 ASRock X570m Pro4  Sapphire 5700XT Nitro in a Corsair 280X case.  All went as planned until I ran into what appears to be a common issue with these DIMMs defaulting to 2133 Mhz. XMP listed it a 16 16 16 34 setting however would not boot After multiple unsuccessful trips down manual CAS and voltage setting trying to reach anything higher than 2133 I took one last shot and looked for a updated BIOS.  Low and behold ASRock went from BIOS 1.9 to 2.30 ( Released 12/9/19)  after a quick DL a reboot into the flash utility and my fingers were crossed the update was successful.  The DIMMs still showed as a default 2133 Mhz but I loaded the XMP values and away with the boot it went!  SUCCESS!  Morale to the story update the bios before you head back to the store for an RMA.
5,Very pretty worked great with my build fast speeds
5,Good
1,When set to white the LED colors are different.Very dissatisfied
5,I'm not a system tweaker but I wanted to build a fast system that would last me for several years. I bought this 128GB kit to use with my new Asus ROG Crosshair VIII with a Ryzen 9 3950x. It works fine. I've used the automatic overclocking feature of the motherboard and my system is running 23% overclocked. I'm not sure if this changes any RAM timings etc. but I'm very happy with the system.I don't want to push things too far because I don't wish to damage any expensive components. But I'm very happy with the performance of the system including the memory.
5,LMAO TO EVERYONE THATS GOTTA GET IT FOR $200
5,Coming from ddr3 1600 and an i5 4670k to a 9600k and ddr4 3200 the difference is incredible.  One click into the bios and another couple clicks to enable XMP profile 1 and this ram is running at blazing speed without a single hiccup.  I wanted white to match my build and was very happy to find the price was artificially inflated(gouging) due to demand.
1,I'm very upset I would receive an empty box
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Stunningly beautiful (had to stare at it for five minutes before running tests) and smooth installation and performance! I can't recommend this ram highly enough. My most demanding games are loading and running like silk.
5,Absolutely no cons to this set of ram. Easy install took 30 seconds and it is crucial to have at least 16 gbs in your PC.
1,RAM died on me never had this happen to me but This ssd is good for those of you who need one. unfortunately I got the bad pick out of the box.
4,I've heard so many people talk about these they've got fantastic reviews and Corsair is well known so I decided to get them. They feel high quality they hit 3600 no problem and the LEDs look amazing.... in white but every other color is rather meh. Maybe I had too high of expectations cuz don't get me wrong they look great. Just not as great as I was hoping for. I wish I would have went with TT or Crucial as I think those look better personally. To each their own but I would recommend them if you're doing an all Corsair build cuz iCUE is pretty dope.
5,Install was easy and they look incredible. I can't rate their for performance because my nerd abilities lie elsewhere but I am incredibly happy with my purchase.
5,I mostly wanted fast ram at a good price point and this went on sale and I thought hey why not light up your case a little. Worked right away with XMP @ 3600 on x570 Aorus Elite w/ Ryzen 7 3800x completely stable with no issues.
5,Great memory with good speed at a good price. The RGB lighting is great. The only thing I don't like about it is the RGB is a little delayed compared to the rest of the lights in the system when initially changing the lights but then matches everything else a few seconds later.
5,Great performance but not really worth the money. RAM is just too expensive these days. If you want RGB RAM though this is probably the nicest implementation with the best software. And I have enjoyed it so far.
5,They work well and the rgb is fully programmable. My first time building a PC and these were very easy to install.
5,Beautiful ram. This is fast reliable ram and damn does it look good in white with the RGBs. I built an almost all white gaming rig and this ram just added to it so much!
5,You're definitely paying a premium on this for the RGB Lighting the RAM sticks fit extremely tight into the slots so you'll really have to shove this one in.
5,Loved the LED's they matched the fan lights on the Computer bought.  The speed and upgrade to my gaming experiance  was very noticable.  Good buy for the money recommended.
5,Everything about it was fine. Only issue i had was changing the speed in the bios. But i found out i had to update the bios and it worked just fine after that.
5,Absolutely stunning! I couldn’t be happier! I have the ROG Strix B550-F motherboard and the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 processor and this ram is compatible!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Was it necessary? Heck no. Does it look cool? Well that's why we got it.lol
5,Works as spected definitely see the difference in speed
5,It’s so sleek premium and performs like a tank. One of my favorite purchases for my PC.
5,Great deal!
5,works awesome no issues.
5,It looks so sexy
5,its pretty good
5,Used Corsair and always reliable.
5,easy to config the rgb  i have to set 3600 on bios and everything is fine
5,Perfect for what I needed
5,This RAM is perfect for all white PC build or someone who just wants more RGB.
5,Awesome product couldn't be happierGreat value fast exactly what you need to play your games
5,Really happy and felt I got a good deal for the price as I did compare to other sites and stores.
5,By far the best looking RAM I've ever owned. My rig looks amazing and it runs at 3000hz so can't complaint much. It looks cool and it works ad intended exactly what you want from gaming RAM.
5,Super easy to install. They look and work great.
5,Works great. Bright. Cheap. I highly recommend this RAM
5,Got from Microcenter. I love this ram. When originally thinking about my build I wanted white ram for a nice White and Black setup. After looking at multiple ram designs I went with this one not only do they look amazing they preform amazing. They’re also customizable. I have yet to try them since I’m lacking a gpu and cannot use my pc but I’ve heard it’s amazing!
5,Appreciated by child receiver.
5,It was very easy to install didnt even need the instructions my computer feels so much smoother now and its worth its price A must grab
5,
5,Easy install look beautiful and were the perfect fit for my white build.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Do I need 32GB of ram? No. But do 4 ram sticks with software controlled rgb and crazy beautiful lighting effects make my computer run faster? Not necessarily. But do these look absolutely sick and I can finally flex on everyone that comes into my room and get all the girls to fall in love with me just by turning on my pc? Yes except for the last part! These are absolutely amazing looking rbg ram sticks. I think they really complete the look of my system. Its a must have for a rgb enthusiast like me. I can also recommend the Corsair iCUE LS100 LED Smart Lighting Strips. Although they could improve by somehow manipulating the wavelength of current these give out to make every women in my room instantly willing to bang... I think they optionally don't put that in cause we gamers aren't ready yet. Otherwise a solid 10/5 stars!
5,muy buen producto funciona perfecto
5,Looks great in a white-themed rig with matching RGB.
5,Easy overclock to 3800Mhz with good Performance.
5,OC to 4000mhz with no problems
5,i used it on ryzen 5 3600 thought i will get 3600 mhz how dumb of me but good product overall
5,I like everything about these sticks except the ICue software. The software is no where near as stable or reliable on boot to start everytime as it should be for Corsair. I've had to go in and reset the RBG a few times so far because one or multiple ram sticks wouldn't illuminate. Other than that there's no problem with compatibility or reliability of the memory itself. Good performance good speeds no problems at all.
5,Great product rapid shipping.  Thanks would buy again.
5,son muy buenas memorias... compré la version de 16Gb (8Gb x 2) a 3200mhz y funciona sin problemas se desempeñan bien tienen un diseño muy elegante y el rgb es hermoso tal vez lo único malo (en mi caso) es que el rgb no se sincroniza lamentablemente con el Rgb Fusion 2.0... me hubiera gustado que se sincronizara con mi placa base de aorus pero no importa el rgb lo configuro con el software de Icue.Recomendadísimas
5,Para instalar fue muy favil y son hermosas ya que su brillo es muy intenso y se ven hermosas.. Quiero comentarles que tuve problemas con el programa de la marca para controlar su rgb y lo solucione fue U bajando un poco la frecuencia de ella... De resto son perfectas.
5,Works great haven't had any issues with it. Make sure to "overclock" it to its full speed in BIOS when you get it though. The RGB controller software is also one of the better ones out there if not lacking a few lighting options; beyond that the software is extremely reliable as long as you don't let crappy programs like MSI's "MSI Center" hijack the coloring from the corsair software.
5,super easy and clean. works great
5,AMD Ryzen 9 5000 series build on ASUS board X570 chipset works great.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Really nice and bright. I just wish there were clear instructions on how to turn off rgb while in sleep mode.
5,What a great memory I meant RAM. Having LED light on my RAM make me feel like I can see the how hard my RAM is working even though it is intended for visual effect only. But whatever make you happy is what matter. My computer is probably happy too I think.
5,MAKE SURE XMP IS ENABLED! I keep seeing people make that mistake and then they run ddr4 at 2133 standard speed which defeats the purpose of being faster memory!These things look pretty and of course many buy this specific model for a certain aesthetic so that and the RGB is pleasant.Performance is great! I went with 32gigs total (4x8GB) to take full advantage of 4 channel and the 3600MHz speed on these is fantastic a huge step up from my last build that literally ran stock DDR4 speeds. I game and my wife jumps on often to do her side business and often ends up with like 30-40 chrome tabs in MULTIPLE chrome instances so the extra chunk of memory seems to help keep up quite well. My old build would just about freeze up by the time you hit 20 tabs in ONE instance of chrome.cant complain if these hold out and function for the life of the entire PC build i will be one happy camper.
5,I wanted a very RGB setup so where else to look other than the icue ecosystem. I bought these 2x8GB 3200MHz RAM sticks and they do wonders! The iCue software is also very user-friendly and simple. 100% recommend and worth the price
5,Excellent product rgb works great
5,worked as advertised...  I will update this review in six months
5,The Best
5,Solid performance. Stabile. Great looking without compromise. Little heavy for the size but all in all. Will be buying more sets for customer and personal builds.
5,Does the job am content.
5,i love how my computer runs with the upgrade. no regrets
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Video is from the review I did of that computer but it has the Corsair ram sticks installed on it in the video. Was easy to pop into place on the motherboard and lights are great. They look really bright in the video and they're bright but has more defined color than the video shows. Since these are 3600Mhz I had to enable XMP in the Bios otherwise it was just running them at 2333 Mhz.
5,It does its job and looks great doing it in my itx build. Ryzen 3700x RTX 3060 32g vengeance rgb pro asrock b450 fatality board.
5,It’s super nice and  beautiful. Works well with all my hardwares but the problem is ICUE cannot sync perfectly with ROG Aura. I have to adjust manually again and over again every time I turn on the computer…
5,Product came in only 2 days after I received the original that was missing some of its contents.
5,I've waited a bit to see how these perform before posting a review first thing while they are quite large in height in my case there was no clearance problem at all they fit perfectly in doesn't touch or interfere with anything else.The RGB lights are programable via the Corsair iCue software I found it to be a bit complex at first compared to what I'm used to from my motherboard & GPU but it does a great job once you get used to it.As far as the RAM sticks themselves they work perfectly no issues whatsoever even with XMP enabled at maximum speed of 3600Mhz.Overall I love this between these and the rest of my hardware I run some games at 100-200 FPS.
5,The title sums it up really. Paid a good price for 2X8gb Ram that fit easily into my motherboard and the RGB is a tasteful addition to my desktop
5,Es una pequeña pero buena mejora en comparación a las Veagance RGB Pro estas memorias son de un perfil más bajo por lo que no batallarás en poner un aio en la parte de arriba y tienen una iluminación más limpiaLas recomiendo al 100%
5,Nice
5,Buena estética y acabados rgb excelente y cero problemas a 3200 en ryzen 5600 eso sí el rgb y el software icue a veces dan conflictos y se detiene también con el software de asus armoury crate ya he probado todos tengo 4 módulos actualmente uso signalrgb y la recomendación es no instalar ni icue ni nada de asus incluso ai suite 3 hace que todo el rgb corsair crashee
5,We have never had problems with any of the Vengeance or Dominator DDR4 and have decided to hold off on buying DDR5. I personally do not game thus the Z690 boards with DDR4 should suffice. We're cutting back on computer building to about 12 per year for family and church support. We've built a few gaming units for others but we will stop. My husband is almost 75 and he just needs to do it for a part-time hobby. He's purchased one Z690 for DDR5 and one for DDR4.with the political games being played I think it may be time to stop altogether. We've settled on specific hardware that has consistently worked (i.e. Aoris by Gigabyte corsair Cougar  Nvidia Samsung) and over the last 20+ years since we built 386 units we've only had one board fail purchased from Amazon or Newegg. We have trusted Corsair for their excellence and Amazon for their consistence in shipping timely and with a few exceptions have purchased mainly from Amazon. We just don't want to get involved in keeping up with the newest trend anymore and it's probably time to quit! Hope to convince the old guy he can stop working. He tells me he wants to find a job. Anyway Corsair is the way to go if you want to be sure.
5,Easy to install really nice and I would recommend this because the price is similar to non rgb
5,works good and looks great.
5,I spent an hour troubleshooting why I couldn't get it to run at 3600mhz. Nothing I did would let it run at 3600 or even 3400. I found a post saying to move the sticks from slots A to B. This did the trick. Hope this review will save someone some time.
5,Looks great inside my computer. Definitely will use again in future builds
5,I ordered this product as part of my personal new pc build. I assembled everything correctly and everything was working fine. After 3 months of usage I had several issues and blue screens on my pc as well as window update issues. After a thoroughly research and testing my hardware for issues I discovered that there was an issue with my computer's memory. My motherboard was Working as a dual channel memory so I tried starting my pc using on one of the memory modules and then the other one. Using that I discovered that my pc couldn't boot with one of them and I finally found the issue. I contacted Amazon support and informed them about the issue. Since this product was under Amazon they send me a replacement pair in new condition. Trying those modules made my day. Everything was working as it should be. Overall despite my little adventure I am giving 5 stars for customer support.
4,Produit conforme tient bien l'overclocking chauffe peu.Un bon produit la spécification est dans la description si vous le souhaitez il n'y a rien a dire de plus tout est conforme.Que dire de plus ! Le rgb est relativement horrible déjà je ne suis pas fan d'habitude mais bon j'ai immédiatement enlever cela. Ma lampe de bureau fournis pour dire moins de lumière que ces barrettes. Malheureusement pour moi j'ai un boîtier vitré (que je regrette a cause de la vitre bien sûr) du coup c'est un vrai délire les LEDs bon pour les personnes qui aime il n'y a rien a dire vous allez aimé !Pour conclure c'est de la bonne ram les perfs sont bonnes et le prix souvent en promotion ! Je vous souhaite de l'acquérir ! En promotion bien sûr !
5,Bellissime e molto minimal nonostante l’illukinazione RGBA Offrono un buon feedback e una certa affidabilità.Sono ancora in fase di test nella mia nuova configurazione con AMD RYZHEN 5Unico difetto che noto al momento riguarda l’illuminazione che ogni tanto resta incantata per qualche secondo come se le ram stessero al momento non eseguendo il comando bloccamdo l’effetto.
5,Rapport qualité prix inégalable.J'avais l'habitude d'acheter mes composants sur d'autres site dédiés et voulant rajouter de la ram à ma config j'ai chercher un peu partout le meilleur ratio Fréquence / Go /  prixJe suis tomber sur cette paire de 2 fois 16 Go j'ai tout de suite commandé et je ne suis clairement pas déçu.Je me posais des questions concernant la compatibilité avec mes deux autres barrette d'une autre marque et d'une autre fréquence et RAS il suffis de bien faire les paires en 1/3 et 2/4
5,Super ! Fonctionne parfaitement à 3200Mhz cl16 sur une msi b450 Gaming plus max avec un 5900x et une 3090 en activant simplement le profil xmp.
5,評価の高いPatriotメモリー2種類、PVE2464G360C0K　PVB464G360C8Kを試しましたが、XMPで3600ではまったく動かない。最後の頼みで注文したこちらのコルセアメモリでしたが、やっと駆動することが出来た。もしかしたらもっと高速で動くのかもしれないが、やっと一安心。海外からくるので到着に一週間以上かかるが、これはおススメです。
5,Price quality the best DDR4 RAM out there 5 work days to get to the Azores that is pretty fast didnt test it yet still waiting for other stuff to arrive for my new white build but im 100% per cent positive that it will work perfectly ( if not i will edit this post XD)I recommend.
5,Très bon produit. Attention à la hauteur si vous voulez installer un Watercooling.
5,Bon rapport qualité/prix reconnues directement le XPM fonctionne parfaitement à 3200Mhz le RGB est beau bref RAS
5,Piccola disavventura con il primo kit acquistato che ho dovuto rispedire ad Amazon perchè un modulo era non funzionante. Assistenza come sempre al top dopo due giorni è arrivato il nuovo kit e sono perfette...
5,Ya había comprado un primer set pero algo extraño pasó con este lo adquirí junto a un enfriamiento líquido y ambas cajas llegaron maltratadas el sello de garantía de las RAM parecía manipulado y los dispositivos tenían ciertos razgos de que ya habían sido utilizados cosa que no pasó con el primer set por motivos personales no pude realizar la devolución. Hasta el momento no han fallado y trabajan de manera excelente....
5,Super Ramsticks mit toll einstellbarer Beleuchtung dank der App iCue.Kaufe gerne wieder etwas von Corsair :)
5,Parfaitement stable avec un ryzen 5600  pas de souci pour activer l'XMP les LEDs paramétrable sont top avec corsair ICue.A peine plus chère que des barrettes corsair non RGB.
5,Muy bonitas y van perfectas para equipos mini ITX. Dado su perfil bajo encajan perfectas con disipadores grandes como los Noctua. No tendrás ningún problema para acomodarlas. Y rinden estupendamente. Cero problemas de estabilidad y el equipo funciona super rápido. Perfectas con procesadores Ryzen de la serie 5000.
5,I wanted white RGB memory for my new build and this value memory fit the bill nicely.Looks good functions well had no problems with XMP profile on my ASUS z690 motherboard.Recommended.
5,nothing wrong with them they work and easy to install.  I wanted an all decked out in rbg but now I do wish i could set it at purple only.  it is a rainbow of colours going up over and over and sometimes the 2 are in sync sometimes they are not.
5,Ram DDR4 da 2200 MHz regge tranquillamente XMP 2.0 fino ad un massimo di 3600 MHz. Molto belli bianchi con RGB gestito tramite il software di Corsar iCue.
5,C'est beau.  Et c'est du dual rank !
5,Fonctionne très bien et très styler je recommandeMeilleurs marque corsaire
5,It works very well and very easy to install into your PC. It also looks very aesthetically pleasing with also being high quality however there are better brand to go for I will always choose Corsair because of the looks!
5,ottima ram riprogrammabile in diverse illuminazioni e tonalità di luce led
5,I am quite happy with my purchase.  Thank you for your swift service.  The Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3600 are exactly what I needed and you supplied.
5,Dis good luks gud
5,Nada que agregar funcionan bien y se ven muy bonito el RGB
5,I bought these to replace my brutally abused Corsair Vengeance slim-factor RAM that was 3000MHz these ones were a massive cosmetic upgrade since they feature RGB and breathe some life into my case the extra 200MHz of speed is always welcome for my work in Blender.For my i7 9700K this was the perfect purchase as Intel 9th gen prefer RAM that operates between 2800MHz - 3600MHz - so this was the perfect middle-ground for me.Great product!
5,Good ram sticks but will note that in icue software they operate separately from the Corsair commander core unless connected through there
4,L'or de l’ouverture des RAM j'ai été surpris par l'odeur  je m’attendais a avoir une belle odeur de neuf mais les RAM avais vraiment un mauvais odeur  sinon on fonction parfaitement .
5,Endlich läuft mein Pc wieder 12 Std. ohne abzustürzen. Hatte davor gskill der Pc ist jeden Tag mindestens 1 mal abgeschmiert. Bin super zufrieden!
5,Corsair ha tra i migliori prodotti di memoria
5,Rien à dire a part que ça a donné un gros coup de boost à la machine et tout ça avec style (quand on aime le rgb je crois que ça se voit sur la photo).
5,Easy to click in RGB looks nice great to double my RAM.
5,White is better than black it has rainbow lighting and looks nice
5,Sehr gutes Paket laufen 1A mit meinem Ryzen 5900x.
5,No complaints
5,Very satisfied! works great :)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Muy buen producto lo recomiendo
5,Je recommande sans hésiter.
5,Ottimo acquisto solo che mettendo colori pulsanti rosso/rosso a volte esce un rosa salmone belle da vedere.
5,Si me gusto
5,Corsair is an amazing brand. There was no competition in my mind when choosing a brand for RAM.The pricing can be a little higher than other brands but for peace of mind in knowing you are buying a quality product that will last it's an easy choice.Lots of Corsair products to choose from it's easy to get carried away as they sell nearly everything you would want for your PC rig
5,Corsair le sang
5,Working really well with my ryzen 5800x very happy with it.
5,専用のソフトを入れることで発光パターンを変えることもできるし、何より白pcに合うので買ってよかった
5,Avevo bisogno di fare un upgrade per il mio sistema lavorando come content creator 32gb non bastavano più ed ho dovuto estendere la memoria complessiva a 64gb.Le ram di per sé sono ottime e il software di corsair per la personalizzazione degli rgb è secondo me il migliore sul mercato. Ho fatto l'errore però di non controllare i timings in quanto questo kit è c16-20-20-38 e il mio già montato sul sistema (sempre corsair rgb pro che non sono più vendute su amazon) era da 16-18-18-36 una volta montato quindi i nuovi due banchi di ram non riuscivo a sincronizzare i timings.Tecnicamente il sistema dovrebbe sincronizzarle automaticamente in maniera da far andare tutte le memorie ai timings di quelle più lente io però con una asus strix b550 non riuscivo ad impostarle a meno di c22-22-22-53.Dopo un paio di giorni di troubleshooting ho risolto riconfigurando prima il bios solo con i due nuovi banchi e i loro rispettivi timings con il profilo d.o.c.p dopodiché ho installato anche le mie due memorie più vecchie. Il sistema si è finalmente riavviato senza errori e tenendomi il profilo 16-20-20-38.Dopo svariati test con questa configurazione non ho notato nessuna instabilità di sistema e le prestazioni sono identiche a prima.Consigliate a chi come me ha bisogno di estendere la memoria ed ha già il kit con i timings inferiori e non vuole rivenderle per ricomprare il kit completo da 64gb  ma con il rischio di dover fare un po' di troubleshooting per farle funzionare alle loro frequenze ottimali.
5,Estas memorias van muy bien con mi ryzen 5 ya tenia otros 2 modulos de 8gb y ahora con estos 2 nuevos ya esta mi pc al completo. Con la app de corsair se puede personalizar el rgb y te da bastantes posibilidades. Muy contento lo recomiendo 100%
4,un tarif un peu élevé mais c'est une bonne qualité
5,Bellissime
5,Acquistate in sconto da amazon fanno un figurone dentro la build e una volta portate a 3600 Mhz vanno da dio mai un problema ne prenderò altri due banchi per arrivare a 32 in futuro
5,delle belle e luminose e soprattutto buone memorie corsair
5,Très bien' pas de cour circuit j ai u un problème avec corsaire carte mère Hs amazon a fait son travail.
5,Endlich der richtige Arbeitsspeicher der sofort ohne Probleme mit  XMP die 3600 MHz eingestellt hat.
5,Was soll ich sagen sehen gut aus . Haben eine gute Qualität. Laufen bei mir schon seit über 6 Jahren. Hab sie für eine Freund gekauft da ich mit der Leistung und Qualität zufrieden bin .
5,fanno una luce stratosferica
4,Très belles barrettes pour aller avec un build corsair tout en blanc. Installation facile et reconnaissance par iCue immédiate.Au niveau des perfs ce ne sont pas les meilleures mais elle tiennent la route. En revanche comme pour tous les modèles LPX et Vengence RGB de chez Corsair il y a pas mal de soucis et d'instabilité avec les profils XMP... Dès qu'on dépasse les 3000MHz il y a des risques de crashs/blue screens. A prendre uniquement si on accepte ce risque et surtout pour compléter un build corsair.
4,bon rendu  par contre beaucoup de soucis sur le reglage des MhZ et XMP qui fais crashé le pc ... et 20 euro de livraison ... le livreur n'a même pas sonner et envoyer mon colis dans un point relais sans même mettre d'avis de passage ...
5,thanks
5,Matériel Corsair. Pas déçu  conforme à la description.
5,Unless you turn on XMP you won't get full 3200mhz
4,Les barrettes de RAM font le boulot il faut penser à activer le XMP dans le bios pour les faire tourner à 3200 MHZ.Sinon c'est dommage qu'ils n'aient pas fait le nécessaire pour que les led se synchronisent avec les utilitaires de principaux fabricants de carte mère.
5,Bien RGB comme on aime !!
5,Le he piado en oferta que si no se pasa con el precio
5,32 go / 3200 MHz de chez corsair.. Que dire de plus à par que tout y est 👍🏼
5,
5,Ottime ram qualità Corsair bella luminosità.
4,las memorias se ven se siente y desempeñan de la mejor manera. Son de calidad. muy bonitas. Simplemente instalas y listo.La razón de las cuatro estrellas es que el software para controlar el rgb no logro hacerlo funcionar adecuadamente. Hago notar que el RGB es muy bonito luminoso y trae muchas opciones de sincronia. El problema es enlazarlo con otros softwares en mi caso el de ASUS (Mobo)  o el de MSI (GPU). Estos dos anteriores dispositivos funcionan sin problemas pero las memorias es imposible integrarlas. Ya baje todas las actualizaciones y patches del sitio de Corsair y no he podido.Pueden funcionar con su software pero no se sincronizan ademas de que genera problemas: a veces carga a veces no aveces no enciende el RGB en otras ocasiones congela el RGB de Mobo etc... Decidi dejarlas en el arcoiris default y esperar alguna acutalización...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ottime memorie da 3200Mhz montate su una scheda madre ASUS X370-pro e processore AMD Ryzen 5 2600. Nessun problema di compatibilità. Testate e stressate per qualche ora per verificare la bontà. Tutti i test superati!Le luci RGB sono belle e fanno il loro bell'effetto. Purtroppo alcune tonalità non sono perfettamente allienate con quelle del dissipatore Corsair ma la colpa non è dei led delle memorie ma da quelli del dissipatore.
5,Tengo una placa base ASUS X570-P y no funcionaron con el perfil X.M.P. sin embargo si las pude dejar estables a 3000Mhz configurandolas manualmente con los valores recomendados para el perfil de 3200Mhz que me recomendó la app de CPU-Z. Si alguien necesita ayuda con este tema lo pueden aprender a hacer igual que yo con videos tutoriales en YouTube o me pueden preguntar que valores he modificado.
5,Great RAM. RGB Colour options through Corsair's iCUE software are great. I have read that you might need to be careful if you're adding more RAM to your PC as the DRAM manufacturer is not Corsair and may vary between different companies. I already had 2 X 8gb in my PC from a local computer store and purchased this 2 X 8gb set from Amazon to upgrade to 32gb. My original 2 X 8gb RAM DRAM manufacturer is technically Samsung and this set from Amazon is showing as made by SK Hynix. However it doesn't seem to matter. All 4 sticks are registering and running XMP at 3200mhz. RGB is also working excellently. They also look terrific. Highly recommend this RAM.
5,Bien
5,Works/looks great. Had 16GB in my comp and really only put in another 2 sticks cause I didn’t like the way it looked with 2 empty RAM slots on the Mobo. I use my Computer for gaming I haven’t noticed any perceptible difference between 16 and 32 GB of RAM so in my case it was literally just for a more completed aesthetic  look.Not the easiest to install with the Mobo in the case already but not impossible either.Had to re-install Corsair ICUE software to get it to recognize that 2 extra RAM sticks were added so that I could change the RGB colours.Lighting looks really good I’m happy overall
1,So after building my computer and running it I discovered that one of my ram's dimm modules were defective. I requested a return even stating in the return field that I just want a replacement if possible instead of a complete refund which is the only option they provide. The company has gone COMPLETELY dark and is forcing me to submit for an Amazon A-to-Z refund. I have a replacement product of this in my computer that I purchased from Memory Express and when there are no issues this ram is BEAUTIFUL.So don't get me wrong the product is amazing (when it works!) but iSanek is a company that will completely ghost you if you have a problem with a product purchased through them so you're better off buying somewhere else for peace of mind.
5,look amazing feel amazing haha. but honestly they're good.There's ONE GRIPE. that stupid Gigabyte RGB Fusion won't leave them alone. so i had to uninstall RGB Fusion and just let me MOBO and GPU stay static at whatever random color they decided.cause Icue couldn't take full control and RGB fusion kept changing my RAM on me.
5,el modelo esta excelente  los led son muy brillantes mas que los trident z  te puedo decir que la aplicacion ICUE  ha superado mis expectativas nada que ver con el insipio aura  que  es algo muy basico  a diferencias de las bondades que te ofrece la aplicacion de corsair  tiene muchisimos efectos  y  los puedes programar a tu antojo en verdad han sido mis las mejores ram que he tenido
5,Honestly functioning of this ram is just like other ram. overclocking not so bad.but the look is amazing. it supports corsair chroma and you can select lightning effects dimming color.it will makes you happy by just looking at it. bought 1 set initially because 16gb is just enough for the computer.the thing is it went missing. so i had to gothru with customer service eventually they sent me replacement for free.thinking to get another set to finalize the look. no regret
5,Paid the corsair tax to get these because they are just so beautifully designed. Loved it with my white-themed build! I have some issues integrating the iCue software with my mobo's software but I think it's just my motherboard's software that sucks (asus). iCue otherwise works fantastic on it's own.Also the RGB effects definitely doubled my FPS can confirm.
5,Stile grandioso offrono una "clearence" appropriata per installare un AIO da 240mm e 280mm su un Corsair 4000x. Al momento della recensione sono il kit 4x8Gb con RGB più economico. Ottime per video editing facili da controllare con il software iCue della Corsair ed esteticamente piacevoli.
3,Ya’ll kept saying 3200 MHz but the board reads it differently as in 2133 MHz out of the box. So y’all need to stop lying. To be honest i only purchased for the RGB to match/sync my other Corsair products.I should’ve stayed with G Skill I guess thats the price i gotta pay to have all sync up the way i want.
5,Ram montate senza problemi su una scheda madre ASUS ROG STRIX B550-A GAMING e il processore RYZEN 5 5600x pienamente compatibile ovviamente non dimenticatevi di entrare nel bios per setterle a 3200mhz. pienamente soddisfatto.PRO-Facili da montare-Facile da settare nel bios-Alta frequenzaCONTROSinceramente non saprei quali contro assegnare a queste ram forse per il fatto che bisogna utilizzare il software ICUE di Corsair apposito delle ram per cambiare colore.
5,This RAM was very very easy to install! The lighting was easy to configure in the iCUE software! And in the end they actually look really nice! They're good for gaming for the price they're really good! And it's faster than what I've had in previous PCs.  I wasn't getting the fastest speed at the beginning and I had to turn on XMP in my BIOS so if you realize that you're not getting the advertised speed make sure you turn on XMP cause that might fix the issue!
4,Las memorias llegaron perfectas totalmente funcionales no tardaron casi nada pero el probema es que la caja estaba un poco maltratada y al abrirlas una de las memorias venia rota de la carcasa en la parte superior izquierda no era una grieta muy grande pero si se notaba pensaba que la memoria no iba a servir pero al usarla estaba totalmente funcional incluso el rgb lo unico malo fue eso que una de las memorias tenia una grieta en la carcasa pero parece que solo fue la carcasa y la memoria no estaba dañada creo que fue un problema de la paquetería.
4,Todo funciona bien me da las velocidades y no eh tenido problemas al subir su velocidad a 3200 mhz aun que si eh tenido detalles como que en ocasiones la app de corsair no reconoce uno y el rgb se desincroniza y no se si sea problema de mi MOBO o de las RAM pero en ocasiones no me reconoce una y solo me detecta 8gb en lugar de 16gb tengo que reiniciar sacar la RAM y volverla a poner para que la detecte
5,Si vas a comprar estas memorias para añadirlas a algún set que ya tengas previo checa que la versión de las memorias que vas a comprar sea idéntica a las que ya tienes o tendrás problemas de compatibilidad. En mi caso yo compre 2 sets de estás memorias pero con las siguientes versiones: Ver4.31 = Samsung 8GBit B-DieVer5.32 = Hynix 8Gbit CFR. Es exactamente el mismo producto pero no los construyo la misma empresa y por ende no me corrieron juntas a 3200MHZ las deje estables solo a 3133MHZ. Como punto aparte cada set por si solo si corrió a 3200MHZ pero juntos no. Fuera de eso el producto es excelente.
2,So I've been building myself a great gaming PC. Out of the lot the biggest issue I've experienced is the memory. I learned the hard way. Other than looking very slick the memory just won't boot at 3200mhz if you've mixed another kit with it. Isn't it just me but I remember doing this back in the days without any issues. With today's RAM it looks completely different and any mixing makes you lose any optimization you've paid for getting a 3200mhz RAM.Long story short I did a lot of back and forth with Corsair support when experiencing this problem. They essentially told me I shouldn't mix kits even if they are all of the same model number (2 kits of 2x8GB CMW16GX4M2C3200C16W). I read a lot about this after and it seems pretty deep. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't... The consumer ends up troubleshooting their way out of it. To me it makes no sense to me that I cannot mix 2 of the same exact kits but it just doesn't work any way I tried it. If I just kept 2x8GB (essentially 1 kit) then it works at 3200mhz. If I want to use 2 kits it is stuck at its lowest speed. I've purchased a lot of Corsair gear with that new PC but I'm overall disappointed that Corsair doesn't stand much behind their product in the case of mixing RAM. I was able to do it with a less familiar brand (XPG). Pretty disappointing to say the less. Now I'm stuck using only 2x8GB and I'll return the second kit. I learned the hard way by wasting a lot of time energy and obviously the deal I got was on the second kit no chances of keeping the deal.Pros:- Look slick! Love the RGB!- Will reach 3200mhz if you use only 1 kit on your motherboard.Cons:- Cannot mix with anything even another kit of the same model/timing/etc. You cannot *ever* upgrade your memory after that. You're done forever unless you feel like paying for complete new RAM sticks and throw those away.- Corsair support is slow at times and I felt like I was stuck with my own issue. The tech support guy wasn't of much help and I had to prove that it just wouldn't work. Luckily I'm tech savvy so I was ale to troubleshoot it myself. End result won't work any way you put it. Thanks Corsair!
5,Ive built over 30 gaming computers from low end to 3 grand computers and by far out of the many ram kits ive used this is by far the best looking for my white and black pc build (ryzen 7 3700x and 3080) looks very nice and very good preformance. the only complaint is that it isnt in stock alot witch is a given for how good it is but wish it would go in stock more wanna get a couple more kits (2x8gb 3600 mhz white)
5,First of all let me just say that if you are not buying these for the RGB get the non RGB ones (obviously). But if you are the RGB is amazing. Its got amazing RGB that is easy to use with Corsair ICue. Easy to install as most ram is had no problems with them so far. (Although i did have to change the clock speed in the BIOS as it was at 2666Mhz instead of 3200Mhz but it was a easy fix) All in all great ram for the RGB and the performance now i can have 500 chrome tabs open in peace.
5,Upgraded my gaming PC from 8 to 16GB. I found installation a bit trickier for me as my motherboard manual never came with my PC (second hand buy). I STRESS that you check your manual for where to install on the slots because two sticks running on the same channels is slower than two running on the designated slots. I also realized a bit late and after some frustration that they went a specific way (I had a moment haha). The colours inside my PC really make it pop with the glass side I have. Overall super happy with purchase.
5,Looks amazing white color is sleek. Has some weight to it and kinda big. 3600MHz out the box. Syncs with iCUE as expected. C16 would be way better but C18 is perfectly understandable
3,Wish I had known before I bought. RGB not recognized by Asus Aura. Can only be controlled by iCue which does not sync with Aura. All my case lighting changes in sync except for the ram. Really spoils the whole effect. Should have bought G.Skill.
4,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that they took something like 2 months to arrive... but that's not reallllyy the sellers fault... the RGB in these are really vibrant and rich in colour... they work nicely I'm pretty happy with them...
3,The web description of this product is not 100% correct.  Yes this is the Vengeance RGB Pro but it's the SL model.  I wanted to get just the Pro model because it's much better desktop memory.  The latency specs on the Pro model is a lot better than SL model.  See the attached photo showing the specs.  I'm not sure who is responsible for this error but this should be correct.  Again Buyer beware??
4,Nice sticks very nice LEDs had to send it back because if your using a watercooler for your cpu its in the way so i went to Corsair Vengeance ram fits better.. sad no LEDs tho
5,Got a great deal on this ram so I'm very happy. With my computer i had to set the ram to 3600mhz  in the bios as when i started my computer it was only reading at 2400mhz. Simple change in the bios and running at correct frequency. Thanks again.
5,The RGB looks awesome works very well with my Ryzen 3800x build. Every running fast and smooth.Easy recommendation for 36000 MHz RAM especially if you want RGB.One warning though if you plan on using the Be Quiet! dark rock pro 4 do not use this ram. This ram is too tall and doesn’t give good clearance to use the dark rock pro 4.
5,No ram looks as good as this one. If you have a white case you really aren't doing it justice with black ram sticks. The lights on these things too are just insane best looking ram there is!
5,Bombastisch diese Leistung. Kann ich nur empfehlen. Für mich der Arbeitsspeicher schlechthin.
1,I ordered three of these packs because I would always receive at least one dead or bad ram stick that wouldn’t work when it came out of the box. I wasted over $300 on this and it still causes me problems today. My PC will always have problems due to rotten ram and all because of this stupid and bad quality that this carrier ships out.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought this kit for my new Pc build works great I also have the 32gig ram kit in another pc of mine
5,Literally the most sexy and beautiful ram one could buy. You can even download a program to customize the colours features etc etc. So happy I decided to go with it. (Sorry my review is late thought I did leave a review already mb)
5,Through the software you can change the color or lighting effects. There are so many options when it comes to effects. It’s also fast & good looking. I bought it for 110 (During Boxing Day) so wait for a sale if you got time. If not then go ahead now
5,Built a new rig for Zen3 I know RAM can be pretty fickle for AMD.  Popped in both sticks to the mobo defaulted to 2133mhz.  Enabled XMP in the BIOS and it's now running at the designated 3600mhz.  Looks really slick to boot.
5,Son hermosos y poderoso.El precio es un poco más altos que la competencia pero bueno son 3200Mgz y son blancos con RGB.Buena estética y excelente funcionalidad y rendimiento no puedo pedir nada más.
4,Fast delivery. Added those two to other two I have.Unable to set the XMP profile with either pair (old or new) without getting BSODs. Might be a motherboard problem idk.
2,Price was cheap compared to what local dealers are offering but as one of the sticks came faulty. i have to claim warranty. Seller did not indicate how i can go about doing that so i have submitted a ticket to corsair directly to attempt to claim warranty for the faulty ram stick
4,Had to RMA the first set I received but the second set I got (a few days later thanks to the quick RMA process) function 100% RGB looks great with a lot of customizable RGB options. Anyways 4 out of 5 stars because of the first dead set. It happens with memory.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I was only going to get 1 that comes with 2 but trust me buying 2 and getting the 4 lights make the aesthetic WAY NICER! Get two!!
5,Pretty great looking sticks of ram. The XMP is running at 3200MHz 16-20-20-38. Cpu Z shows the modules are from samsung which is a surprise. XMP runs perfectly with my 6700k and will be using it for the next upgrade to Zen 3.
5,Ya se sabe! Estas memorias RAM son una chulada tan de vista como al rendimiento no te decepcionará!Pros: Corsair tiene una excelente atención a cliente!Cons: ninguna!
5,Purchased this to replace an old set that had gone bunk in my partner's old computer. If we had kept everything together we could have saved 140 dollars. That said we replaced with the exact same ram because corsair makes good products.
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei meine Games benutzen oft nur wenig im Durchschnitt benutze ich 7-12 GB.Installation war easy sieht gut aus knackige 10/10
5,Muy bonitas buen rendimiento y el RGB es bastante bueno y bonito lastima que no pude sincronizar con AURA SYNC quien sabe por que pero son unas rams bastante bellas. - Shaqtur
4,Not bad ram but the lights do freeze sometimes for no reason and over clocks well
5,Perfectas no dieron ni un detalle al habilitar el perfil xmp. Calidad y excelente compatibilidad
5,Love this ram! It’s super easy to install works really well and looks rad.
5,I bought multiple Corsair RGB components alongside several other brands and the Corsair RGB Pro and LL Fans are by far the brightest and most mesmerising components and they haven't skimped on performance either. Fantastic purchase!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Recomendadisimo llegó en muy buen estado e incluso antes de tiempo y al ponerlas superaron mis expectativas de como se verían un rgb muy fluido y genial 10/10
5,I liked the rgb on the ram sticksBut also I needed more ram😀
5,It's works at 3200 as long as you make your setting be xmp 2. Just turning it on without making sure its on 2.0 would say system unstable and wouldn't start. So works just turn yo xmp 2.0 manually!!!
1,1 of my ram sticks was faulty. Unable to boot PC with that stick of RAM. Bought the ram but couldn't build my PC until GPU came in and by the time it came in return window expired.
5,looks good and im getting fill advertised speeds of 3200mhz with ryzen 7
5,La memoria funciona como se esperaría de cualquiera lo que la hace valer el precio es el RGB excelente.
5,Easy to install and they look amazing
5,So far so good nothing wrong with it and works well. I can’t perfectly review it yet but it looks amazing on my new pc. Recommended for rgb pc build
5,The look amazing in my white PC!
4,Me parece un buen producto me va muy bien en los juegos aunque al inicio note que se congelo por unos segundos pero funciona perfectamente
5,Extremely easy to install and they complete the pc aesthetically
5,Excelente todo
5,Funciona perfecto
1,Dead on arrival and so was the replacement.
5,Good product very happy look great!
5,Its Corsair enough said... RGB is bright and unit works perfectly
5,Perfect with Ryzen 3 2200G & Strix B350-F MOBO!
5,Muy bien cuidado y empaquetado las ram ni se diga son unas bestias lo mejor en relación calidad precio! una buena compra.
1,I buy DDR4 CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB PRO 3200MHz and you give me the 2133MHZ
5,Obviously easy to install and the lighting on them is great as well as the software that can control it
5,Nice
5,jusqu'à maintenant aucun soucis ... à suivre
5,La última vez me llegó algo diferente pero Amazon me dió pronta respuesta solución y eficiencia la verdad. Las memorias se ven geniales y se ven en buena condicion.
5,Good product Icue is great not a fan on motherboards with the one clip vs the 2 but that’s not Corsair’s issue
5,La memoria llego el siguiente dia de ordenada. Funcionaran perfectamente los 4 sticks. Excelente performance. No podria estar mas satisfecha
5,Had no issue with these so far.  Plug and Play.Colors are bright and so very pretty too look at.
5,super product shipping very fast
5,Todo en orden ahora a probarloEnvío rápido y confiable
5,Funcionaron sin ningún problema correan a 3200 sin ningún problema y a una buena temperatura las recomiendo ampliamente
5,La verdad estoy muy conforme con las memorias ram son hermosas.
5,Love the white! And the RGB is nice and bright!
5,Great product
5,it looks amazing in the night and the software system is very simple and clean
5,its just great. the lights are great the performance is great. my favorite ram
1,Ram Failed system booted but when i put the XMP on and set it to 3600mhz at 1.35vpc would than not boot
5,Caratteristiche rispettate ottima l'illuminazione
5,Works and looks great
5,Excelente RGB y rendimiento
5,Ive had no problems although when set to white i get some colours that are not meant to be there
5,Memória de ótima qualidade e o RGB dá o toque final! Perfeito!
5,great ram worth the money
5,Excelente producto llego 5 días antes de lo esperado y la calidad precio es de las mejores
5,item well received . Pack properly. It is way cheaper then getting it in Singapore
5,Use Ryzen DRAM calculator for a guaranteed overclock of 3600 Cl16 (at least for me YMMV).
5,easy to use with corsair app any lightmode can be configured
5,I’m in love with these! Fits my setup perfectly with the hint of white on the sides.
5,The only thing I can say about this is that I should've bought two.
2,Could only clock it into 3400MHz in my bios and was unstable when 3600 was clocked
5,las ram mas hermosas que eh tenido recomendado
5,Excelente calidad y precio muy elegantes si tienes gabinete blanco
5,Cero problemas en la instalación. Fue ponerlas y la placa base (MSI MPG X570) la reconoció al momento y les configuró el perfil XMP apropiado.Hasta el momento ningún error o problemas de rendimiento todo correcto y con la tranquilidad de la garantía que ofrece Corsair.La iluminación RGB es lo que menos me importa pero sin duda es bonita. Se puede configurar si se desea pero para mí el ciclo de colores que hace por defecto ya me vale.
5,the lightning was a bonus very well built no complaints
5,Very good
5,Easily set correct speeds after installing works great vibrant rgb

5,Estou super satisfeito com o resultado.
5,Rien à dire livraison rapideProduit bien emballer aucun pb d'installation aucun plantage les spec sont bien la et le rgb fonctionne bienLe prix très contenu de ce kit en fond a mes yeux un très bon rapport qualité/prixDommage qu'elle n'existe pas en 3600 mhz voir avec un cas plus agressif
5,Conforme à la description
1,Non compatible avec ma carte mere x570 gigabyte
5,Looks great and works as stated specs.
5,Very fast and great lighting.
5,works great for a fair price and also looks great.would definitely recommend

5,Exelente calidad llego mucho antes de lo esperado.
5,Nice rgb
4,Sono buone però mi trovavo meglio con hiperx per overclock
5,Looks great performs well
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Acquistate usato purtroppo le memorie  sono difettosi  ho avviato subito il reso e le ho acquistate nuove poi vi dirò se vanno bene.Ok memorie nuove perfette non danno segni di cedimento impostate a 3600mhz vanno benissimo e sono anche belle da vedere sono ARGB e non RGB effetti più belle  per adesso grazie ad amazon e una garanzia....
5,Buena cero problemas se ven geniales
5,it worked
5,Parfait
5,Muy buenas RAM
5,Buen producto
5,Rgb
4,I already have similar frequency RAM kit from corsair with 16 18 18 36 config. This is addition to the kit to increase the RAM size. So installing this set in addition was a task as I had to manually set the timings in BIOS which is slower than my earlier kit. First I thgt system will automatically adapt to slower settings but it did not happen and Instarted getting blue screen errors. Upon looking into BIOS I figured out that timings are still running with older RAM settings. Turning off XMP and setting voltage values to recommended values and then the timings stopped the error. Happily running the system with 64gigs of ram now.
5,Good
1,Mal
5,ram

5,
4,Dans une config blanche ça rend bien et ses performances ne sont pas décevants.
5,Working as expected Fast Delivery.
4,faites attention à votre processeur? si vous avez un Intel je vous déconseille ce RAM. elle n'est pas très optimisée... d'autres RAMS seront bien meilleurs. SI vos etes chez Amd ce RAM vous conviendras parfaitement.
5,Schneller und optisch sehr geiler RAM.Gut in Kombination mit weiteren Corsair Teilen wie AiO Wasserkühlung oder den RGB Lüftern.Sieht echt schön aus. Vor allem in einem weißen Setup.
5,Le produit correspond parfaitement à la description reçu rapidement et en parfait état.- Facile à configurer avec iCUE.- RGB parfaitement synchronisé.- Personnalisez votre RGB selon vos envies.Mon RGB  change en fonction de la température vert jaune orange rouge !
5,Montate con altre r di diverso produttore e comunque funzionano alla meraviglia oltre ad avere un aspetto curato e accattivante.
5,Buena calidad y efectos luminosos pra mi  torre recién montada.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Bester RAM den ich je hatte. Schnell und hübsch nur ICUE rafft es manchmal nicht und dann ist er beim schließen plötzlich einfarbig. War bei der AIO auch mal so vor einem Update. Kann aber net RAM nix für
5,Had 16gb but thought future proof and %lows in games would benefit from having 32gb so bought another set they are a bit more expensive than other but it’s Corsair I just love their products. I will say though that they are tall so if you have an air cooler check the height restrictions as it might not be tall enough to ride the master race train. 10/10
5,Great memory kit overclocks to 4300mhz with ease on my motherboard with 9900kf CPU deffo impressed with the performance of this memory and was at a great price what more else can I say? A************
4,C'est une très belle ram le rgb est très joli par contre quand il ya des effet comme "aquarelle" des fois le rgb de la ram reste bloquer
5,las tengo puestas en una ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming con un 5900x y va de maravilla compatibles al 100x100 lo único hay que subir a 4000 mhz manualmente desde la bios
5,Die Rams schauen super aus und erfüllen voll ihren Zweck(schnelle Zugriffszeit).Wie immer schneller Versand 👍🏻
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ottime RAM installate in abbinata ad un Ryzen 5600g e MB ASUS con Chipset B450 tengono benissimo l'O.C. fino alla frequenza dichiarata (non ho provato oltre). Esteticamente sono fantastiche: sono dotate di 6 led ARGB ognuna (ogni led è pilotabile singolarmente) inseriti in una barra in plexyglass semitrasparente. Si possono ricreare numerosi effetti di luce anche personalizzati con l'utility CORSAIR. Con un po di pazienza e i giusti plugin si possono sincronizzare con la maggior parte delle schede madri (nel mio caso con ASUS vanno alla grande).
4,Por lo general soy muy generoso con las valoraciones pero esta vez voy a comenzar por lo que no me ha gustado en cuanto al rendimiento dejan un poco que desear no son malas pero pierden contra memorias de menor frecuencia por su latencia de cl18 unas Hyperx a cl16 o cl15 muestran un desempeño mucho mejor aunque su frecuencia sea a 400 o 600mhz menos supongo que para experimentar haciendo OC modificando valores y movidas de esas esta memoria irá muy bien pero es un suponer ya que no lo he comprobado en configuraciones estándar no la recomendaría como una memoria de alto rendimiento. Otro punto que tampoco me ha gustado tiene que ver con el RGB pierde la sincronización y cada memoria va por su lado con el software ICUE se puede encontrar alguna configuración donde esto no moleste pero uno de los cuatro módulos funcionaba al revés que los otros tres y no hubo manera de corregirlo quizás la halla pero yo no lo ve visto cosa que le juega en contra porque debería ser "instalar y usar" así de fácil. Después el diseño es muy bueno a mi me ha encantado en eso se lleva un Diez y lástima lo del rgb porque creo que es uno de los más brillantes uniformes y bonitos que he visto es muy bueno el color de la luz. Quiero marcar como detalle no como defecto que son muy altas por lo que si el sócalo está muy cerca de procesador el disipador chocará irremediablemente con la memoria por lo tanto verificad ese detalle en el diseño de la placa base antes de comprarlas con sistema de bomba eso no tiene importancia pero con disipadores grandes si. En fin un gran producto que se queda corto al rematar su concepto memoria de alto rendimiento que rinde discretamente el mejor rgb que he visto en ram pero que no tiene una buena sincronización y un diseño premium que enamora pero que puede ser un problema con otro hardware le daría un 8 si en estos días consigo sacarle más el jugo le daré 5 estrellas y justificaré el porqué de ello. Saludos.
5,Top
5,Performanti e bellissime da vedere io controllo le luci dal software iCue di Corsair dove si possono creare varie combinazioni di colori in modo semplice è possibile creare colori personalizzati abbassare la luminosità o spegnerli del tutto infine per sfruttare la velocità a 3200MHz bisogna attivare l'impostazione dal bios è facilissimo :)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Acheter couplé à un 5500x mon pc renaît !Utilisés pour du codage web du jeux vidéo et des exports vidéos c'est vraiment top!J'ai choisis ce modèle pour la fréquence des rams et la garantie a vie.Il fait cependant débloquer cette haute fréquence dans le bios de la carte mère sinon c'est bridé et cela fait sauter la garantie.Moi je l'utilise tel quelle pour l'instant pas besoin de plus c'est vraiment rapide.
5,3面モニターで使ってます。動画見ながら配信してゲームしても32GB余るくらいです
5,Perfect for my new all white rig. Would recommend to anyone for the price to performance!
5,Ottime RAM dalle performance notevoli una volt aggiustata la velocità nel BIOS vano alla grande!
5,Sobre élégant fonctionnel
5,Edit:Je modifie mon commentaire car les barrettes fonctionne très bien.Il faut bien penser à connecter toutes les alimentations à la carte mère (2 x 8 pin ATX) pour mon cas sur une MSI EDGE Z590.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 ram looks great but i received one that's doesn't  have the rgb working at all no matter the fixes i've tried and been suggested the ram it self is working but not the point for the price point have been able to receive a replacement from amazon free of charge 👍 (overall great looking ram and works great just unfortunate i received one with the rgb not working ( UPDATE ) have received my placement ram and all is good 👍👌
4,Qualität und Leistung ist definitiv um einiges besser als herkömmliche OEM Arbeitsspeicher welche ich davor für meinen build verwendet hatte.Der Preis is für die Leistung perfekt viel kostengünstiger and andere Anbieter. Das Kit sieht sehr schön aus vor allem mit anderen weißen Komponenten die RGB Beleuchtung ist super lässt sich super leicht anpassen dank der iCue Software.XMP ist leider absolut nicht möglich ich weiß nicht ob es lediglich an meinem Kit lag aber es ist definitiv sehr schwer zu overclocken ohne dass es ständig irgendwelche Einstürze folgen. Musste mehrmals BIOS zurücksetzen und andere Einstellungen probieren damit es dann endlich auf 3200Hz ging.
5,Estéticamente son preciosas las cosas como son. El rgb funciona perfectamente y el software de ICUE también. No olvidéis configurar la bios para sacarle todo el partido (XMP enable).
5,performant
5,Bought it at 277 euro because firstly I needed to upgrade my 16gbs Corsair Rgb Pro 3200 to jmprove my Pc's performance in video editing and secondly because I wanted to have a full white buildThis kit is awesome. Paired it with a 5900x and a  RTX 3080ti on a Gigabhte B550D-P motherboard.Everything works great and worked perfectly from the start XMP was enabled from my previous set and was still on after I switched to the 64gb kitMy Pc has gotten new life and I can open two three or more Vegas application while rendering and it will still keep working flawlessly.Gaming is on another level with so much Ram and with at 3600mhz it is the perfect pair for a Ryzen processor.I checked the kit with Typhoon it turns out it probablt has Samsung B-die chips on it just like my previous 3200 DDR4 kit. From what j have seen if you are lucky your corsair kit had a high chance to have bdie memory on it.Thanks Amazon for the price and the quick delivery.
5,Ram très simple à installées et jolie.Jamais déçu avec Corsair
5,Alors tout d'abord ces barettes respirent le haut de gamme.le packaging est sobre mais efficace a la vue.Celle ci furent montées sur une asus b550 xe wifiDonc pour la reconnaissances des 3600mhz aucun souci mais il vous faudra parcourirble bios pour les paramétrer car par défaut Celle-ci passe automatiquement en 3200 MhzEn ce qui concerne le rgb tout est possible en therme de configuration via le programme corsair hue a téléchargerSimple efficaceEt pour les performances de ces barettes la rapport qualité prix il n'y a pas mieux avis personnel biensurJ 'ai testé les mêmes références en c16 et je peux confirmer et contredire ceux qui pense que le c18 n'apporte pas grand chose en therme de performance.Moi je dis si de 10 a 20% surtout en traitement vidéo et 5 a 10% en gaming.Et pour ce qui est de la stabilité on est a 100%.Après il faut la carte mère adéquate en ce qui concerne celle couplé avec ces barettes b550 xe c 'est l'une des meilleurs en condo refroidissement.Vive corsair.
5,I’m very new to PC building and parts however without a guide it was very easy to replace my 2X 8gb of ram with no issue.
5,La ram est OK rien à dire on peut désactiver les lumières en installant le logiciel une fois et en désactivant par contre elle vont consommer + et chauffer ca reste normal
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Mon fils était trop content pour son PC gamer d'avoir des barrettes qui s'allument. Je ne sais pas si sur la vidéo on voit bien mais les couleurs ne défilent pas forcement en même temps pour les 2 barrettes ce qui est du plus bel effet. Facile à installer elles fonctionnent parfaitement
5,Taktet auf 3200 mhz und läuft auch sehr stabil mit einem Asus PRIME X570-PRO Mainboard.
5,Came on time easy setup with ICUE. Get what you see
4,Après l’achat d’un nouveau pc j’ai oublié de vérifier la compatibilité de cette RAM avec ma carte mère Asus tuf gaming Z690-PLUS WIFI D4 et un Intel i7 12700kfDu coup elles sont bridées à 2133MHz et impossible d’activer le XMP
5,Es instalar y listo tu memoria instalada en un momento.
5,Top
5,J'ai acheté ces barrettes de RAM pour compléter un montage que j'avais commencé. Pas de surprises elles fonctionnent bien une fois le profil XMP activé dans le bios pour atteinte les 3200 MHz c'est une affaire qui roule. Ce sont également un bon rapport qualité/prix quand on voit que certaine sont bien au dessus en terme de prix pour des performances similaires.Le colis est arrivé en bon état et dans les temps comme d'habitude.
5,Très bonne qualité
5,molto belle nient'altro da aggiungere
5,
5,Io ho comprato 32GB di ram in 4 stick da 8gb 3200 mhz cl16 e sono perfette. Montaggio ovviamente istantaneo con un click si inseriscono. RGB affascinante con luci molto luminose e colorate. Prezzo veramente basso a mio avviso (160 euro totale). Unico neo bisogna tenere iCUE installato e aperto per coordinare gli rgb con MSI Mystic Light.
4,La verdad que merece la pena la compra muy bonita las ram en breve las probaré y dejaré un comentario más específico. Pongo 4 estrellas por que tardo un mes y medio en llegar me parece demasiado pero bueno lo importante es que llego.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Really good ram it performs really well for gaming and i had no problems installing the ram i paired this with an intel build with a core i5 10400f at first when i booted it up iy was only running at 2133 mhz but all i had to do was enable thw xmp profile in the bios and now im running 3600 mhz with absolutely no issues so for performance this set of ram is a great option especially if you want to customize the rgb lights this has a great software app with good custimization it has so many colours and light modes and you can change each individual led on each ram module for example i made the ireland flag and it looks great so if you like rgb and you want good performance i'd highly recommend this kit of ram
4,Super produit en soit  par contre pas forcément compatible avec toute les cartes mèresExemple Asus rog strix z690 a-gaming d4A part sa super produit
4,Fonctionne correctement
5,I love it. Definitely not worth the price considering non RGB variants but i wanted RGB white plate so here we are.Great quality worked right out the box XMP an all.Nothing more to say.
3,Dan problemas a 3200 mhz las he logrado poner a 2999
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Exactement comme dans la description
5,Excellent elle tourne bien en 3200 MHz sous le profil XMP j'avais déjà les mêmes en 2x8 go pris pour passer a 32Go toujours a 3200 MHz aucune modification du Bios requises si le Profil XMP est actif.
5,Ottime ram i colori sono bellissimi molto prestanti come funzionalità e design stupendo
5,Las puse junto a una B450 y un 5600x y todo perfecto nada que destacar.
5,Just remember to enable in bios
5,B550  MSIマザーボードとの相性が良いと思います。BOOTエラーランプが点灯の改善がされ快適に使える様になりました。
5,Top Produkt von Corsair.Benutze die RAM von Corsair nun schon seit gut 15 Jahren.Und jedes mal super zufrieden.Auch dieses mal wieder mit dem 64gb 3200mhz kit.Passt perfekt zu meinem ALL white build.Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,A la base j’avais pris 4x8go en Ballistix 4500mhz mais ma CM Asus strix B550F gaming ne supportait pas cette fréquence et la gestion des RGB était catastrophique résultat j’ai renvoyé les Ballistix pour ces Corsair 2x16go en 3600 parfaitement compatible avec ma B550 le rendu RGB est vraiment très joli la gestion se fait aussi bien avec Aura sync qu’avec icue. J’attends une belle offre pour en recommander 2 autres similaires ne serait ce que pour le RGB car je n’ai pas l’utilité de 64go

Les Barrettes de RAM 2x8GB 3600Mhz sont l'outil idéal pour un processeur de chez "AMD". Les LED ont un rendu visuel très satisfaisant qui ravira les gamers pour le côté esthétique du PC.Pour les jeux vidéos mon ordinateur fait tourner "Call of Duty VANGUARD entre 180 et 220 FPS ce qui est un vrai plaisir.Rapport qualité prix c'est pour moi un bon compromis pour allier performance et esthétique visuelle.Je vous recommande cet article.Ma configuration :-Processeur : "AMD Ryzen 7 5800X"-Carte-mère : "ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (Wifi)"-Barette de RAM : "Corsair VENGEANCE RGB" 2x8 GB 3600MHz CL16-SSD Interne : "Western Digital" 1 To 3430 Mo/s-Refroidisseur watercooling : "MSI MAG CORELIQUID C240"-Alientation : "Corsair RM 850x"-Carte graphique : "GIGABYTE Nvidia Geforce RTX 3070"
5,Belle e potenti.Ho raggiunto 3600 MHz senza problemi con la mia mobo asus z690 gaming aGli rgb sono bellissimi e si controllano con Icue di corsair. Un software carino ma ancor molto pieno di bug sfortunatamente.
4,Superbe barette de ram très jolie le RGB est incroyable mais attention pour mon cas j'ai un proc INTEL et j'ai du activer le XMP dans le bios pour qu'elles fonctionnent.
5,Perfect
5,RGB is definitely higher quality than other brands i've used the kit was easily set up the right MHz
4,Au début ne fonctionnaient pas avec le XMP avec ma carte mère Z370 aorus ultra gaming. J'ai dû aller dans le bios pour bidouiller et cela a marché après avoir réglé la gestion de la ram en priorisant la stabilité au lieu du mode normal.
5,Easy to install great visual and good price
5,Running at 3200mhz and looking very nice
5,J'en avais déjà achetée auparavant cette fois j'en ai repris pour doubler la capacité de mon PC. Comme toujours aucun souci avec le matériel la RAM à directement été reconnue par le PC ainsi que par le logiciel iCUE qui gère les leds.Ce modèle est à mon sens une valeur sûr pour ceux qui souhaite avoir de la ram stable et performante avec une touche de lumière pour éclairer ses soirées de jeux.Attention ce modèle est cependant un peu haut ce qui pourrait gêner le ventirad faire vraiment attention à ce détails elles sont vachement hautes !
5,easy to instal and performs great
4,Die ram sticks sind optisch sehr schön und gut verarbeitet . schöne abwechslung zu corsaor vegance rgb pro denn sieht man mir persönlich zu oft . finde den rs auch schöner
5,Good Ram looks good.
3,J'ai pris 128 GO de ram en 4x32 go..Elles sont soit disant en ddr4 pc3200Avec une carte mère thomahawk de MSIQui supporte d'énorme fréquence de ramCes Barrette ne dépasse pas les 2700mhzAu delà de 2700mhz vous aller avoir des écran bleu d'erreur Windows plantage sur plantage et instabilité système.. obliger de reboot en CMOS pour a nouveau corrigé les fréquences des barrettes sinon écran noir au démarrage de l'ordinateur.. franchement pour une marque d'une tel renommée mentir sur les fréquences je trouve ça vraiment honteux de leur part...Vue le prix fallait pas s'étonner de la supercherie.. pour du vrai 3200mhz compter 120€ de plus sur le prix en plus.Je les gardes quand même pour 2700mhz..Elles sont d'aspet de qualité et rgb de bonne nuance.En brefPas de 3200mhz même sur la meilleur carte mère d'overock. Maximum 2700mhz.. a prendre ou à laisser.
4,Problemi di compatibilità con Aura sync non riesco a comandare gli effetti RGB tramite il software di Asus
5,Produit commander bien reçu arriver 4 jours avant la date prévue prix incroyable pour les caractéristiques de ce produit je recommande à 100% 👌
5,pour le prix aucun défaut ram de très bonne qualité avec de très beau effet d'éclairage et très facile a contrôler avec ICUE.
5,Puntuali - Ho comprato un PC con 32gb di Ram della stessa marca già sù installate al volo e funzionano benissimo.. Ora con 64gb di Ram il Pc è mostruoso!!
5,Great looking rgb also easy to overclock to 3200mhz
5,LED‘s sehen sehr gut aus die RAM machen was sie sollen
5,2 barrettes de 16Go chacune qui ont donné un coup de boost à mon ordi qui en avait qu’une de 8go à la base. Produit de qualité aucun problème les leds ça rend bcp plus classe. Allez les y les yeux fermés.
4,Barrettes sympa en rgb facile a configurer via icue de corsair.Pas les plus rapides dans ce niveau de prix par contre
5,This is more than what you would get for the price. It was 100$ at the time of purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Nice rgb easily customised with softwareGood value for moneyMake sure you enable xmp in bios to get it to run at the full speed your mother may  not automatically set it for you
3,Con más fallos que aciertos poco a poco voy alejándome de los dispositivos Corsair.PRESENTAN INCOMPATIBILIDADES ENTRE LOS PRODUCTOS DE LA MISMA MARCA a pesar que se adquieren a un precio notablemente más elevado que la competencia.Es penoso que el software funcione así breakeado por completo cuando son artículos QUE SE PAGAN.Tengo un ratón de la misma marca/gama que constantemente tengo que desconectar y conectar para que sea reconocido por la placa base que además es una Asus de gama lujo asiático.Nunca más.
4,only thing from stopping me giving this a 5 is the rgb lighting for some reason it randomly changes colors somtimes.
5,Muy buena con Ryzen 5 3600 i gráfica XR550 TI
5,安値の時に購入(10600円)した。安いので心配したが、今の処安定。12700+msi Toma wifidd4にて運用。耐久性はこれから検証(特にLED)。但し、ソフト ICUE4は最悪です。照明設定した後はアンインストールしたほうが良い。
5,I installed this set in one of my work stations got full speed right away. no bios update needed either.
5,Funktioniert wie es soll.
5,Pour le moment 2x8Go je doublerais le nombre de barrettes à l'occasion pour avoir 4x8GoTrès belles avec le mode RGB pluie c'est pas que cosmétique ces RGB c'est très fengshui aussi ^^ finalement le tunning PC c'est pas aussi kitch que sur une clio sport ;) allez pour 10€ de plus 5€/barrette ça vaut le coup de prendre avec led !
5,自作PC用に購入しました。光るPCにしたくて選びました。コスパも良いと思う。
3,お買い得感は有ります！安定性は凄く良いですね！耐久性はまだ1ヶ月使用ですので未だ解りません！
3,Une barrette à lâchée rapidement mais j’en ai reçu de nouvelles sans soucis. A voir si elles tiennent dans le temps!
5,Es wurden 2*8 GB RAM in weiss gekauft. ( Waren günstiger als in schwarz) sehr gut verpackt und kam pünktlich an. Die RGB sehen für meine Anforderungen sehr schick aus.
5,alte si ma neanche tanto anzi ho visto di peggio queste sono belle a vedersi con effetti luminosi molto forti e chiari la luce che non sfarfalla se messe sotto stress. acquistato quelle da 3600MHz in confezione da 2 da 8Gb e con reattività al CL18 che dire se non...che le stra/consiglio.
2,Ero riuscito a prendere in offerta al Black Friday esteticamente stupende con iCue praticamente puoi fare quel che ti pare MA... Appena montate su una Z390 Aorus Master sembrava tutto ok dopo circa una mezz'ora ho notato che gli effetti luce si bloccavano. Inutile la reinstallazione di device e driver. Il problema colpiva anche l'M.2 Aorus RGB che praticamente laggava quando veniva eseguito l'effetto sulle RAM. A questo si aggiunge che ad ogni arresto del sistema non si spegneva correttamente di conseguenza ad ogni avvio dovevo reimpostare il BIOS e ad ogni reimpostazione shut down anomalo e riavvio automatico. Non finisce qui la cosa peggiore deve ancora arrivare. La cosa COMICA è che impostando gli effetti luce da RGB Fusion (quindi senza impostare effetti su iCue) funzionavano bene l'ho fatto vedere anche in live stream! L'unico problema rimaneva l'arresto del sistema anomalo che bypassavo con la sospensione e il riavvio quando serviva. Ovviamente ho contattato l'assistenza Corsair qui arriva il peggio! La loro incapacità è disarmante non leggono i messaggi e danno le solite guide che ovviamente non potranno mai risolvere un problema così. Sembra che non gli importi nulla. La cosa terrificante è che per colpa loro le RAM hanno smesso di funzionare con RGB Fusion non sono più riuscito a far andare le RAM con RGB Fusion addirittura spariva l'M.2 Aorus RGB e l'effetto luce rimaneva freezato. Ovviamente disinstallare RGB Fusion non risolve il problema. Dopo quasi 2 mesi di contatto con l'assistenza che rispondono una volta a settimana se va bene il problema stava peggiorando perciò ho deciso di effettuare il reso. Per fortuna c'è Amazon!Morale della favola?! Se avete mobo Aorus (Gigabyte) evitatele assolutamente.
5,It has been about 5 months and it still works perfectly fine
5,le RT hanno estetica diversa e hanno 10 LED rgb all'interno invece di 7 LED RGB
5,Well done but struggling to turn out the leds
5,Bis jetzt laufen die Riegel einwandfrei und sehen dabei noch super aus!Wer jedoch nicht so sehr auf RGB steht sollte sich nach einer andern Lösung umschauen.5/5 !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Der mit Abstand schönste RAM auf dem Markt.
5,Trop classe dans un boîtier translucide ! Efficace et réactives.
5,Ottime ram per un uso estremo del pc gaming. Marca che non ha bisogno di presentazione ormai ho fatto tutta la configurazione corsair per avere un ecosistema unico. Ram ddr4 da 16gb a 3200 Mhz raggiungibili in XMP da Bios. Ovviamente non potevano mancare i led rgb posti frontalmente. Disponibilità colori bianco o nero io sto facendo tutta la postazione bianca che all'occhio si presenta molto elegante e unico. Rgb personalizzabile dal suo programma iCue molto intuitivo. Sono disponibili ovviamente anche a frequenze più alte ma dipende sempre dall'uso che ne fate. Io per giocare a giochi fps competitivi e navigare sul web mi reputo più che soddisfatto  e non raggiungo mail l'80% di utilizzo. Ma non escludo "per estetica" di aggiungerne altre due. Non proprio economiche ma si sa la qualità si paga. Ottime.
5,Raccomando.
5,Prodotto impeccabile esteticamente bellissime ed anche gli RGB non sono a meno. Gestibili interamente tramite software proprietario (iCue) spettacolari sotto ogni punto di vista. Le consiglio a mani basse
4,Di esser belle son belle ma prestazionalmente parlando per me non valgono la cifra spesa.Sarò sfigato io che mi saranno arrivate delle RAM non proprio fortunate ma non riescono nemmeno a tenere l'XMP su una X570 abbastanza costosa. Dovevo intuire la qualità (non proprio eccelsa) di queste memorie già dai timings molto alti (18-22-22-22 se non erro).Purtroppo chi ha un sistema full corsair è costretto a ripiegare su queste se vuole sincronizzare tutto.In ogni caso non sono ram da quattro soldi non fraintentendetemi ma sicuramente si trova di meglio allo stesso prezzo se non addirittura a qualcosa in meno.
5,J'ai acheter ce produit pour mon pc gamer rapport qualité prix au top facile à installer en plus sa customise ma tour de pc. Envoie du colis rapide et soigner je recommande sans hésiter
4,Habe nun zum zweiten mal ein Kit nachgekauft die erstem halten immernoch top allerdings gibt es bei dem ein oder anderem Mainboard probleme mit dem Speichertakt vonn3200Mhz. Dafür sieht der Arbeitsspeicher echt gut verarbeitet aus und fühlt sich auch qualitativ hochwertig an.
2,The sticker seal on the product was already undone when I opened the package
3,I'm going to be honest I bought this RAM for the "aesthetics" more than the performance and boy was I disappointed.The RAM looks the part it really does I do not have an ill-will against the design features of this RAM but where it falls completely and utterly short is on it's timings. It operates under 18-22-22-42 and for the CL18 this is rather slow if corsair had managed to go for better quality DIMMS and gave us CL16? then it would have been acceptable but when competitors such as Crucial and GSKILL are offering this in abundance? It's just not really a fair comparison.The RAM does perform well at it's desired speeds but I was definitely hoping for more.Good not great.
5,Swapped these modules for a Corsair 16Gb 3000mhz kit and it couldnt have been easier boot into bios turned on XMP picked up the speeds and correct memory size straight away 100% recommend
5,Queste ram sono a parità di prezzo fantastiche ma attenzione! Le ram corsair non sono regolarmente supportate (almeno fino ad oggi) dalle schede madri della msi montare queste ram su una scheda madre non asus provocherà il suono di scollegamento della periferica da sistema e il riavvio costante dei led non un grosso problema di ma scomodo ed è sempre meglio evitarlo in fase di acquisto! Quindi abbinatele ad una scheda asus e funzionerà tutto perfettamente! Scaricate poi il programma iCue che serve per il controllo luci e monitoraggio delle prestazioni!
5,Ya disponía de dos módulos iguales a estos de cuando monté mi PC pero las necesidades de ahora tras meter una gráfica RTX3070 y otros factores han hecho que comprara otros dos modulos más para así dispones de 32 GB de RAM.No he tenido que hacer nada solo abrir la ventana de cristal del PC meter los dos modulos en sus ranuras 1 y3 Creo y nada mas arrancar el PC la BIOS me las ha reconocido.Una vz hecho esto he arrancado windows y este también las reconoce por lo que ya solo me quedaba configurarlas con iCUE. Lo he abierto las he seleccionado y las he metido en la configuración. Ahora van a la par que el resto de ventiladores  Corsair y bomba de RL del AMD 7 3700X que corre en mi PC.Recomiendo estas memorias por su buen rendimiento y por su ajustado precio. Ahora están algo mas caras por el tema del Covid pero se pueden encontrar mas adelante mas baratas.Espero haberte ayudado un poco.
5,Certains vous diront de prendre le modèle au dessus mais franchement ça fait le taff et on ne sent pas la différence.
5,RBG最高！今は2枚ざしなので追加購入して光らせたいとおもいます。
5,Me compre la primera vez 2 modulos para ver que tal y me gusto ucho y al final compre otros dos mas. En total 32Gb. Ya llevo un par de meses y todo va muy bien. Por eso no he puesto nigun calificativo hasta ahora porque queria ver mas tarde si hay alguna problema pero no. Recomiendo este producto.
3,Does what it says and works with XMP. Using a new Z690 Asus Strix and could not OC those above 3200 avoid if you are interested in overclocking. Not stable above 3200.
5,Next Generation Software: Take control in CORSAIR iCUE software and synchronize lighting with other CORSAIR RGB products including CPU coolers keyboards and fans.Custom Performance PCB: Provides the highest signal quality for the greatest level of performance and stability.Tightly Screened Memory: Carefully screened ICs for extended overclocking potential.Maximum Bandwidth and Tight Response Times: Optimized for peak performance on the latest Intel and AMD DDR4 motherboards.
5,Meine Tochter wollte einen PC mit Corsair Komponenten. Und die Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO  Ram Riegel waren ihr  Wunsch. Allerdings die 3200 MHz waren meine Entscheidung. Die Riegel stecken auf einem Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming II Mainboard (AM 4 Sockel). Und diese Board steckt in einem Corsair (iCUE 220T RGB Airflow Gehärtetes Glas) Mid-Tower ATX  Gaming Gehäuse. Also die Riegel funktionieren Perfekt und sehen echt schick aus. Allerdings möchte man dann noch eine Corsair Hydro 100i RGB Platinum SE mit 240-mm-Kühler oben im Gehäuse montieren dann hat man ein Platzproblem! Fehlt ca. ein halber cm. Das ist einfach der Größe der Riegel geschuldet. Darauf möchte ich eigentlich mit dieser Rezension hinweisen! In Verbindung mit einem Ryzen 7 1700x laufen die Rams nicht auf 3200 MHz! Das war mir aber von vornherein Klar. Aus Budget gründen ist es erstmal auch nur ein gebrauchter 1700x geworden. Der wird aber noch gegen ein 3700x ersetzt und dann sind die 3200 MHz mit Sicherheit drin.
4,この製品をつかうならasusのマザーボードにしたほうがいい　ドライバーが使いにくい＆不安定　見た目は白でとてもきれい
5,Speicher bisher top keine Probleme. Über die Langzeiterfahrung kann man noch nichts sagen  daher keine 5 Sterne. Die letzten Speicher von Corsair wurden vor über 7 Jahren gekauft und laufen heute noch einwandfrei auf einem Asus P8P67 LE mit nem Intel i5-2500k.Diese hier sind auf einem Asus Tuf Gaming Z590 plus WiFi installiert
4,Icue consomme de la bande passante par à coups ce qui est peu optimal
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               1万切りで安かったので2セット購入win11付属のメモリ診断では問題ありませんでした。耐久性はまだわかりませんRGBに惹かれて買ったのですがCORSAIR iCUEを初めて使ってみたのですが同社製品のみ同期出来るのかな？ちょっと判らなかった。Asrock H570 phantom gaming4の対応RGBソフトウェアではメモリの項目では操作出来ず、i-CUEのメモリ設定では明るさ含め詳細まで設定出来ました。深く掘り下げてまで設定しようと思わなかったので他のRGB製品と同様にレインボー設定で使用しています。このメモリだけ最初は同期して段々ズレてく感じで一定のサイクルこなすとまた同期するような感じですね。単色使用では関係無いし、光るだけで良いなら気にはならないかもしれませんが。とにかく問題無く使えて光るメモリが欲しいならお薦めです。自分は4スロットに2本のみよりかは4本全部埋めたい派かな32Gは絶対使わないけど。ちなみに起動初期では動作クロックが3200で動いて無かったのでXMP2.0を読み込む必要がありました。OCメモリですので対応マザーは要確認ですね追記 CORSAIRのRGB管理ソフト i-CUEは自分の常駐アプリの中ではダントツにメモリ食いでした(自分の環境で500MB程度)このメモリを使用する方はゲーミング用途だと思うので問題は無いと思いますし32G全てを消費するとは通常運用ではありえ無いでしょうが増設メモリのくせに多少のシステム管理と光アニメーションだけでメモリ食いとはもう少し考えて作って欲しい
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Works fine LEDs look nice and with iCUE has a lot of creative possibilities for lighting. Only complaint is with iCUE not the actual RAM. iCUE is not really reliable as it will crash or need restarting after a few hours. Or worse it'll stop detecting the hardware and needs completely closing and opening to try and detect it again. However even the default LED lighting without iCUE looks nice.But I feel you could get more for your money if you don't use iCUE or don't like it crashing regularly if only affecting cosmetics.
5,
4,Non starò qui ad indicare le statistiche tecniche poiché ci saranno altri 10 mila recensioni che ne parleranno approfonditamente.l'unico consiglio che dò è notare bene la lunghezza poiché su un case ATX non vi darà la possibilità (molto probabilmente) di poter mettere il  radiatore del raffreddamento a liquido al di sopra di esse
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               RGBが綺麗でパフォーマンスも申し分無いです。最高です。値段は高めですが、仕方ありませんね。
5,Top
5,Marche très bien sur ma l'ASUS B550-F ROG STRIX  par contre ne pas oublier d'activer l'option XMP (intel) ou DOCP (AMD) pour profiter des 3 200 Mhz sinon les mémoires fonctionneront à 2166 Mhz.Pour activer le DOCP sur l'ASUS B550-F ROG STRIX => Bios (touche sup ou F2 au démarrage) -> Menu AI Tweaker -> Dans l'option AI Overclock Tuner choisissez l'option D.O.C.P. => Quittez en sauvegardant ==> A vous les 3200 Mhz
5,Super content  de ces magnifique  ram de chez corsair ne pas oublier d'activer  le XMP sur le bios pour passer avoir les 3200mhz sinon d'origine  elle son en 2133 mhz bloqué  si en activant  comme sur les carte mère b450 vous avez un écran  noir fait la mise a jour bios puis réessayer  si toujours  pas désactiver  le xmp et entrer manuellement  les référence  des ram  que du bonheur
4,Ho restituito questo prodotto solo perchè mi servivano 64GB ma su 2 moduli e non su 4; acquistato lo stesso prodotto 2 x 32GB funziona benissimo molto stabile prestazioni davvero superbe (testate con Ryzen 9 3900X).Dispone (scaricabile) di una propria utility per la gestione dell'RGB che oltre ai vari effetti già predefiniti e personalizzabili permette anche la gestione dell'intensità luminosa (sono davvero molto luminose ad intensità piena). Unica piccola pecca l'RGB non è compatibile con Aura Sync di ASUS e quindi va gestita a parte.
3,Ottime RAM ho preso le 3200 c16 a 156€ circa e devo dire che vanno abbastanza bene.La gestione dei led è facilissima e finalmente funzionante senza tante rotture grazie ad iCue (il motivo principale per cui le ho prese) che rispetto ad altri software funziona decentemente.L'unico neo è il fatto che abbiano chip B-Die il che non è niente male a questo prezzo peccato che in OC salgano praticamente 0 cosa che non ci si aspetterebbe da delle B-Die.Per cui se avete intenzione di fare overclock alle ram optate per altro...se invece vi basta la frequenza ed i timings stock allora vanno molto bene.
5,Ich besitze den Corsair vengence RT diesen habe ich mir bei einen Umbau auf Corsair zugelegt erstmals gab es Schwierigkeiten das der PC den ram nicht erkannt hat jedoch nach einem BIOS reset würde alles erkannt und funktionierte. Der ram hält ein was er verspricht
5,Très joli ds le pcVigilance sur le prix d’un à l’autre
5,It’s cheap while having fast speeds of 3600mhz (assuming you enable xmp in the bios like any other ram) and awesome adjustable rgb which the Icue software is good for controlling and adding custom rgb profiles!
5,Es una ram bastante buena rápida estable el problema es que es cara.
4,Ok
5,Bought these a replacement item because the original RAM I ordered was not compatible with Aorus X570 chipset motherboards where as these sticks ARE Aorus compatible. Great RAM. Performs well and overclocks nicely.
5,Habe mir gleich 4 Riegel je 16 GB eingebaut.Geiz ist hier falsch am Platz !
5,Super Speicher. Sieht schick aus läuft stabil bei 135V auf 4000MHz. Was will man mehr. Kaufempfehlung.
5,Produit très satisfaisant ma dernière commande était des 8GO de ram il y a 4 ans. N'ayant pas était déçu par la marque Corsair j'ai décidé de prendre 2X16GO.Plus d'un mois d'utilisation et ça change beaucoup j'avais des soucis de chargement dans les jeux vidéos comme GTA 5 Civilisation6 etc.Maintenant c'est super stable et j'ai étais surpris du changementBon rapport qualité-prix design sympa et une marque de confiance.
5,Tres bon produit performance comme attendu pour une DDR4 3600. Aucun problème de température. Elle est compatible sans problem avec CM Asus Rog Strix X570 mais attention Asus la met par défaut a 2133 Mhz il faut utiliser le AI Tweaker dans le BIOS pour la passer à une frequence supérieure. Je n'ai pas essayé de customiser le RGB c'est pas mon truc mais ca semble de très bonne facture. Note valable pour toutes les barettes de RAM pas seulement celle-là : si vous voulez ajouter des nouvelles barettes sur un PC donc avez overclocké la RAM remettez le BIOS en valeurs standard (non-oerclocké) avant de mettre les nouvelles barettes sinon ca ne va pas booter.
5,good ram
5,So I needed 64gb of ram to use in After Effects for large projects or to use for using multiple editing programmes opened at the same time.There's not a huge amount to say they work my programmes used all 64gb as a RAM Preview and I did notice a difference. I have an Intel 8700k but understand the AMD CPU's like 3600 so I went for that for when I eventually upgrade.They look fun but I don't really care for RGB it just happened to be good value for money at the moment I bought them so either way the rainbow effect is more funny to me that something I care about but they're definitely working if that helps!I had no issues with XMP and they read as 3600 so all in all I'm happy with them!
5,Super RAM die Installation war einfach und ging schnell. Die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten für den RGB Streifen sind nahezu endlos und durch iCUE super einfach und schnell einzustellen. Bin mega zufrieden. gerne wieder.
5,I've just upgraded my whole setup and the new PC contains 4 x 32 GB (= 128 GB) RAM; each of them being that above described product. It's (as expected) literally plug'n'play. The only think I had to figure out was the order of the RAM objects in the RGB setup software so that the spectrum effect doesn't look like a randomizer. This however only took not more than a minute of empiric testing with a few clicks and visual checks. In the end that's just ecstatic's and what matters is the memory amount speed quality and build quality. And here it's all 5 of 5 stars. I would buy that again if I'd had to. ;-)
4,今のところなにも問題は起こっていないのですが、四枚組で使うために二個まとめて買ったところ、同じ製品だけれどもバージョン違いが届いた…バージョン違いと言うことは、何かが違うわけなので、相性問題が起こりやすいメモリは、揃えておいて欲しかったかな～と言う気持ち。パッと見は全く同じです。バージョンによる違いは調べても解らず…上記は製品の問題ではないので、評価自体は悪くないです。Intel i7 12700k、z690 steel legendの組み合わせで、一緒に元気に動いてくれています。綺麗に光ってはいますが、電源をいれてすぐは設定を無視してレインボーに派手に派手派手に輝いてくれるのが難点です。これなんとかできるのかな…？設定するためのコルセアのソフトウェアの使い方も今一つ解りづらい…。
5,All ok no issues errors etc
4,Como memoria no he podido analizarla bien pero mi placa la reconoció bien no ha dado fallos... vamos lo esperado.Ahora los LED no he podido configurarlos con Asus aunque indican compatibilidad. Además los cambié por ese motivo (Amazon prefecto como siempre con las devoluciones y problemas) y tampoco funcionaron. Desconozco la causa pero es un fastidio pagar tanto para luego tener unas luces a su bola.
4,Good product. Beautiful. Love the design. Could probably find for a better price but I could only find on Amazon. Also after a while the RGB would both be in different speeds until I booted up Icue when turning on. Probably an easy fix. Beautiful beautiful product in look and function.
4,Joli par rapport aux RGB sur ses barrettes en jouant avec le logiciel de Corsair iCue en fonction de l'application utiliséPerformances au rendez-vous j'ai pu passer à 32 Go de RAM en les rajoutantAttention à sa taille les aircooling auront du mal à accueillir des barrettes de cette taille (Be Quiet Pure Rock me concernant)Incompatible ma carte mère MSI Z270 PC MATE n'acceptant pas vraiment ce modèle de RAM. Au bout de 1 semaine j'avais mon PC qui n'affichait plus rien sur mes écrans sachant que le PC démarrait bien entendu.J'ai dû les renvoyer dommage

5,Its corsair. Cant get any better than that on a budget.
5,Alles wie es sein soll. Super RAM Kits!
5,💽💽💽Compradas en dos pedidos unas a 8799€ y los otros dos módulos a 6999€.No soy experto en memorias RAM y tan solo he probado este modelo pero he de decir que estoy muy contento.Son módulos de 8gb a 3200mhz.Asegúrate de que tú placa base admita estas frecuencias y activar el perfil XMP para exprimirlas al máximo.Tienen iluminación RGB configurable a través de software iCue de Corsair.Las temperaturas están en la media y no se sobrecalientan por lo que la disipación es correcta.En principio instalé 16gb y van de maravilla. Posteriormente aprovechando la oferta adquirí los otros dos módulos.Pc utilizado para programas de gestión de información geográfica que requiere cierta potencia y se nota la diferencia de 16gb a 32.👇 Vota si te ha parecido útil 👇
4,ASUSのAura Sync と同期させるためには、corsairのサイトからICUEとASUSマザーボード用のパッチを当ててやる必要があります。Aura Syncはただでさえメモリを食うのに、ICUEもバックグラウンドで動かしていなければならないので、メモリは余裕を十分に持って購入することをおすすめします。（同期無し、虹色でパチ屋のような光り方で良ければ上記作業は不要です）
5,i built my new PC consisting of Ryzen 7 2700 + RTX 2060 Super + MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX & was going for a white/black build with some RGB for a bit of flairwhen i saw these 3200mhz RAM sticks on offer over black friday i had to pick these up & i was not disappointedThe speed of the RAM is perfect and i get the full speed out of themthe RGB can be controlled by motherboard software like MSI Mystic Light or via the Corsair iCUE software (i opted for iCUE due to also using Corsair fans)The price of RAM has dropped significantly the last 12 months 3200mhz 16GB RAM for £89.99 a year a go you would have been lucky to get 8GB for that price!very pleased and would definitely buy corsair RAM again
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               8GB x 2枚の16GBで自作しましたが、もう2枚買い足して32GBにしました。色もソフトウェアで設定出来るし、アニメーション効果も幾つもの用意されているので工夫次第では色々出来そうです。ケースFANと色を合わせてみました。
4,I bought (2) 2x8gb kits to make up 32gb to use in my system the low profile is nice alongside the same looks as the vengenace pro however my motherboard indicated i had a dram issue with one of the sticks so i tried at with the first set of 2 and my pc did not post but with the other 2 sticks it did post. I am now getting a replacement so hopefully this issue doesnt happen again.
5,ottime memorie low profile quindi più basse rispetto alle Vengeance RGB PRO (no SL). Montate al posto di quest'ultime su una B550-F di ROG STRIX che non ci sarebbero state compatibilmente ad un NZXT Kraken X53 RGB 240mm perché troppo ingombranti. Esteticamente buone soprattutto per il sistema di illuminazione
5,Corsair generally you can’t go wrong with a product from them and that is still true for this product. It’s a new design of the old but still relevant RGB Vengeance. Looks pretty nice basically just a small refresh of the RGB design and vengeance logo/styling. Bright RGB and fully customisable within ICue (Corsair RGB Software)Brilliant for gaming generally and you can’t go wrong. Various speeds available and as we all know quite well RGB means more frames. (That last statement isn’t actually true)Overall happy with the product works well and I have no complaints.
5,Das Ram läuft genauso so wie angegeben!
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,oltre che ad essere belle da vedere seguono il clock con estrema fluidità veloci ed affidabili.
5,Bonne performance en jeu
5,I have been relying on these beasts for the last four months and they proved to be fast reliable and aesthetically impressive. They provide stunning and intense lights with several modes and the possibility to create custom lighting modes.Just make sure that they are functioning at full frequency by adjusting the BIOS settings.I use my gaming computer for intensive gaming and photo and video editing. I use heavy software like premier and I never encountered any delays in rendering or performance.In terms of gaming these are more than enough. I play all games like RDR2 F1 2020 Apex etc at high to ultra graphics. They are simply flawless so far.
4,Belle! Molto belle e funzionali danno un tocco di classe al PC ma eccessivamente care comprate solo per poter comandare ogni dispositivo RGB con lo stesso software sul PC (iCue) .Prestazioni ottime una delle cose che non mi piace é che se il PC va in standby resta acceso il led RGB di default credo si possa rimuovere ma non riesco a trovare l'opzione.
5,These look great in white especially in a white case (I am using the Corsair Carbide Spec-06 in White).The RGB is very nicely diffused with only very subtle hotspots. The RAM is fairly tall so make sure you have checked the position of other things in your case. For example with this installed and the position of the motherboard in my case I could not fit a radiator on the top of the case.iCue software is very comprehensive for controlling the RGB.3200MHz is the sweet spot for price to performance when paired with a Ryzen CPU.I did not have much luck in overclocking the RAM enough to be significant.
5,Ich betreibe den Corsair Vengeance i RGB Pro SL als 32GB kit zu 4 Riegeln a 8 GB (aus kosten gründen) im 3200 Mhz takt es wäre problemlos mehr möglich aber da macht mein Ryzen Prozessor nicht mit ...Das System zeichnet sich durch ein einwandfreies und hochwertiges Design aus und die Riegel sind ausgesprochen performant und temperaturtechnisch gut und ausgewogen gekühlt.Mit Icue 4 lassen sich die Rigel auch endlich mal benutzerfreundlich einstellen das gilt im Übrigen für alle Corsair RGB Produkte. Mit ICUE 3.0 war das bisher immer eher zäh.Daher von mir 5. Sterne
5,Se state cercando delle RAM con i led RGB queste fanno proprio al caso vostro io le ho ordinate bianche ma esistono anche nella versione nera. Sono l’ideale per chi ha bisogno di prestazioni accompagnate allo stile. I led RGB hanno molte funzionalità programmabili con il software iCUE di corsair utile per avere le stesse impostazioni per tutti i dispositivi iCUE inoltre sono compatibili anche con i software AURA SYNC RGB FUSION READY e anche MYSTIC LIGHT SYNC.Dal punto di vista tecnico sono due banchi da 16 GB DDR4 a 3200Hz le ho provate sia in configurazione INTEL che AMD e non hanno dato problemi. Il prezzo per quello che si sta andando a comprare secondo me è ottimo e non nego che a volte si possono trovare anche leggermente a meno quindi se avete intenzione di comprarvi delle RAM tenetele d’occhio.
2,Ram particolarmente belle con bellissimo effetto led. Mi si sono rotte due volte nel giro di 4 mesi: la prima volta ho chiesto il reso e sono state sostituite e adesso si sono rotte un’altra volta. Specifico che sono perfettamente compatibili con la mia build però è già il secondo inconveniente a cui vado in contro. La prima volta il computer mostrava solo schermate nere all’accensione rendendo impossibile qualsiasi operazione la seconda invece le RAM hanno una parte di memoria guasta che rende il computer instabile. Infatti all’esecuzione di giochi quando si va a richiedere “di più” alle RAM (e preciso che monitoro sempre la % di utilizzo delle componenti con Gestione Attività) i giochi si bloccano e successivamente crashano. Non accade solo con i giochi ovviamente anche con diverse schede di Chrome aperte se si eseguono operazioni troppo in fretta il computer si spenge direttamente obbligando ad aspettare che si riaccenda e che Chrome riapra le schede chiuse inaspettatamente anche se ovviamente i dati inseriti nelle schede vanno persi. Insomma se la sostituzione viene accettata provvederò a provare il mio 3^ banco di ram e se ci saranno brutte sorprese aggiornerò la recensione.

5,The RGB effects on the RAM are amazing the light bar effectively dissipates the light making a nice even colour grading. In particular I like the white colour to contrast the black PCB on the motherboard. The speed and latency of the RAM are good and are excellent when paired with the new ryzen CPUs. The RAM was great value when on a black friday sale though at retail prices other options are also good.The only issues I've had with the RAM have been that the XMP profile when enabled causes windows to blue screen immediately though dialling in the overclock manually does seem to be stable - not sure if this is a problem with the RAM motherboard or CPU though. Also iCUE does not work well with Gigabyte RGB fusion.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like the rgb lights. Ram runs fine with the ice software.TIP: GO INTO SETTINGS AND FORCE THE FIRMWARE UPDATE. This will get rid of a small red warning triangle in the top right corner on the software. Some people have had this issue I did too.
4,sometimes the lighting with the software does not synchronize correctly but still works great

5,Perfetto funziona alla grande 👍
5,pas compatible avec le chipset B560 de chez Intel en ce qui me concerne
5,Memorie di buona qualità le ho installate su una Gigabyte Aorus X570 Elite con CPU Ryzen 3700X gli effetti di colore sono molto belli e gestibili con il software RGB di Gigabyte per adesso le sto utilizzando con una frequenza impostata a 2133 e si comportano bene non scaldano e non creano nessuna instabilità del sistema. Mi riservo di aggiornare questa breve recensione dopo averle testate ad una frequenza maggiore e vedere come si comportano.Mi permetto di aggiungere un elogio ad amazon per aver prontamente risolto un problema con la spedizione prontamente risolto in maniera professionale ed efficiente.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I Iike the custom rgb they work well with signal rgb can change them to any colour and different sequence very smooth fast ram.
5,昨今のPCは相性問題なんか起きないだろうと思っていましたが、まさかこんなにトラブルとは…家に到着してすぐに取り付けましたが、なんと起動失敗でブルスク。何度か場所を差しなおしてもブルスク。元のメモリに直して起動。これにするとブルスク。なんじゃこりゃ、と思いつつも今度は元のメモリでもブルスク。それ以降は何をやってもブルスク。結局、OS入れ直しました。どうせならもう一回つけてみようと思い、こいつを付けてみたら今度はすんなり起動。なんだよそれ…システムドライブのデータ全部消えたやんけ…私のやり方が悪かったのかどうかは知りませんが、今時一筋縄でいかない方が珍しい。ちゃんと起動してから何度か再起動しましたが、今のところ動いています。そういえばBIOSでは最初は2133で認識して、安定するようになってからは2666で認識してました。推測ですが、メモリではなくマザボ側の認識が狂っていたのかなと。そして何度かやり直す過程でOSにダメージ入って起動不可に…みたいな？私自身PCには詳しいほうだと思いますが、軽くゴタつきました。本体は想像通りカッコよくていい感じです。デフォの光り方は下品な感じでしたが、ソフトで制御していい感じになりました。白いメモリって珍しいので満足です。
5,Branché sur une AUS TUF gaming Z690. Elle fonctionne à la vitesse indiqué avec XMP activé.Les led de couleur ressortent bien.
5,迷った結果8G×4で32GB、メモリのポートを鮮やかに彩り気に入ってますRyzen7、トマホークB550で使用してますが、現時点では好調で他のPCを使いたくないほどです。
5,Funktioniert alles perfekt
4,J’ai acheté cette ram mais avec ma carte mère asrock b450 steel legend impossible de mettre cette ram a 3200mhz dans le bios à chaque fois que je veut la mettre sa me fait des bout screen resultat : je peut seulement utilisé 2133mhz très déçu de ce produit
3,Vengo de 16GB del mismo modelo hasta la fecha todo perfecto pero quería ampliar a 32 GB y ha sido un auténtico fracaso. Las RAM que tengo desde hace 3 años están en la versión 5.32 mientras que las nuevas que compré eran la versión 5.22 desconozco si este ligero cambio en el mismo modelo de ram pueda ser el causante de inestabilidad que he tenido.El PC era inusable teniendo 32GB de ram pese a que la placa lo soporta y la frecuencia y perfiles XMP los soporta con 16GB sea tanto de mis RAM antiguas como de las nuevas si que funcionaba al final he tenido que tramitar la devolución. No entiendo por qué se venden las rams como si fueran el mismo modelo cuando en realidad tienen variaciones de versión (que no se especifican) que pueden causar problemas de compatibilidad.
4,Las memorias lo esperado con un AMD Ryzen 5900 y placa Aorus X570 dan 1574 MHz de velocidad de reloj y casi casi la cantidad e memoria completa.La pega viene con el software del RGB de Corsair no reconoce los dispositivos al arrancar no actualiza correctamente... no se sí será mi equipo pero por las quejas de los foros diría que el software es un poco malo. Espero que Corsair mejore este punto.
5,Ram ottime nulla da aggiungere le ho sostituite al vecchio modello vengance non RGB. Prese in sconto e arrivate in un giorno con Prime
3,Unable to find anywhere on the listing that specified if this was single or dual rank RAM I decided to buy it and just return it if it was single rank. Needless to say after an initial exchange and subsequent return I had no luck.This information should be easily accessible and on the description for the product.
2,Came unsealed and the box was definitely opened before. I bought it as brand new so this is upsetting.
5,Ich habe Ende 2019 2x 8Gb gekauft und bin seit dem eigentlich restlos zufrieden. Gestern habe ich mir nochmal 16Gb bestellt weil Video Editing hat RAM braucht 32Gb sind da einfach besser.Warum schreibe ich diese Bewertung?Weil es echt ein paar Flamingos* gibt die dieses tolle Produkt mit 1 Stern bewerten weil sie zu depp sind kaputte Riegel zurück zu schicken oder die Software richtig zu bedienen.Meistens sitzt das Problem vor dem Monitor.So du wundervoller RAM gut aussehend und leuchtstark hier hast du 5 volle Sterne von mir auf die du guten Gewissens stolz sein kannst lass dich nicht von den paar Spatzen* mit ihren 1 Sterne Bewertungen ärgern :**) Die Worte sind Platzhalter die wirklichen Worte habe ich nicht benutzt weil ich freundlich bin.
5,All’altezza delle mie prospettive
5,Rien à dire de plus du plus bel effet RGB qualité CORSAIR
5,-it fits perfectly under any AIO cooler-rgb looks better than the VENGEANCE RGB PRO.
5,Only pic I had now the colour is set to a scene in icue so all match. But the RAM is great does what's needed and looks good doing it. Went with the low profile as still haven't decided on a cooler for final build and I didn't want to risk clearance.
4,but it looks damn good
3,Ich muss leider sagen das ich von der leistung enttäucht bin weil ich die versprochene 3600mhz nicht bekomme. Bei mir läuft sie gerade mal auf 3333mhz und das finde ich schade vorab setze ich immer auf die neuste hardware und software . Ich werde Sie wieder zurück schicken müssen.
5,Excelente rendimiento y configuración desde el software Corsair iCUE 4. Son módulos con 44mm de altura para mayor compatibilidad. También compatibles con Intel Xmp 2.0 y Amd Ryzen.
5,En changement de 2 LPX c’est le jour et la nuit surtout au niveau de l’éclaire. Juste un problème de tension avec ma CM mais résolu après un passage sur le Bios.
4,Potentes y bonitas estas memorias. Me aseguré muy bien de que fuesen compatibles con mi placa (msi x570a pro) y así fue con lo que las coloqué en su sitio y a tirar millas. Lo malo es que en mi caso por mucho que las dejo como quiero con el Dragon Center.. van un poco a su bola. Las pongo un efecto de color y al rato cada una tiene un color fijo están un poco locas con el argb pero eso no afecta al rendimiento con lo que me viene dando igual no obstante creía oportuno mencionarlo para futuros compradores.
5,Top Produkt funktioniert einwandfrei
5,Corsair Venegance wie man sie kennt und liebt!
5,Item was as described by the seller well packed and delivered on time schedule. I will definitely recommend this product and the seller. Thanks to the Amazon team. You make everything from online shopping to delivery to your customers. Keep up the good attitude. Thanks one and all.
5,So pretty
5,Las memorias de esta marca nunca me han dado problemas es la primera vez que las compro con luz ojo son hipnotizantes como te quedes viéndolas te vas a quedar pillado y flipando de lo lindo.
4,Bom produto.
5,Perfect for a white themed build or any colour themed build.XMP profile works exactly as expected no issues.Using with a ryzen 5 on a b550 motherboard.
5,They plugged in nicely and light up when the pc is on.  No problems at all!  With 32GB I will be good for a long time.
5,Sehr schöne rgb Akzente und is auch echt hochwertig verarbeitet
5,Buone ram ma ho effettuato un reso per prendere le dominator. Anche queste fanno comunque la loro bella figura
5,Schnelle Lieferung und machen das was sie sollen! Der LED Effekt sieht super aus
5,Assolutamente ottime! Ne ho acquistati quattro banchi e devo dire che sono superlative.
5,ちょっと高価でしたがキレイに光って、３２００ＭＨｚで動作もしたし満足しています。耐久性は、今のところ分かりませんので☆３としておきました。
4,Gewoon goed geheugen.Wordt gebruikt icm Asus ROG Strix B550-E gaming.RGB is mooi en in te stellen via iCUE.
3,Kept getting errors and rgb would stop working needing me to restart the pc. also alot of freezing randomly
5,Facili da installare performanti la mia Msi Tomahawk x570 le ha riconosciute al volo applicando il giusto valore di frequenza tramite xmp. Molto belli i LED ARGB anche se purtroppo possono essere pilotati solo dal software proprietario icue che costringe quindi ad avere in background un app in più.
3,Ottime per il prezzo se ti servono molti gb di ram ma poco stabili e incompatibili con msi z590 e i7 11700kf. Peccato erano delle belle ram provate con Z270 e andavano bene su z590 il profilo xmp fa riavviare il pc all'infinito e non si riesce in nessun caso ad ottenere frequenze decenti per questo in gioco gli fps ne risentono parecchio. Meglio spendere di più per una serie superiore se si vogliono le corsair oppure optare per le migliori e più stabili hyperx o gskill.Reso avviato
5,Facil de instalar buen precio y de buen rendimiento
5,Poco da dire sono bellissime esteticamente e vanno bene.
1,不良品でしたので返品対応させてもらいました。メーカー検査済みのXMP2.0の構成１も２もメモリテストでコケており、SPDに書き込まれている標準構成で使用しても、メモリテストですぐにコケる状態でした。同メーカーの1世代前のメモリでは特に問題は発生しておらず、これの後発のメモリでも特に問題は発生しておらず、他のマザーでも同様にコケているため、このメモリ自体がハズレという結果でした。ちゃんと検査すれば確認できるレベルに思えたので、アセンブリ後の検査が緩いのか、ちゃんとできてなさそうな印象を持ちました。メモリに当たり外れは必ずあるものですが、素早く返品または交換してくれるかどうかという点で、いちいち先方に問い合わせる手間なく、システム的に対応できるamazonはたすかる。（とはいえ返品のやりすぎにはご注意を。）
5,Looks great in my white build as expected with RAM installation was very clean packaging minimal and waste of plastic isn't really evident speeds as described CL16 3200mhz. The Corsair software is extremely easy to use in order to change colour settings and etc
5,Nice looking item! Looking 👍
5,If you like RGB then this is for you.Be mindfull if purchasing 4 sticks and you have a Gigabyte Z170x motherboard with the NZXT kraken cooler as it might be a tight fit for the RAM stick slot that's closest to it ('should' fit with a little squeeze) as the AIO Kraken 62 cooler pipes that exits the unit slightly covers the slot as this ram is a lot wider than normal.Anyway the RGB lights are nice and vibrant and there are plenty of lighting options available using the Corsair iCUE software.  I have put a little video together on YouTube so if you want to have a better look check it out.Installation was straight forward I had allready enabled XMP profile in the BIOS so was just a plug and play for me and showed 3200mhz without any issues.
5,Top Produkt kaum zu toppen
5,Il prodotto funziona benissimo molto stabile prestazioni davvero superbe (testate con Ryzen 9 3900X).Dispone (scaricabile) di una propria utility per la gestione dell'RGB che oltre ai vari effetti già predefiniti e personalizzabili permette anche la gestione dell'intensità luminosa (sono davvero molto luminose ad intensità piena). Unica piccola pecca l'RGB non è compatibile con Aura Sync di ASUS e quindi va gestita a parte.
5,Easy to install rgb looks fantastic
4,The title says it all - not for overclocking not stable even at the advertised frequency of 3200 MHz. I managed to run it at 2800 and 3000 MHz but the MB 'chipset' fans on my Asus TRX40 pro went too loud so I had to cool it down a bit to 2400 MHz. Last but not least it was the cheapest set of 32 Gb RAM modules I could find so no complaint (got two as a matter of fact).
5,I got the 16GB 3200mhz kit for around 76 quid... which was a very good price and it is amazing RAM.Software is great does what it needs and nothing more which is better than some of the other software's for my other various parts. The different RGB options are good and the RGB is stunning.Apart from that its RAM and does what RAM does... I haven't known any different seeing as this was my first PC build. Overall its very nice to look at and does RAM stuff well so yeah it's great. Very happy :)
5,I was concerned about the difference in timings between the SL and non-SL versions but this performs perfectly for what I need.JUST REMEMBER TO ADJUST THE RAM SPEED IN YOUR BIOS. Otherwise you won't be getting the full 3600Hz you pay for but more like 2700Hz or 3200Hz
5,Estetica unica di corsair luminosità davvero incredibile e impostando la loro frequenza nel bios performano davvero bene consigliatissime!
5,I already had 16gb of 3200mhz I bought off here for about £160 (I think) over a year ago... I know it wasn't cheap but at that time I was upgrading my pc as the oculus rift wouldn't run on my old system so out with old faithfull 2600k hd7850xt and in with 8600k gtx1080 anyhow I know theres no need for 32gb but at £89.98 for these but worth it to have in and at some point will use them in my son aging ddr3 rig when I upgrade that... or give him my hand me downs. So for the money I thought sod it in the basket it goes as I can't see it getting any cheaper.
5,I bought this RGB RAM about a month ago now and have really liked it! The RGB lighting is very bright and is easily programmable to your liking in the Corsair iCue software the 3200mhz speed is more than enough for gaming and video editing and it handles things really well without using much of the 16gb RAM it offers! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get RGB RAM and it is certainly good for the price against the other options!
5,Bellissimi questi banchi! Basta comprare le vegance pro normali adesso ci sono queste ed esteticamente sono molto più belle.
5,Selezionate per la mia configuarzione 2 banchi da 16GB total white sono ram incredibili ma al prezzo giusto! Io le ho pagate 174€ e secondo me è il prezzo quasi massimo per il tipo di prodotto.Probabilmente ne acquisterò altre 2 per ampliare e arrivare a 64GB di RAM
5,Super fiable très bien je conseille
3,設定すれば3200Mhzで安定稼働できてます。マザボがXMPに対応していないとだめですが。iCUEというアプリ入れるとLED設定できますが、他のLED設定アプリを入れていると不安定な感じです。WIN立ち上げ時にもUSBを抜いた音がしてう～ん、って感じです。とりあえずは様子見です。
3,特に不具合なく使っていますこのメモリは過去１００枚以上買いましたが、可もなく不可もなくですただソフトウェアでRBGを管理する際はお気を付けを。マザーボードのメーカーにより相性が悪く、きれいに光らないや誤作動する場合もあります特にマザーボードでRBG制御+RAZERデバイスでさらに管理、のパターンだと時々競合してうまく光らない（バラバラに光る）時があります
3,Necesita 1.42v para ser estable a 4000mhz sino al mes o dos de uso empezara a dar problemas
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ich habe mir den Ram in Verbindung mit dem aktuellen Ryzen 9 3900X und dem ASUS Prime X570-Pro ATX Mainboard geholt. XMP 2.0 läuft super der Ram stabil und die Optik ist natürlich was feines bei dem Ram.Er lässt sich super einfach über die Icue Software von Corsair steuern genau wie alle anderen Komponenten von Corsair kann man dann alles vollkommen synchron steuern.Ich bin begeistert und kann es nur empfehlen
5,Verpackung sowie Lieferung war wie immer sehr zufriedenstellend!Die Verarbeitung vom Produkt ist hervorragend! Der Preis ist angemessen gut und ich werde mit Sicherheit dieses Produkt weiter empfehlen.
5,Recomendaciones!
5,Relacion calidad precio buena
5,Sono sempre una garanzia e spettacolari.
5,Tengo las tarjetas con un R7 3800X y van genial. Plug and play fue conectar configurar perfil AMP y listo funcionando estables y bien. A nivel estético son preciosas muy bien acabadas y brillan MUCHO. El software de iCue es una auténtica delicia para configurar el RGB y las tarjetas quedan preciosas.Actualizaré en un futuro cuando haga OC manual para bajar timings ya que subir frecuencias no es productivo en Ryzen 3000 por los límites del Infinity Fabric.
5,I manage to get this product while it was at an all time price low (£87) and I was amazed at how beautiful a stick of ram could look from the perfect rgb to the clean heat sink.
5,Great performance on benchmark
4,Rien a dire comme dab la fiabilité
5,Great ram and rgb lighting to boot
5,Les performances sont excellentes et stable en toute circonstances même en Overclocking.Les effets rgb sont sublime c'est très bien fini facilement contrôlable avec Icue ou d'autres logiciels
3,This RAM literally caused my brand new PC to spark and produce smoke.I had to get it fixed at a retailer as they custom built my PC for me they provided me with a replacement RAM with equal value unsure what they are doing with it now.I have this non faulty ram in my PC now that they supplied me and it looks amazing! Works perfectly.Still need to check if it's actually 3600mhz.
5,Con queste ram ho il turbo adesso riesco a montare video senza stress
5,runs 3600 with a 5600x and MSI b450m mortar max no problem. Looks great and auto connects to the boards mystic light.  went with 4X8 for music applications instead of 16X2. Happy I did. not sure about competition but a happy buyer.
5,Ottime Ram per il gaming
5,Love itmy pc runs 24/7 Chia plotting using this memory as a ram drive and it just keeps going and going 😀
5,Les barrettes sont très jolies faciles à installer peut-être un peu cher pour ce que c’est mais sinon je suis satisfait
4,Good performance stay cool work as advertised !And they look good I'm not a fan of Corsair but memory is memory these day to be honest ... They're nothing to write home about except the RGB but this is the trend nowadays !Software integration with Asus MB is not great corsair software is well ... average
5,Solo vengo a decir que estas las memorias RAM funcionan a la perfección (3200Mhz) con la motherboard MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX. Además el fabricante que me ha tocado es Micron. Un saludo y de nada.
2,Obliger de passer la ram en mode auto et elle se fige à 2333 mhz au lieu de 3600 mhz.Si je la force à rester à 3200 ou 3600 mhz ça créé des ralentissements.Autre problème le rvb reste allumé en mode veille pc et mon pc sort du mode veille sûrement à cause de ça.Je précise que c'est installé en bi canal sur carte mère ASUS Rog B550.
4,十分に検証できているわけではありませんが、iCUEというメモリのLED照明コントロール用のソフトを使用すると動作が不安定になりました。また、同ソフトの自動起動をすると、PC起動時にUSBの接続・切断音が鳴ります。結局、OCせず、定格で使用しています。別のレビュアーの方もコメントしていましたが、IntelAMD両対応モデルと、AMDのみ対応モデルがありますのでご注意ください。照明の制御について使ってみてわかったことですが、照明コントロールは大きく先述のiCUEというソフトウェアコントロールのモードと、メモリに記憶するモードの二つがあり、iCUE動作の場合はソフトウェア制御の照明モードが適用され、iCUE動作なしまたはスリープモードではメモリに記憶された照明モードが適用されます。メモリ記憶の照明のタイミング制御はメモリの内部クロックに依存するようで、例えば複数のメモリに同じ点滅モードを設定した場合、時間の経過とともに照明のタイミングがずれていきます。
4,Mit meinem Ryzen 1600 läuft der Arbeitsspeicher auf 3000 MHZ mehr leider nicht aber das wird eher an dem Mainboard oder der CPU liegen. Finde dass sich der Arbeitsspeicher sehr gut in dem Case macht.Finde die verschiedenen Einstellungen über die iCue Software super um die gleiche Farbe wie die Case LEDs zu haben.Es hätte mich nur sehr gefreutwenn die RAM im Schlafmodus nicht mehr leuchtet aber das ist vermutlich technisch schwer umzusetzen da der RAM ja im Betrieb bleibt.
4,Fonctionne parfaitement excellent produit.
5,Easy to install  looks great.Worth the money.Easy to install.Went straight into my motherboard with no issues. Turned on pc and they were all functioning.
5,Ram dalle prestazioni alte con un design molto bello
5,Da un punto di vista estetico sono al top idem per le prestazioni. Si controllano da iCUE il software proprietario di Corsair. Quello a fianco è un sistema di dissipazione iCue H115i Elite Capellix.
5,Le ram sono di qualità eccellente (non mi aspettavo nulla di meno dalla Corsair) e anche in un case nero fanno la loro bellissima figura! Con il software iCue di Corsair è possibile personalizzare i giochi di luci del bordo. Ottime!!
5,Beautiful build quality. Really nice white metal casing with the RGB strip being also well covered and designed. It's really bright and has fluid and strong colours. I use an MSi motherboard and the program to control the motherboard LEDs identifies the RAM too and can be controlled through the same program whclich is amazing and can link them together as well and also adjust brightness. If you are looking for aesthetically pleasing RAM to showcase your build while having fast performance I can recommend this for sure.
5,
5,PC Parts seem to be getting harder and harder to get hold of... Of course I chose this time to build a new PC.Anyway the RAM looks stunning and performs brilliantly in my gaming PC.I pair it with an AMD 5600x and RTX 3070 and it runs like a dream!
5,buon prodotto
5,Ok
5,J’ai commandé 2x8Go et 2x0Go pour un total de 4 barettes le rendu est uncroyable ! Configurable via le logiciel icue ! Un vrai bonheur.
3,Product came foultyi am sending it back.
5,FANTASTIC. THE RGB LIGHTINGS ARE WICKED. I LOVE IT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND EVERY ONE.
5,Fonctionnelle aucun soucis.
5,C'est barrette sont vraiment bien juste le pris a cause de la période est un peu excessive j'ai eu 2x8go a 3200 méga Hz pour 103€ alors que un amis a moi qui c'est fais un pc en 2019 a eu les même barrette de ram pour 75€
5,Facile à mettre et en plus très beau
5,Fonctionne parfaitement couplé a un ryzen 5 5600x  aucun problème de compatibilité  rgb configurable a souhait led très lumineuse avec une très large palette de couleur  super bien reproduite le blanc est bien blanc le rouge bien vif.....ect  . Satisfait du produit.
5,it was cheaper than the black version at the time so W for me
5,Nothing to say performance and quality RGB is very easy to customize the temperature does not exceed 40 degrees.
5,1万円ちょいでDDR4-3200 8GB×2は最強すぎないかぁ！？！？！？
5,I got mine for a great deal before the price shot up. This ran is great works on x470 despite x470 saying it only supports 64gb ram. Worked first time with XMP 2.0 profile enabled. Overstocks great as well. The ram is a good height even the massive Dark Rock Pro 4 cooler can overhang it without issue so the extra height for led is fine. Rgb works great as well!
5,:D
5,人によってhynixやMicronだったりするらしいですが、今回のブラックフライデーで購入したものはSamsungでした。タイミングゆるゆるなのでそのまんま3800MHzにしてGear1で設定しても安定動作してくれてます。TUF Z690 + 12600kの環境なので、Intel環境の人は使っていいかもしれないです。
5,Die Ram Sticks sind in einer Schicken kleinen Verpackung sind auch sehr Qualitativ Hochwertig. Jedoch steigt der Preis immerhöher  vor 5 Monaten habe ich die Neu für 6990€ Gekauft jetzt kosten sie Fast das Doppelte für den Aktuellen Preis (122€) Empfehle ich Definitiv nicht.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Creo que las mejores ram's que eh tenido nunca 4x16 GB creo que para mí uso voy sobrado para una larga temporada por lo menos van genial y además quedan perfectas. Se nota que corsair es calidad se nota desde antes de abrir la caja.
5,Die Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro in Weiß passen ideal in mein weißes Setup und gefallen mir persönlich auch von der RGB-Farbgebung bzw. dem Design auch deutlich besser. Die markanten Linien machen eben einfach was her und man kann die Farbe ganz kinderleicht und individuell in der iCUE-Software einstellen. Die Leistung ist natürlich auch super und der aktuelle RAM-Preis ist eigentlich unschlagbar.
4,Como pega decir que no me las detecta ICUE por lo cual no puedo configurar su RGB.Por lo demás van muy bien por defecto funcionan a la velocidad del procesador luego te permite modificar si quieres algo más de potencia.Son muy bonitas y su temperatura correcta.
5,(White 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) 3200 MHz) I paired this with the Corsair M55 RGB mouse and using the iCue app I synced the colours which was a cool addition to my set up. You can freely edit the light patterns/intensity/colour/ or even switch it off entirely. I havent noticed a need for any more RAM at the moment.
5,Great ram. Easy to install. So far so good!
5,Had 16gb already used these for a little upgrade to 32gb looks stunning and easy to install
5,BonjourJe suis pas déçu reçu dans les temps a voir dans le temps..Rapport qualité prix 👍🏼Je recommande !
5,I bought this for upgrade. Performance is as expected.RGB is good too which I control with corsair icue.
5,Tut was er soll. XMP funktioniert RGB bräuchte ich nicht aber war für meinen Sohn  der auch Gehäuse+Lüfter von Corsair hat. Da läuft alle über icue zusammen. Zum Glück auch einen guten Preis erwischt. Gehen ja leider wieder bergauf.
5,Alles tip top
3,bien
5,Perfectomuy facil de instalar y de configurarlas luces y demas hace que sea muy bonito
5,TUF GAMING B550M-PLUSとRyzen 7 Pro 4750Gの組み合わせで使っています．問題もありません．LEDも光っています．OCしても動くのでコストパフォーマンスが2021年10月最初の時点で最高によかったです．
5,Che dire !!! Avere 32gb di RAM come guidare un missile terra aria l'illuminazione a LED e i suoi effetti sono fantastici e danno quel tocco da gaming moderno
5,Performantiaffidabilial top!Sicuramente non il top del top..ma secondo me sono al top!In un carico pesante risultano ben dissipate e velocità superlativa.Frequenza di 3.200mhz bianche e rgb che a parer mio risultano stilose in un case come il mio (Corsair Crystal 570x mirror black)Velocità superlativa e incolmabile..A mio parere è personalmente parlando..le ho trovate più belle esteticamente di tutta la concorrenza poi le ho allegate a tutto un set di icue (case Crystal fan ll 120 Commander pro Lighting led k70 scimitar)Consigliatissime!Amazon sempre puntuale!
5,Recommended! These ram sticks are in my opinion the best looking ram sticks on the market. The performance is top and they have good thermals ( this varies depeneding on which case you have and how efficient is the cooling). I am really satisfied.
5,Sempre bellissime a vedersi le memorie Corsair sono una garanzia di qualità e performance...il prezzo è ottimo d'altronde la qualità di paga! Superconsigliate!
5,Top ! Le seul "hic" que je puisse leur trouver c'est que j'ai été obligé de télécharger l'utilitaire "iCue" pour les faire fonctionner (niveau synchro RGB) avec l'utilitaire de ma config "MSI Mystic Light".Mais aucun besoin d'avoir l'appli lancée j'imagine que ça fait juste office de driver pour piloter le RGB.A part ça niveau performance RAS au top !
5,Top of the range memory
5,bellezza e potenza insieme 3600 mhz 32gbin piu sono anche rgb che anche se per molti non ha senso l'rgb anche l'occhio fa la sua parte configurabili in mille modi grazie all'app corsair
4,Product works great except for the installation. when i first installed them one of the ram sticks were not recognized not sure if this is due to my motherboard. but when i switched the places around of the 2 ram sticks both worked fine....Other then that works great and looks stunning!
5,crucial rgb pro le migliori ram ddr4 per desktop e pc gamer
5,meilleur ram rgb vraiment de qualité. gérable avec icue sans soucis. Je recommande
5,la compre teniendo otras dos y con estas tengo 4 para hacer ya los 32 gigas  estoy muy contento al pricipio cuando me dieron la fecha de entrega estuve apunto de cancelar la compra pero cada día ke pasaba se acortaba y en dos semanas en casa y montadas en resumen muy contento y las recomiendo
5,Super produit.
5,Parfait je recommande
2,J'ai mis beaucoup de temps à comprendre pourquoi ma config ne tourne pas comme elle le devrait merci à Corsair! Ils vendent des barrettes avec la même référence mais qui ont pourtant des caractéristiques différentes! En effectuant un CPU-Z j'ai réalisé que j'avais la moitié des barrettes en Nanya ranks "single" et l'autre en  SK Hynix ranks "dual". C'est se moquer du monde. L'activation du profil d.o.c.p. ne marche pas j'ai des barrettes 3200 MHz qui tournent à 2132 MHz. La fenêtre de remboursement de ces produits est close mais je compte m'acheter des G.Skill qui elles sont faites pour bien fonctionner
5,Rasche Lieferung und gut verpackt. Die Leistung ist gut und die LEDs leuchten hell und unterstützen die Stimmung beim Gaming.
5,ottimo prodotto è la ram classica per le specifiche selezionate e quindi 3200mhz che vanno bene per i nuovi amd e per x299 intel. I led si personalizzano a piacimento se necessario. La struttura della ram con l'aggiunta dei lei non crea problemi di montaggio. Le ram hanno passato tutti i test memtest pro. Su schede asus x299 vanno perfette.
5,Easy to install. Works great with ice software
3,Assez déçu par la qualité de finition et de Sav des produits Corsair… une souris a remplacer au bout de 2 mois et maintenant une barrette de ram (choisie pour son esthétique) qui n’a pas le fonctionnement optimal.Marre de perdre du temps à contacter les services techniques pour des produits qui ne devraient même pas sortir d’usine comme cela (la led ne fonctionnait pas le jour de la réception) résultat: fini le matériel Corsair pour ma part
5,Awsome ram sticks.Rgb works perfect while being able to turn them down at night.There still going strong around 6 months use gamingOnly issue is icue software a few months backSeems to have been sorted now though
5,Incroyable !
5,Literally soooo easy to install you just put them in and there you go install the software and turn on he xmp profile then it will turn up as the 3200 MHz Cus mine first came up with 2666 MHz then I fixed it by going into bios and turning the xmp profile on. Then I installed the Corsair software icue and changed the colours it is really cool
5,Amazing Corsair quality! The RGB Cycle is lovely as well looks very aesthetically pleasing. Fits the white theme in my build beautifully as well.
5,Jolie performante et pas chère c'est les 3 mot qui décrive cette ramKit 2x8go à 3200mhz pour une 100aine d'euros c'est génial
5,Great ram works good can change the RGB looks the biz
5,der RAM funktioniert problemlos mit einem Ryzen 2700x auf b450 Plattform Punkt ich konnte den Ram mit 3200 megahertz und cl16 stabil zum laufen bringen. preislich für den Funktionsumfang und die Beleuchtung und insgesamt 64 GB auf 2 Sticks verteilt unschlagbar wenn man denn die Beleuchtung mag :-) War vor einem Jahr gefühlt doppelt so teuer
5,Ottime ram come le sue gemelle ma più grandi queste nella parte led non hanno le due fascette alle estremità rendendo un design molto più lineare
5,Es una ram normal. Es muy elegante y el RGB es bueno. Estoy satisfecho con la compra.
5,there are faster memory on the market. but usually at smaller sizes.  64gb is plenty for a Desktop PC.  even running a few virtual machines on a desktop works fine esp when paired with a NVME drive.Looks good in PC colouch change is smooth and smooth colour change.
5,Plusieurs réglages  lumineux possible facil à installer
4,Good product but the price could be better
5,Rock solid after 5 months.Have always used Corsair ram and they have never let me down.EDITOver 1 year later of heavy gaming at 4k and still hasn't missed a beat.
5,Sieht mega aus mit der Software funktioniert alles top. Etwas teuer aber trotzdem 5sterne
5,Macht was es soll und die RGB Farben sind sehr schön
5,Très bonne RAM facile à installer et vraiment sympa avec le rgb
5,Nel tempo mi è capitato di assemblare svariati PC e sicuramente nella mia esperienza le RAM sono il componente che più spesso ha creato qualche problema ma con queste è andato immediatamente tutto liscio: problemi zero fin dal primo secondo. In una build tutta bianca come la mia fanno una gran figura. L'effetto RGB è molto bello anche se purtroppo non mi è ancora riuscito di sincronizzare i vari led per un problema che non mi è ancora riuscito di risolvere col software Aura Sync (ma non è colpa delle RAM). Immediatamente riconosciute a 3200 via XMP.
5,meilleur rapport/qualité prix et rgb ICUE qu'on aime
5,Facil de instalar perfil bajo que ayuda a la instalación de radiadores en la parte de arriba de la caja el Rgb tiene más funciones que las pro normales el rendimiento es el esperado
5,Great piece of beefy kit for all RAM based needs at a great price (My setup is 32GBx4). RGB really brings out the colours in my build.Note that you’ll need to enable XMP/DOCP in the BIOS to get the full use of 3600mhz clock speed compared to the base clock
5,J'ai eu ce kit de ram pour 90 euros c'est une très bonne affaire. Les couleurs sont magnifiques et même supérieur à la concurrence.
5,I'll assume you know about ram speed and all that if you're buying these. Obviously you can get the same speed ram cheaper but the aesthetics is what set these apart.The lights are really bright I didn't expect them to be so bright.
1,Laut der Beschreibung sollte der RAM ideal für AMD sein. Bei mir verursachte er nur bluescreens sobald ich den auf 3200mhz eingestellt hatte. Deswegen geht der zurück. Schade.
1,Donné pour être compatible avec les Ryzen d'AMD et acheté pour monter sur une carte mere B550M il n'apparaissait qu'une Barette de 8Go sur la première carte mère GIGABYTE B550M AORUS Elite que j'ai renvoyée car ayant testé les barrettes sur une X570 elle fonctionnaient. J'ai donc pris une ASUS TUF GAMING B550M-PLUS (WI-FI) mais le problème était un écran noir à la fin de l'installation de Windows (je ne compte pas les X essais j'ai changé le processeur idem!J'ai pris les barrettes montées sur ma X570 et j'ai pu installer Windows sur la B550.Renvoyées pour incompatibilité B550 j'ai pris des Gskill trident Z à la place...
5,I pay over a tenner for delivery and the useless UPS man didnt even post it. Tried once left note but didn't post this tiny package through my letterbox and now I have to collect. total joke considering I paid for the service. Unacceptable imo
5,Beautifully designed and quality RAM memory wouldn’t expect any less from Corsair.RGB works straight away and is immediately recognised in iCUE without any help. I am absolutely speechless how beautiful and deep the RGB colours are. Working in iCUE software with individually addressable LEDs is a pleasure!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Compatibilité aucun problème attention par contre à ce que les barrettes tournent bien à la fréquence communiquée.Les miennes sont en 3200 MHz mais tournaient à 1600 après installation dans mon boîtier.Après petit tour de 5 secondes dans le bios les barrettes sont maintenant en 3200 comme décrit dans la fiche produit.
5,Memorie davvero eccezionali da gran velocità la spedizione andata veloce.I colori sono davvero perfetti. integrazione molto facile con il software icue l'impostazione di default dei colori un arcobaleno è bellissimo. Acquisto consigliato.
5,Rien à redire sur ces barrettes de RAM.La qualité Corsair est au rendez-vous. Finition des matériaux RGB de qualité et stabilité.Je les trouve personnellement beaucoup plus élégantes que les ancienne corsair vengeance !
5,Para mi son las rams mas bonitas puedes hacer efectos increibles aunque tardes un buen rato en conseguirlo pero el software es muy completo. La iluminacion es perfecta muy difuminada y los colores se mezclan a la perfeccion.La unica pega que le veo es que no es compatible con AuraSync que es la placa base que yo utilizo para sincronizar los efectos pero gracias al software de iCue puedo hacer efectos muy similares a los que trae AuraSync.
5,Diese Speicher-Bausteine sind jetzt seit gut eine Monat im Dauer Einsatz täglich 8 Stunden 7 mal die Woche und kann bis jetzt absolut nichts negatives berichten.Sie funktionieren einfach super und sehen dazu wahnsinnig schick aus. ✌️🙂Ich kann sie wirklich nur wärmstens weiterempfehlen.
5,Un peu chère mais si on veut des rgb ils faut le faire 🤷‍♂️
5,tenia unas Kingston HyperX 3200 pero funcionando a 2900MHZ sino se bloqueaban estas funcionan a su velocidad y un 10% más con overclock y buena disipación la feria de luces casa de lujo con toda la parafernalia ARGB que he comprado recientemente
5,Ended up buying another 16gb looks and works great  make sure you switch to ‘profile 1’ in bios to fully unlock your ram sticks *please check manual on motherboard first.
5,Very good and nice looking
5,
5,Top performance look great and decent price. All good although I worry more and more about Corsair quality for peripherals their hardware doesn't seem so bad as yet so all good. They look fantastic and the software to address the LED is easy to use and apply.
1,Très déçu le ram ne fonctionne pas comme il faut bloqué à 3066MHz au lieu de 3600MHz si j'essaie de monter la vitesse à 3200MHz l'ordinateur s'allume et directement il y à une erreur et il s'ettain si je le monte à 3600MHz il ne s'allume pasMême à 3066MHz il y à des soucis pendant l'utilisation.
5,
5,perfecto le da un toque muy bonito al pc con esas luces que las puedes controlar y poner como quieras.
5,Pour moi la référence niveau barettes de rames RGB fiable et puissante et jolie  merci corsair !
5,Me encanta la calidad y la iluminacion
5,Tadellos funktionieren prima und sind schön
5,Encantado. Funcionan muy bien y son muy bonitos sobre todo si puedes controlarlos con el iCUE. Lo unico malo es que son muy altos y he tenido que obligarme a mover un ventilador del disipador (Noctua NH-D15 black) porque me chocaba.
3,自分はケース、ファン、電源などコルセアで揃えたのでメモリーもこちらで合わせてました。コルセアのアプリで一括してイルミネーションがいじれるのがいいですが星３にしたのは自分はマザボをMSIのZ590ゲーミングを使ってるのですがMSIのアプリにマザボのイルミネーション設定が含まれてい為かどちらもいれるとメモリーのライティングのみ機能しなくなります。コルセアのアプリからもメモリーエラーがでます。フリーズを起こして止まるみたいな感じです。自分はパソコンは初心者の為、対処法がわからなかったのでMSIのアプリを削除しました。そうすると正常に機能します。因みになんど試しても同じでした。
5,Llego en muy buenaa condiciones ya que lo he pedido nuevo. Antes de abrir la caja revise bien si no ha sufrido golpes ni manipulaciones forzosas. Por ese aspecto todo me ha parecido perfecto y junto al pc pues a lucirlo.
5,I love these paired them with 2 dummy sticks for a nice looking result. Bit pricey but aesthetically looks great. I would take a pic of the whole build but the sticks are so bright they make photos look bad. Anyways I recommend these greatly.
3,Great looking memory but I can’t get it to be stable at 3600 I have to run it at 3400.
4,Ram 3200mhz ottime stabili e soprattutto bellissime per la colorazione rgb. SE VOLETE RAM RGB QUESTE SONO LE MIGLIORI!!
5,Les ram sont vraiment incroyable en blanches
5,Super produit- le prix n’est pas ci élevé que ça.- en therme de design c’est vraiment les plus jolies.- Contrôle des couleurs via le software icue qui est très stable.- Le SAV de corsair rien a dire.Corsair une valeur sur même si des fois les prix sont abusifs. Sur ce produit rien a dire.
2,Began causing constant BSOD within 3 months of use in a new build. Ran it through memtest to work out which stick was faulty and it completely failed the memory test with 10000+ errors. One stick fine the other failing
5,E un bello prodotto e anche buono sono belle veramente
5,una volta installate si accendono i led ed è molto carino avendo il pc con la parete trasparente
5,Das war meine erste Bestellung bei dem Anbieter. Die Lieferung ging schnell und die Komponenten sind in Ordnung. Alles ist Top.
4,Gut viel sagen kann man dazu nicht.Tun wofür sie da sindAlles wie versprochenLassen sich perfekt in iCue integrierenSehen top aus.Sind aber natürlich eher gehobenes Preisniveau für meinen Geschmack etwas zu teuer deshalb 1 Stern Abzug.
5,Bought the Corsair Vengeance RGB in white and was not disappointed. At 3200mhz it gets tasks done way quicker then my old 2666mhz ram. Looks clean and performs really well!
5,Muy buen producto performance excelente las luces muy bien y el programa de configuracion de corsair perfecto no tengo quejas de este producto
5,Habe mich für die weiße Variante entschieden da diese Optisch zu meinen Case passt. Die RGB LED sehen klasse aus und mit der Software dazu kann man vieles extra Einstellen. Warum aber eine RGB Software 330mb groß sein muss verstehe ich nicht. P/L ist der RGB Ram zwar nicht der Hit aber geht noch ok. Wem der Preis nicht stört kann ich denn Ram empfehlen so fern genug Platz da ist da der Ram sehr hoch ist.
5,Works straight away no issues  arrived quickly
5,Imballaggio buono bella la struttura una volta montate belle da vedere
5,perfettamente stabile e performante ottima anche l'illuminazione (personalmente non ho neanche installato il suo software l'effetto arcobaleno di default è già fantastico)
5,Ottime RAM prese in offerta
5,This is a great enthusiast grade set of ram it may be more expensive than its same mhz counter parts but damn its flashy.The rgb modules on these ram sticks are so smooth and crisp it really just gives that finishing touch to a RGB based build.
5,Great buy. At time of buying the pair cost me £90. For 16GB of ddr4 this is extremely good imo especially considering the AWESOME RGB factor and the 3200mhz speed.Recommended.
5,Purchased in 2018 and still going strong 3 years later. Lighting is amazing.
5,Reference CMW16GX4M2Z3200C16 pour pour carte mère AMD.
5,Bought this memory for a ryzen 2700x and because I have a white caseI bought the 3200mhz set runs completely stable with xmp applied and runs at the rated 3200mhzI've also overclocked it to 3450mhz 100% stable and with ram prices getting super cheap again it is an amazing buy.
5,Ryzen5 5600xで使用中。問題なく使えてます。
1,
1,初めはしっかり使えていたのですが3ヶ月ほどから不安定になり、ついにエラーで使えなくなってしまいました。
5,I love the effects of this within my custom PC build it add that extra wow factor to it when e everything turns on... I recommend these to anyone whos interested in RGB ram.
5,Als Erweiterung für den normalen korsair grb RAM echt gut man merkt keinen unterschied
5,Have used Vengeance Pro Ram for years its well priced and great quality the RGB lighting looks great would highly Recommend
5,J'utilise ce kit depuis que je l'ai reçu rien à signalez Corsair au top !!!!-XMP 2.0-Timming cadence et Voltage bien reconnu-Couplet à une MSI Z370 GAMING PRO CARBON
5,Muy contento con la compra las mejores calidad precio que encontré.
5,bellissima colorazione fanno il loro dovere
2,Les barrettes fonctionne bien en 3200 mhz mais quand je met le mode XMP dans le BIOS jai un message d'erreur. Pour info jaicette carte mere ROG STRIX Z590-F GAMING WIFI 6E... https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B08CDTJ1M8?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
5,Looks good and easy to install.Lights are bright and don't stay on when pc is asleep.Haven't found software to customise lights yet but I am sure it exists
5,かと思ったらMicronのB-dieでした。X570でオーバークロック用のプロファイルを読み込み、MemTest86は1周ですがエラーなし。一応メーカーが謳っている仕様通りに安定動作しています。RGBは他のCorsair製品のファンや水冷ヘッドよりも淡い光り方なので、揃えてもちょっと浮くかも。
5,Precio y rendimiento
5,It does its job as ram well enough and the lighting looks great: the rgb is under a plastic diffuser so the light looks continuous and you can see individual leds.I like the rainbow wave setting in CUE.Only downside with this is that CUE only works with other corsair RGB components.
5,Dieses Produkt habe ich für mein Mainboard verwendet ohne Arbeitsspeicher Läuft kein PC bin total zufrieden.
5,Très sympa l’effet de couleur LED en blanc dans un boîtier blanc ça ressort très bien. Très stable fait le taff
5,Tutto come da descrizione
5,Memorias RAM de una gran calidad y prestaciones. Otorgan una gran relación calidad-precio y son muy vistosas. Se trata de una muy buena compra.
5,Excelente capacidad y velocidad.
5,Funcionan perfectamente en mi placa x570 el perfil xmp no me dio ningun problema. Bastante recomendable si el precio es correcto. Compradas por 69€ en Noviembre 2020.
5,Looks the part easy instal obviously metallic white cover feels high quality
5,Montate senza problemi vengono tutte rilevate e funzionano.
5,Buena estética y funcionalidad. Tiene muchísimos estilos de iluminación. Lo único negativo es que no puedo manejarlo todo desde un mismo software y al final tengo el pc petado de programas para controlar las lucecitas de cada componente.
5,Ottimi colori Corsair una garanzia RAM molo veloci mi sono trovato subito bene col software icue per l'illuminazione
5,Fantastico prezzo. Questo è il RAM DDR4 3600 più conveniente che riesco a trovare.
5,Habe mir dieses RGB Erweiterungspaket gekauft um alle meine Ram bänke zu belegen und mit Licht auszustatten und muss sagen TOP. Gerne wieder!!!!
5,INcreible performance 100% recomendado
5,Really easy to install the software is also easy to install and works with other products.The rgb range is pretty good as well.
5,Ottime funzionali e veloci
5,Excelentes memorias RAM de corsair. Calidad de primera y buen look. Recomendables en cualquier setup.
5,Perfette per le mie esigenze
1,1 of the 4 sticks I got when installed just stops the pc from booting. Tried all slots (8) and one stick just makes the pc try and start then shutdown before actually starting. Disabled and no way out of house so cannot return them gutted.
5,Le sto ancora testando ma a livello estetico la variante white è incredibile.
5,No defraudan
5,Bilder sagen mehr als tausend Worte.Preis Leistung top und dazu noch 2 dummis und man hat ein perfektes Gesamtbild.Würde ich wieder Kaufen.
5,Niveau qualité on est sur l'un des meilleurs Niveau esthétique elle so t juste magnifique ! On peu gerer le rgb comme on le souhaite avec l'appli icub de corsairJ'ai les 3600 elle tourne bien !
5,La verdad no estaba seguro de querer unas rams con RGB pero se ven BRUTALES! Excelente calidad funcionan a la perfeccion muy rapidas y esteticamente geniales. Las recomiendo.
5,Great RAM from Corsair. Upgraded from Corsair Vengeance LPX 2400 and there is as small performance upgrade but this was more cosmetic for me to include some RGB.Easy to install looks amazing and helps to "finish the build"
5,Brilliant
5,Je n'hésiterais pas a en commander des nouvelles lorsque je le pourrais afin de booster la config a du 32gb au top !
5,Just built a new gaming pc and these suit the build to a tee. 16GB is plenty of ram and at speeds of 3200mhz you shouldn't consider anything else. The rgb lighting in this ram is also extremely bright and will add a real aesthetics boost to your rig there's millions of lighting and colour options to choose from also. Cant recommend this product enough.
5,Świetnie działa RGB pięknie się mieni w obudowie =] dla fanów ledów jak najbardziej polecane.
5,Veryy Nice and fast deliveryI already bought 2 :) Can't wait to get them next Thumbs up
5,Really easy to install (Duh). Looks really good and the iCUE software is easy to use. Probably worth the money since its high speed and decent size... future proof baby!
5,Super easy rgb looks great and fast as well the rgb comes at a price but well worth it id say
5,ram bellissime sia esteticamente che come illuminazione si posso controllare con qualsiasi software della scheda madre io le uso con msi z390 pro carbon e funziona benissimoimpostato il profilo xmp senza problemi in futuro proverò a fare oc per vedere quanto salgonoultra consigliate
5,comoradas por 109€ Corsair vengance rgb pro 2X8Gb 3200 cl16 son muy bonitas y de calidad superior con overclock automatico en placa Msi390 suben a 4000mhz con 1.36v totalmente estables.
5,Looks great with the rgb and foes great in my black and white build
5,Alles bestens würde ich wieder kaufen
5,Perfect condition
5,Amazing
3,Ne ce synchronise pas avec ma asus z490 malgré installation du plugin corsair et explications suivi donc déçu
5,Très belle ram et fonctionne super bien
5,Non l'ideale se cercate ram LP ma su velocità e stile (bianche RGB favolose) non hanno rivali probabilmente. In tutti i casi nella mia build ci stanno una meraviglia adesso anche più economiche consigliate in tutti i casi
5,Me ha gustado todo y lo he utilizado para que se vea mejor la imagen
5,They are stunning and fast
5,Looks awesome i got the white version. Maybe not the cheapest out there but woth the icue software you have alot of lighting options.
5,Memoria muy bonita sin ningún problema con la instalación hay que configurarla en la BIOS.
4,livraison impeccable. reconnu par le l'ordinateur mode xmp 2.0 ok  RAS
5,Qualité corsair au top ! utilisé sur une carte mère asus rog strix b550-a RGB parfait avec ICUE
5,nice looking ram rgb
5,I got 16GB of this RAM for a new RGB build I've made. It's good RAM and can easily be overclocked although I'm using XMP profiles at the moment without complaint. The RGB lighting looks fantastic. The packaging was standard secure and protective.
5,Alles super gelaufen!!!
5,The best ram ever mate.. Love the led and how they work.
5,Alles super!
5,RGB effects great and fairly bright. Always buy vengeance. Went for 3200MHz version as supported by the other components. In white - blends nicely with white case.
5,RGB is great great combo with the white heatsinks
5,Molto belle e senza problemi installate riconosciute subito.... consigliatissime
4,Great Rgb
5,Servizio amazon perfetto come sempre grazie memorie corsair ottime
5,mashalla einfach der hübsche!
5,Livraison parfaite même si colis mal protégé (aucune mousse ou amortisseur). Colis en parfait état et fonctionne très bien
5,Très bien
5,arrived safe despite being in a rather small envelope.  Works great.
5,10/10.
5,Realmente estoy encantada con estas memorias desde la presentación del packaging hasta la funcionalidad. Las recomiendo si lo que buscan es un buen RGB para un gabinete abierto.
5,Valido
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Mémoire avec le meilleur rapport qualité prix.Effet lumineux très beau
5,Parfait et très rapide
5,A good nice memory ram work perfect and so beautiful in white color
5,Bin bisher sehr zufrieden. Sehen super aus und wirken sehr solide sowie hochwertig. Angegebene Geschwindigkeiten werden unter XMP II ebenfalls erreicht. Optisch definitiv ein Blickfang.
5,Top bit of kit I had 2400mhz before with my ryzen 1600x an it wasn't all that got this ram at 3200mhz an the ryzen chip perked right up I'm happy to say the least
5,Easy to install came within 2 days..Would highly recommend
5,Très bon produit
5,Velocidad y compatibilidad con AMD . ESTÉTICA Y DISIPACIÓN DE CALOR PERFECTAS.
5,Really good beautiful and fast ram vengeance 3600 mhz!!!
5,compatible avec B550-F ROG STRIX
5,Duo de barrette de très bonne qualité connecté sans problème en 3600mhz à ma carte mère Msi B450 je recommande fortement! Ps: Qualité Corsair ++
5,Correspond à la description.
5,Looks amazing and really easy to oc.
5,Easy to installVery nice looking with controlable rgbA bit expensive but nice !
5,Amazing colors beautiful and performant just insane
5,Sieht nice aus und funkt auch Top für 110€ aber etwas teuer
5,Estupenda memoria RAM la iluminación de la misma se controla desde el software iCue de Corsair.
5,As advertised
5,Probably the best rgb sticks you can find rn on the market
5,Veloci cattive ed RGB
5,Très bon kit ddr4
5,RGB is bright and easy to customise and the speeds are great
5,best item work so well for my pc
4,i haven't use their full capacity yet so can't tell
5,Es lo que se espera de las memorias son muy buenas y no he tenido ningún problema todo ok.
5,Ottima Amazonspedizione rapida e puntuale.La RAM CORSAIR e' una garanzia di un'ottimo prodottosia belle da' vedere e sia con ottime caratteristiche tecniche.
3,me equivoque yo soy de intel cuando la quieres OC te da error y son  incompatibles con las demas.
5,Der schönste RGB Speicher den ich je gesehen hab.
5,Flawless
5,Angenehm schnell und RGB über iCue easy steuerbar.
3,Senza dubbio l estetica e l'rgb sono spettacolari e la marca Corsair  é una garanzia.Però il prezzo é stato stra-gonfiato e la versione bianca costava 30€ in piu dei banchi neri... secondo me ingiustificato il prezzo... valgono 80€ non 140€!Se le.trovate al.giusto prezzo sono perfette
5,Produit ultra bien fini  couleur blanc qui va réveiller tout vos composants  reçu rapidement  très bien protéger je recommande ! YT : Jaboubix
5,die schauen richtig gut aus sehr schnelle lieferung
4,Looks clean
5,Conforme au produit attendu
5,Läuft zuverlässig auf 3200mhz.Keine Ausfälle oder Probleme.Kommen halt schlicht in Plastikverpackung.Hab sie erst seit 1-2 Monaten aber bis jetzt ohne Beschwerden.Lieferung war auch sehr schnell
2,3600MHzを購入したが3600MHzでは起動できず、3400MHzでやっと動きましたが、動作が不安定。Ryzenには向かないようです。
5,comme tjrs le matériel Corsair tient toutes ses promesses
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Super très bonne qualité jolie
5,8GB×4枚で32GBにしました。完全見た目で選びました。マザーボードの初期不良で色々壊れてる箇所を探す為5〜8回抜き差ししましたが特に問題なく使えました。普通のメモリよりでかいし重いです。
5,Bonito diseño
3,Habe 4 im einsatz jedoch läuft die RGB Beleuchtung nach einer gewissen Zeit nicht mehr synchron. Wenn man die Software startet wird es wieder synchronisiert jedoch finde ich das sollte auch ohne gehen.
5,This Ram is awesome. Looks great in my case with the rest of my LED lights
5,Ce sont de très jolie barrettes de RAM  elles fonctionnent comme prévu  le RGB contrôlé par Icue est très simple et intuitif  . Elles complète le reste de ma configuration sans me ruiner .
5,最短到着予定日より1日早く着きました。2〜3週間待ち予定だったので、3週間かかる気持ちで待っていたお陰もあってか、とても早く来た感じがします。他のレビューで届かないなどあったので、不安もありましたし…梱包は、落花生型の梱包材でしっかり梱包されていました。そのため、外箱の凹みなども全くありませんでした。また、動作確認をしましたが、特に問題もなくBIOSで認識しました。取り敢えずOCを設定して、メモリが5000Mhzで動くところまで確認して、初期設定に戻しました。まぁ、OS入れて安定稼働させた訳でもないので、参考値です。64GB(32×2)×2セットを購入しましたが、追加購入をしたいと思います。
5,Some of the best ram I've ever bought very reliable
5,Ottimo prodotto 😎
5,💯✅
5,Arrivate come al solito in pochissimi giorni mi hanno subito esaltato per la loro qualità costruttiva.Che dire poi nel mio sistema si integrano alla perfezione e sono bellissime con gli effetti luce dati dai led integrati.
5,Ottime ram installate su una asus prime x470 e ryzen 7 2700x. Nessun tipo di problema frequenza in automatico a 2133 impostato sul bios a 3200 e funzionano perfettamente. Consiglio l'articolo
5,Excellent performance
5,pour ma part j'ais pris la version 3200mhz qui est selon moi qui suis streamer la meilleur pour mon activerle rgb se commende via le logiciel corsair icueelle sont très performante et pas cher selon moi
5,👍🏽
5,Très beaux  très rapide produit va bien a 3 200 mhz sans problème très bon investissement  je suis vraiment satisfait du produit .
2,La memoria non era stabile nelle impostazioni XMP neppure a 3000mhz anche dopo la sostituzione su Crosshair VIII IMPACT una delle migliori schede madri per la stabilità e benchmark delle memorie. A volte io computer si riavviava per la perdita di dati nella memoria operativa!Sono passato a Crucial che montano chip  micron nessun problema ed instabilità a 3600 Cl16 di fabbrica!Un gran peccato perché sono bellissime e tengono in memoria gli effetti e colori.
5,The RAM sticks look incredible and they work amazing.
5,Montate su Asus Z390 Prime con i5 9600kriconosciute subito a 3200MHz senza attivare il profilo xmp.Esteticamente sono molto belle da vedere e i led RGB sono regolabili tramite il software ICue  scaricabile dal sito Corsair.Assolutamente consigliate
5,Für wenig Geld super 3200mhz DDR4 Ram 2x8gb kit. Extrem cooles Design/ Super helle RGB Beleuchtung. Top Qualität
5,It has RGB what more do u want?
5,parfait
5,Looks so pretty though being skint makes me want more
5,Maravilla pa que decir más
5,lovely
5,TOP
5,Super facile d'utilisation
2,
2,Und mehr wie 3000 mhz sind nicht drin.Mein Asus Rog Strix  Z 270 Board erkennt den Speicher Problemlos und taktet ihn entsprechend bzw. passt die Voltage auch auf 3600 mhz. Nur bleibt der Bildschirm schwarz bis man den Takt bis 3000 mhz runtergeregelt hat.Ich werde mir nochmal ein paar andere Meinungen einholen aber bis jetzt hält sich meine Begeisterung echt in Grenzen.
5,Immer super Qualität
5,Der RAM funktioniert wie er soll.Die Beleuchtung vom RAM sieth Richtig gut aus.
5,je me suis monté une config "blanche" et les barrettes on parfaitement trouver leur place !magnifiquepuissante et fiable !
5,it works
5,very good
5,Carnero de gran aspecto ¡el rgb es increíble! Funciona a 3200 mhz con mi ryzen zen2 3600 + Asus Strix b350 motherboard.Un gran valor!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ottime performance e buona resa cromatica. Rispetto alle ram tradizionali sono un po' più ingombranti.. Valutate bene lo spazio che avete a disposizione. Mediante l'apposito software é possibile gestire i giochi di luce e creare effetti particolari
5,colours are very very bright on them other wise no complaints
1,********** delivery driver thought it was a good idea to shove £300 worth of product through the ******** letterbox like a **** Amazon train your driverss better when handling pricey good you ******** Other than that very good product easy to install.
5,Parfait
5,Easy one click xmp.Look good.Fast.
5,SUPER bright and gorgeous.I'm going to buy another 2.
5,Very good
5,Ce kit de RAM est tout simplement magnifique. D'une grande élégance il sera ravir votre PC. Facile d'installation et personnalisable  à l'infinie vous les trouverez à votre gout sans problème.Je recommande à 100%
5,Corsair never let me down. Beautiful product.
5,Perfect exactly what I needed for my PC fast delivery
5,Fast delivery looking good product good price 👍
1,Ich habe so ziemlich alles angestellt was man machen kann um diesen Arbeitsspeicher Kit mit den angegebenen 3200MHz laufen zu lassen. Es ist egal mit welchen Einstellungen auch immer keinerlei Systemstabilität vorhanden.Verbaut ist Hynix CFR und in welchem meiner Systeme auch immer ich diesen Kit verbaue die im SPD hinterlegten Einstellungen funktionieren zwar solange ich Windows normal nutze jedoch unter tatsächlicher Last ist ein BSOD/Systemcrash nur eine Frage der Zeit. An XMP oder "Safe" errechnete Timings mit dem Ryzen DRAM Calculator ist nicht im Traum zu denken bei der angegebenen Taktfrequenz von 3200MHz die er ohnehin nicht stabil hinbekommt noch Timings zu verengen lässt einen nicht mal mehr Windows starten.Bei Frequenzen unter 3000MHz CL16 läuft der Speicher Stabil. Dafür habe ich Allerdings nicht bezahlt. Lahme Kits die unter 3000MHz 16er Timings haben kosten in der Regel nicht mal die Hälfte von dem hier.Edit: nach viel herumprobieren und vielen BSOD's "Memory Management" (immer wieder...) hat sich herausgestellt dass einer der Riegel offenbar defekt geliefert wurde. Seit ich diesen ausgebaut habe läuft mein PC absolut stabil. Qualität scheint für Corsair nur in der Optik wichtig zu sein.
1,Vendu comme de la ddr4 3200mhzSi je lance le pc en fréquence de ram 3200mhz tout beug… et si je le met en auto ( dans le bios ) il se lance en 2133mhz. L’article recu n’est pas celui vendu.
5,These are so freaking pretty RGB is life! And they perform very well with base overclocking would reccomended
5,gran articulo a un buen precio escelente calidad...
5,Ok
5,Tres bon rendu un peu haute pour en mettre 4 sur ma carte mère 390 carbon a couse du ventirad.Attention bien entré dans le bios la valeur car par défaut elles fonctionnent en 2133 mhzEmballage ok et livraison ok

5,Fantastico grazie Rgb Corsair Vengeance👑🧡
5,Ok
5,i did not tried overclock but 3200mhz which is the stock is very good and stable for ryzen cpu
3,中のメモリチップがいろんなメーカーの物があるようです。今回のサムスンのものだったせいか、XMPにある設定通りのタイミングで3200動作しなかった。レイテンシを細かく変えれば動作はしたが、メーカーの設定で動かないのは駄目なんでは？
5,none
5,Fonctionne tres bien
5,I love aesthetics!  the rgb look great !!!!
5,livraison impéc les ram fonctionne parfaitement bien sur ma configryzen5 3600xasus x570.
5,Läuft einwandfrei mit einzel ansteuerbaren beleuchtungszonen und sieht dementsprechend gut aus
1,Leider ist die Qualität nicht gut und der Support ist extern gelagert und man möchte für den Defekt leider nicht aufkommen. Leider ist der Artikel nun unbrauchbar und das Geld dafür leider auch futsch. Für meine Tochter ist das eine ganze Menge. Nicht zu empfehlen. Leider sehr schade.
5,The RGB colours are impressive. Quick Ram.
1,quand je joue le jeu crash et s'arrête
3,Leider sind bereits nach nicht einmal einem Monat Farbnuancen unterschiede zu sehen  gerade bei weiß fällt es in einigen Bereichen auf . Werde auf einen Umtausch hoffen denn Premiumprodukte sollten auch halten was sie versprechen. Alles in allemist der Artikelvon der Leuchtkraft vollkommen i.O
1,Il est ecrit "Vengeance PRO" je me suis dit que les photos était peut etre mal choisi par rapport au titre. Mais non le titre est bien faux il ne sagit pas des Pro mais des barettes Vengeance standard. contant du résultat quand meme je vais pas chipoter mais ça commence a etre une habitude sur Amazon les faux titres même chose vecu sur une carte mere NZXT avec titre mensonger acheter en meme temps que les barettes
5,Provate ed è veramente bello l’effetto che fa.
5,Zusammen mit meinem Ryzen 2600 auf einem Asus Corsair Hero VI verbaut. Läuft wunderbar sind Hynix CJR Chips verbaut.
5,No tengo palabras sobre precio i calidad de rendimiento con AMD al.cañon las memorias
2,J'ai un soucis avec ces barrettes de RAM elles sont reconnues par Windows 10 cela fonctionne mais aléatoirement mon pc me fait des écran bleu avec comme erreur :REFERENCE_BY_POINTERIRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUALetMEMORY_MANAGEMENTJ'ai un processeur ryzen 7 3800xC'est très agaçant :/ J'ai du remettre mes anciennes RAM et vais devoir les renvoyer...
5,tres bonnetemperature sur 3600hz stabile a 40-41 Celsius
5,El programa iCue para configurar las luces esta de maravilla. Veanlo en la web. Es buena inversion. :)
5,Barette ram rgb excellente stabilité et s illumine avec le logiciel corsair
5,Très bon produit très stables
1,Tenía ya dos módulos (comprados en otra web) con el perfil xmp activado para sacarle el máximo rendimiento en cuanto a frecuencia ya que sino no trabajan a 3200 y perfectas. Fue añadir estos módulos y empezaron los pantallazos azules... Adjunto imagen de la herramienta de windows aunque en memtest también da fallos... Con perfil xmp desactivado si funcionan por lo que están defectuosas como ya comentó un compañero en otra opinión más antigua. Una lástima porque es buena ram.
5,Gonna fit right in with my build so glad they had a colour verient
5,Très belle barrette de ram ! Très performant RGB au top .
1,購入した商品を早速取り付けましたが，認識はするものの，光らず，差し込む箇所を変えても変化なし。初期不良と判断し，返品を依頼しました。交換用の商品もすぐに発送していただき，対応には大変満足しています。
1,タイトルの通りである。中身を見るまでもなく返却。PCパーツ製品の場合、開封品＝使用済み返却品としか判断できない。amazonでは新品を購入しているのであって、開封済み中古品を受け取るつもりはない。
5,Très bon parfait
2,No me duró ni dos meses luego me costo un triunfo que amazon me tramitara la devolución ya que me remetia al fabricante en un proceso demasiado farragoso. Una mala experiencia en definitiva.
5,Bien emballé bon rapport qualité prix
5,very good
5,Love it.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 IF you looking for a great looking RGB Memory for your PC - Corsair Vengeance RGB RS 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz C16 should be your choice.Speed wise they absolutely fine. Not the fastest on the market but definitely one of best looking RGB Memory.
1,The one working stick does the job perfectly the other is useless. I've tested both sticks in all of my ram slots only one is able to run the computer. The working one does the job fine though.
4,Bon je vous avoue je ne suis pas très fan des lumières qui clignotent dans tous les sens. Mais chacun ses goûts... respect !Bref tout cela pour dire que je n'ai pas testé cet aspect ni les possibilités éventuelles. Ce n'est pas le principal.Pour le reste cela fait plus de 30 ans que je suis dans les PC (mes premiers Amstrad 1512 puis le 2386 avec son disque dur de... 65 Mo ! lol) et la marque ne m'a jamais fait défaut...Après les performances sont excellentes mais je n'ai jamais cherché a faire des comparaisons ni test... D'ailleurs à ce niveau si c'est pour gagner quelques ms...Mais bref une marque de confiance à l'excellente fiabilité.Les mémoires sont très bien emballées et font leur poids. Aucun soucis pour l'installation sur une carte mère Asus AM4.
5,As memory goes this memory kit from Corsair is top notch. It’s great quality ram that is super stable reliable and delivers the advertised performance. But the main feature of these is the RGB lighting and there they don’t disappoint. They look stunning and if you pair them with other parts from the Corsair RGB line then you have a drool worthy system that you can proudly show up to any LAN party with. And please if you don’t have a PC case that is either clear or one that has a clear side window then please don’t bother with these as there’s no point because you can just get cheaper RAM without the RGB lighting.
1,hält nicht was er verspricht
4,Rezensiert wird der Speicher in der Größe von 16 GB (2 Riegel zu je 8 GB/ Dualchannel).Zunächst einmal ist der Speicher stabil verpackt.Die Riegel selbst sind ebenfalls stabil gebaut und sehen meiner Ansicht nach gut aus. Die Höhe der Riegel bemisst sich auf stolze 45 cm inklusive Anschlussleiste (das ist rund 1 cm mehr als z.B. beim Modell Corsair VENGEANCELPX 3600/ ASIN B07RM39V5F). Vermutlich liegt die Höhe an der LED-Beleuchtung. Es lohnt sich also vor dem Kauf darauf zu achten ob der CPU-Lüfter dem Einbau nicht im Wege steht.Die Beleuchtung sieht zwar gut aus wurde von mir aber nicht weiter getestet da ich ein undurchsichtiges Gehäuse habe. Immerhin beim Einbau konnte ich daran erkennen dass die Riegel mit Strom versorgt werden.Getestet wurde mit einem MSI X370 SLI Plus Mainboard der Ryzen 5 3600X CPU und einer MSI Geforce RTX 2070 Grafikkarte.Anmerkung: Bitte nach dem Einau in's BIOS gehen und das passende XMP-Profil des Speichers auswählen da er sonst nur auf 2132 statt 3600 Mhz laufen wird.Zu den technischen Daten sind der Rezension Screenshots des Tool CPU-Z beigefügt. Was fällt auf?- Der Speicher ist Single-Rank. Was bedeutet das? Ein Rank ist eine Gruppe von Speicherhips auf einem Riegel die mit 64 Bit adressiert werden. Bei Dual-Rank hat man auf einem Riegel zwei solcher Gruppen was eine parallele Adressierung erlaubt. Das geht bei Single-Rank nicht womit sie etwas langsamer sind als Dual-Rank-Riegel.- Die Speicherchips selbst sind von Micron. Chips von Micron kamen auch auf meinen alten Riegeln Crucial Ballistix Sport LT (ASIN B07MNJP6RW) zum Einsatz die sehr beliebt waren da sehr gut zur Übertaktung geeignet.- Der maximale Takt nach Spezifikation des Herstellers ist 3600 Mhz (17996 Mhz pro Riegel) bei Timings von 18-22-22-42-CR1. (CR = Command Rate)- Overclocking: Mit den gleichen Timings kann ich ihn aber auch stabil mit 3800 Mhz (18996 Mhz pro Riegel) fahren. Mehr habe ich nicht versucht man muss ja nicht übertreiben. In einem Test von Hardware-Helden (bitte selbst googlen) konnten aber auch 4266 MHz mit 19-23-23-44-CR2 erreicht werden welches aber nicht das scnellste Gesamtsetting war. Als solches stellten sich 4000 MHz bei 16-19-19-38-CR1 heraus. Bei meinen Tuningversuchen ist es bei einigen Settings dazu gekommen dass der PC zwar noch zu booten schien aber die Grafikkarte kein Bild mehr ausgab wodurch man dann auch kein BIOS mehr zu sehen bekommt. Dann hilft nur noch ein BIOS-Reset über das Mainboard (Jumper) oder erst den alten Speicher wieder einzubauen dann die Einstellungen im BIOS zu korrigieren um danach wieder den neuen Speicher einzusetzen und es erneut zu versuchen.Anmerkung: Overclocking auf eigene Gefahr und was auf dem einen System funktioniert muss auf dem Anderen nicht auch klappen.Preis/Leistung: Der hier rezensierte Speicher wird aktuell von Amazon für 10971 € angeboten. Das Vorgängermodell Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB (2x8GB) 3600MHz (ASIN B07TB3R9JB) schlägt nur mit 9051 € zu buche und wer auf die Beleuchtung verzichten kann zahlt für den oben geannten Corsair VENGEANCELPX 3600 nur 7390 €.Im Fazit ein guter Speicher wenn auch noch etwas teuer. Der Gewinn an Geschwindigkeit zu Modellen mit nur 3200 Mhz scheint spürbar auch wenn es kein Dual-Rank-Speicher ist. Die Spürbarkeit ist aber subjektiv und Generationen von Testern im Netz streiten über die Erhöhung des Taktes vs. gleichzeitiger Verlangsamerung der Timings. Das gilt erst Recht bei Übertaktung wozu sich die verwendeten Micron Speicherchips gut eignen die Riegel von Corsair aber tückisch sein können.
5,Le top !
5,This memory kit looks insanely cool when used in conjunction with the Corsair RGB fans and CPU coolers you can get. You can sync them all together and create some amazing lighting effects. With this being Corsair RAM you don’t need to worry about the quality or reliability of the RAM as it’s solid.
4,Attention l'installation est très simple mais relisez bien la notice de votre carte mère.Il y a des slots qui doivent être utilisés en priorités. Dans mon cas installer les barrettes dans les slots de libre empêchait un démarrage de l'ordinateurj'ai du retirer les anciennes mettre les nouvelles en slots 0 et 2 puis ajouter les anciennes en slots 1 et 3.Pour les performances c'est difficile à juger pleinement car cela dépend de la config utilisée et du jeu en lui même.Dans mon cas la fluidité des jeux s'est accrue même en ajoutant des détails.Pensez que pour profiter pleinement des effets il faut absolument un boitier transparent.
5,Bon produit
5,The memory kit arrived safely and it comes nicely packed inside well illustrated premium looking retail packaging.The modules look super high quality and are finished to a very high standard I love the finish of the aluminium heat spreaders and the Vengeance logo. These definitely look like a premium bit of kit and would look great on display in customised case!Geared towards AMD Ryzen I chose to pair these with a Ryzen 9 5900X on a Gigabyte motherboard and they have been absolutely rock solid for the past month running in XMP mode. I’ve played a variety of new games including BF2042 and Forza Horizon 5 with them and even with the current state of these games I’ve still maintained high FPS and not had any crashes so far after about 120 hours combined playtime. Along with my NVME drive any application or game loads as quickly as possible and the computer just generally feels nice and snappy.The iCUE software has got considerably better over the last few years and I’m a big fan of the new GUI Corsair use. You can choose some really cool lighting effects to be displayed on your RAM and the 10-zone RGB lighting makes for some amazingly bright colour shows not to mention it can be synced with all your other iCUE devices for maximum bragging rights! The temperatures can be viewed on the dashboard or even displayed on your Nexus Companion if you have one and while playing games the temperatures always stayed under 50 degrees C in my Corsair 460X case.Overall not only does this memory kit look great but it performs exceptionally well with rock solid stability and it represents good value for money. A great choice for any mid to high range PC you can’t go wrong with Corsair. It’s a product I’m happy to recommend and its feel its worth the full five stars buy with confidence!
4,Ces barrettes de RAM sont esthétiques pour les personnes qui aiment les couleurs dans leur PC je pense que c’est un très bon choix. La transition entre les couleurs et très douce c’est fluide et très agréable à regarder. Le logiciel permet de bien synchroniser ces couleurs et de les personnaliser pour mettre une couleur fixe ou un des nombreux autres modes d’affichage. Les performances quant à elles sont au rendez-vous de base elles ne fonctionnent qu’à 3200 MHz pour les faire fonctionner à leur pleine puissance (3600 MHz) il faut entrer dans le bios pour activer le profil XMP 2.0.Je ne mets pas 5 étoiles car en passant à 3600 MHz le démarrage est devenu très instable je n’ai réussi à rentrer dans le BIOS qu’une seule fois sur 5 redémarrages. Je ne sais pas du tout ce qui peut causer ce problème si c’est ma carte mère (ASROCK B550m Pro4) ou bien mon processeur (AMD Ryzen 5 3600) mais cela n’empêche pas de fonctionner mais pas au maximum de leur capacité.
1,J'ai branché ces deux barrettes (2x 8GO) en plus des 16 go que j'avais deja au bout de 20 minutes mes jeux plantent !J'ai mis a jour le bios regler les frequences de ram activer XMP rien n'y fait !Par contre quand je reviens sur ma config de base plus aucun plantage des jeux
5,It arrived well packed. It comes with a 2x8GB DDR4. Great product made my pc so fast all. They look great and perform better. Really simple to install and I have had no issues with performance. It has been running very smoothly with AMD Ryzen 3600x.Overall I really like them and they perform really well. Recommend it.
4,Mein Kurzfazit vorweg+ leichter Einbau+ individualisierbare RBG-Beleuchtung+ mehr PowerFür mehr Details einfach weiter lesen - viel Spaß dabeiDer ArbeitsspeicherDie Riegel kommen gut verpackt an. Sie machen einen ordentlichen Eindruck. Die Verabreitung ist gut. Ein Highlight ist die dynmasische RGB-Beleuchtung. In der Leuchtleiste an der Oberseite der Riegel sitzen LED's die separat angesteuert werden können. Über ein vom Hersteller angebotenes Programm können viele unterschiedliche voreingestellte Modi verwendet werden was ein echter Hingucker ist. Ein Aluminiumkühlkörper soll vor zu groeßr Wärmeentwicklung schützen und so auch das Übertakten problemlos möglich machen. Der EInbau gestaltet sich simpel. Der Arbeitsspeicher kann einfach auf Motherboard aufgesteckt werden. Ich bin kein PC-Experte aber habe das Gefühl dass seit ich den Speicher eingebaut habe die Performance meines Desktop-PC deutlich besser geworden ist. Daher bin ich mit dem Produkt zufrieden. Bei einem Preis von ca. 90 Euro bin ich der Meinung dass es sich um ein gutes Preis-Leitungs-Verhältnis handelt
5,Neuer Computer Neuer Ram sollte man zumindest meinen aber dem war am Anfang nicht ganz so weil ich noch meinen alten genutzt habe aber das fällt jetzt weg jetzt ist hier endlich alles so wie es sein soll.Der Ram Sieht auf den Ersten Blick schonmal Klasse aus. Das RGB wirklich super gemacht und Clean der Diffusor macht was er Soll und das passt eben wirklich super in jedes System.Der Ram Selber war schnell zurück gesetzt via CMOS Knopf und dann im Bios wurde auch direkt der Ram mit 3600mhz angezeigt so wie das auch für die neueren AMD Chips sein muss wegen dem InfinityFabric das ja auf 1800mhz läuft und ich gehört habe das RAM der doppelt so schnell läuft genau richtig ist dafür und das haben wir hier ja.Ich habe dann im nächsten schritt einfach mal einen Test gestartet damit ich auch gucken kann ob der RAM in Ordnung ist und da ergab sich auch absolut kein Fehler alles war problemlos am laufen und das jetzt auch mit Voller Leistung.Ich kann es nicht genug sagen der Ram sieht halt einfach nur Toll aus mit dem RGB und macht sich wirklich hervorragend vor allem im Dunkel wenn dann der Ganze PC erleuchtet wird einfach Toll!
5,Der "Vengeance RGB RT 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4 3.600MHz C18 Arbeitsspeicher (Dynamische RGB-Beleuchtung Optimiert für AMD 300/400/500 Series Kompatibilität mit Intel 300/400/500 Series) Weiß" von Corsair kam schnell und gut bei uns an verpackt in einem kleinen stabilen Pappkarton.Wir haben ihn in einem etwas älteren PC eingebaut und getestet. Da das Board nur eine Geschwindigkeit von 2667MHz kann läuft auch der RAM nur so schnell. Er ist also auch abwärts kompatibel. Dafür aber fehlerfrei und besser als vorher.Am coolsten ist hier die schicke RGB-LED-Beleuchtung. Er lohnt sich also nur in einem durchsichtigen Gehäuse dass man auch noch gut sehen kann.Mit der Software von Corsair kann man diese auch noch individuell einstellen.
4,Als mir diese beiden Venegance RGB RS 8 GB Arbeitsspeicher von Corsair zum Testen angeboten wurden war gerade der Sohn meines Mannes bei mir. Da der sich seine Rechner immer selbst zusammenbaut und auch uns bislang immer half wenn wir irgendein Problem mit unseren Rechnern hatten fragte ich ihn ob die für unsere Rechner benötigt würden.Die Antwort war dass die bei meinem oder beim Rechner seines Paps (Acer und HP so wie gekauft) nicht nötig wären weil unsere Arbeitsspeicher mit unseren Nutzungsgewohnheiten sowieso nicht an ihre Grenzen stoßen würden. Er selbst könnte sie allerdings für seinen selbst zusammengebauten Gaming-Rechner sehr gut verwenden und würde sie auch gern ausprobieren. Er war sich im Vorfeld lediglich nicht ganz sicher ob sie auch mit seinen beiden bereits verbauten 8 GB RAMs eines anderen Herstellers kompatibel wären.Optische Unterschiede zu den Produktfotos konnte er nach Lieferung der beiden RAMs nicht feststellen. Die Verarbeitung empfindet er als Top. Allerdings hatte er das von Corsair – er hat auch schon einiges dieser Marke verbaut und hatte noch nie einen Grund zur Klage – auch nicht anders erwartet. Die RAMs machen bereits optisch etwas her und er findet es wegen der RGBs fast ein bisschen schade dass er ein geschlossenes Gehäuse hat. Dennoch leuchten sie recht lustig durch die Lüftungsschlitze. Die Farbpalette der Beleuchtung kann man über iCUE sehr einfach anpassen.Er hat diese Arbeitsspeicher vor gut zwei Wochen in seinen Rechner eingebaut und sie funktionieren. Sind halt für Ryzen Mainboard und CPU konzipiert und das hat er ebenfalls verbaut. Nach dem Einstecken in die Slots schaute er im UEFI ob sie angenommen werden. Das wurden sie also sind sie zu seinen älteren RAMs kompatibel. Technisch wurden die jeweils 8 GB RAM geliefert und zusammen erreichen sie eine potentielle Taktrate von 3700 MHz (3600 laut Hersteller). Also ist das auch in Ordnung.Sollte es langfristig gesehen zu irgendwelchen Problemen kommen werden wir diese Rezension ergänzen. Momentan ist „mein Kleiner“ (er misst stolze 197 m) mit diesen beiden neuen RAMs sehr zufrieden. Allerdings hätte er sie selbst sich zum derzeitigen Kaufpreis von etwas über 100 Euro eher nicht gekauft weil er das doch als ein bisschen zu teuer empfindet.
5,Habe den Corsair Vengeance RGB RT 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4 3.600MHz C18 Arbeitsspeicher auf meinem MSI MEG X570 UNIFY mit 3900x installiert der Ram wurde sofort erkannt und nach dem ich DOCP aktiviert habe wurde er auch in der richtigen und vollen Geschwindigkeit von 3.600MHz erkannt und läuft stabil.OC habe ich bisher nicht versucht da mir die Geschwindigkeit mehr als ausreicht.Der Ram arbeitet einwandfrei im Rahmen der technischen Spezifikation.Gewohnt gute Qualität von Corsair gut verpackt und schon beim Auspacken fällt die Wertigkeit auf.Mi der Corsair Software iCue können die  Corsair Geräte vom Lichteffekt Modus Richtung und auch Geschwindigkeit angepasst werden.Die RGB Beleuchtung ist auch ein echter EyecatcherWer einen gut verarbeiteten stabilen Arbeitsspeicher mit toller frei einstellbarer Beleuchtung haben will sollte diesen kaufen.Alles in allem kann ich den RAM nur weiterempfehlen!
4,Die Zeiten für RAM haben sich dahingehend geändert dass die Riegel jetzt auch ästhetische Ansprüche und einen gewissen Plingpling-Faktor erfüllen müssen. Darüber kann man müde lächeln aber z.B. in einem Talius Cronos Gaming-Gehäuse sieht das - in Kombination mit passenden LED-Kühlern - dann schon auch unverschämt stylisch aus. In diesem Punkt zeigen die "neuen" Corsair dann auch keine Schwächen. Haptisch und stylisch perfektioniert nennt man das dann wohl.Das Drumherum hat seinen Preis. Die verbaute Leistung ist identisch mit den ursprünglichen Vengeance RGB d.h. als Speicherchips werden Micron-E verbaut. Dementsprechend fabulös und "übertrieben" ist die angebliche Perfektionierung für AMD denn der Arbeitsspeicher ist immer noch der gleiche Allrounder wie er immer war. Übrigens mit nur bedingt stabilen Leistungsdaten beim Übertackten weshalb ich diesen Punkt ebenfalls nicht übergewichten würde.Fazit: Technisch gut optisch mit Ausrufezeichen. Back to Basic wäre günstiger aber nicht ganz so farbenfroh.
5,Excellente marque avec un excellent produit.Aujourd'hui on arrive à avoir les 16GB de RAM en DDR4 en C16 pour pas trop cher si en plus on a une marque sérieuse et du RGB alors pourquoi s'en priver ?Ajoutées sur ma X470 Aorus (gigabyte) elles sont reconnues sans problème et tout est gérable directement depuis ma CM.J'aime beaucoup le RGB et avec ma CM j'ai pu synchroniser les couleurs des ventilateurs du boitier avec celles de la RAM.N'oubliez pas d'activer le XMP profile dans le BIOS c'est bête d'utiliser de la RAM à une vitesse moindre que celle initialement prévue. Pour vérifier ceci il faut regarder dans le gestionnaire des tâches à partir de Windows 10 dans la partie mémoire vive et regarer la vitesse indiquée en Mhz si c'est 3200 c'est parfait si c'est moins il faut activer le profil XMP.Vitesse de 3200Mhz en CL16 c'est bien même s'il y a mieux mais ça conviendra à la grande majorité des gamers.Excellent produit comme toujours Corsair c'est le top.Je recommande.
5,In a clear case gaming set up these look absolutely fantastic the lighting modes are great in an already lit gaming room. Installation couldn’t be easier and no running issues. Would definitely recommend for aesthetics as well as functionality.

1,Après moins d’un Moi d’utilisation une de mes deux barrettes et hs se qui font planter mon ordinateur en bloucle. Il y aurai possibilité de la renvoyé à corsaire pour qui voie bien qu’elle sont hs et qu’il m’en renvois en état de marche ? Honnêtement première grosse desseption sur un produit corsait j’espere Qu’ils seront quoi faire.
5,Das Preis - Leistungsverhältnis ist wirklich klasse bei dem RAM. Für unter 100 Euro bekommt man hier gleich zwei Riegel zu je 8GB. Beide zusammen ergeben also 16GB und da es die gleiche Leistung ist laufen sie zusammen auch absolut klasse.Der Einbau ist weniger als Einbau zu bezeichnen und mehr ein einfach Einstecken was üblich ist bei Ramriegeln udn hier tadellos funktioniert. Die Farbeinstellung ist eine nette Spielerei die auch noch in dem günstigsten Preis enthalten ist. Unnötig wird dies bei dunklen geschlossenen Cases ansonsten aber wirklich hübsch.Die Leistung ist wirklich klasse und mein Desktop PC läuft sehr schnell und flüssig.Fazit: Für gutes Geld bekommt man einen tollen Arbeitsspeicher mit netter Lichtspielerei. Die beiden sind übrigens sehr sicher und gut verpackt!Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Super Preis-Leistungsverhältnis!Völlig unkompliziert und somit auch für Laien einfach einzubauen.Einwandfreie Leistung also genau das warum man sich so etwas kauft!Der Rechner läuft jetzt wieder rund und schnell und der Nutzer ist mega-glücklich!
5,Great looking LED's. Would have gone great with other Corsair peripherals so the lights would sync and that's something to keep in mind if you are starting from scratch.
5,Easy to install and look better than most I’ve had once in and running the lighting modes are great aesthetically. Form & function at a fab price.
1,This is my 32 gb ram's what is that?
4,Für Sympathisanten der RGB Beleuchtung und allem vor an für die aufgehübschten Gaming PCs um auf der LAN nicht nur mit Performance sondern auch mit Optik zu glänzen ist das genau der richtige RAM.Die Beleuchtung kann im automatischen Modus laufen oder via CORSAIR iCUE-Software individuell über Profile angepasst werden.So kann man ein stimmiges Gesamtkonzept mit anderer LED Beleuchtung entwerfen.Wichtig ist im Bios das richtige XMP-Profil einzustellen damit man auch wirklich mit den 3600 MHz arbeitet.Für Freunde der Übertaktung ist der RAM ebenfalls empfehlenswert da man durchaus mit 3800MHz bzw. sogar 4000MHz laufen lassen kann. Alle Versuche in der Richtung natürlich auf eigene Gefahr.»🚦Vorteile und Nachteile 🚦✅ individuelle RGB Beleuchtung✅ gute Performance✅ übertaktungsgeeignet🟡 preisintensiv❌ etwas größer durch RGB Beleuchtung➡️ FazitIm Endeffekt muss man selber abwägen ob man RGB Beleuchtung beim RAM benötigt oder nicht. Für Case Modder sicher interessant aber für den normalen Gamer vermutlich nicht von Bedeutung. Der RAM erfüllt auf jeden Fall seinen Zweck und sieht optisch klasse aus.Kaufempfehlung? 👍—👉 Ich hoffe meine Bewertung war nützlich und konnte bei der Kaufentscheidung weiterhelfen? Vielen Dank! 👍
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Der Arbeitsspeicher des Computers ist ein nicht zu unterschätzender Punkt welche auf die Geschwindigkeit des Rechners eine unmittelbare Auswirkung haben kann.  Wundert man sich warum Programme nur langsam öffnen und auch der Betrieb nicht sonderlich flott verlaufen sollte man sich vielleicht erst einmal Gedanken um den eigentlichen Arbeitsspeicher machen.Genau hier möchte der Anbieter “Corsair“ mit seinen “Venegeance RGB RS 16 GB) einen Arbeitsspeicher anbieten welcher nicht nur einen Geschwindigkeit Booster erreichen möchte sondern auch dem Auge mit einer tollen RGB Untermalung etwas bieten möchte.Verpackt kommt der Arbeitsspeicher in einer optisch ebenfalls sehr ansprechenden und gelungenen Umverpackung welche mir schon optisch sehr gefällt.Nach dem öffnen der Umverpackung sieht man in einer zusätzlichen Plastiksicherung die beiden RAM Erweiterungen welche jeweils mit 8GB ausgestattet sind (somit 16 GB) und mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 3200MHz daherkommt. Beide sind aus schwarzen Aluminium versehen welches die Erweiterungen wie ich finde sehr hochwertig erscheinen lassen. Der eigentliche Einbau ist kinderleicht denn ausser seinen Rechner zu öffnen muss man nicht viel machen ausser die DIMMS in die vorgesehenen Steckplätze zu stecken. Einfacher geht es kaum.Beim start des Rechners kommt auch der Farbaspekt zum tragen denn nun leuchten die beiden DIMMS in einem schön wechselndem Farbspektrum (siehe Video)… SEHR SCHÖN und das Ganze kommt erst richtig schön zur Geltung wenn man ein durchsichtiges Computer Gehäuse sein eigen nennen darf.Der Arbeitsspeicher ist mit Intel Prozessoren und AMD 300/400 und 500er Serie kompatibel.Nun aber zur Leistung und hier kann der Speicher im Vergleich zu meinen Standard RAM Speichern doch merklich eine Verbesserung der Geschwindigkeit herbeiführen. Durch die Corsair eigene Software “ICUE“ kann man die RGB Beleuchtung und einige Daten zum Speicher usw. verändern bzw. einsehen… SEHR GUT…Auch preislich empfinde ich die beiden Speicher als angemessen knapp 90 Euro für 16GB ist in meinen Augen in Ordnung.Zusammenfassung:➕  2x 8GB DDR4 RAM mit 3200 MHz➕  RGB Beleuchtung➕  Zeigt praktisch einen Geschwindigkeitsschub (im Vergleich zu meinem alten Arbeitsspeicher)➕  Für Intel und AMD 300/400 und 500er Serie➕  Speicher auf optisch schönem und schwarzem Aluminium➖  Fällt mir nichts aufDer Arbeitsspeicher von “Corsair“ kann mich in ganzer Linie überzeugen und die Leistung die Optik und der Preis passen bei diesem Speicher optimal zusammen. Von meiner Seite 5 Sterne und eine Weiterempfehlung….
5,Barrettes CORSAIR Vengeance RGB RT 16Go (2x8Go) DDR4✅  Barrette parfaitement reconnue par le bios avec XMP2 activé.✅  Installation comme d'hab sans difficulté.✅  DDR 4 taille standard✅  Semble de bonne qualité avec un dissipateur thermique bien imposant.Le RGB est très sympa quand elles sont installées dans un boîtier fenêtré d'autant plus qu'elles peuvent être pilotées ( le RGB ) par le logiciel ICUE de CORSAIR il est gratuit et facile à utiliser.Compatible et pilotable par les cartes mères MSI Mystic Light et Gigabyte RGB Fusion.La fréquence des barrettes de 3600MHz est très largement suffisante pour le gaming j'ai fait un test avec 3DMARK pour comparer avec des 3200Mhz et j'ai pas trouvé de différences avoir des 4000Mhz serait du superflu sauf pour les pinailleurs de l'ultime détail c'est clair.Je recommande sans problème !Si mon avis vous a un peu éclairé ?Un petit clique "Utile". Merci bien !
5,Excellent DIMMS. Come in a small but sturdy box and removing is easy. Fitting is a doddle as per all memory BUT check your PC has room for them as they are very tall. Should be ok in most gaming rigs but you may struggle in a compact PC. Build quality is excellent and the dynamic lighting is a great effect for those with clear cases. A stylish upgrade at a reasonable price.
5,This review is for the Corsair Vengeance RGB RT 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3600MHz C18 Desktop Memory Kit of 2. If you are not an IT savvy Ram is where data is stored before any processing occurs within your computer… so it’s one of the most important hardware in your computer after the CPU and the GPU. DDR4 is the latest dynamic RAM technology mostly only compatible with newer motherboards. The benefit of using DDR4 instead of DDR3 is that DDR4 RAM has higher overall speed increased transfer rates and less voltage which means less overall power consumption by 40% and boosts performance and bandwidth by 50% to DDR3 RAM.Corsair it’s always been a trusted brand for me I have used their RAMs in my gaming PC’s I’ve built in the past decades.Would highly recommend upgrading your computer with this DDR4 Corsair Vengeance Memory if you’re regularly using programs that require a lot of memory like games engineering programs or photo and video editing software. I’ve got the 2 x 8 GB module with 3600MHz which is fine for gaming and for everyday use. Also it worth to check your motherboard before you buy it as it might not be compatible or will not allow to RAM to run on the highest MHz’s. To find your motherboard model in Windows 10 go to the Power User Task Menu type in “run” and then “MSinfo32.”. This Ram is mainly optimised for AMD 300/400 and 500 series motherboardsInstalling the rams is simple and easy it’s a plug and play hardware that does not require any software. I would suggest saving anything what you’ve been working on the computer as most of this information is kept on the ram until you save it and you will lose it when you turn off the computer. Remove your old ram and put in your new RAM sticks match the notches with the gaps in the motherboard and push firmly and evenly until you hear a ‘click’. After you’ve installed the new RAM kit close your computer. Restart everything and reboot then you RAM is ready to use by your CPU.The RGB lighting effects can easily be changed using Corsair’s own software to match several pre-sets including one snapped to the temperature of the memory so it can go slowly change from green to yellow orange etc depending on how warm they get. This is particularly handy to keep an eye on the current temperature levels inside your case. Use the CORSAIR iCUE software or your motherboard manufacturer’s software to create your own setting. This RGB colour features makes this Corsair Vengeance a beast ram a perfect hardware for gamers. In the amazon description is not mentioned however on the packaging box it says comes with a Limited Lifetime Warranty.Compare to other DDR4 RAM on the market this one is a little bit pricier but it’s a CORSAIR. It’s a well trusted brand with great reputation.  My computer very stable with this ram boot time significantly less than before all programs run instantly all my heavy RAM consuming apps like Adobe software VirtualBox works great with less crashing and no freeze. I'm very impressed and highly recommend it.
5,Ich setze eine AiO-Wasserkühlung von Corsair seit gut 3 Jahren (und 3 Prozessor-Generationen) in meinem Ryzen-System ein und dies war bisher mein einziges RGB-Teil im Rechner. Mit der hauseigenen ICUE-Steuerungssoftware war ich so schon einmal vertraut und habe mit den Vengeance RGB RT-Ram riegeln nun die Möglichkeit gehabt meine bisherigen Riegel mit 3000er Timing zu ersetzen.Die beiden Riegel sind jeweils mit einer konfigurierbaren 10 Zonen RGB-Beleuchtung ausgestattet werden von meinem MSI-Board problemlos erkannt und das aktivieren des hinterlegten XMP-Profils hat ebenfalls reibungslos geklappt.Die iCUE-Software lässt eine vielfältige Anpassung der Beleuchtungsmodi zu und wir alle wissen das bringt mindestens 5 FPS mehr ;-)Objektiv betrachtet fallen die Benchmark-Ergebnisse tatsächlich etwas besser aus (im 1-Stellingen Prozentbereich) aber auch dieses Bottleneck ist nun eliminiert. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Kit und werde definitiv noch ein weiteres davon ordern einerseits wegen der hübschen. stimmigen Beleuchtung andererseits weil man nie genug schnellen Ram haben kann.
5,Un kit de deux barrettes mémoire 8GB  DDR4 3600MHz  proposé par Corsair. Pour tirer pleinement partie des 3600MHz  il faudra  en premier lieu disposer d'une carte avec un chipset compatible XMP (eXtreme Memory Profile)  et activer le  mode XMP le BIOS de la  carte mère. Ce mode permet aux constructeurs de mémoires de carte mère et de processeur de dépasser les performances maximales standardisées par la norme JEDEC.La gamme "vengeance RGB RS" est un milieu de gamme en termes de performance  chez Corsair. Le refroidissement est assuré par un radiateur alu anodisé noir qui enveloppe l'ensemble du circuit imprimé de la  barette mémoire. Au-delà des performances en termes de vitesse ce qui intéresse  également les gamers  c'est  de personnaliser le design de leur machine ; de ce côté on est également bien servi avec un ruban de 6 leds RGB monté sur le sommet du radiateur et donc visible une fois la barrette en place. Les animations lumineuses sont  sélectionnables et paramétrables via le logiciel Corsair iCUE.En tant que gamer vous serez donc comblé par ce kit de 16GB proposé par une marque de référence dans le domaine des mémoires : Corsair qui vous permettra de tirer pleinement partie de votre processeur AMD Ryzen (pour ne citer que lui) tout en participant à la customization de votre machine
5,Mon fils a testé ces barrettes et voilà son commentaire :Un changement radical. J'avais avant 8go de ram sur ma tour de gaming. Désormais  la fréquence de ces barrettes plus élevée rend mes jeux bien plus fluides. Je gagne facilement 15 fps en moyenne sans compter les temps de chargement plus rapides. Il met également possible d'effectuer plus de tâches de fond. Je réalise de la mao et mon ordi a beaucoup  moins de mal à executer plusieurs plugins même  très lourds en même temps.Bonus :  le retroeclairage RGB est vraiment sympa.
5,J'avais besoin de rebooster mon ancien PC afin de lui gagner en réactivité.Ces barrettes ont largement fait le travail ils ont été reconnu de suite par ma carte mère sur les emplacements laissés libre.Au niveau de la rapidité d'exécution et de jeu cela se ressent assez vite je gagne en moyenne 10 FPS et ce n'est pas rien.J'hésitais à me racheter un nouveau PC mais avec ce nouveau boost je vais attendre un peu.Je connaissais déjà la marque Corsair qui m'avait été conseillé à l'époque et je n'ai jamais été déçu.Le produit est bien fini et il est compatible pour bon nombre de carte mémoire.Ces 2 cartes DDR4 possèdent de réelles performances.Bref j'en super satisfait ces barrettes ont bien rebooster mon PC !
5,Der Arbeitsspeicher ist preislich gesehen zwar kein Schnäppchen bietet aber jede Menge Power. Die Möglichkeit diesen zu übertakten habe ich für mich hier einmal ausgelassen. Ich habe einfach meinen Computer von seinen mickrigen 8GB RAM auf 16GB aufgerüstet.Das ging auch ganz problemlos da ein Speicher mit genau den gleichen Werten bereits verbaut war (hier war der Austausch wirklich ein reines Ausstecken neuen Speicher einstecken). Generell würde ich bei der Wahl eines neuen Arbeitsspeichers aber auf die Angaben des Herstellers zurückgreifen (ob die Speicherart hier DDR4 und die Taktfrequenz hier 36 GHz vom Mainboard unterstützt werden).Ich bin jedenfalls sehr glücklich über dieses gelungene Upgrade und das hierdurch dazugewonnen Leistungsplus.
5,Der speicher sieht nicht nur prima aus. Er ist auch schneller als mein alter! Vorher hatte ich nur 1600mhz nun habe ich dank dieser Speicher 3600 MHz und leute das merkt man! Alles wird schneller und dann leuchten die Teile auch noch... Was will man mehr?Es gibt sogar eine App mit der man dann die Farbe einstellen kann hier habe ich mich aber noch nicht mit befassen können für alle die aber moding Gehäuse haben die werden sicherlich wissen das es dieses Programm gibt.Also ich bin zufrieden aber nicht wegen der Beleuchtung sondern wegen der Schnelligkeit
5,C'est un lot de 2 barrettes de mémoire RAM DDR4 CL16 de 16 Go (soit 32 Go au total) à 3200MHz.Ce produit nous est proposé par Corsair marque bien connue des joueurs.Les barrettes de RAM sont pourvues de LED RGB du plus bel effet.Pour ma part j'ai installé cette RAM sur un PC gamer en remplacement des 2x8 Go DDR4 qui s'y trouvaient.L'apport d'avoir plus de RAM pour l'exécution d'applications gourmandes en RAM m'est effectivement apparu après installation. Idem dans les jeux de plus en plus demandeur en mémoire RAM.Le prix est raisonnable pour de la mémoire de marque.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ich bewerte hier "Corsair Vengeance RGB RT 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4 3.600MHz C18 Arbeitsspeicher (Dynamische RGB-Beleuchtung Optimiert für AMD 300/400/500 Series Kompatibilität mit Intel 300/400/500 Series) Weiß" die ich im Rahmen des Vine Programms  für einen kostenlosen Test erhalten habe.Der Arbeitsspeicher lässt sich einfach einsetzen und beginnt dann auch gleich zu leuchten. Er läuft ohne Einstellung von xmp auch schon mit 3200 mhz (mit xpm dann mit 3600 mhz+) ist also sehr gut geeignet für ältere Pc's. In meinem älteren PC waren 2400 mhz RAM verbaut und die Geschwindigkeit merkt man direkt nach dem Einbau und Neustart des PC's. (Natürlich habe ich die anderen Riegel entfernt denn unterschiedliche RAM sollte man nicht miteinander vermischen).Vor Kauf und Einbau sollte man aber direkt prüfen ob die RAM die mit 3600 mhz laufen kompatibel sind mit der anderen verbauten Hardware da sie ja auch nicht gerade billig sind.(Stand Anfang Oktober 2021: 2 x 8 GB = 10883 €)
5,Voici un lot de 2 barrettes de mémoire RAM DDR4 CL16 de 8 Go (soit 16 Go au total) à 3200MHz.Ce lot est fourni par Corsair marque connue et reconnue par les joueurs les plus exigeants.Pour ma part j'ai installé cette RAM sur un PC gamer en remplacement des 2x4 Go DDR4 qui s'y trouvaient.L'apport d'avoir plus de RAM pour l'exécution d'applications gourmandes en RAM m'est effectivement apparu après installation. Le gain en vitesse ne m'a pas par contre sauté aux yeux.Petit plus (pour les gamers) : les barrettes de RAM sont pourvues de LED RGB du plus bel effet (si vous possédez une tour transparente.Le prix est raisonnable pour de la mémoire de marque.
5,Ayant un Pc Gamer j'ai opté pour ces barrettes.Rien à dire avec du DDR4 j'ai vu tout de suite la différence surtout que j'ai des jeux qui sont gourmands.L'effet de lumières est un plus cela balance du lourd quand même.La performance est bonne le prix est correct je recommande à 100%5⭐
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Je cherchais depuis un moment à mettre à jour mon ordinateur Gaming monté par mes soins .Ma config est la suivante :# Carte mère MSI Gaming 450# processeur AMD RYZEN 5# SSD M2 samsung 500Go# disque dur 2.5' 2To Seagate# RAM ddr4 3200 8Go Corsaire # Carte graphique GTX1080TiJ'ai reçu mes 2 nouvelles barrettes de la marque Corsaire marque haut de gamme que je recommande surtout la gamme Vengeance qui est dédié au GamingLe design est magnifique avec le radiateur gris/noir et les LED RGB sur le dessus mon boitier est en partie transparent donc je vois les lumières au travers ! Elles embellissent ma config!Une fois installées (attention de bien les installer sur les mêmes "chanel" pour bénéficier du DualChanel !) Le pc les a reconnu sans problème et fonctionne parfaitement et même mieux car avec seulement 8go j'étais très limité surtout au niveau du multitâche et des jeux gourmands...Leurs vitesses de 3200Mhz me font bénéficier d'un gain de rapidité dans l'exécution des programmes La faible latence C16 est un gros atout dans les jeux qui demandent de la vivacité !Au niveau des Led RGB elles sont placées sur le dessus du radiateur tout le long et redescendent sur les bords et elles peuvent être configurées facilement via le logiciel il y a pas mal de choix de variation de couleur et de personnalisation aussi. En utilisation lourde je n'ai pas remarqué de surchauffe les radiateurs sont efficaces. J'espère avoir été utile.
3,Obwohl mein PC mit DDR4 RAM ausgestattet ist werden diese Riegel nicht erkannt und der Rechner startet nicht.Prozessor Intel I7 7700 Motherboard H110M Pro-VD.Somit leider nicht zu testen sollte aber eigentlich kompatibel sein.
5,J'ai pris cette RAM pour apporter de la puissance à mon PC. Les barrettes sont bien des DIMM. La ram est bien reconnu sur mon PC et il y a 158Go de RAM de dispo. Seulement 0.2Go de perte réelle ce qui très bien. Au niveau de la vitesse de calcul c'est top. Le RGB est un peu inutile pour moi mais c'est un choix personnel. Je recommande pour les performances!!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Also ich habe die “Corsair Vengeance RGB RT 16 GB (2 x 8 GB)” jetzt annährend 2 Wochen im Einsatz und bin begeistert. Diese speziell auf Ryzen-Systeme optimierten DDR4 machen allein optisch einiges her. Die Riegel gibt es in Hell und Dunkel wobei ich das gräuliche Design habe. Auf dem Riegel selbst ist lediglich der „Vengeance“ Schriftzug sowie die XMP Spezifikationen des Kits von 3600MHz 18-22-22-42 und 135 V zu sehen – mehr nicht. Je Riegel sind einseitig 8 Speicherchips zu erkennen.Ein Riegel fällt mit 55 Gramm ins Gewicht und ist 44 Millimeter hoch und 136 mm lang sowohl die Maße als auch das Gewicht bewegen sich daher im Mittelfeld im Vergleich zu anderen Modellen.Das Hauptaugenmerk bei dieser Reihe ist die 10 Zonen RGB-Beleuchtung und diese ist einfach nur Spitze. Sie sind ultrahell und kräftig und vor allem durchgehend d.h. keine toten “Flecken” im Betrieb. Die Inbetriebnahme auf einem AMD Ryzen 9 5900X basiertem System klappte problemlos.Ohne hier auf genaue Benchmarks eingehen zu wollen und mit Setupdaten zu “flexen” was ich hier einfach nicht möchte kann ich sagen das Performance Tests durchaus positiv ausfallen.Für 10808 € (Oktober 2021) bekommt man hier sehr wohl ein tolles Produkt in punkto DDR4-Riegel welches für mich im wesentliches durch sein Äußeres besticht. Als VINE-Mitglied konnte ich dieses Corsair Produkt übrigens kostenfrei Ausprobieren.
5,Clairement ne choisissez ces barrettes luminescentes que si votre boitier est grillagé ou transparent: l'éclairage se paie 20% mais quel style !Les patterns de lumière proposés sont variés les barrettes sont synchronisées entre elles le résultat est hypnotique.La réalisation est de qualité il faut dire que c'est toujours le cas chez Corsair.C'est un excellent produit !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great quality for the price. The white finish very bright rgb & customisable via iCue. Easy to install as with any ram. Does sit much higher than non rgb ram so check your clearence.
1,Water packing
2,The ram works fine as ram. The problem is the LED lights just don't work with Asus Aura sync. I have installed corsair's icue software and I can get the ram LEDs to work for a while but then when I restart my computer the ram LEDs doesn't do what they are supposed to. It all worked fine with my Trident ram. I don't know why corsair can't just let their ram be controlled by aura sync like other companies do. I can only suggest customers avoid this ram if they want LEDs that just work without installing more software and even then they just don't work properly. I'm sick of trying to trouble shoot the problem.
2,RAM keep freezing occasionally with RGB. Then my PC also stopped. I have had this around 20times since bought it 2month ago.
5,Realmente la calidad se mira por todas partes.... Desde el disipador hasta la iluminación RGB que realmente hace lucir mi tarjeta madre.
5,muy lindas  se me hace  justo el precio
5,Muy bonitas pero hay que subir manualmente a 3600mhz
5,Sin duda de las ram más bonitasFácil de instalarTrabajan bienEl rgb se ve de lujo
5,excelente producto la computadora reconoce de inmediato la ram sin mayor problema
5,So I had ordered this once and when i got notified 'delivered' it had not arrived. After chatting with the support team they sent me a new order which only took 3 days to arrive. Works like a charm and now I run multiple VM'S I need for my classes.
5,RAS
5,Looks nice and works well enabled xmp in bios to oc ram to 3200 mhz .
5,Son muuy buenas y exceientes estas menirias
1,Recieved faulty ram wrote amazon they would not do anything for me because i built my pc 30 days after receiving ram. They directed me to corsair who would not honor warrenty. Will never purchase ram from corsair again. Stay away from this faulty ram and useless customer service. Buy crucial
5,I hope they can have a steady rainbow in their profile otherwise all good. If you are upgrading you have to select the xmp profile again and thats about it. The lighting have a default rainbow rbg but its too bright.I tried to mix it up with a 16GB (2x8) 3200mhz CL 16-18-18-38 and its automatically shutting down my pc when i removed the 16GB kit  it worked normally. This Pro SL kit is 16-20-20-38 I am not sure why it won't work with almost identical CL16 kit to make it x4 module. If there are any fix or resolution let me know.

5,Memorias ram de 3600MHz a precio de 3200MHz... No es un gran aumento en frecuencia pero se siente su RGB es muy bueno (aunque es un poco molesto que no sea compatible con el software de Gigabyte) y son hermosas visualmente
5,Funciona muy bien y el precio es muy bueno
5,You will need to modify Win10 to make sure 64 gb is detected.
5,what can i  say  its corsair  looks great and works great with  i-cue
4,La RAM è ottima stabile con profilo XMP senza particolari override manuali il mio problema è il comparto software iCUE (sia da solo che in accoppiata ad altri software tipo Gigabyte RGB 2.x randomicamente manda in freeze il PC anche solo dopo pochi secondi successivi all'avvio del solo software iCUESia sui Forum di Corsair sia su Reddit è pieno di utenti che si lamentano dal 2020 fino ad oggi sempre e solo per il corredo softwareSe volete le RAM e non vi interessa gestirne l'estetica basta che evitiate di installare iCUE (Software ufficiale del produttore)Se invece vi interessa personalizzarle evitate di utilizzare iCUESe la vostra motherboard lo permette potrete gestirle con il software RGB principale altrimenti potete provare qualche soluzione Open sourceIo personalmente le ho rese e ho comprato un altro kit di moduli da 16 GB non Corsair
5,Plugged directly in to a B450-f rizen cpu posted immediately upon installation. Make sure DCOP settings in your bios to receive the full power from your Ram.
5,Un excelente producto y se nota la calidad que tienen. El software para manejar los rgb es perfecto. 10/10
5,Este duo funciona y se ve excelente Sin quejas🥹
5,Was really easy to install and the ability to link the rgb to component temps is incredibly useful
5,Sieht super aus läuft in der angegebenen Geschwindigkeit hat mehrere Stunden Tests bestanden. Nichts zu bemängeln.
5,Son algo caras pero funcionan perfectamente bien
5,Buen producto llegó a tiempo y bien empacado
5,
5,Obviously you will be paying a premium price for the Corsair brand and the RGB. I've mainly gone with Kingston memory in the past but Corsair hasn't disappointed me. The RGB software is pretty good and I had no problems pairing this set with my 1st generation Ryzen build.
5,Funcionan muy bien y son muy bonitas por el precio creo vale toda la pena 👌🏼
4,It’s still boxed and factory sealed. I will update when i get a cooler.I don’t expect compatibility issues but some anomalies were found on gigabytes z590i vision d compat. List.I think the ram itself has been improved upon since the release of the compatibility list so it should still work but the model numbers on the list don’t match as “CMH…”But “CMK…” instead. Maybe cmk is the model number on older 3.31 versions? Therefore in theory these new models will work. Its gigabyte who need to update the list so us people can make wise current year choices.(Sorry for photo quality and sorry amazon is heading down hill.)The only negative without even opening the box and isn’t really disclosed is that it has a lack of compatibility with gigabytes rgb fusion. Mind blowing. Its compatible with asus and msi software though.Maybe corsair has issues against gigabyte?? Why exclude them? The z590 vision d has perhaps the cleanest aesthetic of the century. (To Bold?)I wanted to deck it out with matching icy argb ram. sonow… Its required to install bloatware to make a silly light thing functional. 4-stars just for that lack of relationship with gigabyte. All the other rgb cats out there selling stuff have at least 4 stamps regarding led software compatibility.
5,La verdad había escuchado algunas malas reseñas del RGB de estas memorias pero me llevé una grata sorpresa al ver que se ve muy bien siendo opinión de alguien que nunca había tenido memorias RAM con RGB y además la encontré a un precio razonable.
5,Llevo usando estas memorias más de 2 semanas y se me han echo fascinantes buenos colores de RGB… sin dudas las volvería a comprar
5,They work and easy to add to icue
5,happy with everything shipping was really fast aswell
5,I'm very happy with the corsair vengeance rgb 64gb ram. The price was good compared to other stores at the time. Also happy that it was free regular postage which came early.
5,Buen comienzo para armar una nueva PC en estos tiempos. No esperaba que fueran tal luminosas son más brillantes que la tira led (con cubierta) y el ventilador del gabinete. En el programa para configurar los leds tienes varias opciones y también para sincronizar con otros componentes leds de tu PC. En todo lo demás supongo que rinden igual que cualquier otra RAMs de 3200mhz justo lo que necesitaba para un Ryzen con gráficos integrados.
1,Both of them doesnt work
4,Great looking and works as advertised
5,La RAM es muy buena cumple su función pero lo que más destaca es el apartado estético se ve espectacular el rgb y lo puedes configurar muy fácil en mi caso las compré en oferta pero en verdad las recomiendo.
5,Anciennes défectueuses
1,Así cómo se ve en las fotos es como me llegó la caja bastante maltrata y hasta abierta por lo mismo que se apachurró ya llevo varias semanas usando las memorias y si funcionan bien aunque el empaquetado fue bastante malo en caso de que falle en unos meses actualizaré el comentario
5,Recuerden configurar la frecuencia de las ram
1,This memory was terrible would only be stable after using the base profile doing 2400mhz and even clocking it at 2666Mhz with loose timings would make my brand new system unstable. A far cry from the 3200mhz advertised on the box.Switched to a different brand and speed and my system has been rock solid since.Maybe I got a bad memory kit but I wouldn’t reccomend this.

5,Elegancko działa po wymianie z 16GB. Mogę teraz skompilować ten jeden spuchnięty projekt dla klienta.W grach bez zarzutu.Współpracuje bardzo dobrze z Ryzen 3600. Teraz przesiadka na i7 12700k i również bez zarzutu.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Buen producto y con rgb muy bonito y funcional
5,Llegaron en perfecto estado y funcionan a la perfección.
5,Funcionan super bien con amd incluso activado los perfiles xmp
5,Does what it says it does. They run hotter when the rgb are on
3,Finally made the rgb work with Armory Crate. Looks good! Not easy to sync the RGB's in armory crate. Good working ram! I rated 3 stars because it was too complicated to sync the RGB's work in armory crate. Finally asus dis an update and rgb's works.
5,Great kit easy install. Works as intended. No issues with xmp.
5,Una ram comi cualquier otra pero mas guapa que todas juntas 👌💕💕
4,Just started smoking in my sons room!!!!!Threw the entire thing outside!!!!!
1,Out of the packaging the pins were broken.
5,El rendimiento diseño son de los mejores calidad y precio de lo mejor
5,Funciona perfecto
5,Excelente
4,Solo no le doy 5 estrellas por un detalle…He tenido esta versión y las negras. Tengo que decir que la calidad de construcción en las negras es mejor y el modelo negro es más barato.No entiendo porque corsair vende más caras las RAM blancas si la calidad (SOLO DE CONSTRUCCIÓN) es menor. Las negras son de aluminio anodizado. Es decir es más difícil que se oxiden son más pesadas y se mantienen más frescas.Estas (las blancas) son solo de aluminio. Son más ligeras y los disipadores (la cubierta blanca) se siente de menor calidad. En general tal vez no es un detalle muy importante pero si prefieres calidad ve por las negras si lo que buscas es “estética” puedes invertir unos pesos más en estas (aunque no creo que lo valgan).*En cuanto a funcionalidad les doy 10/10 a ambos modelos*

5,Easy to install. Work well with Corsair lightning.
3,Hola Buenas tardes  queria ver como puedo hacer valida mi garantia de estas memorias que adquiri con uds les comento un modulo de los 4 es el que esta fallando los demas estan bien pero me genera conflictos la memoria dañada como me pueden ayudar  ya se hicieorn las configuraciones pertinentes y sigue igual  un modulo de los 4 no esta trabajando bien quedo atento a sus comentarios ..
5,Excelente calidad llegaron a tiempony en buen estado
5,Me gustaron mucho el modelo que compre. Excelente para instalar y configurar.
3,i have a 32gb cl15 trident. i wanted more ram because when i was editing a 5k video over sony vegas i was crashing due to low memory. but i knew that perhaps that vegas had some memory leakage. but regardless i bought this thinking it would solve the problem.TLDR: i returned it as it performed worst. port royal and timespy had a much lower score when using these compared to my cl15 despite having double the ram (must be the slower timing). also what did the trick for vegas was to upgrade to 17 (i believe i was using 15). frame rates for gaming also didnt change much. maybe by 1 or 2fps on 1440p highest settings (rtx 3090).
5,Solid ram fast when overclocked looks great and brings the build to life.
5,El producto es bueno da muy buen rendimiento
5,Muy buen producto llego antes de tiempo  excelente servicio
5,Sin duda estas memorias ram son una buena opción si tienes gusto por el RGB añadiendo al hecho de que puedes configurarlo a tu gusto con el software iCUE. En cuestión al rendimiento se nota ese leve aumento (pase de 3200mhz a 3600mhz) en todos tus procesos simultáneos. No esta de más recordar que revises el modelo de tu MotherBoard y ver si las puede manejar esto en caso de querer adquirirlas ya que aunque soporte el DDR4 a 3600mhz estas pueden llegar a crashear en procesos dinámicos (Ejemplo: juegos).
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Je les utilise pour les jeux vidéo et je suis plus que satisfait. Excellent produit de très bonne qualité
5,Thank you amazon. Order yersterday night I received today. Very fast. Highly recommended. Thank you amazon.
5,Llego en el tiempo marcado empaque 100% de calidad y súper protegido. 100% recomendable
5,Estéticamente son muy bonitasEl rgb es bastante brillante pero puedes controlar el brillo y los efectos con el software ICUE de corsair.Las uso con un Ryzen 5 5600x tengo 4 modulos de 8 gb y no tuve ningún problema de compatibilidad y pude aplicar el perfil XMP sin problemas
4,Excelente vista de su RGB
4,Works perfect!Tape looks pealed I don't peal I always cut open my packages.
5,Good price good ram. Hard to go wrong really.
1,They were great until the one pin broke. The Gold plating came off stripped and then the tab came away from the 'Memory module' because it had nothing strapping it down. I have had all kinds of memory NEVER had this happen. I've had Products from Corsair before never really cared much for their quality I can tell NOT very good at all cheap.Friend of mine has had PSU's from them I've had their hydro series coolers mmm they worked okay. Well enough. All I know is bye bye Corsair never again I won't be buying anything from this company ever again.
5,I was looking for RAM that didn't have any logos on the light bar and this one fit the bill. Looks extremely clean and the lighting is quite even compared to the rest of the system. Would recommend for the aesthetic and performance is also decent!
5,I didn't rate any of the features because they are silly.The memory works on the ROG Maximus XIII Hero (WiFi 6E) Z590 LGA 1200(Intel®11th/10th Gen) ATX Gaming Motherboard with an Intel Core i9-11900K.
5,Muy buenas con los rgb que uno le puede poner los colores que quiera o indicadores de temperatura
5,Dan bonito aspecto a la pc sin problemas de instalación el rgb tiene tonos de color muy padres. Recomendado
5,Son excelentes muy buen aspecto físico combinado con una calidad precio muy buena la velocidad de las memorias es excelente sin contar que ahora tengo el doble que antes lo que hace que mi computadora se más rápida que nunca
5,Me llegaron en buen estado y rapido
5,
5,Lo esperado muy buenas y bonitas rams.
5,Funciona muy bien. La relación calidad precio es muy buena.
3,Had 3600 before same speed as these were supposed to be only got a maximum of 2100mhz out of them…. Be careful
5,Llegaron antes de lo esperado funcionan bien hasta el momento. Por ahora no les he exigido demasiado.
5,Excellent !! and great performance looks and value
4,If ordering more than one kit of ram double check when you receive them that the barcodes match as seen in the photos as well as the versions of ram that they are on the ram label. I was unable to achieve 3600mhz no matter what I tried and finally my brother took all 4 stick out to find that they are the same kit but designed differently on the board as they were different versions!!! One kit was version 3.44 and the second kit was 4.33. CHECK YOUR NUMBERS UPON ARRIVAL!! Got the proper sticks and all is good now. And today I found out why it’s better to buy full kits rather than 2 of the same kits 😣For the actual review of the ram itself? Not a single complaint!! Everything works fine now!
5,Funcionan de maravilla las RAM la verdad fue una muy buena compra en oferta ya que en el momento que las compre las utilizaba ya que estaba pensando en mejorar la poca ram con la que contaba
5,Llegaron antes de lo esperado funcionan bien hasta el momento. Por ahora no les he exigido demasiado.
5,Cuando seleccionas un producto de calidad nunca fallas en la eleccion este es el caso! ademas el producto llego antes de lo esperado.
5,Upgraded from 16gb and the difference is great in the games I play also enable xmp in the bios if you're not getting the speed you bought
1,It says 3600 mhz but it's not stable.  I had my gpu crashing at 3600 mhz. I down clocked it to 3200 mhz and it's stable now. Also the latency is 18-22-22-42...
5,So far so good! Plugged them in running at full power the rgb lighting is intensely bright all round couldn’t be more impressed instantly saw improvements as expected. Good bang for your buck if you want the extra rgb going :)
5,El funcionamiento es increible 🙌🏻
3,The product was just sent inside a plastic shipping bag with no additional protection. The corners of the RAM package were crumpled. Hope this does not affect the product.
5,xmp enabled on aorus z690 pro d4 and passed various stability tests.
5,Upgraded from 16gb and the difference is great in the games I play also enable xmp in the bios if you're not getting the speed you bought
5,Les stick sont très beaules lumières paraissent bien et la mémoire fonctionne très bien
1,Return as it didn't clock up to 3600mhz as advertised. Whenever I add in the 4th memory stick with XMP 2.0 3600mhz the PC (Ryzen 9 5900X TUF B550M WIFI MB RTX 3090) will not post. I need to downgrade the clock speed to 3200mhz to get a stable boot and post. Swapped to another motherboard (ASUS Prime B550M) but still the same issue with using the 4th RAM stick. Hence decided to return the RAM.Note to Amazon SG: Please do not use Janio as your return courier. The staff that came to collect the RAM was very picky and ask for "Original Amazon Box" which I've already threw away. Then he also require the printed label even when I told him "I don't have a printer". He was also extremely very rude.
5,Ordered this memory kit and got delivered within a day and this saves my day it's totally compatible with ryzen 5 cpu and it's gorgeous 😍
5,Items received in good condition. Delivery is prompt and fast also!
5,Works great icue software does its magic. So far so good.
3,Impossible de faire monter ça à 3600MhzJ'ai une TUF-GAMING-X570-PLUS-WI-FI AMD Ryzen 3900X et avec le XMP activé en 18-22-22-42 c'est 3200Mhz max au dessus ça c'est instable.Mais qu'est-ce que ça en jette! Le RGB est malade.Je les ai remplacé par des G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series Kit mémoire DDR4 3600 MHz 32 Go (2 x 16 Go) à la place.XMP activé en 16-19-19-39 3600Mhz et c'est parfaitement stable.Pas de RGB mais les performances et la stabilité sont au rendez-vous.
4,OVERALL AVERAGEif you intend to use the white/black models...try to never use iCUE for RGB...it struggles to keep it's RGB you set it as when you boot up and it tend to crash out of nowhere...usually force updating the firmware debug the ram's RGB but a few times it didn't fixed it and required a system resetit's performance is in the average...nothing crazy and it's on par with many 3200mhz 16gb kits out theresorry for not helping you decide if it's good or if it's a skip...when it comes to RAM you only need ddr4 8 x 2 kit with 3000mhz+
4,Pretty much does what it's supposed to the only issue I had was getting it to run at it's rated 3600 speed it won't on my second generation AMD ryzen system but this isn't alltogether uncommon on first and second generation AMD ryzen systems.
3,si un enfriador viene medio despegado afecta o afectará el funcinoamiento de las ram para regresarlas? ya que las memorias que me llegaron una de ellas viene con un lado medio despegado

4,Works wellas per specified value of money.
5,The rgb looks pretty nice and it matches my white build as well. Runs well and i havent experienced any issues.
5,Bastante buen kit ya habia comprado uno antes bonito RGB solo tiene detalles cuando  se apaga forzosamente al rgb le cuesta pero un reinicio y queda.
5,Muy buenas las recomiendo.
5,Looks cool and works well :)
5,Excelente estetica prácticamente se puede personalizar cada centímetro de color de las mismas con el software de icue son hermosas pero cuidado si se tiene disipador de torre ya que son muy altas en mi caso pierdo un modulo de ram por su altura y aparte cuando las instale solo funcionaban a 2400 mhz tuve que activar perfil xpm desde la bios para que corrieran a 3200 mhz para que lo tengan en cuenta.
5,Excelente compra gran relación calidad-precio. Se ven increíbles sobre una tarjeta ROG Strix z690 blanca. el RGB es increíble y el desempeño óptimo
5,Le rgb est magnifique. Je n’est eu aucun problème avec et fonctionne toujours comme neuf après plusieurs mois. Riens a dire surtout pour le prix
2,très jolie produit  malheureusement 1 des 2 ne fonctionne pas  j'ai rapidement été servis et le remplacement a été fait la même journée
5,Great sticks of ram for its price and compared to other Corsair offerings this is a deal.
5,Había comprado otra memoria que inclusive era más rápida pero luego me di cuenta que no era necesaria tanta velocidad (3600) si no iba a hacerle overclocking a mi equipo así que mejor compré esta memoria y estéticamente también me acomodó mejor. Forma parte de mi primer build.
5,it is beautiful when put onto the motherboard especially with the Corsair 5000T case as well.
5,Fantastic memory. Passmark bench test puts it up there. The white was cheaper than the black but same specs
5,Good for the price
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Speeds are great.
5,Excelentes colores y excelente producto
5,Excelente calidad y un buen gesto del vendedor excelente servicio
5,Not much to dislike to be honest. Just make sure to enable xmp in bios . Can’t go wrong with the white . Icue uses up a lot of resources so I don’t use that program for lighting.
5,I'm running the lowest brightness level and it still over powers my original RBG light strips. They are BRIGHT! Pre loaded color schemes are nice for quick set up in iCue. Performance is as described my tower is running great using 2 x 32GB. Will order another set in the future. Cannot speak for long term performance but would buy again so far.
4,This ram is very good but for the price it should at least be 32GB
4,You can set them at 1000Mhz and get 14141428 or 1933Mhz to get 18181836
5,Fast delivery and well packaged.
5,a
5,Facile à installer belle qualité rien de négatif à dire !
5,Me gustaron mucho mas con el rgb le da un toque genial a mi pc
4,The RAM looks great and has worked great on my pc for almost a year. When i tried to install for the first time the pc wouldn't boot. turns out that the advertised 3600mMHz was more like 2166MHz but can go up to 3600MHz if your pc can overclock that high which mine cant. i can go to 3400MHz which is still good so i left it but still disappointed. Just mess with it in your BIOS setting and see how far you can go
5,They are great quality sticks of RAM and they light up automatically with rainbow colours. What more could you need!
2,Prácticamente imposible ponerla a 3600mhz he puesto memorias de 3600 en 4200 estas no se puede

4,Cuando lo entregaron solo lo arrojaron de suerte no presento fallas.
5,Funciona correctamente. La relación precio-calidad es excelente. Y el RGB de la tarjeta se vé muy bien. La recomiendo mucho.
5,exelentes memorias funcionan muy bien sus colores se pueden programar excelente calidad por el precio
5,Super baratas si la encuentras en descuento es una ganga ya que son de 3600 mhz.
5,looks pretty easy to slot in and there's a lot of customization options with ICUE.
5,Works like describe and as expected. Massif overclocking possibility
5,
5,Great product & do keep up the good work!
5,Not much to say works at advertised speeds and looks good doing it.
5,Es muy fácil de instalar  y de controlar con los programas adecuados la iluminación ARGB me encanto y el desempeño en mis juegos con o sin OC me dejo satisfecho
5,Funciona muy bien y se detectaron ambas sin ningún problema tienen un brillo bastante bueno
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great RAM sticks. Really complement my now ageing PC build. When i first ordered the parts for my PC back in 2016 i knew i wanted a white and black colour scheme so got a case to and motherboard (the asus Z170-A) Took 3 years for me to get white RAM sticks but i am glad i waited.Install as with most RAM was an absolute breeze. Popped the old sticks out and slotted the new sticks in and ''voila''! Boot up in to BIOS and set the speed to 3200mhz as advertised. Everything is running sweet.The RGB lighting is amazing if you are in to that sort of thing like i am. I have recently become addicted to anything RGB so have got a razer RGB mouse Razer RGB Keyboard Razer RGB desk mat Razer RGB Headphone stand... blah blah you get the idea. I also recently bought and installed the Corsair Hydro 100i Platinum RGB CPU cooler which like these RAM sticks are excellent.The software to control the lighting effects is called Corsair icue. I found the software to be very user friendly after coming from Razer Synapse. As soon as it was installed it instantly detected both my RAM and CPU cooler and i can sync the lighting patterns for the Corsair kit nicely.My bedroom now looks like an acid rave when i am playing games and me and my cat love it.There is cheaper RAM available which is just as good at being RAM as these are however i would say that if you like RGB and have the spare cash then do get these. Just please check online and in forums to ensure that your motherboard is compatible.
