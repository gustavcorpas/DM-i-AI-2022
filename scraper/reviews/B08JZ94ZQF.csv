5,But this instead of an adapter. The adaptors will break and you’ll be stuck buying a new one every three months. This will last much long with minimal hassle.
5,I hate it took me so long to order this! The cord is very durable cause my grandson are rough while were driving. Thank you so much!
5,Purchased for my 2007 4Runner that has an aux port. I don't like to charge my phone in the car unless it's completely dead so this is a perfect purchase for me. Audio sounds great doesn't charge the phone.
5,Works well and good quality materials
5,I got this to use in my truck so I can play my music off my phone and it has not disappointed me. It’s nice and long and the music sounds great! I would def order this product again if I need to down the road!
5,Better and cheaper than buying dongle and aux cord separate.
3,You get what you pay for it’s a nice cord and the sounds quality is nice. It has issues with disconnecting from my car at random times not sure why but that expected for the price you pay
5,Works perfect and so much more convenient than the little aux adapter that comes with the iphone
2,Bought it in December 2021. My previous one from another cheap brand failed very quickly. When this one arrived it seemed to have been made much more sturdier. However since July 2022 it's been crackling and popping. In August I discovered the lightning connector would actually lose stereo function and only play the RIGHT side of audio unless I kept wiggling and adjusting it. It is now late September and it's just constantly crackling popping losing stereo functionality. So here's my theory: it's not the cord that determines quality. It's the lightning connector itself. I think there are some with better quality and some made poorly that wear down quicker with vibration.
5,No concerns. Works well
3,This cord lasted me a couple of months before it started splaying on both ends and only working properly from certain obscure orientations was great at the start though
2,Bought this for my daughter so we can listen music in the car but over few months of usage the usb side of this cable doesn't work properly. You have to twist the cable in a certain angle for music to play properly which is very annoying specially when you are in a car driving yourself and no one there to assist.This is not a reliable cable. The built quality is very poor. I would be happy if my current cable can be replaced. I am going to look for a different one brand.
4,Works great. Sometimes I get an error message.
3,Works half the time
3,You have to buy the apple version which is $35
2,Ive purchased two of these within a month [or two] of each other. i'll start out by saying the sound quality is great and it looks really nice.First time i purchased the lightning plugin broke from the aux itself. No problem i thought. Purchased another and it has started to short. As nice as it is I wouldnt buy this aux cable again
3,First one got broken inside… I just bought the cable on feb 24 2022 return expired on March 25.It’s April 6 2022. Cable already loose broken on the end. All I did was to plug in. First one got loose somehow also at the end. So constant move of the cable to make it sound even because of broken cable inside.. I don’t recommend.
2,The product worked good for a few weeks and gave out in less then a month. I guess worth the price.
2,Upon first using this aux cord it worked great and I had no issues connecting my phone to my car's sound system.After two months however it completely stopped working. Whenever I plug it into my phone it keeps triggering my phone and behaving as if it is not plugged in. Music will start and stop sporadically as if I am plugging and unplugging the cord.I checked my phone and the lightning female works fine with my charger so the only issue I'm having is with the aux cord.iphone 13 for reference.
4,this cable works well but is very bulky I always worry about it breaking my devices because it is so stiff.
4,Didn’t even last one year
2,Two days after purchase and the sound was compromised. We have to move the cable around and bend it in places so we can hear the music. Disappointing.
4,I've had it a few months and it's already cutting in and out some.
1,Where to start. First when you plug it in it automatically starts playing Apple Music and always the first song in your library even if the app isn’t open. So if you use another service besides Ap music you have to first quit Apple Music open your service (ie Spotify ) then hit play it then starts to play out of your phone even if connected then you have to hit pause and play again for it to finally start working. So quite annoying feature there.On top of that it last me hardly a month before the wires in the cord started to separate inside and had to do that weird bend the cord for them to reconnect to each other but it’s inside the cord wrapping so it still goes in and out. Bottom line not worth the money due to frustration of use and a lack of any sort of durability. Do not buy!
5,Pretty happy with my purchase. Good value for money
3,The cards are great for a while then they start to fall apart. I’ve even received a few broken ones fresh out the pack. My Pal is a dj and he uses them for gigs and we use them in the car. THEY DO WORK but you’ll need another pack eventually.
2,It looks durable but it t did not work for what I wanted needed to work as an audio for my IPhone
3,AirPods Max (rather frustratingly but not surprisingly) require a special cable. These will plug into your AirPods Max but the audio IC in the cable is one way. The audio IC in the cable basically turns the digital signal from your iPhone to analog signal for the headphones. That process does not work in reverse because that audio IC needs power from whatever device the lightning connector is plugged into.Basically you need the 30$ official Apple cable for AirPods Max. This cable will not work and neither will the normal little short lightning to 3.5mm female.I knocked two stars off because no where in the listing did it say any of this or that it did not work with AirPods Max.
4,Sound quality is not as strong after a few months. Have to wiggle cord to keep consistent sound
5,I bought this for my Tivoli radio. My kitchen accents are red and this cloth cord goes great with the silver & white of the radio. I don't bother hiding it. It's braided attractive and seems durable. I'm happy with it.
3,Got an AirPods Max for Xmas and needed to get a cable to connect to the PCs at my university. Unfortunately this six cable is apparently not bi-directional meaning it doesn’t work with the AirPods Max. I’ve heard the only cord that works with them is Apple’s lightning to 3.5mm
2,Firstly it took 3 delivery attempts to get this. First was lost second was wrong item (some kind of magnet for your dishwasher) and third was finally the correct item however while it worked fine for a while and appeared nice it started giving me warnings about water being in my lightening connector and then both ends of it started to crackle after about 3 months. I'm not an abusive user the cable was never under great stress or anything so overall this was a pretty miserly experience for such a simple product.
2,It barely lasted 4 months.
3,THis broke hella quick and I feel like im fornicating with the damn thing to make it work.
5,We purchased 2 of these in the course of 6 months and the same issue kept happening. They suddenly develop a short somewhere in the cord and basically just stop working. The cord had no visible damages but it was not functioning properly. We gave this company several tries with this product and received the exact same outcome both times. Thanks but no thanks
5,Tried a couple Bluetooth aux adapters before it finally occurred to use a an iPhone to aux adapter and it worked like a charm. Plays music perfectly
2,broke after just over a month
3,I really hoped this would work well for us and our new vehicle. The cord seems strong and sturdy we weren’t worried about it bending and breaking. But within a month we had to start jiggling the cord to get it to have all of the sound go through the sound system
5,Good all around ourchase
5,First off the “sheathing” came off both the lightning end and the 3.5mm side. And it would make my phone say a warning. Something about water being present in the port. BS. But it would work 60-70% of the time. Then it just decided to not work at all. Less than a year. Find a different brand.
5,So far works great have tried in my car and on a bose speaker which both provided clear playback. Grateful to not need an AUX adapter anymore.
3,Very touchy. Will work well until you move your device to a new position.. then you have to unplug and RE plug it.. not always but enough to make me write a review about it..Being that it’s the cheapest I found.. I suppose it does well enough.
2,This is my second time buying this product and it broke both times. I thought I had just gotten a bad one the first time but it was the same. The sound was fine for the month that it worked but now I can't listen to music for more than a minute before it starts to glitch.
5,Just what i needed to hook my iphone to my speaker  works as it should
3,I purchased this and started using it Around JULY 28 2021 . Now by not even the end of 30 days it’s sh** the bed.  The sound quality is spotty. You have to fiddle with the iPhone end to get it to play sound correctly. You won’t get full sound unless you place your phone  in an unmoved spot… sucks because it worked great the first few weeks!
3,I like the woven cord look and it arrived quickly. I only used it in my car and basically never moved it around or anything but after about 4-5 months it barely works. The wires obviously wore and the connection isn’t very stable anymore so the bass sort of goes in and out and it just gets worse over time. I’m going to try a different brand as a replacement. I get that they don’t last forever but this one wore out way too quickly
1,I’ve been through aux cord after aux cord hoping the next one will be different. They never are 😔. I don’t even think I got a half a month out of this cord before it started crackling and by about a month in it didn’t work at all anymore-well ya know unless I appeased the gods and stood on my head blinked 90 times held up my ring finger and closed my left ear🙄. So if you’re looking for a cord that gives you mediocre sound quality and lasts about a month- this is your cord.
3,Doesn’t last long.. only purchase if you need a back up aux cord
3,Overall 3 starts due to the fact it causes a lot of static electricity and can be super unsafe around things such as a computer.Every time I’d get out of my chair I’d hear it and feel it if I were to touch metal such as parts of my chair. Ended up pin pointing it to having that Aux in. Everything is fine when it’s off or paused or the Aux is not connected.Have not tested with a car as my car does not need an Aux.
5,I drive a 2014 Impala for work without Bluetooth capabilities for audio. This works amazingly well!
2,This worked great for a while but then stopped working about 2 months after I got it. Gives me an error message on my iPhone that there is "liquid in the lightning connector" and to disconnect. There is no water and other cords/chargers work. Pretty frustrating.
1,This thing barely held up. The lighting plug end for the phone is overly long and lacks the features enabling it to stay solid in the phone instead leaving a janky cable end that doesn’t stay in well. Further this condition seems to worsen because now when I set my phone down or drive over a slight bump the cable disconnects and I have to fiddle with it to make it work again. I’m writing this in my car pulled over because it’s little things like this that really frustrate a person.
4,Worked well for about two months now it’s only sending through one channel.
1,After a few days of using it I was only able to hear the R speaker unless I moved the cord around I was able to hear both L/R. Once it moves I have to readjust it again; it gets annoying.
2,If you're looking for longevity with this product I hope you're satisfied with less than a year of use. I purchased this product in December 2020. It was working great for the first few months but with more use there were times I would plug and replug and get nothing out of it. It is very cheap and inconsistent and now nearly a year later I get nothing out of it.If you're looking for a cheap and easy fix for an aux cable this would be your kind of product. Otherwise if longevity matters to you don't waste your time.
2,It works but isn’t suitable as a headphone cable for most situations.The bad:1. The Lightning connector is low quality and does not fit snugly making for a touchy connection. If you move your phone it will constantly disconnect and reconnect your audio.2. I also get noticeable background hiss.Overall it works and transmits audio just fine but it I would not purchase again.
2,It will not work with my iPhone I tried another cord that ended up working. Waste of money don’t do it
3,This product worked well at first. However it has stopped working after just 3 months. (I do use it almost daily and it stays in my car all the time.) Maybe at only about $8 that is to be expected but the cord I had before this lasted much longer.
3,Could’ve been louder. My CD player was like twice as loud at max volume.
3,This cable has a very nice look to it but the lightning connector feels to be of poor quality but my biggest problem is when plugged in you get a lot of audio interference and staticky screeching and it plays over your device audio. I bought two of these cable and they both do this.
2,Had this product for less than 2 months and it just stopped working.
2,I bought this for my work truck and it couldn’t handle me constantly plugging in and unplugging my phone throughout the day.  Last 1 month to the day. It’s weak point is where it connects to the phone as the wire inside stopped working.
4,This works well for a classic Aux.  Sound goes through well enough.  Note: this has no charging function but that is expected with this type of connection.
1,After only using this cord in my car for one month the plug is bent and doesn’t work anymore. I take very good care of my things and never Did anything to break the cord it just broke. Waste of money
5,I love this product . I recently purchased an old Rogue as a daily and got tired of listening to cds from 2014 . This was a perfect  inexpensive solution . Audio is clear and the cable is durable . I have no complaints what so ever . I just hope that it has some life on it
1,My previous aux cable that I had was worn out. So I decided to get a couple of new ones. One for my personal truck and one for my work truck. Neither cord worked. Could not play any music with them nor talk with someone over the phone. I’d give it zero stars if I could.
3,For the value it could be a bit better. After a week I have to keep unplugging it and turning it around plugging it back into my phone to hear any sound. The connection quality is not great and inconsistent; could be improved.
3,Use it in the car Iphone 11 gives me an error about water in the line. Works fine other than that
4,Feels kind of cheap but for the money...you are in a great deal!
5,Works great. Just what my husband needed to play his music on his phone in his van.
1,I use this item twice a day… it lasted less than 60 days. 30 day return policy… shocking but not surprising that it didn’t last. Garbage product for $13 but would hope it would last more than 46 days. Maybe they will see this and get me a replacement but I doubt it.
5,I love my iPhone 11 but with the lightning charger I could not listen to music on my motorcycle. This cord provides  a sound machine on older inputs - like my GL1800 audio input. I love it and now can listen to a playlist with no effort.
1,This thing worked for about 2 months and started to have sound issues. When I pulled the plug out I found the end had broken off inside the aux connection. What a PITa to remove. Not worth it
1,I would recommend going with a different product. I’m still on the hunt for a cable which lasts but this for sure isn’t it.
5,Recently purchased an older vehicle which is not equipped with a Bluetooth stereo but it does have an Aux input.  Connected my iPhone and the sound was surprisingly good.  It will get heavy use I'm sure until I'm able to swap out for a Bluetooth capable receiver.
2,Wire pulled apart! Product didn’t last a year!
4,Sound quality is great but occasionally has an error connecting with my iPhone 8. Good enough for what I paid.
3,It works on my car stereo for music and other audio however it doesn’t allow me to talk on the phone over my car stereo like my old one did and it’s super annoying
2,Product has been great however it’s now been about three months of use and it’s starting to fail. The audio crackles if the cable is moved.
2,I received the Aux 3.5mm to Lightning port cord August 14. I have been using it for a month in my car. The connection at the iPhone lightning port is already shorting in certain positions. The cord still appears brand new. I expected longer life with a braided cord like this. very disappointing. I gave it two stars as it has a great look and seemed like it would last. The fact that it still looks brand new is the only saving grace otherwise it would be one star.
1,This cable made anything I listened to sounds like a scratched record. Constant popping. Skip this and dish out the cash for a real cable.
3,The end broke after minimal use
5,The only thing I don’t like about this type of review is the durability stars. Can’t rate it until it shows normal wear and tear. Too soon to rate it. Other than that it’s works beautifully. I use it in the car’s auxiliary port
3,It works but occasionally it says there is water in the plug but there isn't so i just override the setting.
1,Bought this to listen to music in my car from my phone. From the very get go sound quality was awful. Music cuts in and out. Sounds like the 90s with a CD skipping.
2,Careful this doesn’t work with my AirPods max on the airplane like I’d hoped
1,I was so excited to receive this cute connector cord for my car so that I could jam out to music from my phone while driving. (I have a lot of road trips) It worked wonderfully for the first 3 months (January through March) but once April hit it now doesn't play music from my phone to stereo system. It is constantly telling me that there is "liquid" on the adaptor and my iPhone sends me warnings to pul the adapter out since it may cause harm to my phone. On a rare day I can get it to work by blowing on the adapter piece and positioning it just right in my iPhone lightening adapter but if it gets bumped or jostled by going over a bump--it's all out the window and no more music through my stereo system. I then have to resort to CD's or music through my phone's speaker. I am very disappointed and ordered a new adapter for my car from a different company. Would not recommend.
3,I only had it for a month and the cord started breaking. The sound started cutting out and I would only hear the interments of the song no words.
2,Unfortunately I hate to leave bad reviews but this cord started glitching after 2-3 weeks. I barely drive anywhere as I WFH and I got this cloth cord for possible durability. Quite dissatisfied as my previous aux cord lasted me 3 years.
4,Using in car. Works good with iPhone 11.
1,Within 2 weeks it started having issues like headphones where I had to position it in certain ways to actually get sound coming from both speakers. Shortly after it started simply not working at all unless in the PERFECT position (mind you I use this for my car and set it in the cupholder so I can't keep it perfectly placed at times and if this is a reason the wire breaks easily? Then its this product because my last cord lasted a year before I had to replace it with this one.)Here we are 2 months later and it doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money with this option because it doesn't last and if you think it lasts for the price you're dead wrong because again my last cord was around the same price maybe $1 more and lasted a year. This product is just not reliable.
1,Connector needs to be bent in order to work. So much for reinforcement
3,Cord works good and sound is clear. It does cut out sometimes and I have to wiggle the cord. It is attached to a treadmill so it does move much.
4,Como lo describen pero no es compatible con todos los Iphone
1,The one job that this cord is designed to do it fails at doing.  A cheaper quality cord that I had works just fine but this one literally produces sound SOMETIMES and when it does at a volume that hovers around a 1 or a 2 on your volume setting.  This is crap avoid like the plague.
3,Initially I was very satisfied with the product; however it quickly stopped working. Unfortunately this product is far from  durable.
4,Cord works well with my cars input. Sounds good.
5,Plugged it in and it worked who could ask for more.This product was delivered when it said it would be and that is why i would use this seller again.
2,This cable was only used in one place my car. I used it to plug into my phone.It took  about 3 months before the end covers fell off.then a week later crackling and a dropping channel and now a month later the cable has stopped working all together.Despite being a braided cable this is not a durable product and I would not in good faith recommend it to anyone. avoid this product.
2,No option to request a replacement. I ordered in Dec 2021 and it broke Feb. 2022.
5,Worked great on our trip.  Girls were happy to crank the entire Beatles collection for our road trip.  Very high quality from what I can tell.
5,Cable works great. I was looking for an easy way to connect my phone to my car speakers without having to upgrade to an Apple CarPlay head unit. This cable does exactly what I needed.
2,I purchased early September. The cable doesn’t work now. Sound is choppy only 1 speaker has transmission. This was purchased to use in my vehicle & has stayed there. This is the kind of crap products that overflow trash.
1,I was under the impression that it might actually last partly due to the braided cord. I was wrong. The actual metal piece that goes into the iPhone broke on the first use from the phones own weight. Not very strong.
5,Very sturdy and durable for the price. Perfect for newer iPhones that don’t have an aux chord but a car that’s old enough to ONLY have an aux chord
5,I’ve found that this product seems to be more durable than others for aux cord/lightening connector. Others have split at the plug site and been rendered unusable rather quickly. Would recommend this product to others!
5,Plug and play on my iPhone 12 Pro and the aux port on a head unit. Sounds great.
2,Worked great for a month and then just quit working.
5,easily outputs to my aux input
5,I’ve only had it for a week or so so I can’t speak on durability but it works beautifully and there’s no crunching or crackling with the audio. I’m happy with it!
5,I’ve used this cord about twice a week for the past month. No issues yet. Hopefully this continues because I keep losing that tiny aux adapter for iPhone!!!
1,This worked well the first two weeks I had it then my phone would no longer work with it because of the low quality of the cord. MMy phone would just say there was water in the cord. I took my phone into the store where I bought it and they said it wasn’t my phone definitely just the cord. I never spilled anything in my car around it!
2,Makes your music sound like it was recorded on a Nokia 3310 in a cave a mile away from the source of the sound. Pretty bad ngl.
2,I've had this cord for maybe 2 months and it already is shorted out. When I first opened it and plugged it in it had a little short in it and I was okay with it but now it just does not work unless it's sitting in a certain spot. Don't waste your time on it.
5,My husband loves it. I bought it for him so he could hook his phone to his Radio on the Harley Davidson.
2,Cheap item. Didn’t last long. Wish I had spent more on original purchase. Now have to buy another one. This last maybe 2 months of light use.
2,After about two months this cord started disconnecting randomly from my phone. Since I use it in the car I can’t exactly fix it whenever.When it works the sound quality is decent. The problem is that sometimes it’ll also disconnect one speaker leading to popping sounds on one side of the car. These problems have become increasingly common to the point where it’s basically unusable after less than six months.
5,iphone 7 this cord works finally no static in car and a solid connection to car speakers! bought a $30 one prior and had to return because of crap connection love the flexible grey cord and THE PRICE! 10/10 would recommend
5,Does the job. The sound is sound when connected so I don't have to turn the volume all the way up.
2,It broke apart and couple of months of using stop working you get what you pay for
1,Broke after 3 months of minimal use: sound quality deteriorated after one.
5,Sounds is great in my vehicle and the cord is not too long.
5,It works great! The only thing is that calls don't go through the aux but I don't think they do that regardless.
1,I bought this in the beginning of December. I loved it for about a month. Then started noticing it was cutting out if I moved my phone. Now I can’t even touch my phone without it completely cutting out and I’ll have to unplug my phone and plug it back in until the next time it goes out. And I have to plug the aux into my phone and unplug it about 5 times before it registers that my phone is even plugged in. It’s infuriating. I even got a brand new iPhone 12 in the beginning of Feb and it is the same way with the new phone. I will never buy anything with this name brand on it. Second purchase of this exact product and will never do it again.
2,I got this cable to connect to my headphone & power adapter. It only works if you connect directly to the phone which defeats the purpose of charging and listening to music through the car stereo at the same time. Shame because there is no static and good sound which is why I gave it the extra star.
1,It’s cool if you need something quick but definitely not lasting longer than a year
2,They are decent for the price. Cut out and make the music static sounding sometimes.
5,Works as expected
5,If you need this for your car stereo then it works 100% great. No water damage errors or poor sound quality. The cable feels very sturdy and durable. Would definitely recommend!
5,Not much to say its what it says on a box seems like good quality materials that wont degrade quickly.
2,Had this in my car for aux. started cutting out after six months of weekly use. Definitely not durable.
2,I used this to play music off my iphone in my car. After the first couple of uses the sound cut out. If I jiggle the connection for a bit I can still get it to work for a bit but most of the time it's non-functional.
1,This item did not last very long. The sound quality would cut off at the slightest movement it made it sound muffled. I could not hear my phone calls. It was just a bad experience in all. I had such high hopes for the product but was sadly disappointed.
2,Randomly decides when it wants to work.Can sometimes have to plug in and unplug the cord 10-15 times just to get it to register a device is plugged in (on a brand new IPhone 11 Max Pro).Get the “liquid in port” error message at least twice a week.Better off buying another product if you actually want it to work as intended.
5,Worth it.  For all you “Audiophiles” you won’t be disappointed
5,This seems to be very sturdy for a cord type item love that I don't have to keep track of an extra attachment because it actually fits my Iphone now.
5,Love this. I had  another brand & I kept losing connection. This one is perfect! Haven’t lost connection yet!
1,What can I say? It’s either I got a faulty product or this is just a cheap garbage cable. I’d say find something better.
1,I bought this about a week ago and didn’t try it until now. I wish I could rate this product with zero stars! It didn’t even work and I tried it for a good five minutes plugging it in twisting the cord everything! Such a waste of money!! Do not buy!!!
2,Worked well until it stopped working correctly. Bought in July and now I have to constantly move the cord to have it play on half of the speaker. Wish these cords would last longer.
1,Worked great for about 30-40 days. Then started to get choppy sounding days later stopped working all together. Buy elsewhere
2,Sound was goos when i first got the cord . In 3 months time it started to distort the audio whenever the cord wasn’t straight. Now the sound is distorted no matter the cord orientation.
2,It worked Well for the first month and a half and now I’m having sound quality issues nonstop I’m gonna have to throw away
5,It’s a great cord and it works fine for what I need it.
5,Easy to ise
1,I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. Not after. I just assumed with all the good reviews that I wouldn’t have an issue. But it seems that recently more customers are having the same problem as me. Two out of three times I plug this in maybe even more frequently I get a warning that there is liquid detected in the connector. Well today I went to plug it in to see if it’ll work and the end snapped off! So now it’s broken! One star all around. Maybe even zero. It broke one day after my return period.
1,Simply doesn’t work to play music in the car.
5,Nothing to complain about they work well and are quite lengthy so you have maneuverability
1,Don’t buy this. That’s the best advice you could get. The cables stopped working well within 2 months. I bought them at the beginning of August and now before September finishes the cable stopped actually transmitting sound and needs to be pinched/bent at certain parts for it to work. Nothing was damaged by me they’ve been in my car literally the entire time since I purchased them but now the cable just... doesn’t work. The sound quality has degraded greatly as well with static heard regularly making listening to any podcasts very uncomfortable. Don’t buy these worthless things because of the price.
1,Sound quality is not great and lots of distortion. Not worth a money.
2,Less than a month of actual use before cord started glitching. Doesn’t work at all anymore. I might’ve gotten a bad apple but if not I wouldn’t recommend this product.
2,Did a good job until a few days in when both ends of the cords kept falling out of the socket in the radio or phone :(
1,Aye Im not too picky let me start off by saying that. I purchased this and in the beginning it was good sound quality was there. Im very careful with my cables But not even 1 or 2 months later it BREAKS. and im only hearing the beat and it sounds like its in a hallway. No signs before that it was eventually going to break I just hopped in the car one day and boom. Trying another model now already ordered. But for this? I’d say good quality but isn’t durable. I was extremely careful and it still stopped working too quick.
5,Worked perfectly!  Was trying to get sound from my iPhone into a practice guitar amplifier to play along with it worked great!
3,It’s not durable as l expected.
1,Did not last more than 2 months.
2,Immediately did the “water detected” pop up as others have stated. Broke within 3 months. Don’t waste your time or money
5,Awesome for the work I do. No hassles st works every time
1,Maybe it was me worked great for 2 days then the lightning connector broke luckily it didn’t brake off inside my phone. Like I said maybe it was me but I’ve been using chargers a long time now haven’t had one brake like this or that quick.
1,The tip that connects into the phone was wobbly and snapped within a few uses. Would not recommend
5,Great for what it was meant for. 👍
1,I bought this cord to use with my iPhone 8. I got no audio signal to my player when inserted in the lightning plug but when I swapped to my iPhone the cord sent audio just fine.
1,This did not work: bought it to use the AirPods Max on the plane and it does not work at all
5,Perfect for my old ass car with only a AUX connector.
2,This product arrives and everything works! However after 2 days of use the side with the iphone port silver part slid right off. Although it works quality is definitely something they need to work on!
5,Product came as described. Works great. No fuzzy of choppy sound. Love it!
1,Dont buy this cable. Bleh
5,Works great for plugging phone into speakers. Crisp clear audio. Haven’t used it for data transfer
2,I have an iPhone XR. This cord did work and play audio for me just fine. But it only worked great for the first day. After that the audio started scratching and skipping. I wish I would have invested a few more dollars and bought a better cord or a Bluetooth aux adaptor
2,Looks much better than an aux with an adapter and this costs less than just the adapters from Apple. However the cable frequently disconnects sound from iPhone with just a slight nudge to the device or cable. Does not like to click into the lightning port.
5,Perfect size and works great.
1,Connecting point of aux cable broke off just pulling phone off holder.  Cheap junk.
2,Worked well for about 2 months. After 2 months I suspect the wires connected to the adapter broke. It still plays occasionally when you wiggle the cord.
1,I’ve had it like a month and it already shorted out plays one side of the audio. Lame.
2,About 20% of the time it doesn’t work saying there is water in the charging port when there definitely isn’t. Then after about a month of use it constantly disconnects.
2,The lightning cable is machined too small or something because it keeps shutting off as if it were pulled out but while still inside my phone’s dock. Very frustrating
2,Like other reviewers I keep getting a warning when I plug this into my iPhone XR. At the moment it does this 2 out of every 3 times I try to use the cable. Unreliable and frustrating to say the least.
2,Cable only seems to work half the time. I keep it in my car. Never seems to work when the weather is too cold. When it does work the quality is pretty good.
2,Sometimes it would choose to not work and I had to unplug it and plug it back in a few times. Then my phone fell onto the carpet of the car and it stopped working completely.
1,This literally won’t work with AirPods max so don’t even try.
1,This cord doesn’t last long. It breaks on the inside and the audio output is very distorted. I’ve ordered two and both have the same problem.
2,It was fine until it wasn't.  The lightning connector is flimsy and it short circuited in my pocket.
1,Sound quality was not great does not work consistently. Sound was choppy and intermittent. Not able to play an entire song
1,After two months it would randomly trigger an iPhone alert about water in the charging port even though my phone was completely dry every time. After two and a half months the slightest movement would cut the music as if it was unplugged despite it only slightly shifting. Broke after three months. Lightning connector broke off in my phone’s charging port when I picked my phone up.
1,I bought this aux cord and had no problems for maybe a week or two then it started making my music sound distorted and I had to hold it a certain way for it to work. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and ordered a new one hoping the first one just had some defects but nope. The second one was just as bad. It’s a cheap price but it won’t last
2,Cord only worked for a weak and now has a short and none of my music plays clearly.
2,Only worked for a few months. Pay a little more and get a better one.
5,Works great
5,Great quality
5,It is perfect 💯  love it❤️
1,Whenever I try to connect my phone to my car aux using this cord if gives me an emergency notification on my phone that there is water detected. The cord has never been near water and the phone has never had water damage. I was able to override the emergency notification and it worked (with good sound quality) but I did not continue to use it out of fear it would damage my phone.
5,Works like it should!
5,Just what I needed
5,Works as needed
5,Versatile. Flexible. Just what I was needing!
1,I expect cheap aux cords to break but this one broke pretty fast. After only 1 month this thing broke and is completely useless. I could see a possibility that if you use it very very carefully that it could last longer. However the aux cord works perfectly besides the breaking issue. The sound is great and works with my iphone. I just wish it lasted longer than a month.
5,GREAT quality cable will be using as an aux with my car :)
1,I kept trying to use it but after a few minutes of playing music it would disconnect internally so my music would stop. Gas stations have better aux cords. Maybe it was just the one I bought. Either way the one I bought broke.
5,Works great so far. No issues with connectivity. Good length as well!
1,I had to return this because it doesn't work. I have a 3' Apple cable that does work when I plug it into my AirPods max and the computer but this one does not - I get no audio so either its a bad cable or the description is wrong.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would. I should have looked at all the negative reviews before purchasing it. I bought it to connect my iPhone XR to the auxiliary port of my car. The connection does not seem to feel as though it could nectarines fully. I was able to get it to work briefly on a short ride to the post office. However since then the audio plays through the phone’s speakers and (as another reviewer pointed out) I get a message that there’s water in the lightning port. It’s a waste of money.
1,Was working fine initially although the sound quality was not great. I only use it in my car broke after about two weeks.
5,Bueno para el precio
2,Cable worked great for two months and then just stopped working.  Doesn't matter if I try it on another phone or another aux input.
5,Excelente
1,Worked for about 2 days then started giving an alert when plugged into my apple phone “caution water detected lighting cable disabled”… gave the message every time plugged in despite neither the phone or cable ever being wet at all. Brand new phone that has never gotten wet. Had the exact same issue with another off brand cord finally had to buy actual apple brand cord and that one works just fine.
2,30 days in and I’m having to purchase another. It’s not durable at all.
2,Sound quality was great when it worked. Quite finicky with connection so probably pass on this guy unless you don’t plan to use it in a vehicle.
2,This worked well at first but after 2 months it does not work anymore unfortunately.
1,Used in my car radio wasn’t messed with but started cutting in and out after a week. Completely unusable. Cheap garbage
2,One of those cords that you gotta mess with to make it sound right. This started 2 weeks after I bought it.
1,I was happy with the cable for the first 4-5 weeks of light use but then after that it started acting up and it works sometimes and other times not at all. Disappointed
2,Works for sound but won’t allow calls to answer or charge the phone
1,I didn’t think I would have a problem with a simple aux cord but I do and it makes the cord practically useless. Worked fine for a few weeks now it doesn’t work right unless the cable is moved around or messed with. It is super annoying at times music just cuts out and you can’t hear anything (even though the music is still playing). Not worth any price  I wouldn’t get it agin if it was free.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
2,Does not stay plugged in to my phone
1,Within 3 days of receiving this item the aux cord broke INSIDE the port of my car. Now I get to see a mechanic and lift up the entire stereo of my car to get it out. Even when the item was working the sound quality was poor and the cord had to be held in a certain position to work through both speakers of my car. Worst item I’ve ever bought on Amazon.
5,Perfect! Love it! Works great for my BMW X5!
1,This cord seems sturdy and well built however it does not work. It feels like the 3.5 mm end of the cord doesn’t fit completely snug when I plug it in. Just to give more context I drive a 2012 Nissan Armada. This might work on things other than trucks but who knows. If the seller reaches out to replace the one I have for one that works I would give it 4-5 stars.
2,the cable just fell and was damaged it looked good until it fell and broke
2,Did it’s job for a couple of weeks before dying.
1,Cord is not quality at all. Sounds horrible and has a short o straight out the package. Buy elsewhere
1,The product itself feels very cheap except for the woven thread part. The housing for the connectors are hard and cheap plastic that snapped in my sweater pocket as I was bending down to tie my shoes. This was only days after I bought it. It's a cheap cable.
2,The cord has a lot of static maybe it’s just a bad cord i would judge the whole brand off of my one issue
1,I had one of these and the 3.5mm plug broke off and then I ordered another and the lightning connector won’t “click” in to the port. It wiggles out and disconnects on its own. So I tried to get a replacement and it’s the EXACT SAME WAY. Garbage product.
5,Great gift idea.
1,I got my aux cord in on time and the next day I decided to use it. Not even thirty minutes passed and the aux cord broke when my phone fell over. The piece that you put into your phone was stuck inside for a while. The aux gave you a great sound it's just really cheap and breaks easily. So if you're not a careful person do not buy this.
5,Works welk
1,I bought it and five months later it breaks don’t buy this product.
2,Cheaply made don’t pull from the cord
2,Didn’t even have it for a month and it shorted out.
1,Always showed a warning about water being in the connection port. I could override that but after a month all the wares came loose so it would stop working anytime the cord was bumped. Don’t waste your money. Amazon shouldn’t even allow this to be sold it’s so poorly made!
2,The sound goes in and out. Not performing like an Apple approved cord.
1,It doesn’t work
5,Great buy
1,I got this to connect my phone to my blue tooth in my car and used it maybe 10 times because I hardly drive anywhere. The sound quality is crap. I have to wiggle the cord to get it to work. This is terrible don’t waste your money. I’ve hardly had this a month.
1,Stopped working after 1 day.
1,I am one for sound quality and I notice when there’s a slight difference BUT this cord vs. an aux cord with a dongle (lighting cable adapter) is a HUGE difference in quality there is no depth I was thinking it may be defective but reading the other reviews i don’t think so.
2,Worked for a few weeks.
1,I took the cord out of the package and noticed that the metal tip was severely bent. I didn't even plug it in for fear of it breaking off inside my amp.
1,The audio drops out as if it’s loosing connection. The third time I plugging it into my phone the phone said liquid found in charging port and would not connect. It worked after a few tries. But there are better aux cords out there.
1,The cord developed a short in the lightning plug 2 weeks after getting it. By the 3rd week only the left speakers worked then it finally stopped working completely. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,It worked great for three days and now doesn’t work at all. Zero stars!
1,They looked of good quality but sadly neither of them lasted very long before they started cutting in & out.
1,This product really surprised me. I thought because it was cloth braided cord that it would be very durable and long lasting but I was mistaken. I’ve had this for about two months and there is now a short in the cord I can’t even listen to the music in my car properly. I have to now purchase another one. Very disappointed.
5,Lo que esperaba
1,Purchased this item for an f250 aux since I thought it was more convenient then having to get a regular aux and then the adaptor for the iPhone. Well that was a fail because it never worked the size was too small it would just come right out.
2,Works but phone calls don’t go through.
1,I bought this once maybe a year ago and within six months it started to fail. I bought a second one thinking maybe the first one was just a bad one. not even two months later and the second one fails as well.
2,Already broken after 1 use.
1,There was another comment here that said that it was super touchy. I can vouch for that never had more of a pain in the ass product than this. Save you’re money and look for a better version wish I did.
5,iPhone
1,One didn’t last through a day of work. The other literally lasted about a minute into the first song.
2,Didn’t last long.
1,Gives error that the cable has water in it.  This is the second one with the same issue.
1,This is the second time buying this cord and it has failed me again. I will never buy this brand ever again. From the outside and physically the cord is nice but the internals seem to have many problems. Mine doesn’t work regardless of how much I wiggle it maybe got 2 months of use.
1,Have had a replacement same issue. Become very staticy very quickly
1,Looks nice! Adds lots of noise though and you have to hold it just right for it to make a connection and you better not want to touch your phone at all because you’ll lose connection. I’ve cleaned out my lightning port but the issue is still there
1,This cable worked fine for the first day. Following it began to intermittently cut in and out. Only works at certain angles now which is not ideal. Unfortunately it is passed the return window for me but it is not too late for you.
2,Barely used it and it won’t work now.
1,Both lasted exactly 1 month horrible now I have to replace but not with them☹️☹️☹️☹️ No stars I pressed the button by accident
1,First use it cuts in and out with the sound has to be in the aux port just right or it only gets sound from one side of car worked on ipad switched to phone and no sound at all. Garbage
1,Unfortunately it broke in less than a week.
1,From the beginning it gave me problems. It would take 10 minutes for it to finally connect to my phone after turning on my truck. After 2 weeks it just wouldn't connect to the phone at all. Finally now it connects for a second then disconnects from phone. Didn't even last a month.
1,Loved this cord until it stopped working a month later. I only ever kept it in my car and never crumpled it or anything. Sort of upsetting because I feel like I have to replace these constantly
1,Sound crackles and pops kinda like the cereal only louder and more annoying.  Save your money find another product.
1,Bought two of these both stopped working within 20 days. Junk save your money. I got a replacement. Was unable to send other one back in time. I’m disabled and could not get there to get refund. Unhappy customer
1,Stopped working after just 1 month use. Does even register it is plugged into the phone
1,It worked really well for a week or two then started telling me that there was liquid in the cable. Then it wouldn't play unless it was at a specific angle. Good sound but does not last. Be better off buying a cable that's a bit more expensive but at least lasts more than a month or two.
1,I bought this and loved it for about a month and a half. Then I noticed it started glitching. I'm two months in and every time I touch the phone the music cuts out.
2,Some noise along with my music.
1,I used it maybe a couple of times a month for a little over 3 months before the item failed to connect.  This product is a rip off - do not buy.
1,This cable didnt fit well you really had to wiggle it around to make sure the phone was connected. It was bad right from the start not due to wear and tear. This is the only lighting to aux cable I've ever bought that sucked to begin with.
1,This is trash. Don’t buy
1,Product lasted 34 days before needing to be held in place. Still looks brand new. Good thing it came with two. I’ll have 30 days to find something higher quality.
1,Cord doesn’t work properly unless it’s in a specific spot and you have to mess with it until you find a good spot where the music works and isn’t full of static. Awful cable.
1,The aux cord is not good quality. It broke after a week. I have to move the ox cord in order for it to sound right in my car. Definitely a waste of money
1,This product was delivered May 3rd. I’ve used the cord maybe 15 times and I now have to hold the cable a certain way or sound will only play out of 1 speaker. Of course the return window closed 5 days ago.
1,I liked that it was made for apple and the cord “seemed” to work until it broke off in the radio and now I can never use my audio jack on my car again because of the cheap quality of this cheaply made cord that will break.
1,Had to return cord. Cord had a low hissing or hum when connected to headphones and two different iPhones and an iPad.  This cord may not be compatible with my Monoprice headphones which are fine with other cords.
1,The lighting part of the cable doesn’t properly fit in the iPhone. When it’s plugged in it rocks from side to side causing the connection to be lost. It also causes a water detected error when plugged in.
1,It does not stay connected. I continuously have to unplug my phone and plug it back in just so it connects to my aux in my car. My bf gave me an aux to lightning cord from apple and it works no problem. So this was a total waste of money
1,Unfortunately the product arrived broken only transmitting  partial sound with a lot of static. Double checked against other wires to make sure the problem wasn’t the phone wouldn’t buy again
1,So spotty it worked for one day and now it doesnt work at all. I have to hold it in a very specific position to have it play
1,The durability of these cables is nonexistent. I had to return it twice due to the cable breaking working two days of purchase. I’d look for a different option.
1,Cord broke at the base. Wires came out and it no longer get works. It was not used daily and yet it still broke. Don’t waste your money on this cord!
1,I was hopeful that this would work out well in my car but my experience with this cable was frequent loss of audio signal which made the sound cut out and also a frequent crackling sound which became intolerable. I wound up going back to using the adapter instead.
1,Skip this one! Has randomly not worked from the moment it came out of the package. About every three days it will suddenly work then back to non functional. Maybe I got a dud but disappointed in this purchase and would not buy again.
1,This cord doesn't work every time you plug it in. You have to plug & replug many time. It's not my phone & not the outlet—I've tried other cords & they work every time. It's this cord. Should've returned it while I could.
1,The connection gets loose fast and just stops working
1,I use it in my car and it doesn't work half the time. If the car is cold in the morning I have to sit with the cord between my fingers until it warms up and works. Very finicky
1,Connector on iPhone is too lose disconnects every few minutes and I have to jiggle the cable to get it to reconnect.  Complete waste of money and very frustrating.
1,This cord is constantly throwing an error to my phone that it’s “wet”Additionally when I set my phone down it disconnects.Don’t waste your money.
1,Every time I plug in the aux cord it says there is water in the adapter. There is static when it does connect and it stops playing and pauses the song then when I hit play it doesn’t play on aux just on my phone. Very annoying to get to work and very touchy. Would not recommend
2,This cuts out all the time.
1,Loose connector doesn’t work with iPhone.
1,Broke in 3 days…… 3!
1,I got this so i could listen to music in my car the cord did not work properly.I also attempted to plug this into multiple amps and mixers and it still did not work properly sounded like faulty wiring. would not recommend
1,I bought two of these within a week they stopped working. I returned them for two replacement cables and here we are again. They both stopped working. They cut in and out.
1,Item did not function at all.  Tried multiple devices to double check. A bummer when on first flight with my AirPods Max as I couldn’t enjoy movie in flight.  Returning for a refund.
1,Worked well at first then next day my phone started acting up. By third day it caused an error message to pop up and my phone automatically shut down.
1,This “product” does not work both connections are loose and if you hold the cord just right you can get sound for about 10 seconds and then all you hear is straight static would not recommend.
1,This stopped working after less than one month of normal use in the car. Very disappointed! Worked great for about three weeks then had spotty connection the last week then stopped around week 4.
1,Cable worked fine for the first two weeks now every time I plug it in it claims there is liquid in my lightning port.  Will not work at all for audio anymore total waste of money.
1,This item was defective right out of the box. Did not work at all connecting AirPads Max to PC. When connected iPhone 12 Pro to a speaker the sound quality was terrible with lots of white noise
1,The sound quality started sounding staticky after 2 days and then the metal part of the aux side fully fell off after 3 days of use.
1,This cord sucks 0/10 would not recommend everything that you see in the reviews are definitely true do not buy waste of money
1,it did that thing where you have to move the cord to get sound to work. after two days of suffering through that the whole thing just broke.
1,The part the connects to my phone don’t even fit it’s just barely too think it almost breaks my Lightning port ... used other ones and they fit right it this one you have to force it and feels like it will brake my lightning port
1,Sound quality was great until sometimes it was create a static noise that you couldn’t get rid of. Durability sucks. It broke within 15 uses. And value is not worth it if it breaks so quickly.
1,garbage. find another brand. i used it maybe twice and now every time i try to plug it in my phone gives me an error and it won’t work. tried on other phones and my phone with other cables with no problems
1,Constant popping and crackling since the first use. It’s not my equipment either; my Apple dongle and generic 3.5mm jack don’t do that. Absolute trash.
1,went to use it and it worked great then i went in to my car later for it to say there is water damage and it can’t connect?
1,i was very sad. my things do not play well together! i was hopeful this little cable would bridge the gap and save me buying a third (third!!!) set of bluetooth headphones just so i don't blow out my neighbor's window playing video games late at night but... alas.
1,Straight out of the package both cables produced an awful buzzing noise when plugged in. Would highly recommend looking for a better quality product.
1,I bought this product to use in my car.  I used it for a few days with not issues. Then suddenly the cable is not recognized by my iPhone.
1,Good packaging shipping and product feel. Unfortunately these data cords have terrible sound quality and skipping issues that made listening to music unbearable. I ordered two and both were frustratingly poor quality and I’ll be returning them in order to get something better.
1,Bought to use in my truck. They do not work for music videos or phone calls most of the time. Trash. Need to get a refund.
1,Doesn’t work well. Never consistent. Cuts in and out. Waste of money.
1,Cord was faulty right out of the box. Tried using several times but the item did not work for more than a few seconds. Very disappointed
1,Stopped working after using for two months. Not physically damaged but doesn’t work.
1,Hard pass. The cable fails to work almost all the time and I have to unplug and plug it back about 20 times before I can get it to work. You'd be better off finding another product.
1,The part that plugs into my aux input slid off in my car stereo...now nothing else can plug in..Also if your phone has a case....it doesnt work either
1,Poor quality. Sound plays to left speaker intermittently and only after jiggling where the braided cable meets the connector.
1,I bought this 2 months ago and it’s already broken. When I plug it into my phone it’s says I have to “emergency reboot” it. Product is not worth it.
1,Do not waist your money on this cable.  Only last 1 day.  The sound was distorted and the cable did not anchor properly.
1,I had the product for 8 months and used it in my car to play music and now it goes in and out of working.
1,It’s not very sturdy… broke after using it for less than a month.
1,I liked it at first. Although after a few weeks it fell apart. The connection broke inside my phone.
1,Bought the cord for my car. I’ve used it for less than two months and it has already come unfraid at one end and no longer works.
1,Waste of money!!! Literally broke off in my phone 3 days after the return window closed! You think an Amazon recommended product wouldn’t be so cheap and awful!!
1,Braided cord is useless musics skips because of bad connection have to turn wire to have good wire connection
1,Ordered four 2 packs and they all broke and suck. They look good but cheaply made. Buyers BEWARE!!!!!!!
1,It worked great but then one day after about a week of use it started to only work at a certain angle.
1,Very faulty and cheap. The cord will just stop playing randomly every 2 minutes or so. Serious connection issues.
1,Purchased this cable 6/9/21 - unfortunately the cable isn’t working. On the exterior the cable is fine but something is loose on the inside.
1,Lightning port plug was loose from the body straight out of the package so the chord never worked.
1,It worked okay for a week after that it’s really done for. It says water in in the cord but their isn’t any water anywhere near it.
1,Unplugged my phone and it broke easily.
1,This my second time buying and both went out withing 1 month. Do not buy. Will not last long
1,Will stop playing or produce a static/whining noise if touched or moved around. Do not waste your money on this.
1,If you only want a cord for 2-3 months this is the cord for you if not spend 5 more bucks
1,Broke in a hour auxiliary end snapped unplugging it
1,Lots of feedback while using & phone calls wouldn’t connect to aux
1,This product bought in July and it already doesn’t work it has ripped and the sound quality wasn’t great either
1,I was able to use it for a week before the plug snapped off of the cord for no reason
1,Worked for about a month then started to have crackling in audio. Eventually it didn’t work all together.
1,Product lasted 5 months before it decided to quit working.
1,I noticed a hum when playing music which I could have lived with. However it actually broke inside my aux outlet and caused me a lot of trouble. Would never ever recommend.
1,This pos is actually like 3mm and not 3.5mm as it wiggles in every 3.5mm jack.  Take this back to china a%%holes!
1,Stopped working after two weeks constantly had to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work. And once it once plugged in I couldn't bump it without losing connection. Wouldn't  recommend.
1,Sound quality was good while it lasted but the cord stopped working within a month.
1,The cord went out in 3 days!!! This is the 2nd replacement they have sent me!!! 👎
1,i have to crank the receivers volume up to max even then i can barley hear the music
1,the aux cord stopped working after only a month of use
1,Auxiliary end broke off after 1 week. This is a very low quality product
1,Didn’t even last 5 months with very little usage.
1,Keeps disconnecting my music just got it yesterday. Simply does not work haha.
1,I bought two of these. One didn’t work at all and the second has stopped working after using it two or three times. This product is certified? By whom?
1,This is not durable. This is our second one from Amazon. They both broke with in months. We ordered in Dec now in March broken. Beware don’t buy.
1,I’ve had this cord in service for less than a month and it has already started cutting out when the line bends.
1,It work d for a couple weeks then started cutting in and out now nothing
1,Barely worked since I removed it from its packaging just go buy a real aux and a dongle thing!
1,Defective cord only lasted 2-4 times before constantly cutting in and out when the cord is flexed around the lighting connector.
1,Broke after using it for only 2 days. When it did work it was great but then the music started cutting out and tons of static noise.  Extremely disappointed and annoyed.
1,Corddoesn’t always recognize your phone. Do you have to bend. And twist the cord to get it to work
1,Doesn’t fit securely into phone. Even the slightest bump will make it disconnect
1,Didn’t even last a month
1,The tip broke off into my phone right away! And sits very loose in the plug of car. Avoid brand.
1,This item barely lasted six weeks.  It is extremely delicate and only ever worked under perfect conditions.  There must be better alternatives out there.
1,It lasted 2 uses then quit working.
1,Not that I was expecting much for the price but not worth it.
1,Songs will pause randomly while using this chord/cable. Absolute waste.
1,Both of the cords became defective within 2 months….
1,Always have to reposition the cord to work
1,Ordered 2 aux cords and both do not workA waste of moneyDo not buy
1,kept telling me i had water in my phone and it broke after literally 2 uses
1,I used this and after about 5 times it stopped working
1,Do not buy doesn’t last long broke on me after just 3weeks I know it’s affordable but don’t buy
1,Sound quality was very poor and it broke at the lightning male plug after a week.
1,The cable stopped functioning within the first week of use.

1,Not only didn't it work but it damaged the charging port of my iPhone.
1,This worked great for about a week… if that. Then completely stopped working.
1,Don’t waste your money
1,This cord is broken already and I just bought it. Literally didn't do anything. Save your money and don't purchase this
1,This cord sucks you can’t even hear your music over the static don’t buy it
1,Very poor quality broke after only about a week of use.
1,I used this for about an hour on a road trip and then it broke. the tip broke right off in my phone and was stuck. Bummer
1,Had the product a little over a month and is no longer working
1,Cord did not even last me 3 weeks before I had to buy a new one.
1,We used this to plug into the aux port in our vehicle and the wire wore out within 2 weeks
1,Doesn’t work half the time and when it does it’s crackly. For those in search of an aux cord keep looking
1,Horrible bought two neither would play two diff phone and two diff vehicles
1,Was great until it would start completely going out in the car. Had to buy a new cable. Lasted a couple of months.
1,Only worked for about a week .
1,After two weeks it started to not have consistent sound after 4 weeks it barely works
1,Broke very fast and makes a beeping/static noises when i first got it
1,Apple’s AUX cord/cable allows music and phone communication too! This cable doesn’t!!!
1,Used this cord for less than 30 days and now has zero functionality

1,Typical cord adapter. Works for a week but if bend the cord the wrong way you might as well throw it away. I’m more prone to get an scar accident fighting with the thing to work than keeping my eyes on the road. Extremely frustrating. Thought I was buying one of the decent ones. Jokes’s on me.
1,Awful and a complete waste of time and money. It just does not work. 99% of the time it doesn’t work at all and the other 1% gives you weird buzzing and cracking in the audio.
1,This thing stopped working in record time. Don’t waste your money.
5,gets the job done
5,Love it 😍😍😍😍
4,So I don’t know what’s wrong with this cord but it stays in my center console with absolutely NO liquid near it yet every time I use it says there’s liquid in it. It still works but so annoying.
2,Decided to pay for this one because of reviews glorifying “no static”. My music randomly cuts out and then jumps back at it. Static is present and it’s just annoying that my music skips from playing fine to silence to back again.
5,Works great with iPhone XR. Seems well built.
1,It got broken after 3 months of using it and I do not suggest this at all! Don't waste your money.
1,This broke after 2 day of use. Not worth it.
4,Awesome
5,This cord is pretty great. The braided cable stands up to bends and turns and is very durable. I do get some fuzzy feedback while playing music at low volume but I think that might be my car’s fault.I have a ‘08 Chevy Impala.
3,Worked perfect until recently and now my iPhone will no longer pick it up.
1,I got this back in March and have only had it for 2 months. It has now started to skip and not work unless it's positioned a certain way. I will be ordering a different one now.
5,Good
5,Great size
4,Works fine now but when I first put it in the sound quality was wonky only taking off one star though bc I think that it could just be the radio in my car that was causing it
1,Won’t work in my Toyota Tundra not sure why
5,I love this product. When we’re buildings houses outside of service areas or just don’t want to listen to country music all the time this comes in handy for my iPhone. Love it.
1,i literally plugged it in and it didn’t work
5,Excellent Quality. Works as expected!
1,Not compatible with AirPods max Pro. Returned it immediately
5,Husband likes it alot
5,saved my life as a truck driver bored of the radio lol
3,This cord does the job for my car where I only have an aux input and it was affordable which is nice.Long story short it works but has some quirks. I had the same issue as others where it popped up a 'liquid in the lightning port' error and I was super confused. Saw that for a few days but have not since seen it in weeks. Occasionally I'll plug my phone in and it won't work so I'll unplug and try again. So not perfect but works most of the time and for the price it's easier than an aux cable + lightning adapter etc.
1,Doesn’t work properly. Any kind of movement to the cord will cause the audio to fuzz up and basically make it impossible to listen to.
5,This is a very cheap wire and it certainly feels that way. That said it gets the job done!
5,I’m a truck driver and I use this everyday for about 10 hours a day and they work great!
1,I only had this cord for about a month before it just stopped working.
5,Good product. For a good price
5,Good
4,use it to play music in my 2010 kia soul. a bit finicky at times but does the job just fine for $8.
1,Horrible product. It does not connect from iPhone to speaker which is such an easy task! Don’t waste money on this one!! Going to buy a better product even if more expensive!!!!
1,This did not work with the Airpod Max
1,I bought this the end of April it is broken already. Waste of money!!
1,don’t get it ... it’s cheap it only works for like two weeks
5,Good product
5,Great price no problems to report durable for the price for aure
1,Used it in my truck for about a month and a half before it broke.
5,Ideal replacement for AirPod max cable much cheaper but similar quality. Works great
3,This made iPhone think their is water in the connectionwhen their is no water present .  Error code water in iPhone jack. Just plain didn’t work from time to time.Allows radio signals to wreck listeners enjoyment.
5,I have bought 3 of these cores. My first worked ok but if your phone slide off the arm rest out your lap the music paused and you had to push play again. No big deal. That cord broke due to my fault so I ordered 2 more cuz the first experience wasn’t bad. Got the 2 new cords and plugged one in. On the third song it paused the music. Phone is stationary in cup holder push play 4 secs later pauses again. With in that one song it pause 14 times I did count. So I said maybe this brand new cord is bad so I got the other aux cord from the pack of 2 I bought and the 2nd cord did the exact same thing… brand new cord. This is not a “Best Quality” that they say. I don’t recommend this cord.
5,Didn’t even know they made these I was busy using a damn irritating am/fm transmitter to listen to my music in my truck off my iPhone.
5,Works well in car!!!
2,Nice idea but lighting cable is bit loss due to that sound quality become poor I have put phone at angle so that all terminals made proper contact. Tried on two phone same issue
4,Works as good as an Apple product
1,This item does not work  as  intended  and is not MFI
1,It came quickly but it came broken. The lightning connector part is loose and broken. Doesn't work. Had to return.
5,As advertised.
