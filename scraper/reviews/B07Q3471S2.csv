5,This ring light is a great gift for the narcissist in your life. They will finally see their true colors however they won‚Äôt believe it because it wasn‚Äôt their own brilliant idea. They will convince themself and try to convince you that although they appear in true color you are just seeing it wrong. It is brings a brightness to their true colors. It hold a cell phone perfectly to enable face recognition so your narcissist can‚Äôt deny they are who they are!
4,This product is lightweight and easy to maneuver but the lightweight can be an issue when using a heavy recording device. I have to be sure to balance my phone just right before recording. It does allow the phone to tilt rotate and be used with forward and backwards facing camera. I love the different light settings.
4,I recommended this product but sometimes move a little bit
4,This is a good ring light. I've had it for about a year and a half now. My only dislike is the set-up/tear down. It isn't the most sturdy. Would probably not be bothered as much if I had a place to leave it set up all the time instead of having to stash it in the closet.
4,Like the standard thread (1/4-20)
4,The light came on time. I love the light and how bright it is. The only thing I didn't like is that when trying to put the light in a down angle with my phone mounted it will tip over and I have to hole the back leg so I can get the right angle for the video.
3,My home office gets no natural light until about  3pm so these are crucial for me. However I feel as though they are not that bright (I have two). One also stopped working after 6 months. If I could re-do I‚Äôd just buy one nicer one than two of these.
3,I have two lights this one is not as bright as I thought it would be and it appears just to have a string of LEDs inside of a plastic mold and you can see that string through the housing and I just don‚Äôt get the amount of light out of it that I expected I wouldn‚Äôt buy another one
4,It's a great purchase. It's my 1st ring light so I have nothing to compare it to. I would say the center part where you place the phone could be better made however for the price I'm happy. Nothing is broken and it's super bright.
3,This was inexpensive. I knew what I was getting into and didn't have high expectations. This is something I would recommend for non-serious filming. It falls over almost every time I'm recording. It doesn't stay in place and the cord is too short to place it anywhere effective. That being said it was inexpensive and is what it is. If you need some extra light it's good. Not recommend for actual content creation.
4,I kinda wish I had gotten a taller tripod. I love the diversity of this light ring with all the color and brightness settings soft blue white warm toned white and mixed. With several brightness options) but I typically have to take my phone out of the case to have the tripod hold it. And you really gotta work to tighten it. I haven't used it a ton. Bought it for lighting during all my zoom calls while things were shut down during the pandemic. Have started filming for videos by myself with it. Lighting is excellent (from an amateur videographer that has a bachelor's degree in theatre and has designed theatre lighting) but the mechanism to hold the phone/camera is pretty whimpy.
5,When I first put this all together and turned it on to test it out it was really bright. To test the brightness even better I waited till night time and this light lit up my most of my bedroom. I did have this on the bright white and all the way up. I did test it in my small bathroom and all 3 light colors lit my bathroom up clearly. I didn't even need the light in there on to be able to see things. The stand this comes with is short but perfect for my meetings that I conduct online. The area my desk is in is dimly lit and with this light not only am I seen but I can see a lot better with things I'm writing. Really easy to setup and once set up it stays put. Even with sitting on my desk and even if my desk moves the light stays put and had not fallen over at all. I like having the option of attaching my phone or not. Most of the time I don't unless I have to use my phone during my meetings. Didn't come with a case but I use the box it came in as my case. Love that it has the foam pieces that still holds everything in place.
5,Small & convent
5,I've been using it with this tripod (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073WCL4NS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it has worked like a charm for all my self tapes. The included table tripod has no locks for the legs but they seem to hold their place reasonably well. It has a 1/4" screw on the top that mounts the light but it could also attach to the included phone mount without the light if needed.The included phone mount feels cheap functioning with a limit range spring that barely fits my OtterBox case. One of the pads also had to be glued back on out of the box but it has a 1/4" thread on the back and bottom so it should work with most camera equipment (I've been using the mount that came with the mentioned tripod without issue).The ball-joint adjusters underneath and within the light are easily loosened and tightened and hold my phone (with an OtterBox case) in place with ease.The light itself is very bright at the top intensity soft but effective at the bottom and hits a good range with the 8 levels in between. The temperature settings are also extremely nice and are as described/shown in the description. My one issue is that while running it off my battery pack (USB-wall socket not provided) it causes the pack to emit a high frequency that gets louder the lower the intensity. I have yet to notice it in my videos but it can make recording a tad annoying.A nice bonus is that everything comes in a 1 sq. ft. 2" thick box with shaped styrofoam inside that holds everything very securely and makes taking it on the go even in a carrying bag very easy. The box is cardboard but avoid rain and I think it will last.All in all I'm happy with it for what I paid especially with competitors seeming lower quality or much more expensive. I'd recommend it (with a different phone mount).
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†the ring light and it‚Äôs three settings were amazing but i bought this product for the duo aspect of having both a tripod and a ring light in one. i‚Äôve had this tripod for a couple of months now and it‚Äôs the most frustrating thing to use. the tripod is literally the worst. the legs are extremely flimsy and did not ever allow my phone to stand up straight. i ended up having it propped on my table with my phone set up on it and because the legs were so unbalanced and flimsy it just toppled over fell on the ground and broke. expect to never use this tripod standing up it just simple won‚Äôt.if you‚Äôre expecting to do some actual videos with this product (specifically using the tripod) good luck because it‚Äôs a difficult time. setting up should not be this difficult and keeping the tripod up should not be my biggest task in recording. this product was supposed to make my life easier with the 2-in-1 concept of light + tripod but the only thing good about this product was the light. it just felt like a waste because if i wanted just a ring light i would have bought one. this product feels only good as a ring light absolutely not as tripod.
3,Its a little flimsy the stand and the cord does get hot when plugged in too long  but overall it hets the job done
4,Does the job but a bit flimsy. I‚Äôd prefer something more stable.
5,i love it and it's great too
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Set up was super easy and quick the tripod legs are very sturdy previously I was using one of those selfie sticks that have these tripod legs and it was always wobbling like a flag pole in the wind and would always fall down and the phone clipart will topple over it took 10 minutes just to get it to stand still and then if you touched it it toppled over so I got this unit to be a sturdy tripod with a light and it absolutely works perfect and the phone clip is very secure watch the video I posted!
3,The quality is definitely cheap and the part that holds my phone flips and doesn't keep it upright. The lighting works great for what you pay for it though.
4,**UPDATE**Soooooo. Apparently the package comes with slightly poor instructions on how to turn it on. You have to hit the power button twice quickly to turn the light function on. I feel like I had tried every button combo like some sort of Super Nintendo cheat code. Took a man twice my size to ask to see what was wrong with it hit the flipping button twice and there you have it light turns on ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . I had ordered a replacement to give it a shot again so once it arrives I‚Äôll check it and return one.The only thing I‚Äôll say is the cell phone holder is a little strange. It‚Äôs all tension with no real adjustment of your own. I have a pop socket so I have to put it in with the screen facing the holder then turn it accordingly.I just received my product with 1 day shipping so I assume it‚Äôs at the local Amazon facility up the road a bit which was a nice perk. Strangely the packaging was not taped securely. It‚Äôs like a small pizza box with the end flap that ticks in to itself. Came right open. Packaging wasn‚Äôt discreet... very obvious what it is inside so could be riskier in terms of porch pirates all the way around. The device turns on as indicated by the on/off switch but the lights do not turn on at all. I will be requesting a refund and likely ordering another brand as this was pretty disappointing.
3,This ring light is easy to set up and is of decent quality for the price‚Ä¶ while it lasts. Mine burned out after a little under a year.
3,The ring light was not as bright as expected. There are 3 light settings all are very low I was a little disappointed it is good as a phone stand though
4,I have an online boutique and do a lot of social media selfie posts and videos. My home doesn't get a lot of light so taking good selfies was a problem. I ordered this one to try and see if it helped to take better pics. I'm very pleased with this purchase!I ordered it and it was delivered the next day. It came with easy to follow instructions and set up was easy. I have another light like this but this one was actually much brighter. I like that the color filters are built into the light ring so I'm not messing around trying to clip on different filters I just click a button to change it! Same thing with the brightness levels. I also like that it has a standard screw fitting on the base so it can be used on my tall tripod and even my selfie stick!I snapped some shots so you can see the difference with the light. The first one is without the light and the other three pics show the three different filters set at the brightest setting.Very good ring light for the price! I'd give it five stars but the tripod that it comes with is not that great. I don't plan to use it though.
5,I love this ring king be wise it gets the job done!
4,This is a good starter ring light. It has multiple settings and hues which is great. Thank you!
5,Current Review of new non-defective product received:The first one i received was defective because the bracket was fused together (where i'm pointing with the blue pen in the old pictures). the new product i received is not fused together and you can unscrew the plate to put it on the ring light (where i'm pointing with the red pen in the new pictures). The ball joint is not flimsy on the new product either. So the first one I received was just a lemon. I have no problem with mistakes because no product can be mass-produced without a mistake here and there so I'm changing my review to 5 stars. No this is not a super high quality product but it is priced accordingly and it does what is promised. If i needed something higher quality then I would spend an extra $100. Their customer service is great they emailed me (the seller not amazon) to try and make it right for me. So I am very happy with the product and the seller. I can now recommend this product. If the first one you get is bad have them send you a new one. You can't beat this price.-----------------------------Previous reviewthe phone holder plate  that is supposed to slide into the bracket on the light is soldered to the base of the screw so you cannot attach the phone holder to the light. You need 2 tripods. it does not work with just one tripod that is included. AND the ball joint does not lock the phone in place. When you tighten it as tight as it will go the phone still flops to any direction gravity takes it. Completely worthless. I will give them a second chance. If this one is defective and they send me one that with a corrected bracket and a ball joint that works then I'll change my review.
3,It topples over from the weight of my phone no matter how much I tighten the two things that tighten. Not great.
4,I'm pretty honest with my reviews and this ring light by far is the best bang for your buck in terms of wanting an item that works is relatively low cost and is ready right out of the box. Quality I'd say is standard to low nothing AMAZING but not worthless. The light is perfect for a youtube beginner which is why I got it personally. It has many tones/ shades and brightness it's easy to use and requires little to no power so even the laptop you're editing on can have it plugged in. It's 10 inch ring is perfect and does a nice job illuminating myself and objects well so 5 stars to that part. The tripod receives the most of my criticism in this review. It's three rods attached to a center point that dangle freely that depend on gravity and surface tension to stand up straight if straight is even achievable without real effort. Honestly it's lazy. Obviously I didn't buy the light for the tripod it is removable which means you're "expected to get a REAL" tripod which slightly annoying. But overall I recommend it for anyone who needs a nice low-cost light as a beginner-intermediate photographer or YouTuber. Yes it does hold your phone pretty well although I wondered if my fat iPhone 8 plus would fit...it did!
4,Got this to help do teaching videos for school as we are doing virtual learning. A couple things to note...1.  Phone holder is not big enough if you have a large phone in a protective case. I can't get my iPhone X with Otterbox case to fit into holder.2.  Although you can technically attach a DSLR camera to the ring like in one of the pictures with the description  I would not recommend it.  I had my Canon Rebel T6 fall from the ring.  The light ring's case is plastic instead use the hot shoe adapter to attach the ring to your DSLR camera.  You won't be shooting through the center of the light but it still works pretty good.3.  The desktop tripod and attachments that came with it seem sturdy.Overall not bad but I did see similar lights for a little less.  I ordered this one because I needed it sooner than the others were available.  Also I chose this type as I have several regular camera tripods that I can attach it to instead of ordering one that comes with a taller tripod.
4,Pretty good for the price. Adjustable and works well. A couple things though. I  plugged into usb port in my laptop like advertised in the manual and it hardly gets enough power to turn on. However if you have a usb hub that can plug into an outlet then that definitely works. So if you wanna plug this into a PC it might short out (but not short out and dead) it just requires more energy.Next the legs. I am going to see if tightening the bolt underneath might help but the adjustable legs are flimsy in that if you knock them it‚Äôll make the other legs do the ‚Äú splits‚Äù and the height slips. It might help to put an anti slip mat underneath ( like drawer mat liner) i will tighten the bolt though to see if this helps make the leg joints tighter to the main unit if not no worries ill put a non slip mat underneath.Despite all of this the light is really nice. I use it at my vanity and intent to use it more for cosplay makeup tutorials.
4,EDIT:The seller reached out to me to warranty the light and I was able to get a refund. The light did work well when I had it it was very easy to install and I think a one year warranty is fair for the price.I appreciate the size and ease of setup of this stand but it burned out after one year and I see no options for contacting the seller.
5,Was thinking about getting this for a while and finally did. I like it. Easy to set up and lets me take cool pics independently.
4,Light is good for price. Stand is very weak and shoddy but I just replaced it with my own tripod .
4,I bought this for TikTok but it won‚Äôt hold phone horizontally. Doesn‚Äôt work for recording tiktoks.
5,Nice tripod light
3,Well this worked really well until it didn‚Äôt. It just - stopped - after three months. I‚Äôve tried charging it plugging it in different outlets but nothing. Sigh. It had a nice albeit short run and worked well for all my Zoom calls. Buyer beware.
5,Light works great the color temperatures are limited but functional. You can also cut the foam the packaging they give you to diffuse the light even further if you feel like you need more.
3,Had to return this as I wear glasses and could see the reflection of the ring light in my glasses while on zoom. It was so distracting!
4,It's a cheap light ring so basically what I expected. The light is pretty focused so you'll still probably want other lights. I haven't tried the center camera bracket at all but it doesn't seem that stable. The stand was pretty much worthless for me... it's too low and was too wide to sit on a tower. The idea of these little ring lights is that you want them above your face to shine light down (if they're in front of you they'd be in the way of your monitor and light from the bottom looks like you're telling ghost stories) and so I had to buy another $20 clamp stand to clamp it to my monitor arm which doubled the price. Last thing to comment on is that the control is pretty far down the cord which makes cord management kind of a pain (you can see how far down it is in my picture - it's the control on my monitor stand probably 30" away from the light).
3,Great lighting options. Flimsy tripod. Wouldn‚Äôt risk damaging my iPhone by trying to use it. Light switch is ‚Äòtiny‚Äô.
4,I received this ring light yesterday and have used it a half a dozen times since then. The light itself is really nice. The size is perfect for working with a smart phone and the controls are easy to use. As far as the light goes this would rate five stars. The accessories though are not good. The little tripod seems decent though I can't say for sure as I have the whole thing set up on my real tripod. The two little little ball heads for attaching the light to the tripod and the camera to the light are pretty much garbage. Their bits don't fit very well and I don't think it's possible to tighten them down to the point of everything staying put without breaking something. That's fine though as I'm putting together a better solution currently.
4,My daughter is enjoying her first light. It fits great on our desk for her to film herself playing her video games for her til Tom channel. The light is just bright enough
4,I use this stand currently in the bathroom as a second countertop light! It works great! I‚Äôve used it a few times for recording and taking pictures and the process was easy and straightforward
4,Eh it's a cheap rim light. It's not the worst product I've purchased but it certainly won't get a glowing review. Was packaged well and came with everything. Easy to put together and simple to use. I definitely suggest not dropping it from any height because it looks super fragile! I bet a hard sneeze would break it Haha But the light does what it is supposed to.The tripod is comes with isn't exactly adjustable and is pretty flimsy even though it's metal. I ended up using my own tripod from my DSLR camera. The phone holder doesn't like thicker cases but I finally got it to stay. My only real complaint is that while I can get the position of the phone holder to stay put I can get the part that grips the actual phone to stay still and my phone just swings around :( Maybe some duct tape? Haha I'd say closer to 3.5 stars.
5,It makes me look awake & pretty !
4,This is such a helpful tool to have professional looking Zoom meetings. If you have a room where lighting is not sufficient having this ring light for video calls are super helpful. It really elevates the quality of your camera on call. Since I am using my laptop for video calls I simply plug in this ring light into the USB slot to get a charge from my laptop. You can also plug it directly into the wall with a wall plug. There are so many different light settings that you can adjust to  depending on how much light and what color you are missing. That means you can actually fix the color of the light so that you don't look flushed out. I just really wish that this came with a stand that you can adjust the height to...otherwise it is very low on the desk and you might have to put it on top of something.
2,We purchased 3 ring lights in April. They've been used for around 3 hours at a time 2-3 times per week. One stopped working last week and a second just stopped today. Even for cheap lights less than 6 months of use is not worth the money. While they were working the brightness was good not great but expected for the price.
4,Its great for the price and size. I do have a problem with the legs. I wish they were WAY thicker like a regular tripod. The legs makes it kind of flimsy. The part that holds my phone did come off while i was carrying it luckily my phone wasnt in it. I tightened that part as much as you can so it was kind of dissappointing that it keeps coming off. But as long as my kids or myself arent bumping the table its on it holds just fine. The lighting is great and the settings are awesome.Edit: My 3yr old stepped on the USB part while I had it plugged into an extension cord (she was okay) but it bent the part and the metal part separated from the cord and I can no longer use the light. It would be great if the cord was detachable and could be replaced. Or maybe a remote and could use batteries instead.
4,Works lovely - love the different types of light and levels of light. Perfect for social media. Only small downfall is the holder for your phone can sometimes tip over - as in it won‚Äôt stay still sometimes.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is a well packaged ring light table top tripod.  The tripod legs are metal and have rubber caps on the feet to prevent scratching the surface it sits on.  The legs pivot closer together and further apart for a few different slight height adjustments.  The tripod legs are a section and the ring is a separate section so it you want to mix and match with another tripod you can.  There is a standard sized screw in the bottom of the ring so it can be screwed into a taller tripod.  The leg portion also has a standard screw at the top so you could screw a regular camera onto it.  There is an adapter that screws inside the light ring with a spring loaded phone holder so the light is centered around your face.  The adapter that holds the phone also pivots so you can put the camera pointed down. There is a long cord with a usb end to go into an outlet for power.  The switch sits on the cord so you can hold it in your hand out of sight of the phone camera.  the light comes in three different temperature colors: white cool and warm.This is a great portable ring light with a table top tripod.  Definitely recommend.
3,The tripod for the light is very flimsy for the weight. There are a lot of light options and the power cord is plenty long. If you wear glasses I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this. You can see the ring of light on your lenses.
5,Easy to setup and it made for only desk tables or tables
5,Doesn‚Äôt take up much room. It helps because I don‚Äôt have much light for my  makeup area.
4,TBH buying this for ~$25 or whatever isn't a bad price. The ring light seems OK and it does have different settings and such. HOWEVER: 1. The "tripod" only raises the ring light to about 12" height. One foot. good only to set on a tabletop.2. The power source is USB. Weird as I wanted to use it at home- but just need to PURCHASE ADDITIONAL USB POWER SOURCE3. In all I guess that I should have examined the specs more carefully before purchasing. I don't want to hassle with sending it back- as it is essentially "useable"- but not really what i had wanted.4. I just bought this as a ring light- but if you want to use this with your phone- the whole thing is *kinda* flimsy so beware. Doesn't seem like the phone clip thingy is adjustable.
5,I'm a full time WFH employee who occasionally needs to share video. My monitors take up my entire desk so had no room for a lamp. I used a command hook to hang behind my monitors on the wall. So its light enough to hang lightens up my direction instead of my side window as well as will help my seasonal depression going into the winter months.It plugs in easily to where my docking station is so easy to turn on and off with the switch. If I ever did want to use my phone for a reel or tiktok its easy to utilize for that as well.
2,Worked for a couple of weeks and then the lights quit working.  No reason for them to stop working...didn't fall over drop or over use it they just stopped working during one of my videos. Sucks too because I really loved and needed it.
5,I am so loving this light!  Mind you I have an 18' Neewer ring light and I think this light is actually better.  You can adjust the color to various different settings of warm light daylight and etc!  I am glad that I made this reasonable investment.I am seriously thinking about selling my 18' ringlight (bought a 2 years ago) that I have and replacing it with this brand if they offer this light in a larger size because I have to use plastic color filters to achieve similar results and there is not a filter on my 18' inch Neweer ringlight that simulates daylight--just warm and white light.However upon further research there is a newer Neewer 18' ring light now that has adjustable warm white natural and color settings that can be changed without swapping out the plastic color filters.Regardless THIS RINGLIGHT is A definite gamechanger for your selfies and raises the bar even in comparison to other brands and sizes of ring lights!
5,Love the light! The light has lots of light settings! It‚Äôs GREAT!!!
2,The middle setting on light temperature always starts flickering after about 60 seconds. It‚Äôs like a strobe light so distracting plus starts to give me a headache. This was a replacement light so I assume they all do this.
4,This is my first ring light and I use it for video calls; I chose this one based on the price to ratings ratio...  The light is fine and it's nice to be able to adjust the warmth and brightness.  The tripod is flimsy - I need to balance mine perfectly and not touch it or the legs slide out from under it.  As other reviews note the holder/grip for the phone is another balancing act.  No matter how tightly I try to screw it to the light I have to let it balance itself then balance it on the light then rebalance the tripod legs to get everything to hold steady.  However I'm only taking one star off as I just use this for extra light during general video calls I'm not reviewing it as someone who is taking photos or making videos.
4,Updated review 8/12/20 : so I emailed the company about the broke piece.  It was missing the metal tread to screw in the clip.  All I wanted was for them to mail me the piece but instead they mailed me a whole new unit.  The offered wonderful customer service and quickly addressed the issue!I purchased this to do live cooking demos.  I can‚Äôt even say how well it works because there is no tread in the expandable clip.  It‚Äôs to be screwed onto the piece that holds the phone in the light ring.  It can‚Äôt be screwed in.  So it can even be used.  Very disappointed.  So we shall see what kind of customer service they have to be willing to fix the problem.
5,What an awesome light. It's a game changer . The halo really makes a difference. A must for better lighting
5,The ring light is the biggest highlight. I love the option of using it as a handheld and I love that the tripod folds down teeny tiny. it's perfect for the salon especially as studio space that has limited square footage. The remote is a really nice touch it's great that you can control the camera on your phone using it from anywhere without even having to touch your telephone.Architecture: My initial impression was that it was well made. The bracket designed to secure the phone is a sturdy plastic with screws that hold it in place. Feel safe enough to put my phone in the stand so you can consider using it as a selfie stick to avoid losing your phone. It is light and compact in structure. I can easily store it in my backpack while hiking instead of adding extra weight. Note: The bracket is easy to fit my phoneEasy to use: I haven't read the instructions yet but I have no problem setting up a tripod or connecting the remote to my phone via Bluetooth. I am not sure I will use the remote control
2,I bought this so I could have it for my job to look better on camera and it worked fairly well for $20 for a couple of months of fairly regular use but ultimately it just died out of nowhere - worked one day dead the next. You truly get what you pay for but that said the time I did have it I thought it was wonderful just wish it was constructed better for $30 vs what it is.
3,I use this light a lot for product photography for the items I sell.  I have my own tripod and other gadgets so this review is for the light itself.  I've now had it for 1.5 years after 1 year and after the warranty the usb connection started failing. You have to keep it really steady once you connect it so that the power flows through.  Still usable 6 months later the on/off power section needs to be wiggled around so the light stays on.  I'm spending more time wiggle and securing than taking pictures of products.  I'm moving on to different light but this product overall is good for short term use.
5,Does the job! I love that it‚Äôs adjustable in positioning and in the brightness and light type. It‚Äôs works perfectly for my daily Teams calls.
3,I was excited about this light. However today was my first day using it and I'm very disappointed! It does not stay on. It powers off even though I have it plugged into an android USB charging plug. If I'm recording I'll have to turn the light back on when it cuts off. Not feeling that at all!
4,Well the light is definitely bright. Gives some good options daylight more yellow and blue... BUT. The stand is kinda meh. Very annoying. It‚Äôll stand but falls over easily. The stand is also meant for a phone to record horizontally. Vertical still woooorks but it covers part of the ring light since you gotta turn the whole thing to one side. It‚Äôs good for the price. But I wish I spent a lil more for one with a better stand & phone holder. Basically even if you‚Äôre poor save for a better one. Unless you don‚Äôt care about a stand and just want good bright light.
2,The light is ok but the dimming feature stopped working after a week. It only works on highest brightness which isn‚Äôt functional for me. Will see if there‚Äôs a warranty.
4,Basically as the headline says. Getting it to sit right where I want it is hard since there is some readjustment after I tighten everything and the grip on the feet isn't great. The legs slide around if positioned at certain angles. I also have to be sure to put my phone in first because the legs always move whenever I touch it.The light itself is great - natural warm and blue light with many different brightness. Has been working reliably for several months and makes a big difference when I record. I'm glad I bought it but I might invest in one with better legs in the future.
3,It‚Äôs ok. What you‚Äôd expect for the price I guess.you can adjust the brightness and the warmth of the light. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs kids flimsy‚Ä¶
5,Easy to assemble‚Ä¶.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I like it thus far the first one I bought was broken when I got it so I had to re-order one and amazon made it easy for me! got the second one and this one has so far worked well my only concern is that its very lighweight so it feels like its not too durable so I feel like I have to be very very gentle with it. I like how I'm able to put it on my own tripod because the tripod it came with is a little desk one thats about 12inches in height:/....over all this is a nice product esp if ur just using it for selfies and portrait style videos
3,Not quite as I was expecting.  Not as sturdy.  But does the job.
3,The light is great - tone and brightness adjustments work well. But the tripod had with a weak wobbly leg that made the whole thing slide or collapse unless kept propped up by something else. Asked for a replacement and the replacement was exactly the same if not worse.Kept the product because I like the light well enough and I can manage for now. I assume the tripod will only get worse so I may replace the tripod with a Gorillapod later on - if the screws are compatible.
3,The light is lovely and had great options. However anything that isn't the light itself is poorly constructed. The tripod doesn't hold it's position the screw to hold the position for your phone constantly falls out.Edit: the company reached out and offered a refund for the troubles I had with mine which was really fantastic!
5,Es bastante potente su luz! Me encantan
3,It‚Äôs a great but the legs of tripod and very week. They don't hold up well at all. Im sure there is better quality out there
5,I have had this product for a little over a year. I hardly ever use it but I was using it the other night and it shorted out almost caught on fire and shut off. It was very hot to the touch. Please buy a better quality ring light that will not short out!
5,If you're new to filming or Zooming this is a great place to start. This ring light works great and gives beautiful flattering light for small scale calls or videos. I wouldn't say it's a hugely professional but it definitely works and for the price point you can't beat it. I like the different settings it offers and how it folds up and is easy to travel with within the box it comes in. It works with iphones or androids and is easy to place behind a laptop or tablet. Overall my professional photographer son-in-law said this was good enough for FB Lives IG shorts and general video calling. Definitely worth the value and easy to operate!
4,I use this in my salon. The legs are not that sturdy. The light falls over. But it you position it right it stands. The part that hold the phone kept getting flipped upside down. Could be user error.
5,S√∫per
5,I didn't want a floor stand so this works perfect for me. I like that there are different light options as well. For the price its really a 5* review but if rating for all LED lights it would be a 4* as this is for personal use.
5,I'm not sure why it's showing stars for camera quality and face recognition when it's a ring light. It's a handy little ring light with stand if you want to make a video sitting down at table or desk. Both my husband and I have used and so far it's working like it should.
4,So far I've only used this ring light for work meetings and family zooms (no content creation) and it's worked well.However the legs are short and not super sturdy (I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions). And when I try to use the phone holder sometimes the legs can't handle the extra weight and everything starts to shift (sometimes things fall).The light was one sale when I purchased so I'm not gutted about the investment. But I would assume professional content creators (like news reporters working from home) would want something sturdier and taller.
3,Lighting is great .everything else is flimsy not sturdy can break with several uses.
4,I am on video calls all day long. This light is a game-changer  and actually makes me want to turn my camera on. The adjustable lighting is the best part - it's easy to  switch it up which I do depending on the overhead lighting or time of day.It's a little flimsy but it sits on my desk so that isn't really an issue  for me. The assembly was confusing - the instructions showed putting the light together with the parts fully unassembled but in reality some of the parts were pre-assembled. I also had a difficult time figuring out how to make the phone holder go to landscape to portrait.Overall worth the money!
3,Flimsy and falls over easily. Bottom is not large enough or heavy enough.
5,I bought this to upgrade from a smaller ring light and WOW what a difference!  I use it mainly with my webcam and it‚Äôs perfect.The ring light has a ball mount to attach it to the included tripod or (in my case) a clamp that I have on my desk.  Inside the ring is a second attach point and ball mount with removable phone holder.  I took that off and attached my webcam.  Sooo much easier than mounting them separately.The light is super bright on high and dims nicely.  Adjusting the color helps me from looking too red or pasty white.  The control even lights up when the light is off to make it easier to find.Overall loving this light and will use it for a long time while I‚Äôm working from home due to Cv19.
4,This is a great starter ring light or for those on a budget. This is my first ring light and I wanted to use it for Zoom meetings/live videos for better lighting. This definitely achieves that objective.Pros: three settings for different lighting plus 8 or so dimmable settings within each easy to set up and useCons: buzzing/ringing sound that can be heard in the background of my live videos which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.Overall a great product for the price!
5,It's a good starter it is very bright and multiple brightness and colors. My only problem is the phone holder is very chimpsy it dont stay on the ring like it should.
5,I must admit that I am not very tech savvy.  I can use my phone and social media about as well as my grandmother.  However  I really like to post pictures of my crochet projects and I needed clearer pictures for my tutorials.  This was perfect for someone like me.  It was easy to assemble and it even  comes with its own tripod.  I was a bit skeptical about the different color schemes  but it does make a difference.  I think the one with blue undertones is my favorite.  I also like that I can clip my phone or camera into clamp in the middle of the ring.  It can be removed if you want to use it for a makeup light.
3,It does not come with the thicker tripod you see in the pictures only the flimsy 3 legged one and I could not get mine to stay up. The legs kept sliding out like Bambi on ice. As a result I couldn't get the light to the height that I wanted so I'm strongly considering returning this especially now that I see the price has come down a few bucks from what I bought it for. It's not really the best option for me anyway.
5,I love this ring light. It's easy to travel with and there are a bunch of different brightness levels.
3,This isn't bright enough. The tripod isn't stable and the light leans no matter how you tighten it.
4,I was looking for a ring light but didn‚Äôt want to spend too much money since I‚Äôm not quite sure how to use it.  I read a lot about them. So I purchased this light and it‚Äôs great. It has three different color settings. you can change the brightness of each. It‚Äôs great for zoom calls as well as applying make up. The tripod is a little flimsy but other than that great product. Make sure you buy the adapter with the correct voltage though.
4,It could be worse but its not the greatest quality.  The screws that tighten to hold the light/phone in place seem to be easily stripped.  It will stay locked in for the first couple weeks but the more I use it the weaker it becomes.  With that being said it still does the job it was intended for as far as the light goes and it does still stand.  However it's not meant to last.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Maybe it‚Äôs just me it‚Äôs not hard to put together but I guess I don‚Äôt know how to make the lags stand up straightZ I have a bigger and heavier phone (8 plus) so the phone holder is really low and the phone weighs everything down. But it‚Äôs an amazing product. The brightness is astounding and really makes you glow and pop. Camera quality depends on your phone but the ring light makes it clearer. Your face is easily recognizable.
5,The LED Ring Light 10" with Tripod Stand & Phone Holder for Live Streaming is everything I hoped it would be: easy to install easy to use and effective in providing me the light I need to talk with friends and family on the Internet. I must admit that thought I am highly educated when it comes to things invented since I turned 50 (that's 32 years ago) I'm as stupid as they come. Someone told me "Hey you need a ring light." So I went to Amazon found the one I am reviewing and I use it easily on a regular basis.
5,I work in tech and like most of us find myself on an ever-increasing number of videoconferences lately. Purchased this inexpensive ring light to level-up my Teams game. It's great because it runs on a USB connection (even a cheap battery like you charge your iPhone with) has three different color levels to match your environment and numerous brightness settings.  I use my GoPro Hero8 with the brand new webcam function in order to get a wide field of view while my face is perfectly lit by the ring light (pick up a $4 GoPro connector with a 1/4" tripod screw here on Amazon). I'm constantly being asked by colleagues how my video looks so damned good. I tell them it's genetics but in reality it's this little ring light + my GoPro.
2,This is not a very good product! The tripod and mounting hardware are clumsy difficult to use and unstable. There must be better options out there.
3,I didnt like that the piece that holds the phone was loose. But the light was very bright which i loved. i bought it to use for putting on makeup.
4,I am happy with this little ring light. It's small and compact which is what I was looking for. It doesn't have a remote button in order to take photos with the press of a button but for the price point it's perfect. The tri-pod legs are only good in the lowest position which isn't a huge deal but I would have preferred for them to be a bit more functional in order to allow the ring light to stand up taller.
3,The ring light is great! I love that it has three warmth settings and myriad brightness settings beyond that. I have exactly zero complaints about the ring light itself. The phone holder is great - it extends to hold my massive phone with its massive case and all is well. It can be mounted horizontally or vertically. Great!Then there's the tripod this thing came with. Wat. Why. How. It collapses whenever someone in the next town over farts. Whenever a bird outside flaps its wings. Whenever I blink.So given that I've found myself mounting this to my own DSLR tripod just for a stupidly complicated desktop setup I'm not thrilled. But I also paid $17 for this setup...so...Anyway if you don't already own an additional tripod I suggest buying a more expensive ring light with a more sturdy base. Good luck.
5,I've been streaming on Twitch for almost 3 months now and was in need of better lighting. Found this ring light and decided to give it a shot. I love how easy it is to set up and how there's different modes you can switch to.You can use it with your webcam or your phone. I think if I wanted to switch to my phone instead it would be an easy to switch.The only thing I'm not too fond of is the tripod that comes with it. I would rather have a tripod that could extend its legs a bit more. I had to buy an arm that attaches to the desk to make it work a little better but not a big deal.
5,Works as advertised.
3,Not meant for me as I wear glasses. Only gave 3 stars because I was so disappointed I cannot use as I wear glasses and the ring light makes me look possessed. By all other accounts the lighting was fine and cool that there‚Äôs different levels of lighting. I had to resell the item.
5,I love this due to the following reasons:1. Lightweight and Portable easy to bring anywhere. You can literally just put it inside your bag and bring wherever you want2. Very easy to assemble will just take you 3 mins to put them all together3. I love the controls. I have a 18inches ring light but that one doesn‚Äôt have button for on and off but this one it has press button4. Built in Controllable Filter5. Perfect for makeup tutorials just place it on your tableSome things that I am not fan about it1. It was delivered in a box and it was snowing that day the box was a little wet but luckily  the inside was dry2. I wish they include a charger to connect into the USB cable.To wrap up! I would say it is worth it!
3,The lighting is great but the stand keeps slipping. It's not very sturdy at all.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I‚Äôve been looking for a ring light for a little while and finally got this one because I liked that it came with multiple lighting options.The video first shows the light on the highest brightness & bluest light. Then I turned it off. Turned it on. Lowered the brightness all the way down. Turned the brightness back up. Changed the lighting to the warmest settings then to mixed lighting setting (part warm part blue) and the the ‚Äúblue‚Äú light setting. (And yes I DID use an Instagram filter because my face is scary af without it).Has all the options I wanted AND didn‚Äôt break the bank. Win win.
4,I purchased this to be able to take selfies with the family and it works fantastic! I have purchased more to give to family members...that's how good this product is! The only downfall (slight) is it is a little wobbly when putting your phone in but not enough to reduce my  rating.
4,The lightning is great 10/10 there and everything else is good EXCEPT the tripod part of it. It won‚Äôt stand. What I mean is that I will slide until all three legs are completely extended outwards. So if you want it to be higher you have to put it on top of something.... which really sucks. It doesn‚Äôt happen as often if you don‚Äôt have your phone on it but the second you out a phone there it can‚Äôt hold up the weight I guess! But good for the $25
3,The light has brightness options which is great but it‚Äôs not very stable. The leg stands slide around a lot. The light is extremely bright to be in front of your face where it needs to be to have that ‚Äúprofessional-ish‚Äù look on camera so ehh. It‚Äôs okay for the price.
3,I'll say that the actual light output is pretty nice assuming you're in a dark room.  It's not very bright so idk how it would help with pictures in an even moderately lit room.  I'm using this in my workshop to take pictures of bonsai though and for that it's fine.The mounts are flimsy.  The little ball mount wants to flop around a bunch even when you've fully tightened it.  That's a bit nerve wracking considering that the mount is holding my phone.  The light ring itself is just plastic.  I feel like it'll crack if I drop it so I won't drop it lol.Overall I'm happy with the purchase as it suits my needs.  I just have to deal with the low quality material/craftsmanship.
5,my first ring light ever... When I first started my YouTube channel this is the ring that I bought. Trust me it works for when you're starting out. If you want to invest in a better light later on down the line fine but this is a definite great starter! I did the first five months of my YouTube channel with this exact lighting. And no one knew the difference everything was well with it was sturdy I had no problems with putting the phone in the cradle I love the fact that you can adjust the lighting right from the cord while sitting down no reaching towardsthe light to change the brightness! Matter of fact I still use it as a backup plate and one filming! Well worth the money!
1,1) Tripod included is terrible.  You need to fully extend the legs for stability so unless you want to livestream your boobs the angle won't be flattering.2) Ring light DOES mount to tripod via universal tripod screw!! This is awesome (and the sole positive).3) Phone mount is terrible. It is so wide it will always press volume keys and on android phones this shortcuts to "take photo"..........The clamp is super tight and unfun to wriggle your phone out of too.4) Can't mount a DSLR into the ring. OK technically you can (the phone clamp unscrews).... but since the whole center arm piece just slides into the ring with a plastic slot I don't recommend it. It's scary even with a $900 phone. If you tilt the ring backwards the whole center arm slides out & falls to the floor.5) Don't be fooled into thinking this will work with any old USB-A shaped hole. This device draws A TON OF POWER and will require a 2.5A brick.  Pop quiz! Do you know which of your old USB bricks delivers 2.5A? Hint: especially if you're an apple user... very few of them.6) It OVERHEATS if you use the "wrong" brick. Seriously!!!On the power thing: This really crosses the line for me from "negative" into "unacceptable."  Lights need a lot of power and if they had CLEARLY advertised that it needs a high-power brick I wouldn't have minded....  I buy a lot of cheap stuff on Amazon and plenty of other companies leave out power bricks BUT specify what bricks to use & not use at home.Saying you can use it "everywhere" with "mobile chargers" or "computers" implies it's a low-power USB-A device that universally works with all USB-A bricks and this light obviously is not. This is just lazy and borderline deceptive - especially when it hazardously overheats with underpowered bricks.This company needs to either chuck out 25 cents to put REALLY REALLY OLD power bricks in their box or they need to adjust the description.
2,Not sure if I had a defective one but it stopped working after awhile and components fell apart.
4,My ring light has great color and brightness. I use it for YouTube vlogging videos. I am very happy with the quality of the lighting. My only complaint about this light is that the controller on the light doesn't work very well. The plus button to make the light brighter usually doesn't work. If I want brigther lighting I  usually have to unplug the light for a minute to reset the brightness level. That's a sligh annoyance but IMO not worth returning the product over. I needed a low budget light and pretty much got what I paid for. "It works" and that's all that really matters to me.
4,I've been teaching from home given the pandemic and was looking for a light to use on my desk. Its been a few months and this works great. The light is adjustable for different hours of the day to match the lighting needed.The only downside would be the stand that is included. The legs are a bit sensitive and if accidentally touched are prone to slip.
5,I waited some time before doing this review. The ring is really good very bright and have 3 different settings. The brightness can be adjusted so you can decide how bright you want the light. It was very very easy to assemble and was ready in no time. One day I forgot to unplug and it stayed on for the whole day and is still working now. The only problem I have with it is that it‚Äôs not very sturdy. It does not break a part or anything but I think they can improve on the base. I like that it can be ball where the phone holder is making it flexible. I wish it also had a wireless remote. Overall it is a great product.
4,The light does a good job however the control switch is very finicky. The blue LEDs on the control switch only partially illuminate and pressing the on button only flashes the lights. You have to press the button twice to turn on the ring light.The tripod legs feel high quality but don‚Äôt provide much resistance to opening and closing. If you‚Äôd like to use a height other than the lowest setting then you should buy a different tiny tripod. Otherwise the legs slide on the desk and lower back to the lowest setting.
4,I had some trouble getting this to stay on as it is unreliable with a low powered USB port but woks well when attached to an adapter and plugged into an outlet. The tripod is okay but I wanted it higher so attached it to a much larger more sturdy tripod to get it high enough up to not reflect on my glasses. The colors work well.
4,I had the product for less than 2 weeks.  It is really handy and provides great light.  I am using it as lighting for my face for my many video calls now that I have to work from home due to COVID.  I went to turn it on one day and it flashed - like a light bulb does when it burns out.  I reached out to the seller and they sent me a replacement immediately no questions asked.  I am a sucker for a happy customer service ending.
2,Liked it when it worked.  Just stopped turning on yesterday. Expected it to last longer than it did. Disappointing.
3,The light works great however the legs are so flimsy on it that it tips over super easily. Had this for a few weeks and it was so flimsy it fell off the table and broke
3,If you are looking for a cheap but great ring light then buy this but plan on buying a separate tripod and phone mount. The legs on the tripod are way too flimsy to trust with your $1200 phone! and certainly would not be viable to use with an actual camera. The legs are only stable if fully pushed out which reduces the height too far. The phone mount also comes loose at the slightest adjustment.I should have read the reviews prior - but I ended up buying a better tripod that will be more secure. Still the total if you do this is less than the popular ring light kits. Overall great light though the color temp settings are great and the controls work really well.
2,Worked well for a few weeks. But now it wont turn on.
3,This light is very good for its sole purpose but the light will last at most 10 minutes. It doesn't take batteries it's by outlet but it ends up overheating and turning itself off. If you wanted something long lasting look somewhere else but it's good for Instagram photos or other selfies or tiktoks!
5,This is easy to set up height is (slightly) adjustable and I like that you can choose warm vs cool colors. You'll look better on Zoom calls.
5,I moved the extra connector to inside the ring to give the webcam a bit more height within it (my preference).  This sits on the top level of my standing desk and it's perfect.  The legs adjust somewhat though they could be a bit tighter (they slide out a bit if you don't have it set just right)...but if that's my only concern big deal.  The 10 different light levels and 3 colors are great.  This is perfect for live video.  I will also use this light with my phone to record video at work...I just have to connect a power bank and it'll be great!  Totally worth it and given the price I didn't expect it to be so good.  It is!
3,The light is great it's a little tricky mounting a phone in there but once it's in there it's solid.The tripod tho' is infuriating. As is it will not stay upright. It splays and falls right down. Terrible terrible terribleI was able to get it to work by putting the tripod in a cool whip lid - prolly one of those ginormous coffee lids would work even better. So that was an effective workaround but I docked 2 stars for even having to do that.
5,Gift they love it!
5,I bought this to help light self-tape auditions and it definitely gets the job done. It's large but not too large and comes with it's own tripod but you can also screw it onto a tripod you already have. The light is bright and flattering and I love that there are three different temperature settings and the option of dimming the brightness if need be. It comes with it's own phone mount too which is awesome! You can mount a camera in the center but the tripod itself is a little light and I haven't tested it with the weight of a camera so I'll probably just stick to using my phone for now.Overall I'm super happy with this purchase especially considering the price and think that it's worth every penny.
5,This is one of the best ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù purchases I‚Äôve made.  Does an excellent job of removing shadows from your face and brightening up the entire video.  There is a marked difference in video quality from people using a ring light and people who aren‚Äôt.  If you are doing any sort of meeting with people outside your organization or for business development purposes I highly recommend this ring light.  I went from troll to human with the click of a button.A couple of nice features: three ‚Äútones‚Äù of light so you can pick which one suits your coloring and background best and a dimmer/bright adjustment.
4,It‚Äôs really bright. And amazing for taking pics! I just wish I would‚Äôve invested into one with a remote to take pictures and with a better tripod stand. Other than that it‚Äôs a great product!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Definitely without a doubt bright!! My favorite feature of this item is the size of it. I hate those tiny ring lights that go on your phone as it isn't light enough and of course those 4ft+ tall ring lights are just so extra and not as portable as this one. Perfect for moving it and adjusting it to wherever you want it to go and be at. Recommend for doing simple quick videos to post on IG and such not professional enough for YouTube though.
5,The lighting is perfect while taking pictures videos and being on a Zoom meeting. I would recommend this product to anyone in search for a desk ring light.
4,Works good for what I need. I'm not doing makeup tutorials. I just needed to brighten up my new office at home which doubles as my dining room. I don't use the phone attachment as again not a 15-year-old girl doing make up tutorials. Just need it for my new normal. Wish the stand was more stable but then again I really like the light weight and portability so the stand is fine.
3,The product description states that the light can be powered by plugging it into a 5v adapter (like the little square ones that come with an iPhone) but there‚Äôs a caution sticker on the chord of the product saying that it needs to be plugged into a 10v adapter and a pamphlet on the box that states it needs at least 12v (older model iPad adapter.) Not happy that I now have to spend another $10 on an adapter (half of what I paid for the light) and wait for it to come before I can use the product. The fact that the power requirements are different depending on which bit of paper you‚Äôre looking at is also concerning.
4,An economical way to get more dimmable light in a room - like having the hue variablity and dimmability -and the fact that it comes with decent attachments for varying the angles means it's usable in a wide variety of placements.  Are using several of these now and have been quite satisfied.
5,It has three different settings of light warm cool and a mix of both together and a dimmer switch and that's it :) for what it has and what it is it works out exactly for my needs which is just to light my face for recording purposes! 5 stars
5,It has more options angles. extra stand  than the other ones on the market. Good illumination.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This ring light is amazing! I bought it to easily create time lapse videos and it seriously exceeds my expectations. I‚Äôm so impressed with the difference in lighting (like when I FaceTime my family or am on a zoom/WebEx virtual meeting). I can be sitting in a room in the complete dark while FaceTiming and my lighting is fantastic just by using this ring light. It really makes a big difference! Installation was really simple and the instructions are very straightforward - even including pictured graphics to help make installation quick and easy. Overall I‚Äôm so happy with this ring light and would confidently recommend it to others. It‚Äôs great!
5,Once I figured out how to tighten the base this light was the best thing ever!  I do a ton of live videos and I don‚Äôt have the best lighting in my house. I‚Äôve been in search of a good ring light that would allow me to hop on my lives whenever instead of planning for when the light would be best in my house. I really like how this light comes with 3 light settings and the dimming ability too. It‚Äôs extremely convenient to have a remote right next to me to adjust as I need to. This is really easy to put together and comes in a nice compact box that makes putting it away really easy.  Really glad I found this!
4,Good size for when you are sitting one leg broke but that‚Äôs because my 2 years got a hold of It. Definitely worth the money just to get started
3,I purchased this light for social media videos. The phone mount isn't very secure and it's a hassle hassle hassle to get my phone set up in it to record. It does not come with an adapter (to plug it into a wall outlet). If you don't use a good quality adapter it won't work (I had to use one from an IPhone charger).  One month after I started using it it started overheating. When it overheats it shuts off. This might be because I have it plugged into an extension cord. Yes that's a reasonable explanation...but isn't it reasonable to think I ought to be able to use it with an extension cord?On the upside I like the light itself. It's not super powerful but if you're just an average Joe looking for a nice way to light up your face for TikTok videos it's fine.
4,The only reason why I give it a 4 is the tripod legs don't stay as stiff as I like but I love it!!! its bright it works. I can take it off and put it on my bigger tri pod so it's  so so so dope .
4,*Edit*Replacement was sent QUICKLY. Like next day. Had it just in time for a PR recording I had to film. Love the light. It goes super bright if you need it farther. Nice that you can easily have this anywhere with the usb plug in.well. I was so excited to receive this. First off. The box's tab looked ripped. But I could overlook that. I plugged it in and guess what. Only 1/4 of it worked. Super disappointed.
3,Falls over when i put my phone on it sometimes but other than that it works great
4,I love this ring light. It's bright and makes my pictures/Tik Toks look amazing! I just have two problems with it. The stand's legs are super loose and seem to bend and collapse for no reason. I also had a hard time connecting my phone and kind of gave up. The clip won't fit. I may be doing something wrong but it's still a bit annoying. I still recommend this though for people starting out with YouTube/Tik Tok/Instagram etc.
3,Its ok its too basic so basic that the part that holds the phone between the lights is just a slit so the phone just slips out so easily and annoyingly!!!! Wish it wasn't too late to return it I barely use it so I missed the deadline urgh
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I absolutely love this ring light! It‚Äôs exactly what I needed for filming my videos. What I liked about it the most was that it was super easy to setup and fast too so I could begin filming my videos the same day! The instructions were very clear and even if you don‚Äôt follow the instructions it is very easy to figure it out. It is also very light weight and easy to travel with if you are on the go and want to capture content on vacation for example. Highlight recommend!
4,Got this for my gf so she could easily take quality photos of products to post on Poshmark. Works great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Ring light does support the weight of my Canon Rebel T6i. It can be mounted to a tripod (one is included). The package comes with a mount for you to slide in the camera as in the picture. The brightness of the ring light is more than I had expected and the different levels and warmths of the light is great.
2,Legs are far from sturdy constantly falling down and ripping over. Don‚Äôt waste your money
4,Product comes with good documentation to allow for easy installation. Some of the parts‚Äô quality would be borderline manageable and not necessarily excellent. We purchased it to do some YouTube and TikTok videos; it clearly accomplished those jobs as it makes the area bright enough for the videos. The pieces that hold the iPhone often become loose so you do have to re-adjust the iPhone to keep it from moving. Get the job done nevertheless.
4,Way smaller than what I thought it was going to be for the money. But it works great! Very bright!
5,I needed this light to film videos for my onlyfans. They say it‚Äôs always best to shoot in natural light and this does just that when I don‚Äôt have enough sunlight and there‚Äôs no harsh shadows .  The three settings are great and you can adjust the brightness of those individually as well ! The stand is taller than I imagined but I like that. I would definitely recommend and at the price it really can‚Äôt be beat .
5,I got this to use for my little YouTube and IG livestreams (40rtyPluss). It does ok. I set it to one side of the camera with the window on the other side. Not perfect but I plan to get a second one for the other side. I do like that it adjusts fairly well. Again it's a good deal for the price.
5,I really love this product! I was originally looking for a tripod to hold my phone for video conferences. The 3 light rings of brightness was an added bonus! It made my skin tone look amazing! Im sure there are plenty of apps and filters you could buy to create this look but you don‚Äôt need anything. It was simple to put together. Your provided with instructions and link to instructional video as well. My iPhone stays secured in with no worries it will fall and get damaged. Great price too!!
2,So the build quality of this is really cheap. Thin brittle plastic is used throughout this ring light if you want something that looks nice this isnt for you.The tripod on it is really flimsy but it works however not having a height adjustment makes it tricky to use. if you need it to be taller you can bring the tripod legs closer together but then it loses stability. Go wider to lower the height but then it takes up more desk space.The phone holder on this is 100% worthless. It uses a spring function to try to pinch the phone in place but I tried multiple times to use it with my phone (iphone 11) but it would not stay on the clip.The light itself works fine though. It has three color temperatures which is nice the little controller that is connected to the USB power cord works fine. The brightness is controllable and the highest setting is good but I think it should have a higher brightness overall. If the ring light is set more that 12" away from my face the drop off is significant so you cant set the light at the back of your desk which means it takes up a good deal of real estate.
5,I‚Äôve been using this for several months now and I like that it has different light colors as well as a brightness control. I like to look my best on camera and this Ring Light definitely makes me look better. It‚Äôs perfect for video conferencing which has become the norm in the new normal.It‚Äôs light enough in weight that you can put two of the three legs in the front of a laptop screen on each side of the camera eye and one leg in the back which is an excellent distance and Just the right amount of light.
4,I bought this for my 19 yr old daughter and she loves it. She also uses this to apply her makeup. It does illuminati very well. The tripod stand is a bit weird when trying to stand it up. But it's not a major issue. Overall a great product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is a straightforward simple to use ring light. If you are looking for a great ring light at a great price I highly recommend this. It was waaaay bigger than I thought it was going to be. It has three light settings. Two cool settings and one warm setting. My photos look phenomenal and my videos are great. If you need a light for streaming youtube or just to do your makeup. This is it.
2,The stand keep falling over. No matter how tight it was it still wasn‚Äôt sturdy
5,No issues. I received exactly as pictured.  If I could change anything it would be the stand/legs.  I didnt realize phone cant be attached upright (portrait) only landscape as seen in ad photo (i resolved this issue by putting phone seperately on another stand that can be rotated). You do not have the option to adjust how widely they spread out. They occupy a lot of space on my desk. Also I would of liked to adjust the height of the light. 5 stars because I received what I paid for (as described.)
5,Very well thought out design. Has a 1/4-20 tripod socket on the outer rim and a cold shoe sized slot on the inner rim. It came with a tripod with a ball head and a mini ball head that fits the inner shoe. So you could mount a small camera easily inside the ring. Or just shoot through the ring with your cell phone. It's USB powered has a cord with the controls for brightness and color built in. You need to provide a USB power supply.
5,It arrived quickly and packaged very well.  I use this on my desk and also in the Kitchen to use while I am videoing cooking episodes.  It's perfect for travel as well and it's so easy to set-up literally there is nothing you really need to do.  This would also be a great light to use while putting makeup on or working on something around the house where there is very low light. Great price as well I am very happy with this purchase. Thank you!

No matter what my room lighting is this product instantly brightens my face. It gives me the confidence I need to speak to my audience! Although it‚Äôs meant to be used with a phone I just face it towards me as I use Zoom on my laptop. If there are any teachers or bloggers interested in a product like this you should definitely get this one!
4,The ring light worked well was easy to set up and was a good value. The problem I had was it is like standing in front of a flood light for anything more than 3 feet away. it casts Huge shadows and stops creating the "2 light source" effect. In my situation i would be better off buying 2 cheap lights instead.
5,Love the versatility of the lighting choices - 3 color temps and 9(!) intensities. Just two very minor negatives for us: an AC adapter isn't included (it has a USB plug) and the height of the ring can't be adjusted. (The bottom of the ring is only about 6" above the surface the tripod is on.) But we bought it primarily for teleconferencing so we just plug the lamp into our PC. As for height we'll just put it on a box - low-tech solution.
5,Very happy with my purchase! After reading reviews I expected it to be good for the price; but I think good is an understatement! It is crazy bright and perfect lighting for doing your makeup. Me personally I don't need the phone attachment but I know some people said it doesn't stay in place however when testing it myself my phone stayed in place(I have an iPhone). My only concern is that half of the blue lights on the clicker don't work which isn't really a big deal but i'm just hoping it doesn't mean the whole product is faulty and might fail sooner than later. But other than that I love it! Highly recommend.
4,Tripod is a little flimsy and I feel is not sturdy. Other than that so far it works fine.
2,For two months it worked great. It had the light I needed and I was happy with it. Then one day it just didn't turn on anymore. So definitely not worth buying unfortunately. Stear clear unless you want to rebuy every 2 months.
4,Very flimsy. Lights are super bright and I love the options for adjusting them. The legs give me so much grief. I will be adding better rubber stoppers to them because they are worthless. Legs don't tighten in place so they move too easily.
4,Decent light for the price!No need to brake the bank. Super bright!My only complaint is that it would not hold a large phone. Not strong enough.Have to either get a separate phone mount or just use duct tape to hold it on in place.I have already found a way to use it effectively.Works like a charm.
5,This work perfect when set correctly and positioned correctly. üåüüåüüòÅüåüüåü
5,I was nervous that this product wasn‚Äôt going to be reliable but i was wrong! it‚Äôs super easy to set up the settings allow you to change the color of the lights as well as the brightness i am very happy with this purchase.
4,This is a light I use for meetings conducted online. It‚Äôs powerful but small. I simply positioned it while watching myself on my computer monitor to decide which light best suited me. It holds a smartphone but not a tablet. Requires power through USB-doesn‚Äôt use ac/dc directly. Worth the money certainly. Also unexpectedly fast delivery.
5,Bye self timer! I think it could be brighter but has a variety of diff light/height settings which have all been useful to me. Tipped it over and the plastic part covering the lights fell off but snapped back in place. I use it for videos pictures to apply makeup etc. Been using this since Jan it‚Äôs now may. Hasn‚Äôt failed me yet. Good for the coins!
2,Very wobbly..not sturdy.  The stand kept falling over.  Very disappointed.
5,I found this very useful at first for makeup. Since then I have disconnected the ringlight from the phone stand/tripod. Both my hands/wrists/arms are injured and so I find the tripod/phone stand handy all by itself!!!! The Ringlight hangs by itself near my makeup mirror. Win-win-win!! Wish the tripod stood taller but I bought this knowing its tripod stand was the length it is so no hate. This nifty gadget has improved my quality of life since my injury and proved itself more useful than ever intended.
4,I love this for doing tiktoc videos! It looks like I‚Äôm recording from a video camera such as canon. The only cons of this is the stick that comes with it. It has to be on the floor and it doesn‚Äôt stand up tall enough for me to do videos standing up. I have to position it on a coffee table or dresser.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I purchased this ringlight with tripod stand for my daughter because not only does she love to do selfies but she is starting to do live make-up videos as well.  She loves the lighting of this ring light!  She had another ring light but it was very unstable on the carpet this is very sturdy and stable on the carpet so she can sit in front of the mirror and record her videos!!  The height of the stand is perfect and it is adjustable.  The light brightness is adjustable and really helps with her videos.  We both highly recommend this product and the price was amazing.
4,The light is great brightness wise. Has to be plugged in to work. Sometimes hard to get to balance on the tripod legs because there isn‚Äôt a way to lock the leg placement. Overall I like this product though.
5,This product is amazing. The pictures and video quality made using the light are exceptional now I can make the content for Instagram and Youtube to be outstanding. Shipping was fast even during covid-19 situation. The ring light was nicely packed with every part in a separate bag. There was an instruction on how to assemble but I didn't even need it it took me about 5 mins to attach all the parts.Also the product description doesn't have a full list of the devices that fit and the range is wide enough to fit my iPhone 11 Pro Max and even wider.
3,It moves when it is holding my phone
5,I've seen these in many vlogging videos and loved how they made the person look. It works really well and the quality is good! I love how it helped bring my features out and showed my true eye color that my camera doesn't truly catch in darker environments. It's small enough to sit on a table or desk and is stable. It holds my new Samsung S21+ with room to spare. Definitely recommend!!
4,Lights are super bright - a little harsh and glaring to look at. But they do the job for the price. The stand is very weak - long skinny legs not very stable - takes up too much footprint.
3,I bought the product for behind my computer for video calls as I‚Äôm sure many others have as well. When fully extended it does not stand very well. The legs kept sliding. I ended up having to rig a system with a bottle and a lot of sand so that it would be the right height and stay put. I do like that it has 3 different light types and a brightness scale. Overall I would probably not buy it again for this purpose but it does the job with a little extra work on my part.
4,The stand is much smaller than I expected otherwise it's an OK purchase. I still need to purchase one that can fit on a large tripod stand. This won't fit the purpose. For now though I'm making use of it and it's fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This is my 1st Ring Light and and i was surprised to how nice and big the ring is üëç and the cute little trypod that it comes with loved tge 3 sets of lights and final I'm not to good putting things together but it was a very easy  setup and you can easily take it apart and take it with you when you travel it does not take much space.
4,Over it‚Äôs a good product to use for your sink or desk. The tri-pod legs are a bit weak but for the price you basically get what you pay for. The ring light would very well. Definitely recommend. The one thing I don‚Äôt really like about this product is the phone holder it‚Äôs hard to adjust to get the right angle. Other then that this product is very good
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I‚Äôm starting a new vlog so I wanted a bright light that lightened my face. This light literally did that! I highly recommend it to new bloggers or vloggers. The control helps you increase/lower the light's power. It also has 3 different light shades. The best part is it‚Äôs compact and VERY easy to set-up. Took me about 2 minutes to set it up after I took it out of the box. So if you love traveling as much as I do this would be the perfect size it‚Äôs basically as long as my monitor (check pic). It is a USB so it can basically connect to your laptops or desktops.
4,The actual light on this ring light works so well. I love using this while doing my makeup taking pictures or making tik toks. You can adjust the level of light also. The only down fall is the tripod does not stand up well once you attach your phone to it.
2,I use this product to take photographs of my makeup and art Instagram posts. When I purchased this in May 2020 it cost $50.99 - now in Jul 2020 it costs $26.99 which sounds like a much better deal for what your getting.First the tripod it comes with is rubbish. It barely supports the weight of the ring light and much less if you attach your phone to it. Prop it up then two seconds later it slips low. I have it propped on a Daiso ($3 but much better quality 3-ft tripod now).Then it's advertised as "chargeable" implying that it will work when not plugged into the wall. Not true - you must be plugged into the wall or a laptop. I tried plugging it into a portable charger for ease of movement but the battery did not last long.Lastly the phone grip works well for me but I dislike the attachments. I hoped to attach the ring light to the flash mount on my DSLR but unfortunately I don't have the piece I need.If the price goes up again to $50 do not waste your money. It's worth maybe $15.
4,It was very easy to put together because instructions were very clear. I know the light says 10‚Äù but I have to admit that I did expect it to be a bit larger lol. However the light does exactly what it says! Great lighting with a few diff modes  great grip on phone and very transportable.Read and review pictures carefully before buying
5,So I bought this light to use for school video classes and to video call and it works very well. The Pros of this unit are that a Metal tripod stand included so it is stride. The light has a plastic cover so it not an exposed bulb. It lights your face really well. The cons all have to do with the phone stand. It is a wired fit and I had to take my pop socket off and it was plastic holder. But overall all really good but and I am excited to continue using it.
4,Great light base needs to be more sturdy and if the ring was battery and cord it would be a five star.
5,I got this light to help take pictures of myself to track my pregnancy. With it‚Äôs adjustable features for height & phone position that was really easy to do. There are 3 light settings with brightness control to achieve the perfect light setting for any space you are using the ring light in. This light would be perfect for vlogging selfies full body images or just extra lighting in a room since it allows you to be hands free from your phone. It was easy to assemble with a clear instruction manual & I was able to use it as soon as I had it set up.
3,The ring light itself is decent I like the different warmth and brightness options it came in very secure packaging with easy to understand details. I only have two complaints1-the phone holder Only lets you place your phone horizontally2-the legs on the stand are an absolute nightmare. They just don‚Äôt stand up way too weak and flimsy for the weight of the light you have to brace the legs against something so the stand will stay upright. And any time you slightly touch or try to readjust the angle the whole thing topples over
5,This light it awesome! It has multiple light settings phone/camera holder.  I use it behind my laptop for all of the webinars I am on and it gives me the right kind of light for all times during the day and night.  I also like this light for makeup applications.
2,Flimsy and ineffective
4,Good lighting tone options. Great coverage and brightness. Disappointed that the neck does not telescope any. I need more height for the propped up laptop in my meetings. (I've not yet used it with my phone).
5,It‚Äôs really easy to use just plug it in in the box was instructions how to put together the stand.This is also not glass which I love. I dropped it and nothing happened so you don‚Äôt have to worry as much about it falling over.Good value ring light when I was looking at others that cost a lot more.This works well as a ring light for desk or for recordings. It puts out an even bright light.  Good for recordings even in really dark places.
3,The ring light itself is great! It had 3 modes and various levels of brightness and really does a great job. The tripod part of the light sucks. Its flimsy and doesn't stand up well. Isk if it's because I have a bigger phone (Galaxy Note 9) but it only really holds steady when it's set all the way down if I try to lift it up even just a little the little tripod feet go wonky wonky and slip back down. Which sucks because I specifically got this light because I thought I would be able to adjust the level of the tripod.
5,I loved that it was easy to put together has a durable design and it has multiple places for which to adjust the light. It came with clear assembly instructions with pictures. The phone holder was standard but could accommodate different types of phones in both orientations.The lighting comes in three types and 5 to 7 brightnesses. My videos and pictures are coming out great! Overall great product so far.
5,Great for pictures and video. The lighting is really good.

I HATE THE STAND THOUGH I WISH IT WAS TALLER :( BUT IT WORKED OUT. It looks even better and Clear with my bathroom light on now. But In the video I had the bathroom light off.
4,Even thought it is a great light.  We've had no problems with it it is true about the tripod stated on other reviews.  It's horrible!!! If you have another small tripod just use that
3,The light is nice no complaints there. The tripod is ridiculous hard to situate just right easy to bump and mess up the adjustment. Definitely made for table top use since the tripod cannot extend up.
5,So i have a Neewer ringlight but its been glitching now so i decided to buy this one as backup. Let me tell you the power it has !! I was shocked at how bright it was and the different color settings. The size was also super convenient you can carry it anywhere unlike some other bulky ringlights. I‚Äôm definitely going to be purchasing another one as a gift.
4,when u plug in the light unless you have the right charging box then it overheats and turns off after a short amount of time
4,To me the lights could have been brighter but I'm not mad. I got what I paid for because this met the budget I had at the time. It get's the job done.
4,This light is of pretty good quality but for this price I  was expecting a little more honestly. One of the legs came missing a rubber cover on the foot (so it wont stand up because it doesnt have enough stability. Other than that it is a very bright and good for photos or doing your makeup.
5,Item exquisite! The packaging was remarkably foxy. Remarkably speedy dispatch. Would buy from again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I ordered this LED ring light to take better selfies and videos and I was not expecting such a great product at a cheap price! I love that it has three different color temperature lights and that the brightness is great too! Really excited to start using this! If your in the market for a cheaper ring light try this one out!
4,So far so good! I finally look decent in my zoom-meetings-that-should've-been-emails. It flickers a liiiittle if I turn it up too much but it hasn't been an issue as I never have it on too bright.
1,Edit: This lasted a combined 2 months if that before the bulbs burnt out and it started flickering - during my meeting. I purchased another one that I found by googling higher rated inexpensive lights. It‚Äôs been reliable so far but it‚Äôs a different brand and its quality was much more durable and sturdy just upon opening the new one. Gave me something to compare this one too and I‚Äôm not surprised this one stopped working so soon now. Keep looking.***************Old Review Below***************I have to say I‚Äôm surprised at how much of a difference this made in my appearance for online meetings. I am currently doing distance teaching and the lighting is difficult in the space where my computer/desk is. I assembled this in less than a minute plugged it into my computer (USB) and voila‚ÄîI looked so much clearer! My middle school students (who are super honest btw lol) said ‚ÄúWow you look different today!‚Äù I told them it was because they could finally see me! Lol...It took away the shadows and dark tone to my appearance and makes for a more bright and inviting feel overall. I suppose for those making YouTube videos it also would make you look more attractive as similar to filters you can adjust lighting to make it more flattering to your face. Light has 3 (I believe) different tones and can be dimmed or brightened. Very easy to assemble. This is one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad I purchased this‚Äù buys. It‚Äôs made all the difference in my presentation at meetings and classes. I feel more confident now being on camera.
5,Great value for money. I've been using it for video-conferencing with great results. Very adjustable brightness settings. Takes power from USB source make sure you're using at least a 2.0 Amp / 10 Watt wall power supply (not a computer etc) or you will have overheating issues and possibly cause a short. Comes with a small table-top tripod. I use mine with the AmazonBasics Lightweight 60" tripod.
5,Really great and effective light for the price!!!  I'm happy with it!
3,The light is nice. But the part where I attach my phone is not very stable. My phone fell from it maaaany times. I tried it many different ways. Got help from several different people. Eventually guess what? Your phone pops out again. I regret that I got this one with the short legs also. Maybe next time I will get the taller tripod. It is hard to be stuck with ‚Äúyou have to be seated‚Äù situation. When you want to record standing up this is not ideal.
4,This camera quality is amazing.
4,Feels cheap half of the buttons are not back lit (see attached pic) which is why I‚Äôm deducting a star. Other than that it works great. I usually just hold it up manually and take a pic with my phone. I added some shots I took as reference. I‚Äôm a nail tech and this helps emphasize my pics.
4,Very easy to use and great light however the tripod is pretty weak and touchy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my heavier phone but the legs start to lower and spread.
5,This works well as a ring light for desk or close up recording.  It puts out an even bright light.It‚Äôs really easy to use plug it in but the box didn‚Äôt come with any instructions on how to put together the stand.  Perhaps it‚Äôs simple and I just missed it but it took me a long time of trial and error and looking at every angle of photo I could find to figure it out.This is also not glass which is good. I dropped it right away taking it out the box.  It‚Äôs plastic (I think) and durable so you don‚Äôt have to worry as much about it falling over.Good value ring light when I was looking at others that cost $99.
4,The product is nice and I had an issue with the stand that the seller promptly responded. She gave me part refund on my stand.  I just wish that the length of the stand is longer.
5,Well let me start off by saying this was purchased for my home studio  while filming product reviews and live streams. Purchased in January and just yesterday 03/08/2021 it finally broke.  For the price yeah Ill buy another one but not from the same seller or brand. I expexted at lease six months of use for a home studio.
4,The lighting is great but it is not very sturdy. I also could only put my phone in horizontally instead of vertically. I will most likely be looking to replace soon just due to it not being sturdy and falls a lot when I put my phone in. But the lighting is great if you just need that!
5,Love it
5,I got this deal during Amazon days and paid less than $20.This little tripod is better suited for your desk as the tripod does not extend. It gives off different lighting as well as the possibility to dim or brighten the ring. Easy to set up and put to work. Works with any USB shaped port (charger computer backup etc.)Definitely pleasantly surprised. I recommend for pictures Zoom calls and vlogging.
5,This was a great buy for the money. If you have a pop socket or a thick protector on your phone it may not hold your phone securely. I like how the lighting can be adjusted to a softer light and it takes all shadows off your face when you are zooming with someone.
5,Hello. Product arrived quickly Fast and easy to assemble and setup  This ring light is a great product for beginnersEasy to adjust the light colors to suit what you need for shooting  Light have brightness levels and easy to adjust from remote.  Overall great dial.Now about quality   lighting rig itself is plastic but if feels ok.  Stand is full metal and really nice and heavy. there you can feel quality and also fittings are nice and strong.
4,The product is fine except that the legs are sooo unsteady!!  Thank goodness I bought a separate phone holder otherwise any time I‚Äôd even lightly touch the phone (if I attached it to the ring light instead) I‚Äôm sure it would keep falling over.  And also it would be helpful if the cord was longer.
4,I‚Äôm using this product for Zoom meetings. My only complaint is that it creates a glare on my glasses so that is more of in issue with my glasses than the product.  It isn‚Äôt incredibly stable but sufficient for what I need it for.
4,Very portable and easy to use. Comes with adjustable settings that can be used to take a wide variety of pictures in different lightings. Perfect for looking good on zoom calls and making Tik Toks.
4,I bought this because it was $15. It works but it feels like it should be about $5.Entire product feels cheap almost brittle.Again it works as I need but it just feels meh.
4,I'm a beginner Youtuber. So I needed something to illuminate my face for video shots. It does that great. The legs on it are not very solid. Dont get me wrong they stand up just fine. I just would expect something a little more solid underneath the light than three very thin legs. Other than that its great.
5,light was exactly what was pictured. Works great
3,I wanted to love this so badly and at first I did. The lights on this is amazing and helped facilitate me taking some beautiful photos. I used it consistently for 5 days and by the 5th day the legs kept giving out and sliding from under itself. Due to this I lost great content which made me throw in the towel in this one. It‚Äôs great for super light use but don‚Äôt even try to get it to twist and turn. The whole thing comes crashing down.I wish I could recommend this product but I just can‚Äôt. Spend a little more on something more sturdy
3,The light kinda flickers sometimes after having it on for a while it just shuts off but just un plug it for 1 min then plug it back and it should be fine other then that the light is great
4,Love it  wish it came with a big stand instead of the table top one but it still shines bright. It also did not come with an adapter piece so if you don‚Äôt have one handy i suggest you get one lol
5,I was looking for a simple ring light for working from home...I spend multiple hours a day in VC meetings. This is a great light for the price and does exactly what I need it to. You can combine the attachments together in different ways that allows for more bend/height/flexibility. The tripod isn't the best and will require a bit of maneuvering but overall I have been very pleased with the light.
4,The brightness settings is great gives you enough light. On the other hand the tripod stand is way too short so I switched it for a taller one.
3,Plug got hot and was not as bright as it look in the picture.
4,Not for sure the item was not a return. It came already put together and I'm an open box. (Not even inside an Amazon box...) But works fine.  I use for Facebook live and make-up tutorials. It is my first ring light so I have nothing to compare it to. Very bright multiple settings. The phone holder is not very sturdy but it serves its purpose.
4,Great item other than the tripod isn't very stable. I have to manipulate it just right to get it to stand without falling. One bump & it drops.
3,I bought this in hopes of using it to create videos on me making my products but when I try to angle it at a 90 degree it keeps falling over and there is just not enough support at all to do this. The lighting is great and this is only useful if you're only using it upright. The tripod's feet are also incredibly slippery so i couldn't get it to stand properly I ended up just holding the light with my hand to take my product photos.
2,This ring light worked well; however it burned out after about 10 months of use. I probably used it about for 10-15 hours per week.
3,The light itself is great. I can take off the phone holder and screw in my canon g7x camera which is great. The tripod itself is terrible though. The legs slide out so what I did was I just attached the light to the big tripod that I already owned.I like that there's a bunch of light temperatures and brightness levels. It's pretty bright. Very happy about that!I've used it a lot since I got it about a month ago and I highly recommend it for people who like to create content for social media. It makes a big difference having a good light source in the quality of your photos and videos!
4,everything about it is pretty good. The bluetooth button was missing though. Other than that the device works as advertised and the shipment and handling were excellent. T
5,I've had this product for a few months now and i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! The light is super bright and I have yet to have any problems. Very portable as well as it basically comes apart into pieces if need be. The price is not too good to be true it really is that good! my only wish was that it was portable but you could always plug the adapter into a portable charger to do so.
4,i didn't like that I can't set up the phone on the tripod vertically and that it didn't come with a case to put it in for travel. But than that its good
4,Very good for photos. Makes every photo look professional. Easiest set up. Easy to put phone in and out. Once I desembled it I never could put it back together. Also I was trying to adjust the angle of the camera and now the bearing is loose. Overall a very good product
3,I bought this to make videos with my iphone and it works ok but difficult to use.I like that there are 4 different light settings.The tripod legs always move around so its hard to get it stable- so you can't really adjust the legs.My phone has an otter box case and that seems to be too heavy. I feel like I often have to stop & tighten the knobs because they become loose & the camera starts to slouch and things move around.
3,It falls everytime I attach my iPhone it‚Äôs too heavy for the tripod
4,The Tripod legs are not sturdy At all. The LED light is bright.  The piece that holds the phone is a little annoying because you have to adjust the phone a certain way In order  for You to take a picture.
2,I got two and both striped and got weak and weaker when you move it or turn it a lot.
5,This was really easy to assemble and set up. There are multiple colored lights and brightnesses. I was surprised at how bright it went really bright! You can adjust the phone holder for a different camera angle long ways or upright.  I‚Äôve been looking for the perfect ring light for posting videos on my social media and this is it! Very fast delivery!
2,Just as the title says the stand is a nightmare and it‚Äôs so hard to get it to stand up just how you want it. If anyone remembers connecting ‚Äúrabbit ears‚Äù to their tvs those rabbit ears are what the legs are on this. Super thin and flimsy. I don‚Äôt recommend.
3,I was really excited for this ring light as I am working from home now and on Zoom calls most of the day. The light itself is great its easy to assemble sturdy on the desk etc. However its stuck on a very bright cold light. The switch which is supposed to toggle to warm light doesn't work and instead shuts the light off. I probably wont use this at all with that defect. I have reached out to the sellers customer support and am hoping they will replace for a functioning light. Will update review when I get a response.
4,This ring light works great and provides sufficient natural light in poorly lit areas. Only complaint is that the ring light doesn‚Äôt ever turn off completely if plugged in. In the OFF state the ring remains dimly lit like a night light.
5,exactly as described . Good product
3,I love this ring light. The lighting is wonderful and it‚Äôs perfect for YouTube videos. The only thing I do not like about this is the legs are so slippery. Every time I try to put my phone in the tripod it constantly falls. it‚Äôs so annoying. But other than that it‚Äôs great. It just takes a lot of patience.Edit. My patience has run out. LOL. I don‚Äôt like this as much as I did at first. it‚Äôs constantly falling and the tripod part finally broke off. The cord is way too short to. Do not like this anymore.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Very bright and nice colors. I like that both the ring light and the phone holder can be moved and that the phone can be held both up right and side ways. Decently long cord does not come with wall plug only a USB plug in. Metal legs can be moved to different positions
5,Lights are bright and the light is sturdy. Perfect for a small space. Definitely recommend!
5,It is a great product especially if you have a great camera on your phone. It really gave our pictures a portrait quality look.  Side bar( My husband has an S Pen so we were able to pose without a timer.) Using a background and this cute little invention we had a whole studio shoot for $20...well worth it!
4,When I received this in I was over the moon. However I thought I was going to have to return it because the warm light would not work. And I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to that headache. Thank God I have a handy husband. He looked at it and took it apart to look at the led‚Äôs and there was a disconnected wire. Now it works wonderfully :)
5,This ring light is perfect. It‚Äôs easy to set up and use as well. I love the different light settings. It allows you to create any kind of mood you‚Äôre looking for. Plus you can brighten or lower the light in each color setting to get just the mood you need. It‚Äôs light but sturdy so easy to travel with as well.
5,This ring light is everything it say it is in the description! It is very easy to put together and use. I have been looking for a great ring light for awhile and I am so happy I came across this one. It will really take my content to the next level. I recommend buying this! Great quality and a great price!
3,The ring light itself is very bright and I like the warm/cool color options. However the tripod is incredibly unstable which results in unexpected shifts during use and makes it very cumbersome to set up and reposition. The phone holder can only hold your phone in the landscape position - which of course is best for most type of videos.  If you need to film yourself working with your hands the portrait position is a must and this product can't accommodate that.
3,The tripod stand is worthless. It moves and wobbles all the time. The bolts that hold the light in place move all the time. I am not happy with the set up for the stand whatsoever. What I am happy with is the amount of light that this puts out. I should have paid more for a sturdier stand. I end up having to hold it every single time and put my camera through the opening in the ring to take pictures. It‚Äôs not ideal but I am past the return. Period
4,I bought this to help illuminate my work station while teaching virtually. The size is great and the tripod is easy to use. The different lighting settings are perfect. The only downside is that it only holds your phone horizontally not vertically.
5,It was a gift for someone
3,It‚Äôs a really nice light but it‚Äôs been two weeks and the legs are wobbling. It does not stand up straight anymore.
5,I use this camera because I have windows in my background makes it seem like I have a dark face. This camera is amazing for white light a natural orange light and a mix of both (which I use often). I use this light daily. Yes the tripod is kinda flimsy so you might have to get yourself a good tripod but the light itself is definitely worth it!
5,I had been thinking about getting a more expensive and more professional ring like when I came across this in my recommendations. I mainly just wanted something to make me look a little better while I am video chatting with clients and then possibly use it for a little bit of photography. I haven‚Äôt used it for photography yet but it works perfectly for just making yourself look better for video chat or social media videos.  For as cheap as it was it‚Äôs quite an amazing little late. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The unit has multiple parts but they are fairly easy to setup system is well built the stand is firm it‚Äôs a breeze to adjust different positions and angle the ring has 120 led pieces it gives plenty of light good to travel with corded controller is easy to handle phone holder works for different units. It makes a big difference when taking pictures or videos with it. Is easy for me use the ring light with power bank. The unit need to be connected to USB port. This item helps me a lot in my daily videos for social media.
3,Light is great and east to change modes with the clicker but when you add your iPhone (I have a 10) it causes the stand tri pod legs to move and it slowly falls down. It also tilts because I guess the phone is too heavy. Light is great as a stand alone item but not great with the newer iPhones Inside the ring light. When I use the fasteners to tighten everything it still slowly slides down or topples over so I have to just prop my phone near it unfortunately.
5,Great for zoom meetings.
3,I only needed some targeted light for all these darn Zoon Meetings ;oX. So for me this is good enough. The little tripod legs don't lock. So this means they can get 'splayed' out. The other thing to note is that it doesn't have the ability to telegraph taller. So when needed I stick it on a set a books. But hey for the casual person who's just trying to not look like they live in a cave this device is perfect.
4,I love this product! The light is very bright and I like the option of 3 different light warmth settings with dimming options. I only feel like I have to give 4 stars because this item was delivered in its own box without any tape holding the box closed so it easily could have been damaged during the delivery process.
5,Great ring light. I love that it fits my big phone in there and I can turn it to be landscape or portrait view.I also like the different lighting options as we don't always need a super bright light for the videos and photos we do.Perfect for makeup application views and photos!!
4,Not to impressed works then doesn't
3,The tripod is stable only at one height which is not quite 3" off the table.  Not high enough to position it above your laptop screen if you are using Zoom on your computer. You can change the light intensity but the temperature is limited to cold warm and half-and-half. No fine tuning of color temperature. For $20 it is not a bad buy.
2,This item is extremely bright. There wasn't any instructions in the box so trying to figure all the functions right impossible. On top of that my phone doesn't even fit in the phone holder. Last I knew this was supposed to have a conversion plug to be able to plug this anywhere in the house. I can only plug it in via my cable box. The assembly of the item pretty easy considering the instructions for that. Where are the instructions for being able to change brightness etc on the different modes?? I wish I never ordered this. You get what you pay for I should have ordered a more expensive one. The plastic housing on this item is so cheaply made. Bottom line is I got ripped off. Note to self.... cheaper isn't always better.
4,Offers adequate lighting. Had to use the instructions and still working out angles of the phone. However worth it. No more looking for good lighting.
5,I am a personal trainer who just converted to online training. I made this purchase so I can record and have lighting in my room while I do daily boot camps. I love the brightness of the lights and that it changes color. My 16 year old set it up for me and now my 23 year old wants one as well. I‚Äôm glad I made this purchase. Will be buying again!
5,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Of course what teen wouldn't love to add perfect lighting to their selfies! She asked for this but had I come across it on my own I would have snagged it in an instant knowing it would make a good gift for her. No issues with the phone holder or light.
5,The light itself is nicely sized especially given the price. The light options are great and bright. It really helped me do my Halloween makeup in my poorly lit bathroom! :)I do wish the tripod extended longer but it is great for countertop/desktop use. I use it mostly for teaching my online classes so my face and props are well-lit.
1,I bought this for work calls and it stopped working after maybe a month. For starters the whole thing is made of a cheap plastic and after a month the light stopped working altogether. There seems to be a loose wire the light will start flickering when it's plugged in and sometimes it won't turn on at all. I'll spend a bunch of time juggling the wire and the light will turn on just for a bit and then will turn off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.
4,I can‚Äôt take photos or videos without this ring light it is that good! Very bright and you can change the settings
4,Really great and clever tool for videos and photos but the phone clip doesn‚Äôt adjust large enough to fit my phone (iPhone 12 Max Pro) without it getting stuck.
5,I wanted a ring light to ensure I looked professional during work calls and interviews.  This ring light is super affordable and definitely met my needs.  It makes the lighting look perfect especially since it's nearly impossible to achieve perfect lighting even in a well lit room.  Would highly recommend!
5,This is a great ring light and really makes a difference on virtual calls. I purchased it during a lightening deal and it is well worth it. The remote makes it so easy to change between the different light options with the ability to dim each. I haven‚Äôt used the cell-phone holder yet but it‚Äôs a nice feature to have. Easy to assemble right out of the box.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Doesn‚Äôt stand up as you can see in the video. Even though I tighten the screw it does nothing!! The lighting is great but the structure sucks!!!
4,The ring light itself is pretty good with all the different brightness but the legs are weak and can barely support the ring light with my phone on it.
4,Nice little set up. It sits on my vanity. Very easy to put together. When I got my package I was missing a part. I emailed the shipper and they gladly sent me another one free and I didn‚Äôt have to send the original one back. It came within a day or so.
4,I use this for Facebook lives and pictures for makeup. It‚Äôs not the greatest as I think it could be brighter but with other lights it does a great job.
4,This light has many adjustments and is just the right size for doing Facebook LIVES.
3,This product is pretty cheaply made. The light is very bright and works great for what I need however the tripod stand and the phone clip are awful. The phone clip constantly moves around no matter how tight I try to secure it. The tripod only works in one position and the base is so wide that it takes up a lot of space on my desk
5,this is a virtual world zoom session must have when you need to be camera ready.  Different functions provide just the right lighting to create a quality zoom experience and help the viewers feel connected.  My daughter loves it for all her Tik Tok video productions.  Easy light weight and bright
5,Update: Customer service contacted me and have completely fixed the issue. I‚Äôm so happy with the way they handled this and how much they care about their customers!**********It‚Äôs not stable at all!! The light comes with three flimsy legs that are supposed to hold the light up. I waste so much time trying to balance the light as to not disturb the legs and knock everything over. I use this light for work and it‚Äôs fallen over more than once. There are better quality lights available.
5,I bought this for recording while working! The size is perfect it‚Äôs super compact and the phone holder can adjust to fit all all phones. It will be perfect for recording videos in a small space and gives great added light! There are multiple light settings for different looks too. It comes apart easy too back in the box for organized storage.
5,I needed more light for conference calls on my computer. This works great to fill in the light I need without having multiple lights on. It also comes with a clip on for my phone or I can screw in a camera mount. I like that it has 3 light colors and the ability to change the brightness. I placed this on a camera tripod I already had and it's cheaper than buying one with a tripod.
4,This is so easy to put together! And soooo bright. You can turn the brightness up and down. When it‚Äôs all the way up it‚Äôs blinding. Very good for its price.
5,I love everything about this selfie light.  I purchased this 6 months ago for teaching online.  It has three settings and a dimmer.  One bright light one soft light and one of both.  Adjustable tripod with remote for dimness.  HIGHLY recommend.  Great price!
4,I like the brightness and different tones. I think the tripod and connections could be sturdier
3,I like this.  It really works.  But the tripod is annoying. Wish it was sturdier. As long as the legs are spread flat and wide it‚Äôs fine.  But at times for angles we need the tripod to stand tall and it falls.  So I prop the tripod on boxes or books etc. But I love the product.  Use it for my zoom meetings.
5,For the price of this ring light I highly recommend it.  You get 3 different settings along with brightness control.  I've used this almost everyday since I bought it just because it's a great product.  It comes with a phone holster so you can take pictures/videos within the ring light and it works great for streaming lighting.
4,I would give this light a 5 star review if it had rechargeable batteries. As is it must remain plugged in. This is a rather large inconvenience for anyone wanting to be more mobile in their video making
3,This contraption works but is extremely fragile and flimsy.  Storing it back in the box has issues too.  It tends to flop around due to a ball pivot on the ring and is hard to tighten securely.  I‚Äôve had several instances of the clip in the center of the ring dropping my phone as I was repositioning the light.  One time the drop shattered the screen on my phone and I had to have it replaced.  Ugh.
5,In the age of quarantine and endless Zoom calls I never have to worry about lighting at any time of day and in any room with this ring light (assuming you want to be seen).  It's easy to use and set up and with the conveniently adjustable lighting I find that it's also easy to ensure the most flattering lighting on any Zoom call or with any photos.  Worth the price!
4,It‚Äôs good enough if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money but it‚Äôs pretty flimsy. The feet of the stand don‚Äôt stay put too well and there is no way to tighten them ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4,I like the color settings and the ease of use. Works great for my online business photos. I do not like the tripod. The legs move around to easily and do not lock. The ring light can be tilted and locked into position to get the light where you need it.
3,So far I like the quality of the lighting but hate the sturdiness of the phone holder. The way the phone holder fits onto the light it‚Äôs very easy to slide back out or drop your phone as tightening the piece does not hold it so good. Also you get what you pay for so you have to be very gentle with handling the light because I can tell it‚Äôs not made of sturdy materials. Overall if your looking for a quick cheaper ring light the quality of the light is great.
5,This was a surprise gift for one of my older daughters. She is into making videos and kept asking about a stand for her phone. She was squealing when she saw it. She opened it right up and set it up on her own. She showed how the lights change different colors and the brightness changes. She showed me videos with and without the light and I have to say you can really tell the difference.
5,As mentioned in the title it‚Äôs awesome lighting. My room is poorly lit so when I do makeup it‚Äôs hard to see! This brightens up the space. I also now use it as extra lighting for zoom meetings! It even looks kind of neat just as a lamp.
2,Overall the light works well and the features such as 3 different types of lighting and dimming are handy.The construction is awkward and clumsy. The Phone holder is very narrow so any case you have on the phone will make it feel like the phone will fall out. The legs have no resistance to them so unless you have them completely splayed out they will not hold. In this position the camera is very low so have a high surface area to put the light or sit on the ground. Save time and money get one of the adjustable octopus-type tripods or a higher-end one.
5,This light and stand is amazing!
4,It‚Äôs great for the price. Only bad thing I‚Äôve found so far is that the tripod legs are super flimsy.  Takes forever to get them to stop moving
3,I like the different light settings and the brightness levels this offers. However I do feel like it is a little flimsy. My iPhone makes the phone holder tip to the side even though the piece is secured. I only use it for meetings/calls that require video and I can manage if I am able to get my phone to balance properly on the ring light but I would not recommend if you are using this for photoshoot purposes.
5,The best ring light
3,Plenty bright but I wound up with an extra part and a wobbly base. The instructions weren‚Äôt written for someone like me. Actually there were no instructions. So it went together pretty easily without instructions but it‚Äôs just not steady and I‚Äôm pretty sure it has to do with the extra piece. Otherwise it‚Äôs great and a great price.
4,I use this for conference calls and it‚Äôs been great for that. Small enough to be mostly out of the way but large enough to do a good job overall. I love the usb power feature!
5,This product is fabulous. It is bright and worked great for my pictures. It was great in adjusting for the angles that I needed. I would recommend every time.
3,The inner circle of the light keeps going off. When I first turn it on the light is perfect after a minute the inner line of bulbs just goes out.
4,I love my ring light! It‚Äôs so portable!Only issue I have is that it never stays up properly the legs are very unstable and weaker than I would imagine also the phone holder comes off very easy even if it it screwed it. But other than that I love it so much.
4,The ring light is great. The stand not so much.
5,Very nice light. Very bright at full brightness. Controls for brightness and warmth work as they should.
5,Light weight easy to assemble and takes photos to the next level . Love various light modes!
5,I'm LOVING this light. I bought it because I work late and needed more light to take pictures for my eBay business. It's absolutely PERFECT! I love how you can change the filter color by the click of a button. My old ring light you had to change out the whole plastic cover. I also like that you can dim the lighting with a click of a button. The packaging is awesome because I can easily put it away in it's own box that was a plus. Great purchase.
3,Bought this for makeup and selfies. The light itself is awesome but all of the parts are cheap plastic. What is more is that this plastic can't properly handle the weight of a phone. Once I put my phone on there the stand collapses. Its really annoying and I get so frustrated. For references all I have on my phone is a simple plastic case which adds next to nothing in weight. May be you should look somewhere else that can support the phone.
3,This ring light has a stunning brightness however I had trouble assembling an important piece and the phone would just not stay in place. Also I felt like the pieces could break easily since they aren‚Äôt made out of the best strong material. Unfortunately I had to return it.
4,This is decent. It does not stand up very well at all. It kept sliding and leaning over which was annoying. The light quality is great.
4,I love the lighting and the overall product! The piece that is made to hold a cellphone is a joke! Super small so it won't fit. I would buy this again but you will need to hold the camera in your hand.
4,It does its thing not very steady
2,The light does turn on and off but they brightness controls change nothing and the cold light is just an off switch. Nothing else happens. Will be returning it.
3,I got this to use for FB lives and Instagram videos which apparently you can only film vertically now. The phone holder will only hold the phone horizontally. I seriously just recorded a 20min. live before someone told me I was sideways. Ha!  Additionally the tripod is not robust enough to stand up tall the legs keep slipping. The ring light itself is GREAT and I'm hoping that there is some solution that the seller can help me with if not I'm going to return and purchase something more expensive.
4,Old folks dealing with lighting problems when on Zoom.  This product was easy to install and came through for us.
5,I do a lot of Skype video conferencing for work and I needed a good white light for lighting. I found this one to be just perfect because it‚Äôs not too bright and gets the job done. I‚Äôm never lacking good lighting in my conferences any more and my videos come out clear. Good product overall. I also like that it has multiple brightness settings and also the stand is pretty solid. I normally don‚Äôt use the phone clamp I just use the light.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This ring light is great and compact! It has three temperature light settings to create the look you want for your photo. It does its job and is a good little ring light for the price. Would be good for taking product pictures or selfies or using for makeup. Satisfied with my purchase!
3,The functionality of the light itself is nice. The clip doesn‚Äôt fit my phone - especially if the phone case is on. When I use a different clip that does fit my phone it doesn‚Äôt fit properly in the ring. Then it toppled over due ti uneven distribution of weight. Not a fan of ball bearings because I have had them wear out and/or break with other things. Overall it is a decent light. It would be better if it had a clip that fit larger phones.
3,This works as instructed and the lighting options are nice. However I intended to use this ring light to take flat lay photos and the light itself along with my camera are to heavy. The ring light kept falling over and the three legs were not very sturdy. This ring light may work well with for you if your are only positioning it up-right. Side note my phone is the iPhone 11 Pro Max but truly it is not that heavy of a phone.
3,After giving this a fair try. We ended up sending it back. In my opinion it‚Äôs not very bright. It‚Äôs very wobbly and cheaply made. The tripod stand is useless. It doesn‚Äôt even hold the light let alone the light and a phone. I found one that I really liked and I also reviewed it. But I won‚Äôt mention it on here pier
4,Light was great tripod is practically useless can not really support light and iPhone together
2,I thought this light would be perfect for teaching from home since it plugs right into my computer. The USB made a terrible connection. if any to my computer. every time I tried to turn on the light with the switch it would flash on then off. I tried it multiple times switched USB outlets etc. but it only fully turned on then continued to flicker on and off every time I tried to turn it back on.The legs are not able to be fixed in a standing position so once you set them if it is bumped or touched slightly it moves or falls. The legs should be able to be fixed at different heights depending on your needs but I couldn't find a way to do so.For the price this ring light should at least work let alone be able to stand actually function. Terrible product returned it to find a better working one.
5,I enjoy how compact this is so when I‚Äôm not using it for makeup or making TikToks it easily fits in my countertop basket in my bathroom. The adjustable brightness and color selection is also great. My only issue- and admittedly it‚Äôs probably user error- is that sometimes it falls due to being too top heavy when my phone is attached.
4,So I was very excited to get this in but when it came it was missing a much needed piece. Currently waiting to see how this gets resolved. Will edit once I have more info.***UPDATE***Brought this up in stars because they sent a replacement ASAP and guess what? It had all the parts!!!  WOO!
4,The price for the product is great; however be careful with the stand.  It's not tall at all and it's difficult to balance the halo light on it.  Holding the light may produce shadows in your pictures so a taller more stable base would be nice but for the price I'll deal with it.
2,No-name 10 inch dimmable two-tone ringlight with short desktop stand and phone camera holder at a very low price. Worked great at first. Make sure to buy a higher capacity USB transformer if you use this on mainline power (I used an 18 watt). Thinking LEDs have a long life I used this light for several hours daily for desktop illumination when not using it as a front light for videocasting. After six months the ringlight failed to brighten and stayed at lowest level. The following day it failed to light at all. Suspect the cheap controller built into the USB cable.
3,Compared to what I had (which wad a lamp and a ceiling light in a dark room) this light is sufficient for what I needed. I like the size and the color options and the setup wasn't difficult. The main issue I have is with the phone holding component. When you set it up so that your phone is in the middle of the light the tightened area doesn't take much movement before it loosens and your phone falls to the floor.  Luckily my phone is super durable (one of the reasons I picked it).
3,This thing is bright and I love the lighting options but the stand is trash and a pain in the ass. The light is way too heavy for the stand. It falls more than it‚Äôs worth. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again
5,If you‚Äôre into makeup or just good lighting picturesthen this is it. Buy it!! Not only cause this is a really good price but also its so easy to use and easy to put together. It took me like 10 minutes.  I use to have one of the floor/big ones but my sons broke it when playingthats why i think this one is much better.
5,A lovely light. Meets my needs so that I don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm sitting in a cave during web conferences. The phone holder is not terribly helpful as there‚Äôs no way to adjust the width but it serves to prop up the phone sufficiently if not securely. I had not smiled in months before receiving this light. Now I have hope!
5,At first I was hesitant on purchasing this light.. but after receiving it I‚Äôm wicked impressed! The brightness is perfect and everything about it is awesome! I‚Äôm definitely happy!
4,Small but sturdy durable and lightweight. Light has 3 color settings. Dimmable and super bright.
3,I don‚Äôt understand why the review is asking for questions that depends on the phone you have and not on the light or the product itself. The tr√≠pode falls down specially if you have a big phone. The power cord is uncomfortable. With all the advance right now it should work on batteries in order to avoid the cable which must of the time makes the ring falls down with your phone. If talking about the light itself is bright and confy to the eye.
5,Have multiple Zoom meetings as well as virtual videos to do and this ring light came in perfect. I don't have a lot of space or light in my small apartment and this portable ring light was perfect. Easy to set up with brightness levels as well as cool-warm settings. So far works great!
4,The ring light works perfectly I am able to shoot better quality videos the only downside is that it‚Äôs a bit flimsy but for the price and as a starter video maker I‚Äôd recommend it!
4,The only issue I have is the tripod is very flimsy the legs  literally have to be that far apart for them to hold up the ring. And I don‚Äôt have that much vanity space.
5,Bought this since I am working from home and do a lot of video calls. My office has poor lighting at night and this has been great for end of the day meetings. You can adjust the color of the light and brightness so it doesn't blind you. Great buy!
4,Set screw did not hold ball joint securely. Vendor quickly responded with a solution.
3,It doesn‚Äôt firmly hold the phone. It is a great piece to enhance the light for recording or video chat but you will have to have the phone place on some place else. After 3 times it didn‚Äôt hold it anymore and I am very frustrated. It is all plastic and very unstable so I would recommend maybe a more expensive but more reliable product. Don‚Äôt waist your money on this if you have a big project.
4,I love the brightness of this light. However I am having a difficult time getting the pan-tilt and Mobile clip to stay connected to the mount. Even when tightened it easily comes out. That‚Äôs pretty much my only issue.
5,I use it on my desk for Webinars and Zoom calls. It has lasted several months and is a great buy compared to other brands. I love the multiple lighting options and the ability to dim. It is a great size and works perfectly for all my needs.
1,This was great for the 3 times I used it until one day it just wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I tried multiple occasions and it still doesn‚Äôt work. Disappointing for sure
5,This is perfect for my zoom meetings no more dark shadows on my video calls. The quality of the product is really good. The only downside is that since it‚Äôs short it Hides behind my laptop the lights doesn‚Äôt hit perfectly. But if you love it to the side the light is perfect.
5,This was the perfect device for my zoom meetings. Very easy to setup and adjust the light for my desk/zoom setting. Haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to use some of the other accessories but they are all high quality and a great value
5,This 10‚Äù tripod works great you can move your phone horizontally and vertically. Also I love the ability to record from the top towards the bottom; great when you are doing DIY‚Äôs. The light is amazing you can increase it and decrease it with the control. I am loving this tripod.
4,The light itself is good in my opinion I mainly wanted it because of the phone stand. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt hold my phone very well I have an iPhone XR and it can‚Äôt hold it up properly.
4,Very good product! I love it  the only thing is it turns off when it gets hot but other than that it‚Äôs an AWESOME product & when I take my pictures now they come out great !
4,This makes seeing myself on calls a bit more bearable!
5,Omg I love it lol I didn‚Äôt know it would be so cute and the 3 different light settings is Cool Af. Great for youtubers personally that‚Äôs why I Got it. It‚Äôs So convenient not too big you can take it anywhere and can literally use your phone charger Outlet to turn it on. I would def Recommend This!!!
3,I used this just because I got it at discount. It sucks.I phones are thin but actually heavy too heavy for the stand. The legs will keep spreading out because of the weight. And the light seem bright but when I use my camera the light seems the same. The stand is a desk stand it is so short very annoying.
5,Love it! Easy to assemble. You can dim the light and brighten the light.  The phone phone holder is adjustable.  It comes complete with a tripod.  Attach a cube to the USB and it can be plugged into an outlet.  I used it as soon as I got it and I can really see a difference when taking pictures .  I‚Äôm glad I made the purchase.
3,This ring light is alright. It does the job it needs to but all of the adjustment tighteners don't get tight enough so a lot of the time the phone and entire ring light falls over. Also the attachment that holds the phone and then connects to the ring light doesn't actually screw on you just slip it in and so it falls off all the time. I mean it does the job just don't touch it while you are using it.
5,I bought this product to use in place of using a photo booth company for an event I'm hosting. It was very easy to set up; I watched the video under the reviews and it was helpful. I was able to fit my iPhone X in the holder. All I had to do was set the self-timer for "photo booth" photos and it worked great! We have also used it as a tripod to take family pictures.
4,The lighting is very good but the base is a bit flimsy. For the price a steal for a travel ring light
5,The ring light actually is amazing. I used it to test out and it works best when its dark extra light in the room doesn‚Äôt really do it justice. The setting go up high enough to light up your entire face. I am excited to start my YouTube channel and I believe this will help. I would suggest it to anyone.
3,This is just ok very frustrating that the tri pod legs won‚Äôt hold a position. I have to put a thick rubber band around them to TRY and hold them in position but that doesn‚Äôt work when I mount my phone because of the weight. I would buy a different one if I had to do it all over again. Also the first one I ordered was missing the face plate on the switch.
5,Easy to set up with color and brightness options.
5,I purchased this ring light specifically to shoot videos for YouTube.  For starters the set up was a total breeze (wasn't the case for others I've tried in the past).  I love the it collapses almost flat for storage - huge plus of this item.  The light is also very very bright and has multiple dimmable settings making it perfect for use with variety of lighting situations in my home. All around I am highly satisfied with this product and definitely recommend it.
4,This light is very bright even at it's lowest setting great for video calls.
4,The light ring works great but the legs on the tripod are super wobbly and the part that hold the phone often times falls over.
4,Lighting is great.  THe other parts are cheap.  The rubber pieces that hold the phone in place came off on the first use.  everything else is pretty wobbly.
4,Cute light easy setup not that bright to me it‚Äôs so so I‚Äôm a makeup artist and good lighting for me is everything only 4 stars for me.
5,Got me looking photoshoot fabulous and then some in the lighting. Great purchase for videos or pictures. I'm fellin myself..I'm feeling myself yep!
4,I love it! I‚Äôm a hair dresser so I bought it for hair pics and it‚Äôs great! Fits perfectly on my station and I love using it for pics
5,I wasn't sure about getting a ring light so I opted for this lower end option. It was super cheap and that's evident in how wobbly it can get - but it's easily fixable by just adjusting screws/legs. Overall though the adjustable light is amazing and it has upgraded my morning makeup routine. I'd recommend this. I just wish the base was more stable and longer.
3,The piece that holds phone to ring didn‚Äôt exactly tightened the way it should leaving the phone wobbly I gave away to my nieces
4,Soooo still works but the piece under the phone mount that turns already broke . And the stand doesn‚Äôt stand well on its own  keeps sliding no matter how I position or what surface. Still nice
4,Overall very happy with this ring light.  Easy to assemble.  Has 3 light settings.  Only improvement I‚Äôd make is that the phone holder only allows phone to go horizontal.  But other than that I‚Äôm really happy with it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Very easy to set up for this non-tech savvy person! Very easy to use. I‚Äôve never had one before but this is great for family pics over the holidays indoors when you can‚Äôt get that great outdoor lighting! Love it.
5,Very nice ring light. Much bigger then expected gives off great light when recording videos. Setting up was a tad challenging as the tripod doesn‚Äôt lock into any specific position. It has to be open all the way which is only an inch or 2 off of your table. You need to tilt the camera and light to position it correctly. Other then that it‚Äôs a great value for the money.
5,Definitely worth it and it‚Äôs affordable about. You will need a little elbow grease to connect the piece to the ring light but once it‚Äôs in it‚Äôs in! You will also need a unit to connect to the usb to plug into the wall - luckily I had an extra one laying around. Love love love this!
5,This little thing is perfect for my use. Only thing that could be better is those 3 feets it stands on they are little loose but i fixed it so its all goodüôÇ
3,The lamp itself feels bright enough but I often have to position it closer to my face for any cameras to pick up on the light. The legs aren‚Äôt steady enough to use so I‚Äôve had to make due without any sort of stable stand unfortunately.
4,This is nice for the price!! Works great on what I need it for can't complain. Haven't had Ny problems and it was super easy to put together.
4,Wish landscape view was easier to attain when phone is in holder.
5,Didn‚Äôt think it would be this good absolutely love it and made my videos from amateur to advance real quick
5,Super easy to assemble nice brightness to each light setting i‚Äôm overall happy with photo & video outcomes. i take tripod with me everywhere i go easy for on the go creations.
3,I wanted to get a ring light that was powered by my computer USB so I don't use any more outlets. After plugging into the computer there is a high pitch whine when the light is on. I'm also getting an error on my mac that says the device is consuming too much power. Unfortunately I need it to be silent so I'm returning.
3,I love that its large and the brightness is great My only complaint was the tripod stand or lack thereof its so tiny that the weight of a Samsung galaxy weighed on it. if they change the stand to a sturdier one i would most likely buy or recommend. great product save for the stand. The return was swift and I appreciate that. I would still recommend if you have a way oaround the stand
3,the only reason why i gave it a low review was because it could not hold my phone. I have a iphone 11 pro max & it kept falling off & not staying still when i tried to put my phone in. also it was a hassle even getting my phone to fit in it. the light is amazing though so if you have a smaller phone this works for you
5,Gift for my daughter. It‚Äôs exactly what she wanted!She loves it! Perfect for her YouTube videos!Easy to use compact and well made! Holds her iPhone 11 perfectly. an extreme value!
4,This is a great product! However the legs are a little flimsy and slowly drop/ease down.
5,You can use your camera or your phone. It has three  colors:  white warm and white + warm.It comes with the product manual very easy to understand.You can also modified the brightness (More or Less)The presentation is really nice. perfect for a gift !
4,Only thing I wish is that it would hold the phone upright for Facetime calls.
5,I love it! For my small vanity/desk area it is the perfect size. It was very easy to assemble it had real life pictures for the instructions which was great since the pieces were intimidating at first glance. The different lighting types were great. The adjustable remote was great simple to know what each button does. Would definitely recommend for someone starting off making videos using their phones.
5,I am a blogger and influencer so this definitely helps with my videos. I found it a little hard to put together but it turned out great. So much light. Easier to make my videos brighter and lighter. 3 color modes and light. Camera attaches to a phone stand which is included. Wondering how I have lived without it so long.
4,Works well bought for streaming on twitch.
3,Okay the light part is nice and bright. However the stand sticks. Even with everything tightened it still slips and moves. If you have an iPhone 12 the whole stand is barley strong enough to hold the phone. I‚Äôd return but I got rid of the box. Super disappointing
3,The light is good quality and can be reasonably adjusted for brightness and color tone.  I did not realize in advance that it will not work by just plugging the USB into a laptop or PC.  That doesn't seem to provide enough power.  It does with by using an adapter (such as an iPhone plug) that then plugs into an AC outlet.  With that it powers on nicely but this does limit its portability.
5,This works exactly as it should and makes a big difference with the quality of video. I really like the camera holder in the center. The tripod it comes with is excellent for table top usage. I like that all the fittings are standard size so I was also able to use with with a floor model tripod that I already had. Good purchase!
4,I didn‚Äôt realize the tripod was that small so I‚Äôm giving this to my sister but it‚Äôs great if your streaming or makeup stuff üòä
4,Good product for the price. Great for YouTube videos and selfies. It even fits with my phone case on. My only issue with it is that it's easily knocked over with the slightest touch or movement.
5,I was impressed with this light. Very bright different settings with different colors of lights. Easy to put together once you read what goes where. The base is a little wide and now I wish I would have gotten the floor stand instead of this one that goes on a table only because it gives you more places to put it but it works amazing.
5,the light gets really bright which is exactly what i have been looking for (:
5,I bought for a job interview and it was simple to set up. Worked perfectly especially when i had other things i needed to focus on. I usually rely on my young adult sons for help with techy type set ups but i could easily set it  up myself.
3,I loved this product when I first got it! It is very bright has multiple settings and a easy to use control. HOWEVER recently it has beenturning off after just a few minutes of being on. I can't even finish doing my makeup before it stops working. I will say that if I give it 8-10 minutes then I can turn it back on but it is a hassle to have lighting start your makeupnot have lighting start again and so on. So all in all it works great... sometimes.
3,Not the best ring light I‚Äôve seen. The light is solid and it‚Äôs easy to set up but the light itself feels very cheaply made that if it were to fall it would definitely break; and the tripod legs never held up o that was very likely to happen. I‚Äôve returned and looked elsewhere but if you‚Äôre tight on cash then sure I guess.
5,I was actually surprised with the quality. Especially for the price! I bought it to take pictures of my puppies when they were born and it worked great. Put off plenty of bright light in my house with few windows and I got good pics!
4,It's fun to use. Several different light settings. Better than a lamp for zoom meetings.
1,Phone clamp doesn't attach snugly to ring light. No matter how I did it it would pop out of the area it slides into with barely any pressure. Can only use with phone horizontally! It looks like you should be able to move the mount to the side and put your phone in vertically...but jokes on you! The phone mount bumps into into ring light and there's no using it that way. Additionally the legs were sliding out from under the whole thing and phone wasn't even mounted! Literally got it all put together separated the legs just enough so it should stand...and the moment I set it on my desk two of the legs were sliding outwards causing the whole thing to collapse to one side. Good thing my phone wasn't in it yet.Was really needing this to work for my business launch...and now I have nothing. üò°
5,Amazing little ring light holder!!! I use this every single time I do my makeup or I want to make tiktoks!! The light is very bright and it's easy to use and put together!
5,This ring light did everything that it said it would and more I love the fact that it has three different tones for color and it goes up to 10 times for the brightness I can't say enough about this ring light the quality is amazing and for the price you can't beat it
2,First off the light worked very well as expected. Light was bright stand was very adjustable.HOWEVER this does not come with any power adapter or instructions.  You must supply your own and there are no directions or suggestions as to exactly what type of USB adapter they recommend.So I used the standard USB charger for my iPhone 8.  The light worked perfectly for about 5 mins and then just shut itself off!  I turned it back on and it stayed on for a few more minutes and shut off itself off again.  At this point I checked the USB adapter and it was extremely hot!  I suspect this unit (at the power adapter) could possibly catch fire.I wish it would have worked because everything else about it seems great.  They should have either included a proper power adapter or at the very least recommend one that is rated for safety.  A bit too scary I'm sending it back.
5,Product was easy to set up and worked great. Love that there is no battery so be ready to have a USB or computer ready when you want to use it. This product gets the job done and the three settings are really great! Would recommend.
3,Eh... it makes you think that this is going to result in some awesome revolution in your photos; it certainly helps but it's not nearly as bright or life altering as I was hoping it would be.  Also you can't really fit a modern phone into the mount in the middle so don't expect that to work unless you have a really tiny phone.Overall I guess it's fine but not worth $50...
5,I purchased this for my daughter She absolutely loved it from the start.  There was a time when I had a concern about it and the seller was on it right away.  I will continue to purchase from the seller and would recommend this light to anyone.  Nothing like a great product and great customer service!
5,Great product for pictures videos and doing your makeup! Love all the lighting options. Also love that it plugs into a USB so it‚Äôs versatile and easy to use anywhere. Very simple to put together a few screws and tighten and good to go! Pretty cool that you can put your phone or camera in the middle. Can‚Äôt wait to use it even more!
4,Nice ring light that really adds brightness to your videos or photos. It also can be attached to a tripod if you have one. Not sure how long the actual frame/hardware will last as it feels a little cheap but the price is good for what you‚Äôre getting.
3,I loved it but I hadn‚Äôt used it in a while (about a month) and I went to turn it on and all of the sudden it didn‚Äôt work anymore so I had to order an new one üò© but the brightness and adjustment ms on it are awesome!
4,I bring myself a portable charger and utilize it if im Vlogging or recording on instagram. It really lightens up my videos and also can be used as a background light to add more definition to your frame while you are filming.
5,I ordered this light for a new business I'm building where I'll need good lighting for videos and pictures.  This ring light does a great job.  Bonus the brightness adjusts as well as the "tone" of the lighting.  I didn't know this when I bought the ring light so it was a pleasant surprise.  The phone holder works great and adjusts to fit different sized phones.  Great product and worth the money!
5,This is a perfect desktop ring light for teleconferencing. It comes with a small but stable desktop-appropriate height tripod with a switch to control intensity and the color of the ring light. It has a convenient holder for your camera phone. Very easy to set up and delivers all it advertises.
3,Very easy to put together but does not stay together well. Bought in May have used it maybe 10 times and the phone holder keeps falling off. I readjust it tighten it and its very insecure. I worry my phone will fall out or the whole piece will fall off. For $50 I'd expect everything to be secure especially when holding a phone.
5,Both the light and stand are adjustable. The color and brightness of the light can be changed/controlled by the touch of a button on the controller to suit your setting. The stand can be used adjusted to be used as a table or desk top stand or can be elongated to use as a floor stand. Very flexible in use with ease of transition from one to the other. Great for use with social media.
3,I was happy with this product when I first received it but after just having it for a few months it already died.
5,In my last Zoom meeting I had the best lighting of the entire group. This ring light is easily mounted on top of a photo light stand or with the supplied tripod to evenly illuminate your image. Go for it!
4,It‚Äôs super bright!!! love how my pictures/videos turn out. Just hate how flimsy it can be but otherwise amazing product.
4,My only dislike is that the tripod is not taller.
1,it‚Äôs a good light when it works when it‚Äôs not it flickers all night won‚Äôt turn on turns on when it want and it‚Äôs worthless after the return window i can‚Äôt even contact the seller
3,It gives decent lighting but the legs are not sturdy for me. My product legs/base kept sliding too far out.
5,I bought this to use during my work zoom meetings and it‚Äôs great! The lighting is adjustable and I get a ton of compliments. Perfect for pretty much anyone and definitely a must when working from home and trying to get the perfect light.
4,Everything was to expect for this product but i was trying to tighten the phone holder but it really wasn‚Äôt working... my phone was too heavy with my phone case.
3,It does alright for close up work.  My regular iPhone 11 is SUPER tight in the holder.  Have to take it out of the small case.If you are looking for something super pro this isn‚Äôt it.I do like the ability to change the color tones.
5,My favorite product of all time. This definitely will not be a regret of buying. I don‚Äôt just use it for makeup or anything like that. It‚Äôs bright enough to use sometimes as a light
5,good for the price! surprisingly bright!
3,Maybe I should have read more details. To work the light has to be plugged into a USB port. This was a bit annoying to me. The stand I thought would expand beyond inches-Nope. It was easy to assemble. The light and settings are great. It is easy to use. I would give it a 7 out of 10.
3,This ring light is OK... cheap plastic and flimsy. The tripod is the same. Cheap.But you get what you pay for. The light doesn‚Äôt travel very far you have to be decently close to it. If you really don‚Äôt wanna pay the money for a good one then it does the job. But I‚Äôd suggest saving a bit more and investing in a nicer one.
4,Got it as a gift for teen birthday. She loved it. Easy to use.
5,real bright great
5,I love this light ring. It has different tones (warm to cool) that you can adjust by just hitting a button on the switch. Also you can adjust the brightness with about 10 settings. Seems pretty well made and was packaged well for shipment. I would recommend it to a friend for sure.
1,So with the coronavirus life some of my health care visits are by video various applications like Zoom or Skype or supplied by the organization.I have a windows 10 pro OS and the updates made Zoom not work on my laptop so I had to use my phone.I have neuropathy in both hands (and feet) but holding a phone so the caller can see you is so painful. (Holding the phone to my ear is painful too so I got a great pair of Bluetooth earbuds I use at home.)My apartment also is not lighted for that especially as I don't know where I will be recliner couch bed? So when this came up on sale from my wishlist I snapped it up. A holder a variety of lighting options ahhhh.Set up is not too bad got it all put together and I plugged it in and turned it on and only ONE QUARTER of the lights light.  The remote was sluggish to respond and then cycled through so fast no light was on. I don't want another so use yours with with a wish it will work for you. Good luck.Not recommended. Sad. Returning.
3,Not a horrible product. Have issues with it staying together though. Can be extremely bright and then light levels are great. I normally only have it low or half level. Was able to attach it to my camera tripod with ease. The phone mount that goes inside the light ring is where I have issues. Fully tightened down it still pops out me fairly easy. But I am still able to use it for what I want so I'm pleased with the product.
3,Flimsy. The tripod is useless and you can knock it over with a gust of wind. Not worth the money. I will be returning it
5,This is just what I have been looking for! I was looking for light that I could use for some online sales to replace a set that I currently have that‚Äôs difficult for me to use. This was super easy to assemble and maneuver into position. There are different lights that you can choose depending on your preference. I posted a sample pic of the lighting (my son wanted to film his Lego battle!!)
5,After communication with the seller my damaged product was replaced and I am comfortable re issuing that 5 star review. This is truly an EXCELLENT light. I am a stylist and makeup artist and lighting is everything. Of course it‚Äôs to be used for filming  and photos etc but when I say this is amazing it really is!
4,I love my ring light but I've only had it since September and the screw that locks the neck in place already broke and wont even turn. Then whole top of the screw cracked.. other than that the light in general is AMAZING.
3,I like the light the brightness also the convenience of the ability to pack it away quickly. I returned the product only because it did not have the ability to swivel or pivot to focus on subject also its a plug in light . If your looking for a light to apply make up it's perfect
4,I‚Äôm sorry where are the instructions??? Great product but how tf do I put the phone holder on it
4,My phone is a little too heavy for it and makes it tip some but I make do... great for beginners... I have an I phone x
5,Works great for the price and the fact it can run off a power bank is very helpful.
4,There is not camera or face recognition idk why Amazon is asking me that. It's a nice little ring light.
3,Perfectly illuminates and gets the job done; however the stand for the phone is a little difficult to maintain tightness and the tripod is barely adjustable. Should be able to lower and raise the height according to surface use.
3,Seems like a neat product but for me it didn't work. I could see the ring of light as a reflection in my glasses. I returned it. The return was no problem for which I am appreciative.
4,Works great for my photos
1,I only use twice the camera holder is broken üòû
4,I like the quality of the item and the fact that it was easy to put together!
3,Overall it seems like it would be great. It arrived earlier than I thought although it was smaller than I thought it would be. Size aside. Only one ring the warmer ring was working. There were only a few bulbs on the white ring that turned on. I've contacted the seller in hopes that they could fix the issue. I'll update this after I hear from them.
3,As pictured. Lights can be a bit harsh so it takes a minute to get use to it. Legs are not very stable if you need to record a flat surface. This does need to be plugged up. Hard to change positions.
5,the stand is exactly what i was looking for recording videos for youtube and taking selfie videos. There are 3 different light patterns which can be used. The mobile lock is tight so there were no slip ups. Its not heavy and can be easily used when travelling outside.
3,First off I wanted to say I excited  I was to receive my ring light . I decided  to record my self doing my quick makeup look. Anyways the light kept turning off for no reason . So I thought maybe it was something with my outlet . But NO . After multiple try‚Äôs it‚Äôs still doing that. Very disappointed!! and threw the box away already so can‚Äôt return. I think it might be a defective one. Not sure what‚Äôs going on.
5,I think this ring light is the perfect size for at home or travel . I really like how it has adjustable lighting features and how you can put your phone on top or camera. I am super excited about this buy and it‚Äôs also very affordable.
3,Came very quick. Cute but not worth the money. It‚Äôs not sturdy.  Flimsy. It‚Äôs only good for taking videos while sitting on the floor. I wish it had an adjustable strong stand. I gave this to my kid. I needed a tall sturdy one. Even if it‚Äôs plastic it should be sturdy. Idk 50/50 This is worth about $25 not $50
4,Works well....nice light changes....can have a hard time keeping sturdy so it doesn't fall over tightening pieces isnt always easy but it does it's job.
4,The legs are a little loose. Hard to get it to stay where you want it. But overall a great product.
4,What I needed
5,With so many video calls I was struggling to find the right light. Another person recommended this light so I thought I'd give it a try! I love the ease of use flexibility and portability. I recommend it. Great product at the right price.
5,Did not expect that many things to come with. It has a tripod for the phone and 2 holders to hold the phone. It‚Äôs been so useful. Like i even use it for sleeping as an sleeping light. I just dim it. Really recommended for the price.
5,This ring light is just as expected.  The light gets really bright and it can be dimmed. I purchased it to use for my job working at home and it is well worth the buy.
4,Only problem it gets really hot when you have it on for quite a while.
5,This ring light is well built and the light is much stronger than I expected which is great! I love the different brightness and tone settings. Will be trying this for my zoom meetings and selfies.
5,Really good simple and generous style lighting effect great all of a sudden a lot of three-dimensional skin color is also a lot of light live broadcast stand is very stable very simple on the installation the effect is very good
5,This light works well. Easy to set up easy to use.
5,I originally left an ‚Äúokay‚Äù review due to a broken item but their customer service is SO good they were able to help right after. I really like the ring light and the quality as stated on my first review is amazing! and they were able to fix the error on their part. 10/10 recommend.
3,I never liked the stand on this - it wouldn‚Äôt stay in one spot and kept spreading out to be too low. The phone holder isn‚Äôt great either - I have a heavy phone.
5,I love how big this 10 inch ring light is.A few setting available in regards to brightness warmth or cool light.I have my old samsung phone in the photo to show it fits a galaxy however I also tested to see if it would hold my note 9 and it does even w the case on it.10/10 recommended!
3,So I've been looking for something just like this for some time now and I was pumped to get it but I was looking for a sturdier stand. The one that came with this was just some wires for legs. Luckily I had my own tripod to set this up on and that did the trick.
4,I love this product sooo much. The lighting settings are what It's a light and get very warm after a while so be careful. Perfect to travel with. Aalyiah Jay from youtube put me on!!
5,It‚Äôs everything I expected it to be and more! I didn‚Äôt want one that was very big. This size is perfect! I‚Äôm able to put it just about anywhere. Very easy to put together!
5,Was looking for an inexpensive light to help the quality of my Zoom sessions and purchased this light. The quality is good and the lighting options are great. There are different light filters and the ability to make the light brighter.
5,I‚Äôve used this for zoom/google meet interviews and work meetings. Definitely worth it if you don‚Äôt have  good natural light. Lots of settings and easy to use.
4,It is not as bright as I thought it would be but it‚Äôs good quality and super nice!!!!
1,Worked great at first then died after about 3 months of only a few hours of use per week. I even used the right power adapter for 10W per the instructions. Very disappointed I feel like I wasted my money on this. I wish I could return it.
4,Light is AMAZING but tripod is very weak. Will need to buy a stronger tripod üòä
3,The only reason why I gave 3 stars was because the lighting worked other than that this is cheap and doesn‚Äôt work. It doesn‚Äôt hold the weight of my phone (iphone x) the screws do not tighten so the stand flops all around and doesn‚Äôt stay in the position you want. The tripod screw Doesn‚Äôt tighten down so the tripod is flimsy and will not stay up. I sent back. I do not recommend.
4,Everything is great except the stand for the legs I can‚Äôt get the light to stand up very well
1,I thought this was gonna work out but it's not very practical. For one the stand gets loose over time and there's no way to tighten it so when you set up the ring light the stand just slides down. I ended up having to stand it upright as much as possible which isn't safe.Also there is no off/on switch. This *has* to be plugged in for it work and the cord isn't very long. I had to purchase an extender and an extra square.It works -- I guess -- but it's grief. Pass.
3,The lights don't always work with the control. It takes several attempts to change dim or brighten them. The tripod part has to be held by heavy objects or it falls/slides. The piece to put your phone in is extremely hard to use and sometimes even hurts to put my phone in or out. I don't recommend it and will be searching for something else.
5,Awesome quality. Perfect brightness.  Easy to use. Great price and value. Great camera quality. Highly recommend!
2,The screws provided were stripped. I followed the instructions and watched others videos and there was no threading on the inside holes where they screw is suppose to be. I ended up making it work with a hammer and extra nail. It seems like nice quality but oh my worddddddd the assembly was annoying with stripped screws!
4,I LOVED this light! I wish Tripod was a bit more sturdy but overall everything else is great! Love the 3 settings and that you can control it with a remote! Would recommend!
3,I used this tripod to hold the ring light only. I use a separate tripod for my phone when doing my live videos.  There are plenty of light settings for personal preference. The light is very bright. I angle the ring so that the light filters appropriately.My big mistake was purchasing the wrong model. This tripod is built for landscape and I needed portrait. It could have been marked more clearly.
3,The light is really bright but the tripod doesn't hold up well it's slides down. And the phone falls off of the holder often. I like that it has different light settings.
5,Works well very good lighting choices. Use it all the time. Recommend.
5,Great price and quality. I‚Äôve used this ring light for zoom work meetings and  video game streaming. I love it!!! Very pleased with this purchase for sure!
4,Kids love it!!
4,For the price point it did the job.  The tripod is sorta clumsy tho.
5,easy to assemble  great results.My videos are clear and my complexion and teeth looks amazing when lights are on.I set mine to the clear light at mid brightness.A note is to pull the phone holder up if your phone appears not to fit.  It adjust.
5,I really like this ring light Is very brightly good quality. is better than what I thought. I recommend it specially for makeup. I love that it has the little thing to attach the phone.
3,It's a good light wouldn't purchase again. The cover for the lights comes off and it's pretty unstable so you have to get it just right so it doesn't fall.
4,This is an awesome little tripod for the price. I did have a hard time stabilizing it at times. Also- I imagined I'd be able to make it taller but it doesn't have extending legs.
3,Great for selfies or amateur photo taking but not the best quality. I don‚Äôt know if I just got a defective one or if they‚Äôre all like that but nine of the levers tighten so the ring light is constantly swiveling or tips if the surface isn‚Äôt too level. The part that‚Äôs supposed to hold the phone is also loose so sometimes the whole phone stand will Swivel or fall off with your phone attached.
3,Cheaply made buttons offset so they worked terribly. The piece that holds the phone in place kept slipping out there's no way to lock it in place
4,It‚Äôs a cool little situation. I recommend. Only one problem...the part that holds the phone is not too sturdy.
2,I bought this light and it worked great for about a month. Now it constantly flickers when I have it on the warmest light setting. I have tried adjusting the brightness cleaning the light and doing everything recommended on the troubleshooting guide to no avail. I am very disappointed in this light. If you want a light that will last a while this is not the light for you.
3,Lighting was good. Only complaint is the tripod legs there is no way to keep them secure and they don't provide stability so it kept falling over from the top weight.
2,I only got maybe 40 hours of use out of this and that's being nice. I wish I wouldn't just paid extra for another ring light that would've lasted. You get get you pay for. The phone holder on this SUCKS! Without the case on my phone it still popped out constantly. The rotator for the phone holder never really stayed in place it was very loose. 4 stars for the light brightness (that part was OK). 2 stars for longevity (it lasted several months not using on a weekly basis).
4,It does the job but the phone holder tends to fall out( pretty consistently) and that‚Äôs very frustrating when you are trying to take photos for your portfolio
5,Bought for my wife and her business.  She loves it and has asked me to purchase two more for her office and as a travel light.
5,I bought 3 of these for my 3 daughters and rhis was the surprise hit of Christmas.  They all 3 loved it and said they loved how it has different light settings.
4,I bought these for my girlfriend and she loves it
3,The light is amazing.  I love the different options available for all kinds of lighting situations.  The stand for the light is worthless.  The attachments are standard so I purchased a different stand that is taller and more stable than the one here.
5,I was tired of rearranging lamps and blinds to get decent lighting for video calls (thanks COVID).  This makes it super easy- I plug it into my laptop set it behind the camera click on and I have even flattering lighting.  Recommended this to several friends.
4,Perfect for making so fun TikToks! It sites nicely on a table and very bright. It does have three colors. Can‚Äôt wait to make some videos with my family.
5,This is a great value for a ring light with adjustable brightness.  Everything worked well.  Excellent for lightning a subject for zoom.
5,Absolutely love there are 3 separate modes I've used it live a few times and love it
1,This ring light has caused me way too much headache over something so simple to resolve. The ring light stopped working after 1.5/2 months. I contacted Amazon for a replacement (since I STILL have the original packaging and warranty info) and they said to contact the manufacturer/seller. The light will not stay on it flashes on when I press the button but then doesn't stay on.The ring light has a manufacturer warranty and 90 day coverage on AMAZON. So tell me why I have contacted the manufacturer with no response....AND AMAZON 3 times AND NO ONE HAS HELPED ME. Each Rep said "okay we can send a replacement and then no replacement arrives".I want a working ring light. This one worked just fine for what I was using it for before it decided to malfunction or whatever. A replacement is fine a refund is fine just wanted resolution.So now I have a defective ring light with no replacement or refund and its not only covered under a manufacturer warranty BUT AN AMAZON 90 day warranty as well.
4,Kids love
3,This light does a nice job of improving your video appearance with a diffused light. However after a week of using it it flickers back and forth between a level of lighting. Something like a ring light is definitely a good addition to your webcam set up but I would not be able to recommend this particular offering to anyone.
5,Loving this light it helps makes the quality of both pictures and videos easier to see the tripod is sturdy enough that it balances well and doesn't tip over. We've used it on the floor and a table top and no issues.
5,Stopped working literally a couple of weeks before my full year of having itUpdate: contacted seller and they sent me another one! Changed back to 5 stars
1,Thought LED was supposed to last a long time. It was good until it didn‚Äôt work but I would not recommend it because it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Not even 5 months!
3,This product is ok. I feel it‚Äôs clumsy to manipulate the legs move too easily creating an unstable position ... and therefore needs a ton of tweaking. Phone area to put your phone is also a little weird & not easily perfected. Lighting is pretty good. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this particular one again though.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I was for a selfie ring that would hold my camera and I love this one! It‚Äôs so lightweight easy to assemble and it bends in different ways that allows me to take videos from different angles! Overall awesome purchase
5,The light works well and the phone holder works great! The only issue I have with this light is the tripod is weak. I had to put erasers on the tips of the tripod to make it stay standing.
5,My daughter makes lps videos for YouTube and has been asking for a ring light for ages This one is perfect for her because it's only 10 inches and you can set it on top of the table and move it around easily and you can't beat it for the price. The tripod legs are adjustable but they are very sturdy.
5,Made me look like an alien with my glasses! Great for a joke with my students! Got some hilarity going with this one...sent it back. Not my intended purpose.
5,Super bright. Make sure you use the right size power adapter and it‚Äôll be super bright. Well made the tripod is durable and the mount attachments are not cheaply made. All in all well worth the price
5,I have been obsessed with this ring light since it arrived. It works amazingly. The lighting is perfect and I love that you can rotate your phone. You can also control the intensity of the light. I really love this for my videos and pictures!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it!!! will be buying the bigger one.
4,Works will but a little small for what I was looking for so I returned it.
5,product arrived fast great size easy to move 3 shades of light colors. This ring light produce perfect fill in light to improve the brightness and clarity of the video and photo.
5,It‚Äôs so much better than you‚Äôd expect for this cost. It gets the job done but doesn‚Äôt have a spot for phones.
2,Not good sizing for iPhones 11 and so on‚Ä¶ it barely fits. The light is also very dull which sucks. Waste of money
5,Works very well for the price! The legs are a bit difficult to control from time to time but other than that it's a great little light.
5,Pros: easy to assemble lighting was on point. Cons: At first I wasn‚Äôt happy with how the phone attachment had my phone in the horizontal position. I was contacted by the manufacturer and was instructed how to switch the phone positioning. Would have been great if that instruction was included. Love the light and the options available.
5,Perfect light for desktop lighting needs; makeup application tutorials shooting videos etc. I bought this to travel with and use for makeup applications on clients when there isn‚Äôt the best lighting on location and for client makeup photography. The performance of this light is great. Happy with this purchase.
3,I was searching for a small ringlight to help with my youtube channel. This one is worth the purchase. It had multiple settings and brightness levels to give you the look that you want. I only wished that the attachment for your phone was sturdier. You have to be really careful with it.
3,This is difficult to get the phone into and even harder to put into position. There is no good angling for someone with glasses and when I try to reposition the bracket for the camera falls out. Not what I was expecting but still can be used.
3,I really can‚Äôt even tell a difference. I wish I had gotten a nicer one that actually made a difference. The main thing it lets you do is film in a dark room- doesn‚Äôt make a difference in picture quality like others.*Right after I posted this the light stopped working- don‚Äôt buy it!
3,Light works perfectly.  The phone holder is a little hard to use as the spring is very tight.  There isn't an easy way to manually open the phone holder.The plastic bracket that holds the phone to the light also broke very easily after some use.There are better products but this is reasonable for the cost.
3,I tried using this to do one of my live jewelry shows and it was a failure!  I misread the description I guess and didn't realize it was only a horizontal angle and not vertical.  However I still tried to use this and the lighting was off and the phone holder was loose no matter how much I tightened it.  Also the stand would not stay up and fell 15 minutes in to my show.  Frustrating!!
4,I really like this ring light the only problem is the legs are fragile and it falls easily.
5,I‚Äôve been wanting one of these for so long! I‚Äôve been surprised how much I‚Äôve used it. I bought for taking pictures of items that I sell on Facebook eBay and Mercari and it works great! But I‚Äôve also been using for applying make up and videos of my kids! Great product that I‚Äôm really enjoying!
4,The only complaint I have is that the stand is not very sturdy so if you even slightly bump your table it will fall. It is extremely easy to put together and the lighting is actually amazing. Definitely a great 1st ring light
3,my product stopped working after 3 weeks of use it just cut off on me. but it was really bright i just wish it lasted longer
5,EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.. MAKES...  WHEN DOING CONFERENCE CALLS.  EVERYTHING IS SO CLEAR & THE LIGHTING IS ADJUSTABLE TO WHEREVER I'M SITTING ~~~
2,The phone holder only works sideways and broke the first day I got it
4,The tools came in broken so my fianc√© had to come up with a way to fix it.
5,Needed this for my business photos and videos.  I was nicely surprised at how well it works for the price
4,Brightness
5,Bought this for my daughter and I may just have to buy one for myself. I have a pricier one and I would rather this one! It‚Äôs a space saver I love the quality and the phone attachment it comes with and you can‚Äôt beat the price! It works great too! I would highly recommend this product!
5,I love the ability to dim or brighten as needed and the light balance buttons allow me to adjust as needed for any background. Works great with a cellphone or on its own near a laptop or webcam!
3,El anillo y la luz bien el problema realmente es que el tr√≠pode me vino malo una de las patas de abre sola y con el peso del tlf no hay manera una lastima xq vivo en Panam√° y regresarlo termina siendo m√°s costoso que comprar un tr√≠pode nuevo
3,This item has been really helpful for phone video hands free. Had issues with the adjustments and stabilizing and securing the components. The lighting works very well however. Good if you need a basic ring light for a set spot with minimal moving or height variations. Thank you!
3,The light itself works really well. The piece to hold the phone is flimsy as well as the stand itself. I have to have all the legs completely flat and prop it against something to stay up.
5,Very good quality for the price. The lighting helps to improve the appearance of complexion. The different shades of color are an added bonus. Would buy again.
5,Works great love it but it‚Äôs a bit to big you have to clear off table completely to use it.
5,I really like this ring light. It‚Äôs perfect size to fit on my desk. Also it‚Äôs super bright and has two different color tones. I wish it had the option to use batteries not just plugged into a wall. However I‚Äôm really happy with the light!
4,I received my package earlier than expected and so far I love it! The light is a nice size for my vanity table and brightens my room. The quality is great so far.
5,The ring 10 inches which is pretty big and bright. There are three colors light from this ring and they are all natural color. This helps our picture taken using this light is so beautiful. It is very easy to setup it also come with the tripod and remote which can be connect to phone via Bluetooth.
4,The lighting is great however there's no feet on the bottom of the tripod so it slips alot
3,Very good very bright. Very easy to connect. But the feet it stand on are very flimsy and do not stay in place.
5,This thing is awesome it‚Äôs super bright & definitely worth the money it has different setting for any type of light you like!
5,This is exactly what we were looking for. Very pleased with the LED light ring.The first ring light that came did not work. No problem with Amazon of them sending me a replacement.Very satisfied.
3,Shame on me for not really looking at the measurements. The Tripod legs are so tiny and short. The light itself is also tiny but will get the job done and the different warmth‚Äôs and brightness is good. The legs of the tripod also aren‚Äôt sturdy. It‚Äôs OK but not the best.
5,great ring of light I can take them everywhere and connect it to the power bank or my laptop. I like that I can adjust the intensity and temperature of light. It originally has a mini tripod to place on the desktop but if you have a professional camera tripod it is compatible and easy to connect.
3,Great ring light but terrible tripod it does not stand up it just slides down flat. There is nothing to hold it tight and standing up. Disappointing.
3,The lighting itself is perfect the mechanism breaks easily by itself. So now the neck is all wobbly and wont stand up and i have to find something to prop it up
5,I love the lightin  hate the stand. The stand is wide and doesn‚Äôt fit on my desk.
3,So first of it can only hold my phone side ways. Then after like 2 weeks the part to hold my phone completely broke off. And the tripod can‚Äôt hold the weight of the light so it never stays in position
4,Only complaint is the phone holder is small i have to take the case off my iphone 8 for it to fit
4,Once the light fixture and phone are on the tripod the tripod doesn‚Äôt hold up. I had to put heavier items around each leg of the tripod to keep it from sliding down flat. Luckily I have a stronger tripod to use. The light is wonderful.
5,Purchased as a gift for my niece! She was so excited and I've been informed she loves it and stays on her phone in front of it!
5,Good quality very good lighting it is easy to assemble and use.  Not like the others they had that are very uncomfortable.  I recommend it 100%.  Since I took it in my hands I realized that it was of good quality.  It fits very well on the phone and stays firm perfect for taking videos and photos
4,Honestly I wasn't expecting much at all. I really like this for doing lip or eye make up then taking a photo to post to Insta or Twitter. I also like the different color settings.
2,In theory it should work well. And the ring is cool lights and all. But the design flaw is (mostly) in the tripod. When the phone is perfectly balanced it's great.  But it's not easy to move or change settings on the phone without knocking the whole thing over. Last time it fell into a full glass of water knocking that over water everywhere. I saved the phone. I would not purchase this again.
3,Seems like good light but the cell phone holder didn't fit. Not sure how to set that up now they should have an adjustable piece.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Super easy to set up and very sturdy. It is easy to use and makes my life much easier for unboxing videos! Would definitely recommend!
5,Easy to set up. I like the remote on the cord to control the light colors and brightness. Helps a lot when taking up close photos in poorly lit spots.
5,Easily one of the best inexpensive purchases during the pandemic. This helps improve my lighting and I feel better about how I look on video calls. I still detest video calls but at least I look less miserable.
5,I bought the large photographer one but this one is much better. So much light and brightness but small enough to just fold and put away when I‚Äôm done with use. Love that it‚Äôs portable. I can set it next to my laptop and plug in the USB and voila!
2,Flimsy and annoying as heck. The tripod will not stand up no matter what you do just drops to the ground or turned sideways it is freaking nightmare quite honestly. If I put it all the way up as high as I can and don't let anything move around me it might stay up for a little bit but it's just really cheap and it will frustrate the heck out of you. Spend a little more and get a better quality one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Has been perfect for all the zoom calls! Also use so I can see when applying makeup
4,Good
3,The product works as advertised but I find the lighting rather harsh and didn‚Äôt improve online view the way many other people have said. This is just to say I don‚Äôt think a ring light is a great addition to my online teaching setup. I‚Äôd guess a diffuser is much better.
5,I‚Äôve been drooling over ring lights since I have an online business. My Product shots and Facebook love videos needed an upgrade but the price was stopping me. I found this and thought the price was good. I‚Äôm obsessed. Check out my before and after photo! That speaks for itself!! Easy to set up and use.
5,I love this ring !! I have experience with multiple small rings and this one really impressed me. It lights up great my face and dark rooms. Perfect for traveling
4,Do not wear your eyeglasses while using this!
5,Easy to adjust lighting with the controller. Tripod sturdy for a tabletop model. Connectors loosen a bit too easily but still worth it for the cost. Be prepared to figure out assembly yourself. Not disappointed with my purchase decision.
4,The phone holder is difficult to keep open to fit my phone in.
5,It does the job and easily connects universally to other tripods which is good because it connects to my fugetek all in one selfie stick tripod.  It doesn't cost much so it's worth the price and is easily portable for people on the go if you keep the box it comes in.
2,After receiving this ring light I immediately decided to return it.The production was cheaply done. You cannot trust the tripod to hold your phone and the tripod legs slip easily on the table.Phone holder is very stiff and you have to hold the whole unit for removing or just adjusting the phone position.The packaging is very simple and gives you the sense that they don't care about the buyer and the first impression.In general the first sight on the unit was very bad for me and the quality was way lower than I expected.There are definitely better options in this price rage such as Ubeesize 10 inch (2020 version) that I am waiting to arrive.
2,The product is ok. It is very poor quality. Not worth the price. I originally purchased it for myself to do pictures and videos of me and my clients make up however i ended up giving it to my daughter for her to play with. It was so small and light weight. I hate the phone holder because I have to take my phone out of the case each time I want to use the light. ANNOYING!!! Additionally it is very flimsy and you can only use in in a USB outlet luckily I had a wall charger that has the UBS port on it so we can move around with it other that that we would only be limited to using it at the computer desk.
5,Good product for the price. Lots of ways to adjust it it takes a little while to get it right. Happy overall
3,so it‚Äôs a good product to have in your bathroom for make up or selfies BUT the thing where i put my charger on broke for me  and the whole thing in general isn‚Äôt very steady. it tips over easily. i mean it gets the job done but i wish it was more steady.
4,The only bad thing about this product is the tripod. It sucks!  Poorly made!
2,The light itself is bright and does a good job.  I use it for teleconferencing and typically have it at about 50-75% of it's full output.The phone clamp is really poor quality.  The threads in one of the two mounting holes is unusable so can't mount in landscape mode either incorrectly threaded or inserted backwards.  Additionally there is dried glue running down one side and the pads are all really crooked and look like they would fall off.  I actually bought a separate phone mount because this one is so poorly made.I didn't use the included tripod because it is really short.  Instead I am using a mounting arm that I already had.
5,FINALLY Delivered 11hrs since leaving fulfillmnt ctr! Any who my lite is Awesome had to Test it out RIGHT AWAY! The pictures are the proof! It's worth the money & WAIT for delivery! Can't wait to use it with my phone & makeup on my faceüë∏üèΩüëåüèº! So far while plugged into my car üíØ% BRIGHT & Soft too üòâ!
5,The quality is very good which is completely consistent with the description of the seller I really like it it completely exceeds the expectation and I am very satisfied with it. I hope more friends can trust it.
3,The light is great but the piece that holds your phone does not stay put and continuously falls. It could be that I got a faulty model - but I have the most recent iPhone so weight shouldn‚Äôt be too much of an issue.  But it provides amazing lighting!
3,The legs aren‚Äôt super sturdy so it‚Äôs hard to get the tripod to balance well but if you can make it work the light is super bright. I like that it has warm and cool settings
5,It definitely helps  making my pictures so much better and more professional looking. I love how small it is. I have a bigger one and I hardly use it because it‚Äôs so bulky
5,I was skeptical about buying this because of the price. I thought it‚Äôs too cheap it won‚Äôt be good for what I want it. Wrong! I‚Äôm so glad I took the chance. I wanted it more for my camera rather than my cellphone and it works PERFECT!!! I‚Äôm excited to use it!
2,I ended up having to put another ring tripod.  I had to put this tripod stand in a cup or something study to hold it up.  The legs couldn't hold up the ring light alone and especially when my phone was attached.  The light is still good but very annoying that the legs couldn't hold up the light and phone.
4,Some small parts are difficult to keep it standing the legs have to be all the way out. Must be set on a table
5,It‚Äôs awesome! Bright three settings cwhich allow it to be dimmer depending on your room light with just a touch of a button. Great for videos or putting on make up!
5,This was a gift to my little sister and let me tell you  its small not toooo small its perfect size but that thing can light up your face . it doesnt look way too bright or over exposed i promise. it is soooo worth it
5,I didn‚Äôt expect this light to be as good as it was for the price that I paid. I do hv trouble attaching the cell phone holder and it DOES cause my phone to fall although I have a small iPhone. Nonetheless my clients LOVE the light and the different settings was awesome! I will definitely refer my clients to this product
5,I love this ring light for my zoom meetings. It works well when I am recording videos as well. Love the Bluetooth capabilities. I usually use the soft white light.
2,This light is bright and I was so excited when it got here... but it started turning off randomly.. just days after I got it. It come with a cord but no plug in attachment. So I found one I had.. the cord gets really hot and maybe that‚Äôs why it turns off but it‚Äôs not useful at all if it doesn‚Äôt have a light. I wish I would have got one that was better quality now I‚Äôll have to spend even more for another which is annoying.
5,The brightness levels on this thing are amazing! And the same one at Walmart is 39.99!
5,I love everything about this product sans one thing. The legs don‚Äôt seem to really support the weight once you put a phone in it. I‚Äôve had to do some weird balancing acts to make it stand sometimes
3,The brightness of the light is good. The light itself must have a short or something bc it flickers or cuts off.  Sometimes the light is hard to change the setting but for the price it works for now.
4,I like the light overall but sometimes I notice it blinks.. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to go out soon or what. I‚Äôve maybe had it for a month or 2..
1,why does this keep shutting off? I want a new one
3,It‚Äôs fine. It does the job. It‚Äôs shorter than I expected and the stands can be a bit finicky but it‚Äôs  usable.
1,Extremely poor quality. Only used twice and second time the light was flickering.
2,Pulled it out of the box and it initially didn't power up. Oh great I got a dud. Then it magically lit up and worked reliably for a day or two. A week or so goes by before I go to use it again and I only got power to the little controller. I pushed the buttons on the remote about 10-15 times and it flashed for a half a second if that and then went dark again. Unresponsive since.I liked it for the few hours of use I *did* get out of it but as expected it's a crapshoot when buying budget electronics. Exchanging for a new one. If the next one acts the same way I'll be returning it altogether and finding a more reliable light even if it will cost a few more extra dollars.
5,Love how portable it is. Compact and easy to set up. The brightness is just right and makes it easy to adjust to different settings.  highly recommend.
5,Works great multiple color temps and just right brightness. Make the camera focus better and very clear.
5,This light weight light provides great table top light for conferencing and teaching from my laptop.  It was inexpensive and does the trick.  I like the different modes of light (warm to cool).
5,The Ring Light that I bought does not have a camera.  The ring works well and I had good comments from my Zoom friends of how I look.
4,Everything is cool but the legs is too flimsy. Ezy fix replace the stand ü§òü§†ü§ò
5,I pretty much like everything about this product gives pictures a super quality it's pretty easy to put together even if you're not handy or "tech savvy" & was delivered on time. All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
4,To small sent it back to order a bigger stand.
3,It works perfectly except for the fact that the legs are kind of wobbly and are only stable if it's open flat on a surface.
3,Like the light HATE the flimsy stand which had very minimal height adjustment. Had to use another stand from an old ring light.
5,Love it! Well worth the price! I wish the stand was made a little different or maybe a taller but still a great product. It‚Äôs brightest setting is blinding( a good thing lol). Would definitely purchase again.
4,okay  - pricey for how small it is .
5,So excited to have this- I have been wanting one to do my vlogs and pictures. It was easy to assemble however some plastic melted into one of the grooves making it harder to screw in. Once I got the plastic out I have had no issues. I just got a Nikon camera and found out this ring light fit that as well!!
3,It‚Äôs not bright enough to take pictures like I do with my bigger ring light it‚Äôs bright enough to do makeup but I tried taking photos with it ant didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations. It is okay/good quality to have light to do makeup but not good enough for photos.
4,This is a good product! The lighting is amazing and it works well. The only thing I would say is wrong with it is that the tripod doesn't stay on that well.
1,Received in April 2022 light no longer powers on as of Aug 2022.
5,Just the kind of light I needed. It's bright plus it has different modes.  Perfect for my makeup pics.  It's worth every penny!!
4,Shipping was accurate. The light itself it very bright and i love the different lighting options.
3,Great product for lighting my den
5,This light was a steal.  It does everything i need it to. Couldn't ask for better.
5,The brightness is definitely a lot brighter than I was expecting which is great! Definitely helps me take a lot better and clearer photos
3,I totally love the I get this right away.  I love amazon prime and the deliver photos. I love the stand and the phone adapter is perfect for what Im looking for but The only thing the I hate is the light I feel the is not that bright And for that reason it doesn‚Äôt work for me
4,Love the light and phone clip. Tripod legs are low quality. Good enough for price.
3,I really love the look and different levels of brightness on this light however the thing isn't stable with a naked iPhone 6 and the hotshoe I received does not fit the light. The light honestly wanted to topple over on itself if the legs aren't right. I didn't feel secure with an attachment doesn't attach securely. I really love the light but I'm returning and using the other light i bought cause the reviews on this one were kinda iffy.
3,This product has rust and corrosion on some parts right out the box. Not sure how but when paying for a NEW  product I expect better quality.
5,AMAZING LIGHT HOLY CRAP!I was a little skeptical but it fits perfect in the corner I had ready for it on my desk. Love it!!!! And it took a min to adjust to the brightness but again. LOVE IT BUY BUY BUY
4,Great light I just wish the tripod was a little more sturdy.  The light snapped off after tipping over
5,Super easy to set up and use. I love how my face looks bright and natural on zoom meetings!
5,I have had it for 19 days now and the light already not working right it flicks on and off really don't recommend.
3,Worked great for the few months I had it then just stopped working randomly. I only use it a few days a week for short periods of time so it wasn‚Äôt due to overuse. It just didn‚Äôt last long for what I paid for it.
5,Works well but use a big USB power plug. I initially used an iPhone plug I had just laying around and it overheated. So the light ‚Äúdied‚Äù on me. I went and got the plug from my iPad and no problems since. Has 3 diff light color options and you can dimmer. I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase.
5,This definitely brightens up my lighting for zoom. I love the different options of color you have for this! I‚Äôve gotten compliments saying that my coloring looks good!
5,This is the perfect ring light for recording close up videos on your phone. I love how you can change the light color and have control over how bright you want the light. I would definitely recommend this light!
5,Love this ring light! Comes with a few different pieces not too difficult to assemble and easy to store. Definitely adds a nice brightness if you want to use it to take selfies or for makeup applying. Also has different light settings for a blue-ish light or regular light.
5,I like how this has 3 different light settings: warm cool and both. It‚Äôs very strong light and I like how it‚Äôs pretty lightweight. I can attach it to a tripod and also hang it from hooks.
4,I wish it would pivot better but this is perfect for the price
5,I love this ring lightIts great for photos I plan on using it when I travel
3,The glue came off of the tripod. It worked well until it broke. Lasted a little over a year. Disappointed.
2,Unless you have a rare higher voltage USB do not buy as this light will be too dim.
3,I wish it was a little sturdier and that I could raise the camera a little higher but for the price it‚Äôs sufficient
5,This is perfect for my gigs! I am a part time band and I couldn‚Äôt seem to find the perfect camera lighting when i take pictures or videos. It‚Äôs either a little dark or too bright until i found this tripos with adjustable lighting! It‚Äôs easy and so much fun to use!
5,I like the different levels of brightness and tones.
3,The stand is not well made it collapses very easily. The camera older is also not very strong and tilts easily.
3,It‚Äôs a dope light but the legs are a joke lol. Very little you can do with the positioning bc the legs won‚Äôt hold up.
5,I bought this one because I need a light to help during my make up and it work great
4,so good even with it being that price
3,The only complaint I have for this product is that the light sometimes flickers when using it which is annoying .
5,This LED light works so good. I don‚Äôt know what I did so long without it. Definitely recommend. The face recognition and brightness are great.
3,The brightness is nice I just wish the height was adjustable. I should have read more. I recommend it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Excelente producto. I‚Äôm in love with this ring light La calidad de la luz es excelente y es bastante f√°cil de instalar.
5,Face recognition is great.  Clear camera quality and brightness.  This product is great for the new flow of media into YouTube.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It came as expected no damage in the packaging. It was very easy to assemble even without the instructions. It‚Äôs a great product especially if you plan on taking pics and recording.
5,I love the price and the quality of the product I wish the stand was a little longer but for the price I think is a fair price for the product very happy
5,When they said it‚Äôs bright they really mean it. I use it as my main lighting in my room now because of its brightness. Love it! It makes my photos look so much better too
5,I love it.
3,Light is good. Legs? Not so much. And the thing that holds the camera is wobbly and difficult to assemble.
5,While working from home this light is perfect for creating the perfect lighting for any Zoom or Teams setting.
5,bright
4,I thought it would be brighter but all in all it‚Äôs not bad for the price.
3,I love the light but hate the tripod it came with. It‚Äôs cheap and can‚Äôt be adjusted. When you try to squeeze the legs in to make it a bit taller the legs keep sliding out. I also wish the camera clip could be turned so that my camera could sit upright and not sideways.
3,The light itself is great! It gives my dessert pictures a very professional look. My only complaint is the legs on the Tripod seem loose it‚Äôs hard to keep them from spreading more than you‚Äôre trying to position them to.
3,Really like it...the only problem that I have with mines is thts i can't get it 2 stand sturdy long enough i made sure it was screwed tightly with the help of my husband but it will still lean an slide. but other then that the light is wonderful.
4,Needs a longer cord
5,This is a great price and does the job. V swift delivery too x
4,Its perfect for up close pics and videos
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The ring light was so easy to put together. As well as the lighting on it works so well on all settings. I was so impressed that I‚Äôm looking to buy a bigger size ring light.
5,Purchased for my daughter so she had more light applying her makeup she loves the convenience and flexibility of it. Overall a great purchase!
4,I love it. It is amazing! I cant wait to do my makeup videos. I only gave it 4 stars because i am missing an item (bluetooth control thing)
5,This thing is amazing! Lighting is always an issue when there‚Äôs only so many good angles. But this thing?! Fixed all of that game-changer.Things to note:1) This will only allow the phone to be in landscape not portrait.2) It plugs into a USB port not a socket/outlet.
5,Great light had to buy another one for the since we both are online so much now.Great price also.
5,I use mine for pictures and social media and the brightness is very good better then i expected and I like how it has the different settings of lighting.It was easy to set up following the instructions and came very quickly.
5,Variable brightness/ tone USB power light weight also great for flat work. Great price.
4,The light keeps twisting even when the bolt is screwed all the way. Everything else is perfect.
5,It‚Äôs so bright and easy to use. The only downside is the tripod...a little unstable but I have a tripod...so I use that instead. Apart from this everything else is perfect! Love it!
3,Flimsy as hell and doesn't last long. Don't waste your money.
5,It works super well! I love that there are a bunch of different modes and settings. It‚Äôs good for photos but also for zoom meetings you‚Äôll look very professional!
5,It's a gift...no idea how the quality is but it arrived on time and is nicely packaged.  Item looks good...we shall see.
5,It's easy to set up and use I'd recommend a 6' distance or so from your targets. The variable hues help adjust the light to be just as you need it.
4,Good product
5,Perfect lighting for social media video conferencing pictures etc. Easy setup simply user features. Definitely a good starter ring light for smaller projects
2,A lot smaller then I thought it would be but I think its because I read the description wrong. I thought it meant the stand would be 10 inches not the whole thing.The lights okay but again- not what I expected. Unless you're standing really close to it it doesn't work because it wont reach you if you're standing farther away. So its ultimately pointless for me.The part that holds your phone is also very weak and won't stay in place if you tilt it up or down. It will just fall over.I could have gotten a WAY brighter taller stand for the same price somewhere else.
5,I love my table top ring light. I use it for my live video for my clothing boutique.
4,A bit small and flimsy but otherwise it does what it‚Äôs meant to. The base/stand is the wonky part.
5,I love this ring light! Makes all the difference with pictures & videos! Easy to set up and to use.
4,I loved everything about this except putting it together. I wasn‚Äôt able to get it tight on the tripod connection and it‚Äôs not very stable.
5,Love the size! It‚Äôs easy to adjust move around and put wherever I need. Perfect for meetings and making videos.
5,The light works extremely well I love that it‚Äôs small but still provides a lot of good lightening also it‚Äôs perfect for when I want to take good pictures of my make up it fits perfectly on my vanity. For the price it‚Äôs pretty great I would recommend!
5,This ring light is very handy. It gives enough brightness to take great photos and videos. I love how my phone can attach to the center of this ring light. Super easy to use and easy to carry if traveling. Definitely worth the money.
4,Muy buen producto
5,This is such a great ring light and it‚Äôs super affordable!! There are several options for lighting colors and brightness. It holds my phone well and can be used vertically or horizontally!!
4,Stand too flimsy..other then that not a bad buy
3,Nice ring light but the stand quality is completely horrible. I had to purchase another tripod.
4,I really like itso beautiful
5,Brought this for my girlfriend. Likes to do tik too videos. Well she loved it and it works great. Only complaint by me is its not to sturdy.
5,Great travel size light ring! As a make-up artist I take this with me for clients‚Äô pics and to look at the overall detail of makeup blending. Have used for videos as well and it makes a stunning difference!
2,This is just a ring light and tripod. The tripod is not study so I recommend switching it out for a camera tripod. I have a hard time getting the light to come on. I have to click the power button several times before it stays on. I've tried adjusting the lighting and plugging to a different power source but nothing helps. I may be looking for a better quality one  but if you are just getting started the light is good.
1,The part that holds my phone in place broke within two weeks of having it. It was handled very gently it was not a user error. Just built very poorly with cheap thin plastic.
5,works well in my study
3,This is super helpful & love the light options but I had to give it three stars because the tripod doesn‚Äôt stay up very good at different heights... pretty disappointed.
5,Smaller lights with no adjustability sell for $10 more in stores.  The tripod is kind of lame but it will get the job done.  I use mine for my face light for streaming. The brightness adjustment is nice. Don't be afraid of It being cheap just go for it.
3,UPDATE: returning because it is very unstable and I am not satisfied with quality.Doesn‚Äôt attach itself very securely and has a wiggle to it but for the price it‚Äôs worth it. Light and easy to carry with.
5,Great product. Light is very bright and lights up my face very well for webcams. Comes with many attachments all very useful. I didnt use it in my photo but i do see the use.
5,This is a great light! 3 different color choices for led setting. Looks great. Easy to assemble and holds up well. As good as more expensive lights. Only thing I wish it had was a remote but for the price I'll take it!
5,The ring light was very easy to set up in less than 5 minutes.  It is a great tool for those needing improved photos for selling products/items on EBay/Etsy/etc.  Being reasonably priced was a bonus.
5,This is the perfect size ring light. Perfect for all photos and videos! It is easy to transport and it works perfectly!
2,The tripod is tiny and not very stable. The light does a weird flicker thing if not plugged directly into a wall and you don't get the adapter to plug into a wall. I tried plugging in to a USB on the computer and it just flashes.There is no clip to use this with a computer just the flimsy tripod. Yet to see how this does at a distance from the subject like we need it for for right in front of my face on a computer it wasnt the greatest lighting.
5,Gives off a lot of light for being a small/cheaper light. Love the settings and adjustability. I can also put it on my large tripod as well and still have a phone holder! Which I love a lot.
5,I've been dealing with bad lighting and this solved the entire problem.  The stand and mount are awesome and I am very happy with the price/value.  :)
5,My granddaughter used this light in college during rush! Everything was done virtual. She was happy said it worked great and she's in the sorority she wanted!
3,heats up super quick and gets really hot please be careful using this
3,Light turns off randomly.  Seems that the usb gets heated and it shuts down.
5,Love this product! Easy to assemble. If you have a separate Tripod that comes with a remote you can attach the ring light to it easily.For those who don‚Äôt the only thing I wish it would have had was a remote control to take photos/videos
5,It's the perfect size for a vanity table. Its not very stable even when all screws are tightened. It takes alot of stabilizing to get it to stand. The different settings are great for different looks.
5,It sits well on my desk and does not take up much space. It adds the right amount of lighting for video calls on my laptop.
5,I love the three light modes and that you can make each brighter or dimmer.  I use it for work.Love the way it can sit on my desk.
3,The light died within 6 months. The tripod is a joke had to use one that I already had.
5,Everything looked good when I opened the box but this was for my Granddaughter and my son bought her the same item so I had to return the one I purchased.
4,Had some issues with my ring light but the business reached out right away and offered a solution. Thankful for this.
5,Works wonderfully and does tip over or slide! Putting together was a breeze didn‚Äôt even need the instructions. It doesn‚Äôt come with a wall out put it‚Äôs just USB so keep that in mind. All in all it‚Äôs what I needed.
5,Love it love the height of this little thing. The brightness is what I love the most! Great quality.
3,The wire has a poor connection after a few months.
5,These were gifts and they work exactly as expected and made 2 tweens very very happy.
3,It suddenly stopped working in less than a year.
3,It wasn‚Äôt bad for a few months but the parts are so cheap that it one of the parts broke that hold the phone.  Not only that it‚Äôs hard to get the phone into the holder at times.  Will not use the same brand again
4,Nice size ring light
3,The light is really nice but the stand of the light takes a while to adjust and is unstable.
5,The package came next day. It was really easy to put together. It‚Äôs really nice but the top two buttons on the remote doesn‚Äôt light up like the other two.
5,I like this product. I do wish that the arm that Hold your phone was a bit more sturdy but over all I can't complain. It didn't cost that much And it is getting the job done!
5,It‚Äôs so bright and so easy to maneuver. Used it while putting on makeup and came out amazing. Not to mention selfies are PHENOMENAL! Highly recommend. My sister loves it and plans on getting one as well!
5,It just perfect wish it have a retractable size in hight but works on a couple of books
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I‚Äôm so happy that my ring light came sooo quick! It came with everything I wanted and the lights so are bright and beautiful! I look forward to filming my makeup looks especially at night!
4,The tripod stand‚Äôs legs are a bit unstable and don‚Äôt stand upright for long. This product isn‚Äôt made the best but for the price it will do.
5,Exactly as pictured ... now if I can keep my 2yr old from breaking it ü§£
5,I love it!! Super and easy to use the perfect size for my pictures videos and zoom reunions. 100% recommended.@joycemakeupuae Joyce Sosa ü§©
5,For the price especially this gets the job done well. The camera fits neatly in the center and the light levels are adjustable.
5,The item was as stated.  It was easy to assemble and worked well for video chats.
5,I love my new ring light!! Very easy to assemble & operate! 3 different temp & brightness settings are awesome for different settings! & the phone attachment allows for your phone to swivel around!! :) Highly recommend this product!!
5,Tripod is flimsy and you have to place the light very closely for use. Not good for my purpose but maybe better for cell phone pictures.
3,the tripod legs are fine if you have the space for them to be fully extended on a table or counter top & then it will support the phone the light part works great with different light shades & brightness.
5,SPREADS LIGHT WITHOUT THE GLARE OF FLASH.
5,so In love!! can't wait to make new videos and take awesome pictures. the tripod is a little flimsy but as long as you make sure everything straight and even it'll work fine! very happy
3,The tripod that comes with this is a joke. It has no screw to tighten the legs and it just falls. The light is but as bright as they make it seem and is only good for close up selfies. Might be good for some but not me.
5,Love the brightness and the ability to change the colors and their brightness. Has definitely added significant quality to my videos. But I didn‚Äôt notice any facial recognition and the part that holds the phone doesn‚Äôt always stay on good. Overall a pretty good product for the price.
3,The ring light works well. The stand itself has already broken.
3,I think it has a very bright light but within the first day of use it the brightness adjustment button on the remote stopped working and now it‚Äôs stuck at a medium level.
3,Using the light for to long overheats and shuts off the light. You would have to unplug it and let it cool down. Other wise I‚Äôd give it 5 stars.
5,Perfect size very durable light weight easy to put together lights are perfect lighting for Lives.
5,it's been amazing using this the stand can be annoying sometimes but it gets the job done. I hope they add more stands in this such as one to add on top of ur monitor for example if you are streaming etc.
5,I cant light for my daughter  for Christmas  she loved it fast shipping
5,Great light for at home videos and selfies  very easy to assemble! Gives you a few different light colors and you can have it as bright or and low as you like it!
5,Works wonderfully. I took this photo with my phone and the lighting on my face looks awesome! Definitely takes your selfies to a different quality :)
5,I'm fascinated with this ring light it's exactly what I wanted light size is perfect  I'm really happy üòä
5,I am a brown skin African American woman and it it was great having my rich skin tones up so wonderfully in my Zoom meetings. Excellent product.
5,This product was great! It‚Äôs a great size and was exactly what I was expecting! 10/10 would recommend!!
5,I‚Äôm so excited to finally have one of these! I paint and love that I can now take video of myself painting with good lighting! You can change the color of the light as well as the brightness.
3,The stands legs do not lock so the phone weight tips the whole thing over.
5,Muy buen art√≠culo y de mucha ayuda pero solo se puede poner a una altura estar√≠a mejor si se pudiera poner en diferentes tama√±os
5,It was beautiful my granddaughter loves it will buy again bright great for phone an computer great gift
3,The dual warm light and LED setting was my favorite but sadly after 10 uses half of the warm lights have burnt out. Very disappointed.
5,I really appreciate the company because they solve the problem that I was having it reached out to me and made me feel very comfortable about reordering with him very satisfied thank you once again...
5,Wow this light is amazing! I like to take selfies and this gives me the right amount of light for the photo no matter what. I'm also using it for videos amd the light ring helps get the right shot. It's wasy to put together too!
5,This is a great light has a few different settings but for the price it‚Äôs super amazing
5,It's a useful device. Great for facetiming/videocalls/video.  I like the ability to set the temperature to 3 settings and different brightness values.Updated:. The seller has been proactive in resolving issues. For that I have updated my rating.
5,Muy buen producto.  Buena terminaci√≥n.  Buena luz.  Sencillo y pr√°ctico.
5,I love my ring light fast shipping came in a day the ring size is perfect to me a big ring light and gives me great lighting to take videos or take pictures. It‚Äôs worth the money to buy
5,Yeah! This is pretty cool. I love how it doesn't overpower my at-home desk. So happy with it.
5,I love using this for instagram selfies. It just gives my face a little extra glam. Easy to use and change for different angles. Highly recommend!
5,I am very pleased with this item. My photos for my business look very professional now that I have the perfect lighting. I recommend this light for anyone whether it‚Äôs for photos or video recording on social media. Very worth every dollar.
2,The light itself is great works nicely - problem is it is made with very flimsy parts.The tightener for the phone holder was stripped after using it only 3 times (and please believe me I did not tighten it down that much) same for the tightener for the tri-pod to stay level - stripped. Made the light ring unusable; phone no longer stays in place tripod no longer stays in place. Gave it away  and buying a new one today.
3,Legs could be more sturdy but overall I like it
1,Absolute junk.  I bought two of these one for home and one for work.  Both have quit working.
4,Nice
5,Great customer service and replaced product works great. The stand is short like I expected. I am using for product photos not YT videos.
3,The stand doesn‚Äôt work
5,I have a side job teaching online and this ring light is exactly what I need for part time work!
3,It‚Äôs not a camera!!! The review is for a selfie light. The light works good. The casing and stand a cheap materials and very light. The light falls over because of weight distribution
5,I bought this light for a job interview and it has been awesome! It lights up my entire face.
3,The lighting is excellent but I had to wrap and tape the wire to get it to work after a few uses otherwise it wouldn't turn on disappointing but I guess you get what you pay for and it does get the job done
5,Great gift for my niece she used it all the time. Even when we FaceTime #OD
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! It‚Äôs super easy to use & put together. I plan to use it to film makeup looks & help with time lapse videos at home & it‚Äôs great! Perfect size for starters my opinion.
5,This product is great overall. But I will be returning for a refund. It does not take the pictures for you like most ring lights can. I need one that can take the picture for me without me clicking on my phone.
3,Works great! I love that I don‚Äôt have to add extra pieces to change the light. My only issue are the weak spindly legs. They‚Äôre just not sturdy.
5,So this is the perfect size for my live videos!! The color is threat: the stand is perfect and it‚Äôs so easy to move around with the tripod! So glad I don‚Äôt have to clip it onto anything!! Great purchase!
4,Very good
5,All around dope to have whether you‚Äôre a streamer or just want lit pictures...easy to assemble and definitely worth it. 10/10
5,I absolutely love the options for brightness and lighting. It allows me to find the perfect lighting for what I‚Äôm trying to record. Easy to put together and holds my phone (IPhone X) even with a bulky case.
5,This ring light provides perfect lighting for All types of video calls
3,Okay light but needs a horizontal clip attachment for monitors.
5,This a great light- much larger and way more wonderful that I expected at this price points.  No regrets here at all.
5,low Priced and it‚Äôs great for videos!! I would recommend this for beginners!  I really enjoy that I can change the temperature and brightness of this light. nice and light and not too bulky. The quality is overall very nice!
4,Would purchase again
3,Works well stand is very weak.Falls over all the time
1,I get it! I went for a cheaper budget so I thought this one would be at least decent due to the good reviews. First setting it up. The attachments are just weak. They don‚Äôt really stay tightened down in position. They kept coming loose I kept having to tighten and retighten and adjust the knobs that are supposed to hold your phone tightly to the light fixture. And then when I put stand on highest level the weight of the phone made it sink so it didn‚Äôt stand 10‚Äù like it said. If I wanted my phone to be angled down as it is also supposed to do the stand started to tip. Everything about it was pathetic really. I would definitely go a little higher priced than this item. You really are only able to use the light: the light seems decent but combine with phone and it‚Äôs a joke. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money. I am returning it and buying a different light stand
3,Those categories ^^^ don't apply to this product. The light is fine and the grip for your phone is fine. What does not work well is the tripod itself. It's very flimsy.
3,I got this ring light and it seemed a little flimsy so I had to be careful putting my phone in the part that holds it. Well as I suspected that part broke now I‚Äôm out on filming the light is great and it‚Äôs easy to essemble but it‚Äôs very cheap!
5,This is great for beginners wanting to enhance their pictures or make videos. Also just in general as a beauty light for daily makeup. Would definitely repurchase!
5,I like the different light settings on it
5,Great lighting when I am on Google meet out zoom
5,The brightness is great & having adjustable levels makes it even better!
3,The tripod doesn‚Äôt stay standing! Legs aren‚Äôt tight enough for the weight of my iPhone.  Had to put it in a box so it would stay up right!
5,Me facino el brillo y forma..las luzes..
4,EVERYTHING
5,With all of the Zoom meetings we now have to participate in this ring light is priceless.  You can achieve natural and flattering lighting easily there are multiple settings.
3,I love the lighted ring but it's very hard to get my rather large iphone into the holder.  Also the tripod is SO flimsy it's constantly moving.
5,So surprised by this product! It is so bright and easy to set up! So glad i decided to get it because i can‚Äôt live without it now!
5,I love this ring light! The size is perfect and it‚Äôs so easy to use.
5,Just received this and am excited to add it to the arsenal of tools for creating quality content. The instructions are clear and it's easy to assemble. Quality is good and as expected. Thumbs UP! :)
3,This light shines bright but the phone holder constantly falls off no matter how tight I tighten it to the light. Then it broke soon afterwards (holder broke not the light)
5,Easy to assemble.. brightness is A1. Very convenient phone holder that i love. My phone doesn't slip through like the rest i tried. But i wish the stand was a little taller luckily it fits on my tripod.
5,this is the best purchase i‚Äôve made üòçüòç
2,I'm surprised this got so many good reviews. The light is nice but the stand is extremely annoying! it keeps falling and slipping. Whoever made this really didn't think about  how to support the light and the weight of it. Also the attachment that comes with it is always coming off of the light and falling off. No matter how many times I tighten it it will always come off. Once your phone is on there it does not support the weight. Extremely annoying and disappointing
5,Product works really well and is exactly what I ordered. Nice and bright with the 3 modes and different brightness levels for each.
5,Amazing product! My makeup and pictures look great! The 3 different lighting setting is very convenient. And I love the fact that it has an iPhone and camera mount.
5,I love it I use it all the time. It works great it‚Äôs portable and worth every penny. Also makes a great gift.
5,Best purchase I ever made and easy to set up. My photos look 100x better!
5,The light brings out the colors!!!
1,After using it for a total of maybe 5-10 hours it quit. Totally dead.
5,Love this product! I use it EVERYTIME I‚Äôm making a video or taking a picture. It has awesome lighting and I love how it can hold your phone!
5,This is honestly a pretty good darn ring light. I see SO MANNNY COMPLAINTS about the x being too heavy I have the xr (slightly bigger) and it‚Äôs perfect OBVIOUSLY you gotta take the case off but no biggie. Perfect for my fb lives + YouTube. 9/10 would recommend.
3,Great for price but legs are flimsy.
5,This little ring light is super bright and very effective. I love it for doing my makeup.
5,I definitely recommend this 1000% this works so beautiful! The brightness tones are amazing. So glad I took the chance and bought this :)
3,At first the product was really good. However just in less than a month It stopped turning on. I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it now
4,Good
3,Products is ok. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to do. I feel like its cheap for the price you pay. It works fine for now. I‚Äôve only had it a few days.
5,This product is exactly what it looks like . I love it
2,The light itself is nice and bright but feels cheap- like really really cheap. Id give at least a 4 star for just the light but the ‚Äúphone mount‚Äù is absolutely crap. The engineering on the ball mount is seriously flawed- there‚Äôs no way to tighten the ball enough to keep the mount stable the phone inevitably begins to sink while filming. And the mini tripod it a throwaway item as well. I‚Äôm disappointed this item cost as much as it did and it feels like a rip off.
5,I gave it to my daughter for her online business and it has been great. The quality of her videos increased tremendously!!
5,Keep Up the Great Work üí™
5,Works just fine. The review prompts ask about Face Recognition but I don't think this does that... it's just a nice ring light for working from home.
5,I looking to setup a small studio for photo shooting this light is a decent light and helped me figure things out. The ring light works good It have 3 color light and brightness is adjustable. workable and helpful easy to use.
3,The light is fine but the stand is not great. The legs will keep sliding out so it‚Äôs hard to balance.
5,Came in perfect will update after Christmas because this is a gift thank you !
4,Very good for the price !
5,Great product my pictures haven‚Äôt ever looked so good. Having three light temperature settings is a great plus! Must buy
5,This is a great ring light for a fantastic price. I love the fact that it comes with an attachment to hold your phone to make photography even easier. This is exactly what I needed for my wildlife photography. very pleased!
5,I wanted it for my makeup table and it worked out perfect!!! Love it
5,I like it has so many choices of light brightness I can easily find one that fit my skin color the best.
4,Thought it would be a little bigger but its still a great product. Needs something to adjust and stabilize the tripod.
5,I purchase this as a gift and my friend love it
3,This light is just ok.  I like the 3 settings of the lights and that part is all fine.  But the tripod is terrible!  it barely holds the weight of the ring it wobbles and can't stay balanced.  Disappointed.
5,The LED Ring Light is versatile. You can use it for table lamp videos selfies and make-up light.There are 3 levels of lighting.
2,It powers on & has all the pieces however the built-in controls do nothing. I can't turn it on/off adjust the brightness or adjust the warmth/coolness as was advertised. I have to unplug it to turn it off. The tripod & phone holder is also not the best & they lean downward.  You get what you pay for in that aspect I suppose but I'm actually annoyed that the controls don't work.
5,Easy set up.  Makes a real difference.
5,Family Review: We love this ring light. It's super bright and the color options are great. Great for indoor photoshoots. Great quality for the price point!
5,Wife has been asking for this for awhile. She loves it! The modes and the brightness settings are great. Easyo adjust. She likes it for makeup. Trying to keep my daughter away from it....
1,I only used this for the light about 6 minutes a day and it died after 4 months. I realize it wasn‚Äôt super expensive but I do think anything should last longer than 4 months.
3,I was disappointed to see that the legs do not extend on this tripod. Otherwise it is a very good tabletop ring light.
5,Love it! I wish I purchased it sooner. Worth the money. Holds my cell phone just fine. Phone holder is adjustable.
3,Only thing I wish it had a stand!
3,This product does not act as a regular tripod. You cant adjust it higher or lower. It sits about 3 inches off the surface.
3,Pros: this is a ring light that attaches to a smartphone so technically I got what I paid forCons: for the price this is made extremely cheaply
3,After a few months the electronic component begins to go out and the light no longer works. Very disappointing.
5,love this especially for my virtual work meetings! kinda feels cheaply made but you get what you pay for. It works perfect!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I wanted to start making new videos and needed a light to make me look bright. It is not hard to assemble but can take a few tries. It works with a USB plug. I like the quality of my face with the light.
2,I found this device to be very limited.  The lighting improves the picture but I was limited to a horizontal display. When I used this to have FaceTime with family in England one of us was always transmitted at a 90 degree angle making for an awkward if amusing conversation. I returned the phone holder.
5,Loveee it! I sell jewelry so I do lives on Facebook & this is perfect for the lighting! I definitely recommend!!!
5,Its perfect for walking around with & traveling
5,Genial para tomar fotos o grabar de cerca.
5,TIGHTEN FOR HEAVIER PHONES BUT WORKS GREAT AND ATTACHES TO MY TRIPOD
5,I like this ring light! It‚Äôs a good size and very bright!
5,For the price this is a great value to lighting up your face for web calls. Nice controls for warm and cool light.
5,The wife loves this! The 3 light modes are pretty cool! Works well. It can be used for numerous things!
5,This Is a great light for selfies and videos. The brightness of the light gives an appearance of a younger looking skin. This was a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it
5,Easy to put together. Very bright great for makeup lovers
4,Very great brightness but the tripod could've been a little longer and sturdier.
5,My videos and photos look so much better with this thing! My stream looks great as well!
3,The kegs are not very strong so they tend to spread out easily. I used it 3 times and the part that attaches to the stand for your phone broke after 3 uses. Will not purchase again.
3,No funciona su base
5,I‚Äôm very happy with this Led ring light I like very for my work in makeup thank you
5,It‚Äôs perfect for my office space! I‚Äôm now working from home and I love the light I get when on Microsoft Teams!
4,Phine holder doesnt always stay in place ...doesnt tighten enough but overall great product
5,My husband loves this. Good quality options and seems durable. (We have cats)
1,You get what you pay for. You spend cheap you get a cheap light. The clamp where the phone connected was always wobbly. The light died after 4 months.
3,It‚Äôs good. Only issue Are the legs. It‚Äôs not sturdy enough and the legs start sliding bringing the entire thing downward. Wish it would be tighter so it can stand longer
5,Has adjustable brightness settings. My only complaint is that it slides on certain services making it hard to stand it up.
5,Different brightnesses also had a orange and white light.
5,Great lighting for selfies
5,I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this sturdy. I hope it lasts a long time.
5,Not as bright as I would of liked and sometimes the lights turn off by itself! I still love my ring light still
3,I don‚Äôt like the stand!! Once you put you phone on the light it falls over the stand isn‚Äôt sturdy enough if you‚Äôre needed it to sit higher up. Overs it‚Äôs a good product.
3,This tripod ring is okay. I would not say it is worth the money though. Mine does not seem secure or sturdy. I would not buy this again.
5,I got it today and tried it already! I love the different types brightness.I hope it will last.
5,Love love this light! The price was amazing compared to some of the others I saw and it works great! Couldn‚Äôt be more happy with my purchase!
4,I‚Äôm in love
5,Very bright . May need to order a longer tripod & legs are really supportive unless on a sturdy surface. Other than that everything is great !
5,This is going to be my new best friend! An affordable big ring light!! I am starting to do a lot of live videos so this is a great source of light and it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space!
5,Compact small lights awesome& How old are great very happy
3,The device made such an impact to my picture quality it does a good job even though the mechanics for the tripod are sub par.
5,This item is light weight and easy plug in accessible with cell phone.
5,Omg this thing is amazing! So bright and makes every video and pic look great. Bought it for my daughter for tik toks lol
3,This was great when I first got it but just recently it hasn't been working properly. It begins to flicker and then shuts off consistently.
3,Light is superb but the stand is wobbly . One of the knobs  were broken when I opened it
5,Hello this gets the job done for lights around our office when we are at our standing table
5,Super bright and great size for use if as a hand held w/phone
2,I used this ring light for video conferencing in rooms with mixed or poor light. It worked fine for that. Until it began shutting off randomly.  I returned it for that reason.
3,Good but a little screw up is when you put your phone on it you gotta super glue to hold in one position
3,The material is not that good. However it is good for recording the video. But I don‚Äôt think it worth for the price with the quality.
1,No tripod no power cord. It‚Äôs completely useless. Unfortunately I missed the return window.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I always make a video and chat with my family and friends but never there are enought light. I love this product because my family can see me clearly.
2,Not that great.
5,Working for 3 months 100%
5,It helps with our zoom meetings.
5,Bought this for my 50 year old mom for her hair business.  She put it together  and shes honestly  terrible  with technology.  So theres that lol.Its turned her picture  quality  around.
5,I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. The lights are bright and the stand is sturdy. It works well for what I need. If you‚Äôre considering buying this product buy it!
5,Me encantan la variaci√≥n de colores y es lo suficientemente fuerte para iluminar a 30-50 cent√≠metros perfectos v√≠deos si lo usar√°s para ello.
4,Great power and lighting
5,The light is everything!!. I am very happy with this item. It‚Äôs worth the money
2,You guys...Unless you plan to never touch the light look elsewhere. The Tripod is a joke it‚Äôs has the skinniest legs that are not sturdy unless they‚Äôre all the way expanded. The phone clip/holder is only center when there is no phone on it; when your phone clips in its off centered to the right.. DRIVES ME CRAZY! The lighting is impressive- but that‚Äôs it. Every time I clip in my phone I have to readjust the entire thing. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
5,Love this light for getting ready and using it for my makeup clients! Easy to travel and pack!
1,The tripod is a joke. How can such a thin/weak tripod hold a heavy ring light. There‚Äôs literally no support. Also the ring light is very cheaply made for the price point - the brightness is not very good and some of the parts you have to assemble are so cheaply made it feels like they‚Äôll break anytime you take it apart for storage. I found a cheaper and smaller ring light that does the job and is much brighter.
5,Such a great product for a great price. Great to have for beautiful photos.
5,This ring light is really good for making tiktoks absolutely love how it works.
5,I absolutely love it; super happy with it wish I would have bought one sooner. Only thing that I have to complain about is the piece that holds the phone came messed up and I had to fix it before use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Perfect product for such a good price. Easy to assemble and use. Definitely would recommend 10/10.
5,I have not used a filter on a single photo since using this ring light!!! LOVE IT!
5,Works well and easy to use
3,Keeps sliding down and it's really hard to get the phone in and out of the clamp.
3,If you have a larger smartphone this product is going to disappoint unless you by another piece that can actually hold your phone.
5,I love it that its not so bigits easy to store!Easy to use and set it upMakes nice photos
3,Not my favorite. Wish it had the ability to charge and use without plugging in but for the price it‚Äôs fine. Does the job!
5,It brightens up everything around it people ask me why I look lighter in videos and it‚Äôs because of this I highly recommend
5,Everything about ring is nice. Would but again.
5,seriously LOVE this ring light!! makes my pictures 10x better! definitely don‚Äôt regret this purchase!!
5,So far so good! I‚Äôve used it as a lighting for doing my makeup or I‚Äôll set it up in front of a ‚Äúbackdrop‚Äù to take some pictures. Bright and I like the different settings of cool/warm/both.
5,Does everything it is supposed to do! Thank you!
5,Perfect lighting for zoom calls or making videos. Even great lighting for applying makeup
5,Give me the perfect amount of light went Im live for my viewers while doing make up . Perfect size table top
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Very good quality and can't beat the price!  Perfect for the novelist video or pix takers!
5,It makes my camera so clear! I really like it for my home office during conference calls!
5,Easy to use and set up was a breeze. I noticed a difference immediately when I participated in a video conf call on my MacBook.
4,It works.
5,The product was great also easy to install. The seller sent it quick and safe. I would definitely recommend to everybody.
3,Nice little  light however  it turns  off on it's on after a while
5,Item is great. Pretty good for webcam usage. I work telework and its perfect for Zoom.
5,The light was a lot brighter than I thought I love how I can control the brightness of all three of the light modes. Amazing product!
3,Not sturdy enough for what I need it for. It toppled over several times within a 10 min timespan. It wouldn‚Äôt stay upright the clip is secure for just the phone not the phone and a case. The light is good though but I‚Äôll have to return it and keep looking.
5,Great purchase for the money
5,It is such an amazing product !! The only thing that was tricky was assembling it all together. But over all it had such a great lighting !
5,I bought this for my daughter who does makeup videos and she loves it. Holds her phone just right and she loves how it has 3 lighting settings.
3,This is great for pictures but it causes a high pitch noise when filming and it‚Äôs kinda loud in your videos
5,I needed a light for applying make up and I wanted to shoot better photos and videos for my work. I love this light and it's easy to take with you when you travel. Highly recommend.
3,There is no face recognition. Overall it was great until it randomly broke two months later.
3,Easy to assemble but the part that coneects the phone holder to the ring light stand always loosens and the phone turns. I have to wedge something in there for it to be sturdy.
3,The size of this lamp is great for a desktop but it is simply not bright enough
5,Everyone asks me what studio I have set up when I FaceTime or post pictures online.. this is a MUST HAVE for good lighting!!!
5,I ordered similar products from another company but had to return them because the light will tilt forward from the weight of the phone. This model works well for shooting YouTube videos.
3,Light isnt very strong and it feels very cheap. Definitely get what you pay for. The plastic inserts are hard to press in and sound like they're breaking when you do.
5,Excellent quality product with different shades of lights brightness shine.
5,This is amazing! I love the colors and it is perfect for photography! Love the stand it comes with and the phone holder is steady. This was a great buy!Exceeded my expectations.
5,LOVE THIS! Such an awesome find and purchase.
5,Makes everything brighter and better! I use for parties and my blog page. Definitely recommend this product.
5,Mine got stolen so I didnt get to use it! But seems like a fantastic product
5,Excellent light for taking product pictures. The light has two spectrums to work with and is bright enough. The tripod is perfect size and doesn't get in the way when taking pictures
5,I absolutely love it. I go on Facebook live all the time and absolutely love it !!!
5,Works great simple & quick set-up! Has three light settings and can easily be adjusted
1,Bought this January 2022. Lasted 6 months. Will no longer power on.  Used only occasionally. DO NOT BUY!
4,Nothing special. Not bad and not excellent either.
3,Gives a lot of light glare on glasses too much to use with a webcam.  Otherwise a really good light for many reasons.
5,This was my second purchase. It was on sale. I used it for my virtual sessions.
5,Very awesome I use mines to twitch stream and it's not hot after 4 hours of streaming.
5,Nice and bright!!! Get product for the price my only complaint would be the stand is a bit unstable but nothing unmanageable.
5,Bright Ring Light! Love it! Good Price & tough.
5,I used to video call with my mom who lives in Asia.With this ring light she can see me better.One thing need to improved probably the tripod. It need to be more sturdy.
5,So great I had to buy a second one for my wife. May buy more. Great lighting for streaming and for photos. Really showed my facial colors
5,This was a gift for a 14-year-old aspiring youtuber. She had no issues getting to work without help-- and she typically needs help with everything. Definitely worth it for the price.
5,Works great!
5,So far so good.  Had to exchange first one for not working after 3 days but got a replacement and all is well!  Thank you !  Very good lighting and perfect size!
5,So easy to assemble and so bright! Super cute! I wish it was taller but most taller ones are more expensive so this still does its job! Love!
3,A little unstable and cheaply made plastics but it works ok for a first one.
5,Came in on time. Product is what it‚Äôs described.
3,I‚Äôm having trouble with the pan tilt for on how to connect it to the lightSquare part does not detach
3,The base is not as sturdy and I thought it would be. It does have awesome lighting though.
3,I wish this product was able to light up without having to be plugged into an electrical outlet while using. This limits you on how far you can go.
5,Perfect for table top recording
2,After just a month I noticed segments of the ring were bright and others were dim.  It quickly went to areas that would not light up or were flashing on and off.  Eventually 80% of the ring would not light at all!
3,The lighting in this ring light is amazing for the price but the tripod stand doesn't hold when you put your phone on it.
5,The light has GREAT lighting. Its a great product to sit on a vanity. The part where you slide you phone on is a little loose. I recommend this product.
3,Turns off on lowest brightness. Aside from that its great
5,I have used it for make up and photos and it is great. The tripod is just okay but it does an okay job.
5,Super bright and great quality! It's perfect for my mini videos and selfies. The 1st I bought had a short in the cord the seller replaced it and I couldn't be happier! Love it!
3,Brightness not great
5,I like the light a lot. Perfect for travel very compact. Fits in a compact. The cord attaches to any USB port. Just so convenient.
2,The light itself works wonderfully however it is very cheaply made. The very first time that I used it I noticed that the plastic screw piece to fashion the phone holder onto the ring light itself was snapped. It will not hold my phone or camera in place they always fall backwards as the holder slides out of position. The screw will not hold tension. It basically makes the entire ring light useless.
5,I bought two. They completely met my needs for the best lighting for virtual meetings and presentations.
5,Definitely would purchase another one
5,I use it to take pictures of my products and it does the trick! Love it
5,Was weird how it came it was like someone had done it prior but didn‚Äôt finish it? No damages and the brightness is amazing! And holds the phone really well
5,Needed this for virtual teaching and it‚Äôs definitely doing its job. Great ring light.
5,I absolutly loved this ring lightperfect lighting and perfect size .
5,Nice and bright. Easy to use
3,It doesn‚Äôt last turns off fast over heats not worth it
5,It‚Äôs absolutely amazing! It‚Äôs even brighter in person than some of the pictures show. Easy to set up as well!
5,I love this. The tripod is crap but the rest is worth the value/price at around $30US.
1,The stand barely holds the weight of my phone. The top part kept coming undone. I had it for a few days. No worth the money.
5,my child really likes this tool i make it happy and happy the tool is easy to use and very simple the goods have no safety when arriving home very satisfying.
5,By far one of my best purchases. Fits perfectly on my vanity and the three options are great for getting ready for different events.
5,It is nice for the price and holds my phone well
5,Like the light ring lighting is perfect
5,Omgggggg y'all this light is everything! It has 3different lights colors and like 8/9 dimmers and brighteners if I said that right! Just know it's worth the money
3,Light flickered.
5,Purchased to do make up tutorials using my phone. The brightness levels are amazing and the different colored light options are helpful. Easy to assemble.
2,I have barely used this and the lights have already burned out. It worked well before that happened but the tripod slipped easily. Didn‚Äôt stand up tall
3,The light works well but the tripod is very flimsy and horrible.
5,Great addition to my beauty room .. the lighting is just right for makeup videos and more .
5,Just perfect for my professional zoom sessions. Thank you.
3,Good
5,Good amount of brightness. Feels a little cheap but gets the job done.
5,Great for the price. Works great and my daughter's even love it for makeup. Cant beat that.  Quickly arrived and packaged well.
3,Not what I expected is of cheap quality I bought a cheaper one on eBay and it was by far better in every aspect of design and quality
5,This light is perfect to use to apply make-up or do a video - it sits perfectly on a desktop.
3,My phone doesn‚Äôt want to stay in the holder very well barely move it and it falls to the ground. Other than that it‚Äôs decent for the price.
5,The only thing i wish it had was a button to push to take the pictures instead of using the timer on the phone. Other than that love it!
5,Love that it is portable .
3,Flimsy not as ergonomic as I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs definitely a nice starting ring light
5,Good ring light very compact for small spaces good brightness
3,I really like it. It‚Äôs easy to put together and the light it very good and bright. But it won‚Äôt stay up no matter how much I tighten it the whole light goes sideways and fall down.
5,I bought this for blogging and it's absolutely perfect. Great light love the option of changing the light temperature.
5,My daughter love her ring light
5,Perfect lighting! Sturdy and durable.
5,Great for the price
3,Great gift the only problem is the tripod that comes with the light doesn‚Äôt stand so purchasing another tripod may be helpful one that‚Äôs a little more sturdy.
5,Does the job
5,Bought this for my daughter. Needed to add a 2nd light for her video shoots. She loves it. Arrived in good condition with all parts and pieces.
3,i love it but the tripod stand falls really quickly it doesnt stay up ..
3,The phone clamp that should attach to the light does not attach.
5,I freaking LOVE this ring light!!!!
5,i love it easy set up
5,LED is great technology for a small price. This unit features fine design with good materials.Highly recommend.
5,Using for virtual school as a teacher and it has worked great!
3,Decent product for the price but it‚Äôs really finicky and sometimes doesn‚Äôt turn on and has to be unplugged and plugged back in. The Tripod isn‚Äôt very sturdy and easily collapses with slight movement.
5,Must buy this!
5,Great for simple videos such as tiktok
1,The positive reviews for this thing HAVE to be fake. I sometimes have to just laugh at myself as I try to adjust the levers and legs on this poorly constructed terrible-quality product. The ring light is fine but the tripod is quite literally the worst I have ever encountered in my life. If once you get this thing set up you will never need to move or adjust it again you‚Äôll be fine but if you do need to change it‚Äôs positioning or make any sort of adjustment you‚Äôll either be laughing at yourself me or giving up and tossing this piece of junk in the trash.
5,Super bright and the brightness is adjustable!
5,Pretty great! Look forward to seeing my YouTube channel take off with help from this awesome device. Stay creative!  -Cre8tv_TV
5,Very easy to put together! I also love the different settings of brightness you can put it on!
5,Very nice. Easy assembly.Perfect for Facebook lives!
1,I have had this ring light for less than 4 months. It‚Äôs probably been used less than 10 times. I got it out today and it will not turn on. I‚Äôve tried multiple outlets just in case and still nothing. Very disappointing.Otherwise the light output is ok. The ability to change settings and brightness is nice though I usually had it on a pretty bright setting. You cannot really adjust the height. I also wish the cord was longer since it has to be plugged in.
5,My sister says she absolutely loves how she looks with this light.  She says its the best light that she has received!
5,Easy to put together even without instructions (which are included). Bright with great variety in settings. Using to create better light for Instagram craft videos.
5,Amazing product. Very easy to install and practical.
3,It‚Äôs ok for a little while I guess but mine came a bit broken my pan tilt was cracked overall it‚Äôs still a good product because it works.
1,Omg. I think this is the worst thing I‚Äôve ever bought off amazon. Maybe mine was just defected but the light colors only has two settings not three. The brightness and darkness buttons don‚Äôt work at all and neither does the on or off button. It also doesn‚Äôt come with an adapter so you need to make sure you have the right one. It barely holds my phone in place without flopping over. Very flimsy product. I‚Äôve used other rings before that light up my face so much better. I bought this one because I needed a mini size. Very disappointed.
5,This device performed as advertised. No problematic issues experienced.
5,This light plugs into my computer and helps me look professional for work video calls in the pandemic.
2,The light was working okay--I could tell a difference w the brightness etc nut then it went out and it wouldn't turn back on for the remaining hour and a half long call! I couldn't believe it. Wish I could return. Soooo frustrating!
5,The light is very bright and the product is easy to put together. After a little difficulty customer service made everything ok and were very responsive!
5,My favorite purchase!! It exceeded my expectation for the price it lights up my face amazingly when I do my makeup
5,Comes complete - just add camera
5,Nice features.
2,The ring wouldn't tighten into the lower gimbal and so if you try to move it the whole thing slips off the tripod.Also it sat too low on the desk. I didn't really want my chins highlighted and hadn't noticed there was no way to extend the light upward.The light was nice and the controls intuitive but I had to return it.
5,Perfect
5,It is everything I was looking for in a ring light
2,At first I thought this was great for the price but it completely fell apart after several uses. It is cheaply made and won‚Äôt hold your phone for long. The camera holder/base pieces just won‚Äôt tighten and fall over all the time. I was sad because the lighting was good and I thought it would get a great product based on other reviews.
5,Has a lot of lighting options
3,ON THE PHONE HOOK UP ITS PRETTY TOUGH TO PLACE  YOUR PHONE IN PHONE HOLDER.. I'M STILL TRYING TO DO.
5,I love it and all but I thought it was suppose to come with 2 I only got one
5,Good
1,Very disappointed in this product. If I could send it back I would but I threw the box away. The tripod legs are very weak and collapse with any weight on (like a phone) or even with its own weight of the light so it‚Äôs always falling flat down and you can‚Äôt adjust the height. The attachment that holds the phone in place falls off constantly (dropping my phone on the floor multiple times). The adjustment knobs do not stay in place no matter how hard you try to tighten them they wiggle loose and fall apart. I‚Äôve had this product two days and said more curse words in those two days than I have in my life. Very frustrating. Would not recommend.Only good thing... the light is good
5,This is a great light has multiple light settings perfect size works great
5,Love this ringlight! It‚Äôs improved my lighting for pictures and applying my makeup.
5,It‚Äôs very simple it‚Äôs crazy to think it was over 50 dollars but the brightness is amazing
5,Very easy to assemble. Different light settings. Doesn't take up a lot of space on the table top. No complaints thus far.
5,Great purchase.
3,This was missing the Light holder !!
5,This is so great I‚Äôm obsessed. I bought it to film a YouTube video. The set up was easy (watch the video if you have questions) and the light is bright. Would highly recommend.
5,I love the light... my phone holder is a bit wobbly and wont stay on most of the time but i just hold in my hand to take a pic.
5,I don‚Äôt like the phone stand but the ring light truly helps when applying make up.
2,The light works just fine but the tripod that came with it is trash. The legs of the tripod can‚Äôt hold the weight of a phone when it‚Äôs attached and the arm that holds the phone doesn‚Äôt stay in place it collapses under the weight of the phone.Honestly would have returned it if I hadn‚Äôt already recycled the box.
5,First LED light I‚Äôve purchased & I‚Äôm amazed by the quality ! I totally recommend! Great for a desk! A must for pictures!
5,lovely quality light. material doesn‚Äôt feel cheap and it can get pretty bright. is controlled by a switch on the cable and have been using daily since purchased.
5,Great deal!
5,Perfect lightning fits any where and easy assemble
5,Couldn't figure how to fit the phone in the ring light until I found out the thing stretches duh I love it worth the money for sure
5,matches the description
2,The cell phone holder is scraped and has scratches on it. Looks used as if someone else returned it and then they repackaged it. See photos. Otherwise the light works fine. I wish they would replace the cell phone holder. But I honestly do not feel like going through the return process. I wish it would've been in great shape already upon arrival.
2,Brightness was great but the phone holder itself will not hold my iPhone 11 pro max unless I take the case off. On top of that it can‚Äôt hold my phone in portrait orientation only landscape.
2,It‚Äôs good enough for the price. Doesn‚Äôt really tighten up well so the phone part moves. Also doesn‚Äôt extend (my fault) and you can only have your phone vertical if you turn the light sideways. The brightness is good however and the different colors/levels are nice.
3,I bought this product as a Christmas present for our granddaughter. The product appears to be fine however the package came through slightly damaged.
5,Awesome ring light!
5,My daughter loved this ring light she uses it for her selfies and for her love videos. The light has different light settings and a remote built in the cord. Great product!
5,Survivalist
5,Worth the money
3,It‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt stand well on its on.
5,The tripod is a little wobbly.
1,It does not work. It came in the mail already not working. Unfortunately I was out of town and missed my return period. Bad product. Also the light is super lightweight.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This product is worth the money.  Perfect for tutorials and all
3,It‚Äôs a little cheap built but if you get what you pay for !
2,I‚Äôm slightly disappointed. The quality is very cheap I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting but it wasn‚Äôt this. I can‚Äôt get the phone part to connect to the ring light no matter how much I try. I‚Äôve watched many videos and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs broken. It does have good light and I‚Äôm sure it will be useful. Just not what I was expecting
3,Was not very sturdy... returned
2,I was very excited at first because there were different modes and brightness settings but after one use it just started randomly turning off in the middle of shooting. I guess if you are buying for pictures it‚Äôs not a huge deal for the price but when you are 4:30 into a perfect 5 minute take and the light goes out.. it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. Will be returning.
5,Its a small portable light that i can use and set up in anyroom in my home. Its convenient and wasnt expensive at all. Good value for money!
1,This is one of the worst products out there. Flimsy doesn‚Äôt stand up correctly and over all a terrible product. Do not waste your money.
5,Awesome product! I cannot wait to do a Facebook live using this light! I will update review as soon as I do!
5,Perfect starter light kit!!! Easy to setup and to use!!
4,Da buena luz
2,I like that you can change the brightness level and the color of the light but the tripod legs would not stay put. If you accidentally touched it the legs would give out. When I put my phone in the older it was too heavy as the legs would not stay up.
5,This was a great purchase ! I am so glad that I bought this because the lighting is a 10/10 !
1,Absolutely horrible and very disappointing.The tripod itself IS NOT sturdy. It‚Äôs very flimsy and ANY movement causes it to fall. It can only stay in one position otherwise it‚Äôll fall over. You can hardly rotate your phone or the light otherwise it falls apart. The phone holder is super tough to open for my iPhone X and I couldn‚Äôt use it without taking off my case. Although It never dropped my phone itself apparently my phone was too heavy for it to hold. It never held up my phone straight. Also the light makes you very washed out. Doesn‚Äôt matter the setting it‚Äôs on or how low you may have the brightness the light quality is horrible. Definitely not worth it and will be returning. It‚Äôll be better to just spend a couple more dollars and buy a better quality item.
5,I like the different brightness that it offers.
4,Excelente
5,A mi hija le funciono bien para hacer sus v√≠deos
5,I absolutely love it! It turned out much better than I thought! Super bright and very easy to assemble!! A must buy!! ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Love it
5,My zoom meetings...
5,It's amazing arrived in 4 days.
5,Perfect for live streaming or making videos
5,i really really like it its cute and bright
3,Broke after 6 months and I can get it replaced. Don‚Äôt buy.
5,Awesome Product!! Easy assembly
5,My first ring light and I‚Äôm so impressed with the quality and the brightness... Highly recommend!!!
5,I love love love this light very easy to put together
3,I love the product overall except for the tripod it's not sturdy.
5,My daughter loves it.
5,The light is great I can take great photos etc
5,This is worth every penny!! Literally ü§™
5,Great product! Gets really bright and I like the fact that you can adjust the brightness and color
5,Works great
5,I like it and would recommend to friends
5,At first it was hard to assemble but when i read the instructions it was easy and now my pictures look better .
5,Very bright
1,It will break in a few months. I hardly used it and it snapped completely at the bottom of the ring. I moved it after loosening the base and it snapped. the plastic crumbled...
5,Amazing product! Worked exactly how i imagined  will definitely recommend this product to family and friends!!
5,Works great for the teenage social media user.
5,Very good product accidentally stepped on the USB end and broke mine üò¢
5,I like how easy it was to assemble used for taking pics of products for posting.
5,My husband uses it more than I do!
5,My wife loves it for pictures and it's great that it has different settings and brightness settings.
5,Had a minor difficulty with the phone clip but the company was amazing at addressing it and took great care of the issue!
5,bought this for my daughter for her birthday! she absolutely loves it!
5,The light is okay for this amount of money it works pretty well but the best thing is the nice attitude from the seller.
5,I like the difference it made during my video presentation.
5,Brightness
5,Great little product for my zoom meetings.  Received day after ordering.
5,So easy to use.I like that the setup is easy and I can started using it right away.Easy to attach your phone to it.
5,Zoom meetings. Just as desperate. Just received today 8/5/20.
5,Product is perfect for zoom call lighting!
3,It's bright but it's kinda cheap feeling
5,This works great and when I had a problem they sent me a new 1 right away with out any problems
2,The balance was hard to adjust once the phone was put in place. I have an IPhone 8 which is not so big but getting the tripod balanced and at the right position was more of a challenge than I thought it should be.
5,Me encanto lo uso para fotos y mi esposa para maquillarse
2,Flimsy. Can‚Äôt get it to stand. iPhone makes it fall over because it becomes top heavy. Seller refunded some money to us. They seem to care about their product. Maybe adjustments to it will be made and it will be worth the price. With a partial refund it does make it a little easier to justify the purchase. Plastic shouldn‚Äôt cost a lot. The brightness of the light is good.
5,Very easy to setup! And perfect for my work desk!
5,This ring light is so goodddddd. get it fr
5,Great light at a really great price
5,It was very easy to assemble and use.  Mades such a difference with light coming all around in the photos.  Love this!
5,Great for the price
2,Unfortunately my lights flickers I just opened my product and it is broken. There is no option offered to return or get a refund for this item. $49.99 and it went to waste! I really hope its not because I didnt purchase the safety protection. I didn't think it would be broken before I even got a full use.
5,I love it it‚Äôs perfect
5,Great for zoom meeting.
5,Great for a new MUA! My pictures look 10x better. Will definitely be upgrading soon.
2,I was really excited for this since I host a lot of calls from home and I was told a ring light helps with the lighting on the face.  Unfortunately the stand was not stable at all. Fell and broke the ring light within the first few days üòè
5,Love the outcome of my pictures
2,My ring light arrived with many defects.  The tripod base did not screw in properly which made the ring light unstable.  The brightness level did not work.  It worked on one setting (bright). I returned the product for a replacement because it fits my needs and fits into my space perfectly.  I hope the replacement is without defect.
5,PERFECTION.
5,Light works great! Nice and bright but has settings to make lighter and darker and change warm ness  too! Definitely recommend
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Lighting is great; Stand isn‚Äôt stable and moves around a lot. I would recommend investing in another stand.
5,Immediate Glamour!
2,I initially liked this light a lot (easy to set up and use) but it started flickering within a few weeks of purchase rendering it completely useless. Would not recommend.
5,Happy with this purchase. Perfect size to sit on my vanity. Offers amazing lightening at an affordable price.
1,The light itself was decent;however the tripod stand it comes with is so cheap that as it is I found it to be unusable.  Calling it a tripod is a stretch.  It‚Äôs more like 3 metal prongs with cheap plastic caps on the ends.  The one I got slipped all the time and could not bare the weight of itself let along when I hand my phone on it. If you want to strip it down and use a custom rig then I can see this working.  But as it is out of the box  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good product.  #unpopularopinion.
5,Me agrado
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†If I could throw this product out the window I would. The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt is because my window faces a highway and I would probably get arrested. It does not stand up it just slides down until it eventually knocks everything over in it‚Äôs path like dominos. The phone holder part just decides to fall off whenever it feels like it cracking the screen on my iPhone along with giving me the strong urge to grab a xanax to calm myself down from screaming at a light all night. Do not buy.
3,Came on time well packaged but the part that holds the phone broke in the third day
2,Worked super well at first light was great with good options. Two weeks later no longer lighting up. As others have said very cheap craftsmanship.
5,Good quality.  Small but bright... perfect to bring it anywhere with my pc...
3,One of the sticks to hold it up came off immediately
1,Stopped working in the middle of a live stream class on the 5th time I used it. Now the return window has closed so this was a COMPLETE waste of money. Also the legs have zero support and slide all the way out bringing the light completely to the ground and often falling over. It isn‚Äôt nearly supportive enough to hold a cellphone so I had to use a separate tripod and wedge the ring light between two objects in front of the phone. Totally totally useless product.
3,The product is cheaply made. It won‚Äôt even stand up!
5,Great product for price. Very easy to assemble and my daughter loves it!
2,The tripod legs slide out from under it.  You can only use it with the legs completely spread out down on the surface.  Would not buy again.
3,The legs on my trifold are not firm. They‚Äôre always sliding away and the light falls over.
5,I just got this product and looks very interesting but had to return because of quality
5,I love the item!! Highly recommended!Thank you!
5,I like the different tones
5,Perfect lighting diff modes to change from and 3 brightness settings. Perfect to get on live with
5,Thank you. Received it right away and it‚Äôs perfect for my needs. Perfect
5,Great great itemThis is like Christmas morning opening something you really wanted and finally treated yourself to it. I am happy to have this ring light.
5,This product works really well. The ring light is bright sturdy and durable all settings work effectively all 3 light colors are equally bright dimming works really well.
5,The good thing about that LED is that you can change the color. Good quality. Easy to use . üòá
1,Everytime I used this for a Live the phone clip holder gave me problems. The lock in place never worked right and I had to literally place the phone and not move it once placed. The stand is very flimsy and again once I set it up I could not dare move it.  Also the chord does not allow much length  I went to use it last week and the springs in the phone clip holder came out and completely broke off. I would not recommend this product at all it is just made extremely cheap and not well made at all. I now have to buy a whole new one in less than 3 months and I only used this one 8x.
5,LOVE IT!!!!! Gets really bright but u can adjust to the perfect brightness easy to assemble and affordable
5,Very good light !!! Cheap price and the lighting is so amazing for videos & ect.
3,Teenager love this. Gave as a Christmas gift. Had to order another one.
5,Worked as described. Would purchase again.
2,The light and ability to the change the color and intensity was great. But the tripod was terrible. The bolts wouldn't tighten anything in place and the legs were flimsy. The whole thing kept collapsing.
5,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she lovesssssss it. This was definitely worth every penny
5,I absolutely love this product! The pictures I can take with it are absolutely flawless. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a while!
5,I love it! Awesome ring light for the price! üòç
5,I love this light! Now I can stop using my phones flashlight while I‚Äôm live streaming lol
5,It‚Äôs a great product  I love it. My selfies are amazing
1,Stay far away from this! It‚Äôs unstablePhone holder is a joke can barely grip my phone!It falls over constantlyThe ‚Äúball joint‚Äù is a joke!The tripod is so poorly put together! I can‚Äôt get over how bad this thing is for $50I‚Äôm sending it back an spending more for something worth my while! Horrible product*edit* I was asked to remove my negative review for $50No thank youHorrible productI got caught in a trap of paid for good reviewsOur delivery men Nd women are working too hard to deliver goodsReturns means more work! This ring is really terrible!! DO NOT BUY IT
5,I love it perfect for pictures or videos
5,It gives a bright light and very easy to use.It is a good kit for the people want to be makeup youtuber. Nice price too.
5,Es muy bueno a mi sobrina le encanto
5,Works perfectly for everything! I absolutely love it!
3,Legs are a little weak but for the price it's ok
5,Really great ring light at super price
5,Girl this thing changed the picture and video game. Amazing clarity SO SO GREAT.
1,This little thing is so weak and useless‚Ä¶.The phone holder won‚Äôt hold your phone unless you have a small one and if you can get your phone to fit in the holder the tripod and the holder itself fail and bend because they can‚Äôt withstand the weight of a normal phone. It does not come with a plug or anything just a usb cord. Really cheapo product.
2,Honestly this thing is so unstable. The legs move WAY too freely and falls over. The phone holder does not rotate so you're forced to always put the phone into landscape mode. Quite unhappy.
5,Definitely worth it for the price ! Love this
5,Love it. Thanks it was delivered quickly.
3,I cannot seem to attach the cellphone holder.
5,Very easy to use and easy setup!
1,It only has a USB compatibility not to mention it‚Äôs impossible to get your phone to stay on
2,The legs came broken so it wouldn‚Äôt stand up right and the ring light popped out randomly as well.
5,Super amazing. Putting on makeup is so much better because it‚Äôs so well lit.
5,Love this. Makes my pictures look so much better!!
1,I am NOT happy with this light what so ever. The stand itself does not lock into place which is a hassle and then the tightening mechanisms for the ring light and the phone holder won‚Äôt go tight enough to stop both of them from leaning and moving on me when trying to use them that I have to use props to hold them up. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt suggest buying this model. There are better Ones out there I AM POSITIVE! Now I see they have it listed for $50 plus and I got it on sale for $24 plus so it‚Äôs definitely not even close to being worth that much money.
5,Exelente servicio r√°pido y eficaz ..!!!Todo en orden ..!!!
2,it's a decent product. i bought it twixe. the 2nd one I used only twice and some of the lights towards the bottom don't work.
5,Love this. Holds my canon g7x
5,My daughter loves it!
3,It works perfectly and it‚Äôs bright....but mine was missing the phone holder. Highly upset thought I could do my first video today
5,Works as expected.
2,You get what you pay for. It worked great until it didn't. 40 hours of use is a waste of plastic. such a shame.
5,Tripods work great for my setup!
1,Won‚Äôt turn on anymore after 3 months
5,I'm inlove with my ring lights it's great for on the go and everything I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Great product
5,Recommend it!
5,Stand could be smaller but it works fine otherwise.
2,Honestly  the light itself is OK...but not worth the price. the stand is literally like 3 tooth picks. Not sturdy at all. I think you can buy and add your own tripod but rather buy a new ring light. Also tightening for the phone grip is a mess also. Returning my ring light!
1,Light ring portion is great but tripod legs are flimsy unstable and does not stay in place.May be great as hand held selfie but not as a stand alone light!Update*** exactly a year after I purchased item this light became faulty. Light turns off after 5 minutes of use and also notices USB plug in adapter is gets very hot to touch. Used different adapters with same result. Can be a fire hazard if not monitored!!
5,Very easy to use does exactly what it says it‚Äôs going to do!
5,I LOVE THIS LIGHT!! You just gotta make sure you have a box for the cord to charge.
5,this was a really good product it was easy to assemble and use
1,Assembled the light at first when I hit the power button the lights came on for about a second but wouldn‚Äôt stay on. Now I don‚Äôt get any light at all. It won‚Äôt turn on.
5,Great product but missing remote
5,My little sister loves this light for her YouTube videos
2,The light seemed to work as advertised however the stand was broken. Chatted with the customer service team to try and troubleshoot but it didn‚Äôt work so I had to return it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be ordering again. I‚Äôm going to try a different brand.
5,Perfect...light weight
5,Awesome purchase.
5,I love it just need to buy bigger phone holder
5,Perfect ring light! Has different warmth/coolness light settings which makes it very versatile to use. Pretty darn bright!
5,Product was delivered as described quality seems to be nice. It works as expected. The product does what we hoped and we would purchase again.
5,I love the light up ring. It makes all of my videos so much better.
5,It was surprisingly good.
5,Love this! Picture perfect.
5,Fantastic! That was all that I‚Äôve looking for! That make my videos much better without shadows
1,I love the idea of the product. We have purchased two of them. The first one died within 2 months and we assumed it was a fluke. We‚Äôre three months in and our second one died. Ugh! In totality we have used it maybe 30 hours?The quality is really disappointing.
5,Very good value. Works very well. Totally worth the money
5,I usually chat with my friends and sometimes make videos so this light helps me a-lot. Easy to use and very bright.
3,Little bit flimsy but overall good lighting and works well
5,Love it
5,Love it  perfect for makeup and selfies!!ü§≥
5,Love this! Use this for my makeup vanity - so easy to use
3,Pieces broke in a week of having this item!
5,tripod is a little unsteady but other than that it is great!
5,It was the perfect size and it fit right on my vanity.
5,This is a great product for what I use it for!
2,The Tripod keeps falling down and will not stay up. Very I stable. I like the different light volumes but it seems to go from one extreme to another. My phone with my case would not fit in the clamp
5,This product is easy to assemble and a good size.
2,The tripod is so horrible it doesn‚Äôt even stand where you would like it. the light is bright and you can adjust it that‚Äôs fine. the phone clasp part of the stand broke super easily and it fell off my dresser so now I can‚Äôt even use it.
5,Really nice product and very useful for my business
5,I use this for all my my tutorials check me out on Instagram @candysbeatdown
5,Works for what‚Äôs needed.
5,Happy with the product
5,Gift for my daughter and she loved it for makeup application.
1,Better off buying the more expensive ones. While the brightness is nice this one doesn‚Äôt hold the weight of your phone as the legs on the tripod keep slipping. I just threw it out since it‚Äôs not even worth the hassle to return it. Avoid this product!
2,I bought this and gave it a try for a couple of days. The legs are too weak and it is very hard to have it hold still.
5,Congratulations  !
5,Gift for grand daughter and she loved it.
5,Great light I love the  it works well great for photos!!
1,Item is very cheap! It is too flimsy and is unstable. The lock/clamp on the phone holder is the worst and does not support the weight of the phone device at all. The phone moves and wobbles too much. You get what you pay for!
5,I love
5,For the price it does a really great job
5,es muy util
2,Very cheaply made. The stand does not hold up. The piece that holds your phone to the stand does not stay on the stand. Its all very cheaply made. Im going to have to find another one.
5,Worked so perfect connected it to my tripod so perfect for videos and pictures!
2,If all the lights worked it seems as if if would be a great quality product. I will be returning and hopefully be getting a beer quality product.
2,It was great and I barely used it. but unfortunately it seems like it's burnt out already. I bought it Jan '20 and it's now Dec '20 and won't stay on.
5,I absolutely love it!!
5,It‚Äôs nice.
5,I really liked the size of the light but was kind of disappointed on what‚Äôs surrounding the light it‚Äôs all plastic
5,I‚Äôve never looked better
1,This was around $30 when I had it on my wishlist 2 months ago. After the whole pandemic thing they kept uping the price to over $50. I bought it for around 50 and it's absolutely not worth it. Cheap bad quality. The tripod is short thin flimsy and will not work. The phone mound also does not work for any phones. It doesn't come with a plug.I suggest getting a light box or making one yourself for 1/3 the price. Plus if you're looking for light diffusion using everyday lamps with a white t-shirt over them will work just as well.
5,Great product great quality
5,Seriously the Best Buy Everü•∞ü•∞ Super Easy to assemble! Instructions are easy to read! I‚Äôm very very happyy
5,I love this
5,Super awesome and makes videos and pictures look great. Light was way brighter than I expected.
3,Makes an awful high pitch noise while recording...
3,A little fragile but it gets the job done!
5,Great ringlight!! If you are looking for an easy to use and carry around this is it!
5,This has changed the way I take my photos. I love this!
2,I‚Äôve had it for almost a month now and have used it for less than an hour total and 3/4 of the lights do not work anymore. Also everything is so wobbly because you can‚Äôt fully tighten any of the pieces. Definitely a waste of money.
5,buy this.
1,I was really excited for this. Once I opened it up I realized I made a mistake. This light and its components are made from finicky light plastic. After about 10 zoom calls the lights started to flicker and then it wouldnt turn on to its regular brightness when I would turn it on. I had to shake it to get the lights to fully active. This thing is crap.
5,Works perfect! A must buy!
2,I had high hopes for this ring light but it was terrible!  The light isn't very bright the tripod isn't very stable and now less than 5 months later it doesn't even work.  Don't waste your money.
1,Terribly unstable legs. There is only ONE position the legs stay in and that's flat. You can not raise the height for it to stay at all. Also the actual holder of the phone is very cheaply made and difficult to hold the phone in one place. Also the lighting does not have any low ranges.
5,Very good company I had an issue with my light and they resolved it above and beyond my expectations!
5,Great product!
5,This light works perfectly. Perfect lighting for videos and pictures
1,This works really well while it lasts. I purchased it in July 2020 it died I less than a year. The window to return or receive support is closed. Just keep that in mind if/when you make the purchase.6/8/21 Update. Company read my review reached out and offered me a refund allowing me to replace the light. For this reason I am changing my rating.
2,I purchased this item in July and the component where you turn the light on and off has peeled up The product is  made very well either that or I received the lemon.
5,My wife is so happy to get this as her birthday gift. It was so easy to assemble and use.
5,Awesome little light but it doesn‚Äôt come with wall outlet . It‚Äôs a usb plug . But great for the price
5,Makes my pictures better
2,It only lasted 2 months and stopped working. I may have used it 12 times at best. Waste of money
3,Missing a screw when it came to me
2,Lighting is good but not sturdy when u stand it up. Find something else.
5,luv it!! can‚Äôt wait to take so many selfies :)
5,Go to IG #supremesparks_71 and you'll see how good the 10inch ring work.
1,Do not order this product. I had it for 2 months and only used it to broadcast. Never moved it or anything. Just adjusted my phone to it periodically‚Ä¶ and it stopped working. Very cheap and not worth the money
5,Great light for great price
5,Muy bueno para el precio excelente
2,It was great when it worked but it just stopped stopped working one day and I‚Äôve only used it maybe 5 times. The legs are not as sturdy either.
3,The bright light setting on it doesn‚Äôt work only the warm setting
2,Purchased Oct. 15 2020 and today it just shut off. Lost power. It was great while it lasted but now just junk after only a month of using.
5,Photos speak for themselves
5,Product was just as expected! I can‚Äôt wait to start using it for my products photos
1,It is rickety and doesn't stay tight. Wobbles and tips.
5,So easy to put together I‚Äôm honestly in love with it
5,Better than expected!!! Great deal for the price!!
3,Great for videos and  pics
5,Its too expensive for $50.
5,Pieces were falling off this item as I unboxed.... not worth the money
5,I absolutely love it ! It‚Äôs worth your money
1,lasted a month. now does not work.
2,Does not work as easy as I expected. And the tone is not at nice as I expected.
5,Great for the price.
5,Perfect for distance learning videos.
1,The feet on this light tripod won't sit upright ... It only sits way down flat and you can't adjust it.  And once I put my phone into the clamp it tips over.This stand is garbage.
5,Came as advertised. Easy set up and hasn‚Äôt failed me yet.
2,This is not worth the price and it‚Äôs cheaply made. The lighting is good but it isn‚Äôt a durable product so I doubt it‚Äôll last very long.
5,I am very happy that the product shipped quickly is cheap and the goods are very good I recommend it
5,I like the product all around. It wasn‚Äôt anything I disliked about to. Got it earlier than expected
5,Great buy for the price.
5,This is such a great mirror my daughter love it
2,Don‚Äôt waste your money. This thing falls over repetitively with your phone in the stability on it is awful
1,Completely disappointed. Once the item was shipped the ENTIRE picture of what I thought I was getting changed into some tiny kickstand with a light. When I ordered I SPECIFICALLY picked the one I (thought) I was getting because I needed the full tripod because I am tall and what I intended it for I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting or any where near the floor so now I have to either figure out how to make this thing float or ordered a full tripod for it. And again I say DISAPPOINTED
5,The tripod is quite stable
5,Love love love this product
5,I love this product it‚Äôs worth it !
1,The light is great the settings are ample with nice coloring. The tripod is pure JUNK. My 11 pro Mac iPhone is too heavy! I wish I could Return this but I didnt Keep the box it came in. The fasteners don‚Äôt let you tighten anything and after 3 uses it‚Äôs just falling apart. Don‚Äôt buy this!
2,Used mostly for web calls and worked fine for a few months then just went dim.
2,My biggest complaint is that the legs/stand are VERY flimsy. They do not adjust tighter at all. It falls over constantly. And it is extremely difficult to get my iPhone in the holder.
5,I love this ringlight it has really improved my video‚Äôs for Instagram and my pictures as well
1,This worked okay for the price HOWEVER after using for just two months I started to smell something burning and then the light just stop working AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE TO RETURN IT! How convenient that it stop working after the return option is longer available. This I why I wait to write reviews! Don't by this if you want a product that's gonna last.
5,Totally in love. It‚Äôs perfect.
2,This product barely supports the weight of my iphone and it all kept falling over. It doesn't adjust very well. I'm returning it. The light is good if you just want to use it for that though.
5,O love love love
5,Works great love it
5,I like it.
5,My picture & videos come out so well
5,Perfect and easy to assemble.
5,I use this on pictures and came out so good the light its üòç
5,Use for live Facebook shows and works wonderfully
5,Super easy to use. Lighting is awesome.
5,I like this product i love the brightness and very nice for YouTube videos
5,I bought this for daughter‚Äôs birthday!She said it‚Äôs perfect!
5,I really like it.
5,10/10 of this product.
5,I love it!
5,This product is amazing and delivery was pretty fast?
5,In love with this product and they have great customer service
5,El. Tr√≠pode es muy inestable
5,Daughter loves it for her makeup tutorials
5,Great customer service!
5,Very easy to set up and use
5,Arrived fast
5,Does just what i need it to do
2,Didn‚Äôt used it right way then when I used it it blinks and after 3-4 times of usingit it never work again these was in a period of 6 months
2,The light works great.  But the stand itself is flawed.  It wont hold the phone holder in well and the ball bearing that allows the light to tilt or rotate doesn't tighten.  So I have to prop something up in front of it to hold the light and my phone up.
5,I love it . Work very good
2,Legs are flimsy. It barely stands with the weight of the phone. Also it stops working after 3-5 mins. I‚Äôm assuming it gets ‚Äúhot‚Äù and needs to cool down. It‚Äôs really annoying when you‚Äôre between a video and have to stop and wait.
5,Great light! Amazing for makeup application!
5,Very nice
5,Easy to assemble. Illumination is great!
1,This ring light hasn't worked at all since the day I recieved it. The Tripod part doesn't have enough tension to stand up. The plastic covering the lights broke after the first use. This is not even usable. Do yourself a favor and stay clear.
5,Great lamp.  Very bright and sturdy!
5,Love it üòª
5,Very nice!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†easy to assemble works well.
5,Definitely like this ring light!!
5,This is amazing
5,5 stars
5,I use it to take my pictures after makeup. I love it
1,I hate this thing. Wish I'd returned it but I was traveling and didn't have time to deal with it. Legs are so weak it can't stand solo let alone with anything in it. The clip has almost no ability to adjust to different size phones or cameras. You can barely adjust the angle unless you loosen it at which point it just face plants. Basically useless.
2,The tripod is my only issue with this as it is not very  sturdy and if you are trying to do a video of your hands the tripod tips over
5,does not tighten up enough where doesn't flop over but my 9 year old uses it
5,Thx exactly what I needed
5,Works great! Can't wait to use it
5,Excellent!
1,The product is not well put together.  The light does not connect well to the base.  Despite our attempts there is no way to lock in the legs of the tripod for it to stay in place and more importantly  the part that holds the phone slips out from the light (even when tightened all the way).  Unfortunately we were not able to return the product as we gave it as a gift after the return date expired.  Very disappointed.  Waste of money.
5,Just as pictured my niece love it!
3,Very flimsy wont hold settings
5,Love this for my instagram makeup videos!!
2,Loved it when it did work but wasn‚Äôt for long. It would turn on and off after having it on for a was few minutes. Then wouldn‚Äôt even turn on at all. And when I would try to dim the light it would flicker on and off. I returned it.
2,I should've returned it right after I got it but it is too late now. I think the quality of the product is very good it's just that I got the one that is bad.
5,Bought as a gift. She enjoys it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Worth the money
5,Very useful . It‚Äôs enhance your profile
5,Love the lighting
5,Easy to assemble bright and rather sturdy. Great for tiktoks
5,Very good‚ò∫Ô∏è
1,I got played with this purchase. Sure the light is bright and has different settings but the phone holder does NOT stay in the slot it goes in. And the stand is THE WORST stand that could have been made for this. The legs are too skinny and the second you put a phone on it the legs separate and slide. I've been so angry with this thing that I've wanted to set it on fire. DO NOT buy this one. Find one with a stronger tripod I wasted my money.
1,Would have given 5 stars across the board for lighting purposes only  BUT my phone constantly pops out of the holder and the ring light itself falls over CONSTANTLY and there is zero way to truly tighten it all up to keep these things from happening. Super annoying to have your tripod fall over and/or your phone pop out of the holder in the middle of a video.There isn‚Äôt even stars to click for the holder or sturdiness of the tripod :/
2,A bit disappointed. The stands are so weak it hardly stand by itself. By the time i added my Samsung S10 to it it couldn't handle the weight.
5,So cute and practical for everyday use has different settings I love it
5,Tripod is short tho but good product. I love it.
2,This was a good ring light until it just stopped working a few days after the return window closed. Wish it lasted longer than one month
2,This product was very flimsy . I could not withstand the weight of my phone and eventually broke in half.
2,Got it and it worked for a while. After about a month later it went out but it was beautiful when it actually worked.
5,Love this product!! Highly recommend!
1,I absolutely cannot stand this product. Does not hold your phone without sliding falling and doing all other kinds of crap. And I have a very small cell phone so it should not be that much of an issue. The tripod is also equally as embarrassing. Whoever decided to actually sell this product is a joke and I do not recommend getting this. Please check out reviews and spend your money elsewhere
5,I like it
5,Love it
5,Berry good
5,Great product. Upset that I didn‚Äôt buy this years ago
5,Love it! Perfect for selfies or for when I‚Äôm recording videos of myself.
2,Not a fan. The light options are either too bright and unnatural or too dark. The tripod always slips. The phone clip always falls. Definitely returning this product to find a better option.
1,This light is super bright. Leaves an even cast of light over my entire face. I also use it as an extra spot light while sewing. Love it. **Edit** as much as I loved this light it burned out in less than a year. So sad it broke my heart
5,Wonderful product
1,Do not be fooled by the reviews!! My Ring Light died on me (light is not bright and flickering) recently which is unfortunate as I purchased this mid July .. so it only lasted 2 months. I would reconsider investing in something of better quality (and not this) if you're looking for a product that lasts and just simply works. Also- how ironic that it dies just soon after the 30 day return window is up.
5,very bright and easy to use
2,I doesn‚Äôt stay as high as I would like it literally starts slipping if you want it at a higher position. You have to put it on top of something in order to get a good angle
5,bright light and very easy to use. An essential kit for YouTubers.
1,Doesn‚Äôt hold phone up very well. The piece that holds the phone in circle light doesn‚Äôt stay in. It just kinda sits there. So when you move the camera up or down it slides right out. Bought for recording Tutorial videos to start promoting my crafts and wasn‚Äôt a good purchase. My phone is one of the newer iPhones so it‚Äôs large and makes the tripod top heavy. Not a very good design at all.
5,All good!
1,Used for five minutes and it turned off wouldn‚Äôt turn back on. Waste of my time and money. Needed this for a work presentation on zoom and it left me unable to complete my presentation. Worst possible timing for something like this.
5,The kids purchased this to do YouTube videos. They gave it 2 thumbs up
1,When it works it's great (amazing quality light options etc). But I'd say at least 4/10 times I use it it doesn't work for long periods of time. This is really disruptive because it is essential to me looking good in virtual work meetings since I work in the basement of my house. I'm bummed and will have to buy a different one. Total waste of money.
2,Light fixture works fine. The cellphone attachment is poorly designed
5,I‚Äôm in direct sales for a cosmetics and do live videos
5,Great Purchase!
2,The tripod does NOT work. Mine slides around and falls over.
5,Perfect beginners ring light
5,I don‚Äôt write reviews but I actually like this ring light.
1,Feels cheap looks cheap works cheap. The swivel ball has difficulty holding everything in place when you try to tilt the light down. Everything is cheap plastic. One of the little handles on the swivel ball lock broke the first time I used it. Snapped right off. I would recommend this for children under 10 playing around on their phones and consider it disposable when you purchase it. It's seriously built like a one-shot piece of equipment.
1,Came out of the box this way with only one of the four quadrants lighting up. The stand's legs do not stay up well on their own and often slip down and splay out unless you have something against them to help hold them up. I would not recommend this light.
5,Best Buy I could have done.
5,Love it !!
1,It broke within a few weeks of using it. I bought this for my husband to use during conference calls. He used it twice and I used it once.Because I bought it early for his birthday the return window had passed before we got to use it. Now we have a useless broken ring light.Do not buy this. Very poorly made.
5,Love it
1,This may the first 1 star review that I have given. This product is poorly made and arrived to me unable to assemble. I understand that you get what you pay for but this is just unacceptable. Smh!
5,Buena iluminaci√≥n y muy pr√°ctico de utilizar.
2,I was so excited for this item. And I was very disappointed. Whenever I put my phone on it it falls over it does not stay up like a tripod should the legs move outward and it falls over. After about 2 weeks the cord starting ripping.
2,Not impressed. Flimsy tripod. Stopped working after 5 months of using it about 3 days/wk.
1,Tripod not strong. INEFFECTIVE. REURNED
1,The stand is wobbly and does not stand up. With the weight of my phone it just falls over. I would have returned it if I had tried it before my return window. Light seems ok but doesn‚Äôt stand up
5,Great light ring
5,Like
5,Liked it completely
1,I was very excited about this ring light I bought it to use on zoom calls and it worked great exactly two times before it stopped working completely. Now it won't turn on despite changing the plug for the USB and moving it to different outlets. Disappointing because it wasn't cheap and I'm out of the window for returns to Amazon at this point.
5,I‚Äôm so in love can‚Äôt wait to use it!
5,This is wonderful I can‚Äôt wait to start my YouTube channel!!
1,I bought this ring light and tripod because it was recommended but the ring light failed after the first use. It would not stay on when connected by USB. I was able to use it as a tripod to hold the phone for camera use  but the tripod is very unstable often slipping and needing additional support for stability. A poor investment.
5,Really bright and very easy to put together. I love it.
1,I tried to use this ring light today  for the first time during a zoom call and just 5 minutes into the call it died on me. It was so disappointing. I read reviews before purchasing it and most of the reviews were positive; that was why I decided to make the purchase. It wouldn‚Äôt bother me if I had been able to use it a few times at least. I just received it about a week ago.
2,Unstable light dim
5,Love esp for the price
5,Filming
2,It literally broke right outside of the return policy. The light will no longer come on. I thought it would at least last for a year.
2,The light constantly flickers giving me a headache
5,So fun!! Love using it
1,I bought this for my business and at first loved and even recommended it but less than 5 months in and it won‚Äôt even power on.  The thing that holds the phone will NOT stay in no matter how tightly I screw it on AND the legs are so sensitive that if I barely bump them the whole thing falls.  I‚Äôm past the return period though so it lasted long enough for that to happen.  Disappointed.
2,The lightning is good but the stand and the phone holder  keep moving I have to be fixing it every single time.
1,It broke in 3 days when I used it and when I switched it off I cannot switch it back on. Seems like I‚Äôve had to unplug it from the wall and plug it in before it will work. It‚Äôs past the due date to return but I hope the company can exchange me with a new proper one otherwise I want a refund.
1,This product delivers a nice light but the workmanship of the control is of poor quality. Buttons can't hold up to being pressed..I had two of these and the keypads broke both times.
5,Great customer service!
5,Tiene 3 diferentes colores de luz  muy buen tama√±oincre√≠ble!!
5,I love this like feels like I‚Äôm in a studio.
5,Love it and works great. Super compact as well!
5,Great brightness hard to put together very flimsy and cheap
5,Helps Me A lot When I‚Äôm Doing My Make Up
5,Bright great for selfies :)
2,I wanted a taller tripod stand. Didn‚Äôt realize when I ordered this one had to sit on top of something
5,Exactly as described.
5,Just what I was looking for
1,This ring light is junk and for $50? Rip off! The box literally weighs less than one of my morphe eyeshadow palettes. Its hallow junk. Might as well use a nightlight to light yourself up. That's how much power this thing has....on any setting. It will be going back. I am looking for a quality light that is more powerful than my desk lamp. You could probably blow this thing over with one powerful breath.
5,Great lighting.
1,The piece that holds my phone refuses to attach the ring light as shown on the instructions. The light work but can‚Äôt use it to record properly. This was a waist of money.
1,I wanted to love this but it came with broken and unusable parts. Some of the threads on the pieces that were supposed to be screwed together were gone/painted over. This made assembling impossible. I tried to rig it to work but it just falls over
1,I was so excited to use this light! It was bright affordable and easy to use. HOWEVER after having it only 3 months the light only lights up half the ring. One of the wires wasnt soldered properly and came undone. I do not have access to a soldering machine so I am unable to use it now.I wish I could have given 5 stars but because it wasn't properly made I'm giving it a one-star.
1,DO NOT BUY. This product started smoking in the middle of an important zoom meeting that I had. I used a normal iPhone charger block as this product does not come with a block and I saw smoke come out of my block and the outlet began to fuse. The light went out. Needless to say I will be returning this product. Very cheap.
5,it work's great and is exactly as pictured
1,This ring light is extremely cheaply made and flimsy. The tripod is weak with no locking mechanism. A slight jiggle is all it takes for the entire contraption to tumble down.The parts that screw together do not fit properly - the threads would not align correctly. Honestly I would expect this level of quality at a dollar store - not a $50+ item by any stretch of the imagination.
5,Good light for me to start my online business with.
5,I love this light !
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I don‚Äôt understand how this LED light has so many good reviews it‚Äôs extremely cheap for the price! The stand barely stands up on its own never mind while the phone is place in it.. I expected WAY better quality for the reviews and the price point but it‚Äôs not worth it AT ALL. Please go find another brand because this one is NOT it.
2,Missing lots of pieces but I was able to combine parts from old stands.. Upset that I didn't get everything!
1,The tripod can not hold up a phone with out a case if is at any angle other than straight.  I can't shoot things down on a lab table or make videos well when the tripod is too floppy to work.  The light is great though.  Wish it was much less flimsy.  Worth $10 at best.
5,Satisfied. But no tripod included. Just the mini stand
2,The light itself is ok. The power cord overheated during the first use. The stand is flimsy and so short
5,Genial
2,You basically get what you you pay for. It isn‚Äôt that great but it‚Äôs good for the price.
1,TERRIBLE PURCHASE! I gave 1 star for easy to assemble although it is easy to assemble the piece that holds the phone that attaches to the ring itself will not tighten securely to hold phone to ring. I worked for minimum of 5 min to tighten it multiple times and just when I thought it was good it fell off with a gentle tap of my phone as I tried placing it in. The light is not bright at all!
2,My daughter didn't like it
5,Good buy
1,The legs are not designed well. This topples over and I wish I would have chosen a different setup. Not a fan.
2,The legs are very feeble and the slide apart easily making very difficult to keep it in position
2,Flimsy. 3 legs too spindly to support large ring.
5,Very good item...thank you
5,Really good.
5,Perfect for my vanity!!! Easy to assemble
5,very nice
5,Cannot wait to use it for my videos
2,Bought this for a gift in March and the light has already gone out. Having a hard time finding number to Manufacture.
1,The light right works great but the adjustable parts do not hold tight your phone will fall and the legs are HORRIBLE! they give out and are not balanced I had to put things in front of them to hold them in place.  Ended up buying a better quality one for only 5 dollars more.
1,the light works fine and looks great but the stand is cheaply made. the stand is barely heavy enough to holdthe phone so it falls over. waste ofmoney
1,I bought this a while ago. Nothing stays in place like it's supposed to. The light itself is good but the tripod it's on is terrible. don't even bother with the phone clip. It never stays in place.
5,Great product!
2,Eh it‚Äôs ok. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. It‚Äôs also currently 1/2 the price of what I paid
2,Does not stand up steady or sturdy as needed for recording & pictures.
1,If only I could give it zero stars...Cheap plastic junk. Feels like something you would get from Five Below. It broke the first day I used it. The positioning mechanism failed so it will turn on but it cannot support its own weight on the tripod rendering it useless.Spend a little more and get another model because this one is trash.
1,I was so excited when I got this in! My videos were so clear and you could actually see me and not be yellow but as of yesterday it started messing up and wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I believe there‚Äôs a short in the wire. I threw away my box so I can‚Äôt return it. I don‚Äôt recommend this.
1,My lights won't change and it just shut off on its own. It won't turn on even though the remote is still lit blue. I am hitting the on/off button and trying to change the lights but nothing is working. Trying to contact the seller for a replacement and waiting to hear back. Not worth the money at all if it dies on you within 10 seconds of plugging in.
3,Wobbly
1,You get what you pay for. If it‚Äôs under 50$ it‚Äôs not worth it. Mine arrived with broken pieces I tried to make it work because I started working from home. After a month just completely fell apart. Tripod doesn‚Äôt even hold the camera at all. I need to buy an entire new ring light. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,I was very excited to receive my ring light! As I started setting it up to get a full picture of the product I noticed one of the ‚Äúball heads‚Äù of the tripod was broken! So sad to have received a faulty item üò©
5,Good
1,No longevity in this product whatsoever. Equivalent quality as the dollar store.
1,Updating review from 4 stars to 1 star. The product stopped working within a month. Now only has cool white mode no warm or neutral option. Utterly useless now. Dont ever have time to drive to a ups store so I'm just going to have to take the loss. Such a bummer to have something not work for even a month of light use....
1,I had this product for 3 months and then the light just stopped working.  The light comes on for 3 seconds and then pops off.  The product is useless without a light that will stay on.
1,Light works but good luck getting any actual use out of this entire set. Only had it for 2 weeks before it began to failBall joints are crap and easily loosen with little effort  after being tightened plastic connectors have stripped doesn‚Äôt thread all the way down to a tri-pod.Spend the star few dollars for a better product
5,Loved it
1,I cannot tell you how many times I have screamed trying to put this together. It's really poorly designed and engineer. The tripod legs are super weak the whole thing tips over very easily. There's no design to turn the phone to portrait mode. This was a waste of money. I guess the light was aight.
1,I never got a fully working ring light even the replacement didn‚Äôt work properly. The first ring would only light up 1/2 of the way in its led mode.  None of the intensity levels worked and the light cover was loose with the smallest amount of movement would short the light. On the replacement ring the led mode worked 1/4 of way.
5,Buen tama√±o
1,Do not buy this piece of crap!! Spend a little extra and get good one this one broke won't stay up the ring will not stay up the phone won't stay up!! It wouldn't let me rate it 0 Stars had to put 1 but believe me I rate it 0 Stars
2,Good
1,It fell off my vanity and broke the same day.. not sturdy at all
1,It fell apart within hours.
1,this product could not hold itself up. The tripod legs were not even therefore it was tilted the phone stand fell apart and didn‚Äôt stay on the mount. Before it broke it barely held my phone (XS) and couldn‚Äôt even hold it up. It was honestly horrible. I really do not recommend this product at all.
2,Legs are flimsy so you can only position the light low to the table.
5,Perfect! Thank you!!!
1,The light is okay quality but is very cheaply made. For $50 not worth it. You can get this quality for $20. The tripod is so skinny and cannot hold the weight of my phone so it crashes. I don't recommend. If you're looking for something that doesn't hold your phone don't spend this much money.
2,I can‚Äôt get it to hold my phone up at all without propping it up. I have an iPhone 6s. The light itself is fine.
1,It‚Äôs very flimsy in the sense of when you lot your phone vertically  the legs move a bit but still able to use it for what I need. The quality of my photos are still very great . I would recommend something more stable
5,Enjoying it!
5,Greatest
1,Falls over when you put your phone in it. Defeats the point of having it. Returned this product.
1,My first one lasted about 4 hours of intermittant use. Got it replaced and the second one quit after about 45 minutes of use . And YES it was plugged into a 12 watt Apple USB  power adapter. Planned to use for online teaching --great idea - bad product.
1,the stand that comes with this thing is atrocious and the quality of the light itself is low quality/low standard. Its really small which doesnt make it ideal for streaming on a desktop PC. I should have just spent the money on studio lights
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it
5,Excellent
2,The stand is so flimsy. It does not stand with the weight of the phone. The light is great.
5,Excelente
1,I purchased this light to do my facebook lives. (I purchased using my dad's Prime account)After about the 7th time of using it it won't turn on.My lives are not very long maybe 15-30 min at a time. So that's no more than 3 hours of use.And I missed my return window so I'm stuck with it.Bummer
1,The piece that holds the phone doesn't stay in place and easily falls off. Also used the light on the day it arrived and it worked fine. Put it away and decided to use it a week or so later and the light doesn't come on it just flashes and goes back off. Also the tripod is unstable.
2,The light is very dim so it doesn‚Äôt really do much for you.
1,I love the light of gives off but it snapped off its stand about a week later!
5,Good purchase
5,Love it
1,The light is fine however the stand is total junk. I have it tightened as much as I can however it doesn't stay standing very well. If I bump it or adjust my phone I have to fix the legs so it doesn't collapse.
5,Na
2,Very flimsy  doesn‚Äôt stay together well . Not worth the price.
1,I bought this ring light in March and just started using it and it sucks so bad!!! You can‚Äôt rotate your phone the tripod doesn‚Äôt stay up and everything is wobbly.Not satisfied.....
5,Very bright and works great!
1,Miserable piece of lighting for zoom or TEAMs meeting. The tripod is too flimsy to prop the light up of you need to adjust the hight it dosent hold. Might be good for up close selfie but terrible for home office use.
2,The stands were really weak and wouldn't stay up for a long time. low-quality product
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This was great until 1/2 of the lights went out after a month. Definitely disappointed.
2,This worked for a day the next day I tried to use it kept shutting off and I had just turned it on so I know it wasn‚Äôt overheating or anything.
2,This unit draws 10 watts and you will need a USB power source capable of powering the light.
1,My daughter has been using this since Christmas for her theater zoom classes.  Today right before they started filming it died on her.  Disappointed.  It was great while it lasted...
2,Lighting is good but the stand is junk. falls over and it‚Äôs hard to keep your phone attached. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
5,Me encanto luz perfecta
5,Great product for the price!
2,The tripod is so flimsy that it collapsed during my live video.
2,The lighting is really nice but it‚Äôs really glitchy. Randomly cuts off and sometimes doesn‚Äôt come on at all.Update: This light overheats VERY quickly. Potential fire hazard.
1,This thing died right after I used it for the first time. I've tried all different ways of making it work like plugging it into different outlets different blocks etc. Nope. Not impressed and I can't even return it. :(
1,I don‚Äôt know if I have installed this incorrectly or what but I am unable to mount my mobile phone. I love the lighting that‚Äôs about it. I definitely have to be careful or else it will fall :( not satisfied
1,When I got my ring light in the mail I was excited to try it out. When I plugged it in it did not turn on. The light just twitched and it doesn‚Äôt turn on. I‚Äôm trying to get a refund for it but no contact info. Don‚Äôt waste your money! They send out defective ones.
2,the plastic cover piece for the handle on one of the adjustment knobs broke immediately the 1st time being twisted during assembly. I used pliers to compensate & finish assembling.
1,The legs won‚Äôt even hold up the weight of my phone. Should‚Äôve gone with one with a real tripod stand. The images of this product vary from one to the next. I was under the impression that the Tripp‚Äôs included would be the one from the images.
5,Excellent quality
1,Do not purchase! I do reviews all the time and it‚Äôs rare that I give a bad one. I just received my light 2 days ago and it no longer lights up. This is the second one. If you want a good quality just spend $100 on a good one.
2,legs are very loose and easily slip or fall altogether
5,Super Love it!
5,Love them
5,It‚Äôs so cutr
1,Just unboxed this product to use for the first time today and the light completely does not work. I‚Äôm past the return window and so upset that this doesn‚Äôt work at all. Very disappointed. Do not purchase this product!!!
1,It broke upon first use.
1,Super disappointing purchase because it seems like such a great set up! The quality of this product is poor and it malfunctioned for me after one of the first uses. I should have returned it right then! There is a better light for $50!
2,It's a decent price but stopped working after just 2 months.
2,Only a quarter of the ring would light up.
5,Bien buena luz
1,I WISH that I never purchased this item. I WISH I would have opened it sooner rather than AFTER the return date. UTTER WASTE OF $30.00.  The pieces that hold the cellphone are EXTREMELY flimsy and ridiculous.  DONT BUY‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
2,The ring is great the lil baby tripod sucks!
1,fell apart almost immediately and was never sturdy impossible to keep the phone at the angle needed because the cheap products cant hold it in place. dont buy.
1,Horrible... the legs barely hold up the light.. it‚Äôs fell off my desk at least 30 times by now. When I was using it today it shut off randomly and wouldn‚Äôt turn on for a good 5 minutes. The lighting is alright..... it feels super cheap.
1,Not bright or sturdy AT ALL. If you were hoping this would give you a nice even lighting you are wasting your money. It‚Äôs easy enough to assemble but wow... my phone does not feel secure in this at all. I can not recommend this product.
1,What a piece of junk! The tripod on this is so flimsy. You will never want to use it. I highly recommend against purchasing this product
1,Dislike: the "dimmer" control only had 3 or 4 levels not the 10 listed.  It was flimsy made not very solid.  For $50 it is a horrible deal at best it was only worth half that and that is if it worked properly.
1,Product broke while I used it for the first time. It was plugged in and the light died. Product also felt very cheap
1,Tripod is not adjustable--it can only stand in the lowest position with the legs splayed all the way out. The entire device is as cheap as can be and basically worthless. I have to order something else to replace it. Save your money.
2,Stand isn‚Äôt strong enough to stay in position
1,Super wobbly I constantly have to tinker with it. Falls over constantly. The light itself is fine but everything else about it tanks the review
1,Do not order this!  The ring light didn't come with the appropriate parts to assemble phone mount to ring light.  Nor did the phone holder have the screw on part in the right place to allow the phone to be held
2,Very flimsy. Tri-pod is very unstble
1,This light stopped working  3 days after I could return it.  Don‚Äôt waste your money!
2,Not great quality. Very flimsy and small.
1,This is undoubtedly one of the flimsiest poorly designed items you can imagine. It‚Äôs like trying to balance a 50 pound head on 2 pound legs. I can‚Äôt recommend this at all.
5,It‚Äôs nice!!
1,i‚Äôve had this for just a little over a month and the lights already don‚Äôt work. they‚Äôve dimmed to the point where they don‚Äôt give off any type of lighting. this is ridiculous and i can‚Äôt even return it ü§ß DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!
1,Product seemed fine out of the box but the first time I used it for a Facebook live it quit about 30 minutes in. Also the piece that holds the phone doesn't lock into place so if you're not careful it will fall out. Piece of junk.
1,Would like a replacement
1,This product only lasted about 5 months. It no longer turns on. I only use it maybe an hour a day as I get ready for the day. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this product.
2,Does not work for my needs
1,it falls down so easily the phone holder also broke the day after i got itü§®
1,Light itself is great and we really haven't used that much but the tightening mechanism crumbled. My daughter used her own money to purchase this light and is soooo bummed and disappointed! :(
2,Very disappointed
5,Good product
5,Perfect size
1,Trash dont buy the mount for your phone doesn't stay on the ring light no matter how much you tighten it. Your phone and the mount will randomly just fall off almost dropped my phone off a balcony... Dont buy
1,Horrible product!  The power unit stopped working after 1 month of sporadic use. No longer lights up when plugged in and I can no longer return as it is passed the one month window. Spend your money somewhere else.
1,This product does not stand well at all. It lasted 2 months and the adjustments on it started to crack and fall apart.
1,It is so cheaply made! It falls apart when u put your phone on it. The bars don‚Äôt stay up. The entire thing just collapses. A complete waste of money.
1,It is not sturdy at all. The legs fall off when you touch the mirror or put your phone on the stand. I like the brightness of the light though. Too bad the stand itself is not dependable.
2,Legs not sturdy enough.
1,After almost three months of use 1/2 the light went out and won't work. Before that it worked great and I didn't even use it that much. Maybe 3 times a week for an hour each day.
5,Perfect
1,I bought it mid September didn't start using it till mid february and only used it 3 times a week for a month and a half before it stopped working. it doesn't turn on anymore. Definitely regret this purchase
1,The lighting wasn't powerful.  I get the same effect just using the overhead light in my bedroom.It is so flimsy.  Not stable at all.  I'm really sorry that I purchased not 1 but 2.
1,Made my skin look terrible. Not very bright. Tried all tones none were flattering. My husband‚Äôs garage light gives a better affect.
1,I do not recommend this product. It turns on and off on it's own and has left me underlit during a presentation. The tripod feature is bulky and it's just poorly made.
1,The part that fits the phone unscrews doesn‚Äôt stay tight and falls off. It would be perfect if it was one total unit.
1,I used this for video conferencing online for about 5-6 hours a day. After 3 days it wouldn't turn off or on and the plugin would get very hot. Sometimes it would blink. Not a good product.
5,Its great
1,Misssing a part on the pan tilt therefore I‚Äôm unable to attach my phone to the ring light for recording. This has really been an inconvenience.
1,Doesn't stand for itself. It continuously falls over so that annoying
1,The stand to this light is horrible. The brightness is what you‚Äôd expect for a 20Dollar light you get what you pay for.
1,This was a very poorly made product that often overheated and then totally stopped working after only occasional use in about 2 months. I had to throw it out and buy an upgraded version.
1,worked for 5 minutes.  returning it now
2,Mehh
2,Easy to set up but CHEAP CHeap! Spend a little more and get quality
1,I did not like the stand I thought it expanded and it doesn‚Äôt
1,Power button looked like it had been tampered with and never worked. Have to plug and unplug it from wall.
1,I got this 7 months ago and now the LEDs are continuously flickering and making this unusable. I've only used this once every two weeks... Such a shame.
1,This product broken even before having it one full month. When I plug the cord into an outlet or a adapter plug it will not turn on. I‚Äôve tried various outlets does not work.
1,My light ring broke after 6 months and I hardly use it. Its cheaply made. It snapped in half on the tripod part.
2,It‚Äôs nice for teenagers and small kids.
1,The stand broke right out the box so now it does not stay up right. The metal screw no longer attaches to the movable ball joint. Manufacturer should have used a harder plastic or metal.
2,This product fell over and now it doesnt work. Waste of money
2,Purchased the shorter light with tripod. No instructions. No idea how to set it up..
1,Loved it at first.. but only had it for maybe 6 months and the light just doesn‚Äôt come on anymore .. I‚Äôve tried everything and it just doesn‚Äôt come on.
1,Ordered this it stopped working almost immediately.  Amazon sent me a replacement.  The replacement stopped working after only three months.  Do not recommend at all.
1,Phone holder does not attach properly to tripod stand.  I almost broke my iPhone trying to get this to work. This was listed as ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice.‚Äù  But it‚Äôs junk.
1,The product worked for about a week. Unfortunately now it only turns on and off. It will not adjust in terms of brightness or tone of color as it originally did.
1,Every time I try to use this for a live video there is an obnoxious loud ringing on the live (only happens when on this light stand) and my watchers cant hear me. Very disappointed.
1,The legs do not tighten. So the whole stand has to be held up by something else propped against it. It will not support its own weight. Do not buy
2,Light worked BUT the leg was loose and didn't stand.
1,Was not sturdy at all and would tip over everytime I tried to use it. Definitely would. It recommend
1,Product worked great for about 5 minutes. Now it won‚Äôt turn on at all. Do not waste your time and money.
1,Muy mala calidad! El tr√≠pode es muy delgado y no soporta el peso del celular. Se me parti√≥ el soporte del celular con s√≥lo ajustarlo. La verdad no me gusto
1,It came broken light wouldn‚Äôt turn on no matter what or where I plugged it in to.
1,This product was so cheap. The light wouldn‚Äôt stay on- I had to keep turning it on in the middle of my FB lives!! Like 10x for a 15 minute video. Look elsewhere.
2,Was not bright at all
2,The phone holder part isn‚Äôt stable. Phone keeps falling out
1,It is not lightning up.  Not working properly.  Need to send it back.
1,Picked it because it said it was bright. Nope. It isn't.
1,Worked really nicely for the first maybe 2 months? The wiring on the circuit board of the remote broke apart and now it's just junk in my closet...
1,The ring does not screw into the base and falls off easily. The light is good but hard to use when the ring doesn‚Äôt stay in place.
1,The part where the screw is supposed to go in for the base is very very stripped and will not Hold at all very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
5,Outstanding product  all the pieces fit together perfectly couldn‚Äôt had done it better myself !!!
1,Returning. The tripod legs don‚Äôt stay put and collapse while you‚Äôre using it.
1,The light has a cheap plastic cover that snapped/cracked with the tripod tipped over. The tripod is slippery and even on a flat service cannot stand up straight
1,Only turned on one time and then nothing not a good product
1,Had very high hopes for this one but on the third day wouldn‚Äôt turn on then the screw where u tight the phone broke and it‚Äôs not stable kept falling
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Hey my package came broke only one side of the led lights turns on instead of the whole thing. I would a refund or new one brought back please thank you.
1,Ordered on the 29th with one day shipping received a defective product one the 2nd of the following month. Only 1/4 of the light Ring works.
1,The product is fine. The shipment was HORRIBLE! The box was NOT SEALED! IT WAS COMPLETELY OPEN! It was also shipped in its original package. It was a Christmas gift.
1,I purchase assembled it unfortunately it did not work for me the part where your phone is placed just falls off dropping my phonne.
5,Vale la pena
1,Wss trying to use this with my DSLR for unboxing videos just wasn't what I needed.Would probably be great for Makeup tutorials and such.
1,DISAPPOINTED. ONLY LASTED LESS THAN 4 MONTH. WILL NOT COME ON NOW! DON'T BUY WILL NOT LAST.
1,The ring light is 10‚Äù. The tripod is non existent. It literally sits on the counter. It does NOT adjust and it does NOT extend.
1,This looks and feels soooo cheap. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Wish I could get a refund but I live out of country so that‚Äôs my L
1,My second time using it it was on for about 4 minutes before it blew out and won‚Äôt turn back on.
1,DON'T BUY IT.
1,Crapy  cheap  flimsy
1,This light didn't have enough brightness even on full power. The "tripod" stand was flimsy and couldn't be extended. It wasn't worth the price.
1,Absolutely trash. Dull and flimsy.
1,Couldn‚Äôt even hold my old iPhone SE upright.  Tripod collapsed completely and it only holds the phone horizontally.  Returned it the day I got it!!!
1,This ring light broke after 5 uses.  The power switch/adjuster felt clunky and  after maybe 5 uses  it stopped working.
1,I have an iPhone 11 promax in this ring light struggles to hold the phone up on it‚Äôs own.. it‚Äôs completely flimsy
1,Came broken awesome! Had great reviews too. The screw to the bad was stripped..
1,Product delivered to me had an issue with the light and was a waste of money. Please do not purchase.
1,It was very cheaply made. The light did not have as many settings as claimed and was very dim.
1,Plastic tightener cracked under light use.  The rest of the plastic components feel just as fragile.
1,I‚Äôve only owned this light for a month now all of a sudden it don‚Äôt work??I have hardly used it!I want a replacement!
1,The tripod doesn't have each leg work at the same angle as the other so it is impossible for it to be stable.
1,It was supposed to be about to hold my phone in landscaping mode or regular. Or only hold it in landscaping.Plastic bolts don't hold strong. Cheaply made
1,This product was out of the box and used once and is already broken.
1,Died a day after I got this ring light. I turned the ring light on and it started to dim out on its own. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed.
1,I was super excited about this ring light but sadly it came broken. Only a third of the ring would light up.
1,I thought this was a taller tripod and it is VERY SHORT not adjustable and very wobbly. The lighting is dim as well.
1,No instructions came with this product and the light did not fully light up even after charging.  Returning product.
1,Missing 2 pieces. The 2 pan-tilts.Update: I didn't notice a small crack in the back of the ring light.
1,Wish this worked but you need to fiddle with the port and 80% of the time it doesn‚Äôt work. Total regrets.
1,This suddenly stopped working today. Very disappointed and dissatisfied with the overall product. Would return if I could
1,Upon trying out the light only half of it lit up. It must have been wired and or sodered incorrectly.
1,The stand was very weak and not stable the light kept falling down.
1,Muy mala calidad  las piezas y el material no son buenos
1,I unboxed it and it turned on a few seconds and shut off. I connected varies ways and nothing. What a waste.
1,Used 2 times in the one month I have had it and the light has gone out of it.
1,Was broken when it arrivedOnly lit in half of the ‚Äú ring ‚Äú returned it
1,There a piece missing can‚Äôt put it together
1,I turned on the ring light and it went out within 5 seconds of trying to use it.
1,This item came with NO tripod which makes the light pointless. Not only was the entire ordered delayed but it came incomplete. Very disappointed
1,I disliked how I got it I used it one time and the next day it stopped working! üò°
1,I used this twice for about 10 each minutes before the light died.
1,Wanted to use for Zoom but was WAY too bright yet poorly illuminated subject.Returned product.
1,Finally wanted to use the tripod and went to screw it on and it broke. please replace
1,Seemed like a good investment.  Yet light start going out after a month of having it.
1,Crappy product. Doesn‚Äôt stand properly. Very disappointed. I would have rather spend more money and gotten a better one
1,Extremely flimsy . Wouldn‚Äôt stand up on it‚Äôs on. fell on carpet and cracked. Doesn‚Äôt even hold phone
1,Did not come with all of the pieces. Not able to attach my phone to the stand üôÑ
1,Breaks easily. Not steady or well made.
1,At 3 months only the lowest setting worked. After 6 months it doesn't work at all. Nothing.
1,IT BROKE WHEN U BOUGHT IT

1,Bad quality

1,broke about a month after i got it tripod sucks btw
1,The iPhone is to large to fit in its very cheap quality can‚Äôt even use it
1,Stand is not sturdy. My phone won't stay in place and keeps falling. Not good quality.
1,Definitely not what I expected was hoping for something taller and better quality.
1,Loved it but it stopped working less than a week after purchase! Do not recommend.
1,Well it was great at first. 3 months later and it doesn‚Äôt work at all.
1,Paid $50 4 months ago stopped working! The light isn't great and it won't last.
1,It is missing pieces

1,It stopped working within two days of receiving  it üôÉ
1,This thing broke after the third use and stopped lighting up.
1,Mine came missing a few important pieces so it cannot hold my phone. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠
1,First time I used it the clip for your phone broke. Wish I could return it.
1,We had this for less than a month and it stopped working.
1,Spend a few extra dollars for better quality. This light is not bright at all.
1,The tripod is very short in a pic it showed it get taller
1,Bought twice both were duds
1,Nice and bright. Falls apart in seconds. Great for lighting your closet but not much else.
1,Cannot attach the tripod to the ring light. Will not thread. Useless.
1,This item broke in less than 2 months with minimal use. Don't buy.
1,It stopped working after 2 weeks of having it and I barely used the thing.
1,Skip this.  It‚Äôs not stable and the tripod is worthless.
1,Only worked the first time I turned it on then never worked again.
1,It stopped working after using it just 2 times!
1,Doesn't work after about a dozen uses. Cheap.
1,Replacement just stopped working. Used it 6 times.Do not buy.
1,Lights started to fail after about one month.
1,The thing lasted all of 20 minutes before it completely died. I‚Äôm returning it.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†My ring light won‚Äôt stop blinking?? Why is it blinking?? Can‚Äôt even be fixed
1,The phone holder shattered when I tried to insert my phone. Very disappointed.
1,It didn‚Äôt work.It would not light up after I plugged it in.
1,This is very folksy falls down before it‚Äôs assembled
1,Didn't really add much to my pics
1,Stand doesn‚Äôt stay up. Falls over. Poor quality.

1,Had to buy another one :(Unreliable!
1,My light came missing the piece that connects the phone holder to the stand
1,Piece of junk - never lit up
1,Absolute junk
1,Not good @ all Horrible very flimsy
1,Came broken and returned
1,I return  because it‚Äôs so bad quality
1,CRAPPY LIGHT
1,my light went out
1,doesn't work
1,Very bad
1,Stopped working after a month
1,Cannot assemble parts do not fit. Useless.
5,I use this for my work from home meetings and it makes a big difference on camera!
3,I received this as a gift in March or so and absolutely loved it. However here I am less than a year later and it‚Äôs dead. When I plug it into an outlet it does nothing. So sad because I loved it and I was hoping it would work for a long time.
5,Good product
4,So I love the light and the settings the size is perfect but I wish that it would lock in place enough to hold up my phone.
5,Works great. Bright light and very versatile. Gonna make some great tiktoks with it.
5,I loved it! I offer virtual classes and this small device works just perfectly. I don't need to worry about exterior lights or anything else. Thank you!
4,Light is great. The phone holder and base aren't that great. The legs can't lock to make the position higher. They just slide to the widest position so the height stays at lower. I used a box to adjust the height with my phone on because if I didn't I would have to crouch down to record videos or take photos. The phone holder isn't strong for larger phones like the S21 ultra. It wants to lean even when I tightened the screw to keep it in place. The light is barely wide enough for my phone.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love this but I think I lost the phone attachment piece! I‚Äôd like to upgrade to one that can go even taller but this is worth every penny and a great starter item!
3,Pros: This ring light definitely gets the job done. It‚Äôs light weight and for personal use. Not meant for a large setting. It has about 4 different brightness settings with three different lighting colors - bright white golden light and blue light.Cons: Stops working very easily. This is my second time purchasing. My first one stopped working (just completely stopped turning on) within a couple of weeks buying it. I got a replacement that lasted longer but after a year (without constant use) it has done the same thing. The power button doesn‚Äôt even light up so the entire ring light is completely blown.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The quality of brightness is amazing and the 3 different tones are great. I use this ring light mostly for cosplay photos and videos but also use it as a desk lamp. Thing is just today it stopped working. It would not turn on. The blue light is turned on though meaning it's connected but it still doesn't turn on. Really weird and I'm not sure if there's a warranty for this sort of stuff but some sort of accommodation would be nice. I was really looking forward to using this for a long time. :(
4,It‚Äôs very easy to use but it stopped turning on properly 3 months into me having it. I‚Äôll try to turn it on and it will flicker on when I press the button and then it will just turn off again. Sometimes it won‚Äôt turn on at all
3,Bought this to do live videos on Facebook.  Lights fine but the thing that attaches the tripod to the light doesn‚Äôt screw in the light.  It‚Äôs like the screw is too rounded off. Not happy.  UPDATE after contacting amazon. They immediately replaced this for me  it even. Came  the next day.  Very pleased with new light. Works wonderfully
5,This was a fun and useful ring light to use for virtual calls and meetings. The light has adjustable multiple colors and settings. This was easy to use and set up. Good product for an affordable price.Update: after using for a couple weeks the brightness and quality is still good. Will keep using this handy ring light.
5,I love this however it needs to be more sturdy.
5,I ordered this for my high school senior as she has several video presentations she must do in preparation for graduation - especially now that school is 100% online.  I was presently surprised that it came and wasn't broken as UPS just tossed the box over our wall.  It works well.  The video quality is pretty close to professional in my humble opinion. Most importantly my daughter is very satisfied with the purchase.
5,thank you very much my daugther is going to love going to order more soon

The pink tone is my favorite. I got this as a Secret Santa gift and couldn‚Äôt wait to put it together and try it out. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Put it together and make your best modeling face like I did üòâ

You can set it up for vertical or horizontal phone holder. Just screw it in for your desire setups! It fits for all smartphones sizes since the phone holder is adjustable! Very recommended! Probably going to purchase another one for a gift!
2,The tripod does not stay up well. It is really hard to get my phone into the clasp when my phone case is on. I also found it very inconvenient you can‚Äôt use it with a normal USB port. Definitely not satisfied. Wish I would have spent a little more to get a better one.
2,The tripod is way too flimsy to support a device being attached. If it didn't have the option to attach a device I'd have rated it higher.So now I use the attachment for a small magnifying mirror to make plucking chin hair easier with the bright light.... or brows.... üòÅ
5,My daughter loves this light - now she can take professional looking selfies! No it's actually for her to use when doing makeup applications as she's an aspiring makeup artist. It's easy to use and the light is bright but not too glaring. The adjustable settings are very helpful to have too. She's recommended it to her whole esthetics class!
5,The illumination minimizes shadows on my face and brightens my look.  BEST part is light ring hold my phone at exactly the right height and frees up my hands during my ZOOM calls.
2,Not sure about the ring light but I did not appreciate the inadequacy of the tripod stand. I'd planned to position the tripod behind the monitor so the ring light would perch above it and illuminate my face. But the tripod is way too short for that. Moreover if I were to position to the side the legs splay out too wide and it is super unstable as other reviewers noted. If it came with a different tripod it might work.
5,The shipping was fast  the ring like was purchased for our 4 kids all under the age of 10. They haven‚Äôt gotten it yet since it‚Äôs a Christmas present but i checked it out and it‚Äôs easy to assemble and overall really cool with the three different lighting settings .
5,I purchased this light for my daughter because she likes taking pictures and using tic tok. This light is very bright and a very nice size I would highly recommend it.
5,It is an amazing product and I love it!
1,There were two immediate problems. First the tripod stand was too weak to securely support the light right. The light touch or movement caused it to collapse. There was no way to tighten the legs. Second the mechanism that holds and stabilizes the light ring itself was really difficult to adjust and the part itself appear flimsy and likely to break with even modest use.
5,This is a great product I love it
5,Great for taking pictures!
2,The light stopped working after 2 months. I had to get a new one. The stand does not have rubber stoppers on the bottom so I had to use cardboard to keep it from slipping. The legs also had no tension or locking mechanism so they would slide all over the place.
2,Total rip off. Product broke after about 50 uses.
5,wœÉnd—îrful lœÉv—î √≠tüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Excellent! To do live instagram phone videos
5,Perfect. My 10 years does YouTube videos and she loves it. The stand fits her iPhone 8plus.
5,This is a awesome light to purchaser i highly recommend this product
5,Great ring light!
2,After one day of use the light won‚Äôt stay on. It was nice while it worked.
5,So bright.
5,Its so cute! Its small enough to be able to take along during travels! It takes up less room than the regular size. Very bright!
1,Piece of crap. First I couldn‚Äôt get the phone piece to stay on just falls out no matter how tight I put it even using pliers. It worked for like maybe 5 minutes and then the light wouldn‚Äôt change settings. Light kept shutting off after couple minutes of being on. Every time I tried to change the light setting it turned off then wouldn‚Äôt turn back. And almost started a fire. The plug got super super hot and I could smell burning. Made a loud noise and now won‚Äôt work at all don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,Do not buy this!! The legs are flimsy and the light won‚Äôt stay lit for more than 5 minutes IF it even turns on. Total waste of money!
1,You get what you pay for. It stopped working properly after about 2 months stopped working entirely after 4 months.
1,Bought this product some weeks agos i‚Äôve asked beforehand how long could i use it for and they said all the time i wanted. Used ut for about an hour long and out of nowhere it turned off. Now it doesnt work anymore i just cant turn it on again.
1,It arrived and only half of it turned on. The rest was broken
1,DONT BUY!!! Had this thing for only about 3 months and it‚Äôs already broken!!!

Issue is when I first got it it was very difficult to put together. Pieces will fall off a few times. After I assembled it it only worked a few times. When it did it was a nice brightness. Now whenever I try to turn it on it doesn‚Äôt work until i try taking it out of the outlet but it flickers. I‚Äôve tried my computer different usb and different outlets still hasn‚Äôt worked with any of those options. I also tried re-assembling the pieces again but no luck.
5,Makes my Live Photo‚Äôs look like portrait mode! I received this yesterday and me and my daughter can‚Äôt stop taking selfie‚Äôs. The assembly was super easy and the best part is you can switch how it holds your phone horizontally or vertically. You just unscrew the part that holds the phone and flip it the other way and screw it back in. The light is really bright the buttons are super easy to use and read it has different modes where you can make it brighter or lighter and then two different types of different lighting that you can mix together. Very sturdy and honestly my favorite thing in my room right now. Going to have my friends buy this product because it‚Äôs a serious game changerüíï

Nice having 3 lighting hues and multiple levels of brightness. The stand is one height easy to place on books or a box if you would like it higher. Easily holds any size phone but did not adapt well for my iPhone XR with a case and pop sockets in place.  I shoot most of my video horizontal so the stand works well. Not sure how to adjust for vertical shooting. Gives me everything I was looking for.

Sometimes you don‚Äôt need professional light you just need a little bit of extra light so the video looks better. That‚Äôs when the ring lights become super helpful. It‚Äôs great and an expensive tool for all the video creators and even people who have to use zoom for work and simply want to look better in the video.
1,Light worked fine I couldn‚Äôt really use it. At first I received the light with a defective mount. Before I even got to return it I was sent another light. This light was missing the camera/phone holder; so that defeated the purpose for the light. I reached out to customer support and asked if I can just take the missing piece for the defective one before I mailed it back in and instead they offered for me to contact the manufacturer because they didn‚Äôt have the part to can send me. Honestly I needed this sooner than later and I wasn‚Äôt going to call back and forth for such a cheap item. Now I have to go return both of these lights for a refund. I do not recommend this seller.
5,I ordered this Ring Light/Phone Holder to use in Virtual Choir videos.  I needed better equipment because my standard desk lamp lights my face insufficiently and unevenly and its a bit of a pain to stack boxes to elevate my phone to the proper height.The lamp works very well.  I use the default warm white (I think) but I do turn down the default brightness a couple of clicks.  I've had no problems (with three days of usage) with lamp fading/shutoff as some have described.  Its plugged into a USB port on a desktop computer; the first port I tried apparently wasn't powered but the second port I tried worked well.  Backlights on the power/light switch come on when power is generated.Ideally it would be nice if the lamp were a little physically smaller because if placed directly in front of a computer monitor (which displays my music) I can't see all of the music.  So I have to place the light a little off-center from the monitor and you can tell from the videos that I'm looking off to the side a little bit.  But I suspected I might have that problem when I bought the lamp so I'm living with it.The phone holder just barely expands to hold my IPhone 8 Plus w/ case.  It wasn't clear to me from the questions/reviews on amazon.com whether the phone holder could be adjusted for vertical/portrait (I have had a vertical video requirement for one choir) in addition to the pictured horizontal/landscape view but it can; there's a  female adapter on two sides of the "mobile clip" which holds the phone.My only problem which I've resolved satisfactorily by making environmental adjustments is that the only method for increasing the height of the light/phone is to manipulate the angles of the tripod legs.  My IPhone 8 Plus is apparently heavy enough that the tripod legs aren't stable in any but the shortest/widest position.  As a result the phone isn't quite as high as I'd prefer (but its close).All-in-all this light is working well for me.
5,Now that life is conducted virtually for most of us we need to look to Hollywood and the art and magic of great lighting! It makes all the difference! Look more confident feel more confident in your client meetings interviews auditions recordings whatever you have to do in front of the webcam or phone. Great inexpensive medium sized light.

So make it lighter or dimmer up to you. Phone holder in the center for any kind of media you choose!!!!! Its lightand shper portable.  I dont really have any cons about this. Theres no charger/wall outlet piece however again i personally have extra ports lying around so it actually is to my personal benefit to not have the charger square. Thrilled I decided to get this. Definitely glad it's in my home!
5,This is a really awesome affordable light. I love that you can do three setting of the bright daylight light 3 settings of the warm light and 3 of the combo Incase you can‚Äôt decide between daylight and warm. It‚Äôs well packaged it‚Äôs prefect for your vanity and for makeup. I usually do my makeup on the floor in front of a floor length mirror and it works great for that as well. I love that it‚Äôs usb so it can be used with a computer USB port or you can use an adapter and plug it into the wall.
4,I don't like the wobbly stand but love the lights
2,I was excited to receive the product and used it to make vlogs. I have had it for less than one month (used it 3 times) and it will no longer work. In the middle of recording a video the light and electricity to the product stopped working. I tried changing outlets plugged it to different computers and it just won't work. I real let down for this product!
5,*adjustable tripod legs / phone holder / ring angle* comes with everything needed to set up EXCEPT the USB adapter (which is the same as a phone charger‚Äôs)* 3 light modes (warm fluorescent white) as well as ability to dim / brightenThis is my very first ring light / phone tripod and now that I have one I can‚Äôt believe I have lived without one for so long!I was first interested in this item during Walmart‚Äôs Black Friday sale but I missed it and at regular ‚Äúsale‚Äù price it is $25 and up. Luckily Amazon had it cheaper and with quick delivery. I was so excited for this that as soon as it got here I opened it and used it right away! When I opened it it came with a simple instruction paper with a QR code if you open your camera and scan the code it opens up a YouTube video that shows you how to set up the tripod (the video repeats itself it seems long but it just replays the same 3 to 4 simple steps). I was delighted by that because I am normally too lazy to read the manuals and setting up this tripod was a lot easier than it looked.I love this both as a lighting source (which I desperately needed) for when I do live streams and as a tripod for making videos or even watching videos on your phone. It was able to fit both a large Samsung A51 WITH a thick otter box case AND a small iPhone SE comftrably! The legs are sturdy and adjustable as well as the phone holder so you can set it up at the perfect angle.I am very happy with my purchase I am getting a lot more out of this ring light tripod than I expected!
5,Before purchasing I read the reviews and they were 50/50 some people like it some people don‚Äôt but personally I love it. I think it‚Äôs a GREAT ring light. It‚Äôs very easy to assemble nothing was broken the only thing you need is a USB device to plug it into in order for it to work. My daughter and I tried it out and I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. The three settings are very bright and what I LOVE is you have the option to dim and make the certain setting brighter using the + - buttons on the remote. 10/10 would highly recommend this light ‚ò∫Ô∏éÔ∏é
2,Gave it 2 stars bc the actual light is fine. The legs and phone holder are trash. Like a newborn giraffe the legs can‚Äôt seem to hold itself up. I have smaller sizes iPhone but the phone holder will not hold it with a thin case and definitely will not hold anything with a pop socket. Packaging back up and sending back. Lame.
3,First off the packaging is good it worked out of the box and the different CT modes are good. The mixed CT is more cool than warm and the cool CT is definitely brighter than the warm by itself. It looks good the tripod it comes with is pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù so i put it on a table top one that was better. Lightweight.The shoe and phone attachment is‚Ä¶passable. Sorta.For $20 it‚Äôs pretty dang good but i have noticed color flickering when doing zoom on an ipad pro that I don‚Äôt get with normal continuous light sources like bulbs or other higher end led panels but hey‚Ä¶it‚Äôs around $20 and the flickering isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for that price. But don‚Äôt expect this to replace a really proper ring light from a higher end manufacturer.
5,My Daughter works in Human Resources since Covid started she works presenting on Zoom calls several times per day. I gave her the LED ring light as a gift and she says the quality of her zoom calls makes a world of difference.The brightness of the light is really great! The difference in the quality of the lighting for photos & zoom calls is exactly what she was looking for. The product is very easy to use..  The camera remote connects to Bluetooth and enable you to take photos at a distance. We definitely recommend this product.
5,I was actually surprised at how little but bright this ring light is!! It's super lightweight and very easy to put away and store. I love that you can adjust the tone of lighting as well. It goes from normal to a cool to a warm light. This would ve perfect if you don't have a big space to do makeup or to take on the go if you're traveling.
5,Had difficulty in the beginning company was quick to help resolve the issue. Perfect stand to leave out or fold and pull out when needed.
5,Let me say. I didn't have high hopes with this at first but as soon as I turned it on I thought I died and seen the white light. Whatever you do. Don't touch your eyeball with it while testing it out. It's friggin bright.
5,i have to film at home auditions sometimes from home and because I have overhead lighting in every room of the house it caat terrible shadows on my face. A friend recommended this to me and it totally fixes the problem not to mention it was fabulous for taking great quality photos of my kiddos inside!
5,This product is amazing! Especially great for it's price the ringlight is bright and has different colors which can suit the vibe of any video you are shooting. Also great for selfies! The stand for both the ringlight and phone is sturdy and easy to assemble. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a professional looking set for an affordable price!  Great for gifts as well.
5,This ring light is game changer. It has 3 lighting modes: bright white warm yellow and yellow. It has usb power cord and is easy to setup. Perfect your video blogs and pictorials. Me and my friends had fun during the holidays celebrations and realized  righlight is now a must. We used it for the christmas and new year countdown get togethers.
4,Perfect for desktop streaming or filming makeup tutorials etc. This small and handy Tripod is not height adjustable but ideal for desk or elevated use. I like the variety of shades and colors you can alternate with this ring light. It is VERY bright and so its great that you and adjust it to a warmer lighting tones. Reasonably priced for beginner vblogger or for taking selfies with better lighting. Gets the job done! As time goes on I think the stand legs have loosened a bit but it still holds up. Great for zoom calls as well as long as it stays in position!
5,this ring light is absolutely a NEED for perfect lighting! it‚Äôs good for just taking some pics for your socials or filming a youtube video. it comes with a stand that is customizable you‚Äôre able to position it any way you like. there‚Äôs also a dimmable feature so you have a variety of light brightnesses to choose from too. there‚Äôs also different light settings there‚Äôs a daylight feature and more of an orange lighting and a few more to choose from too. 100%%% my favorite and go to light

5,This light is so amazing. I had a ring light before but way smaller and oh my gosh the difference it makes! It was very easy to put together. I like how it can be very low off the counter but the legs are just a little weird of the tripod. Overall very satisfied and it‚Äôs going to make filming videos very easy
5,The brightness alone is a great reason to purchase this product. I was looking for a ring light to make my products stand out in pictures for my clients. The ring light is easy to use and set up. I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening up the package. I love the different light settings and the remote that is easy to use. Definitely really happy with my purchase!
5,Extremely impressed with how good this light ring is. I like that it comes with an attachment to hold my phone in check centre. The lead is nice and long which helps when setting it up ready to use as your not limited where you can stand it. It has multiple light settings and adjustable sturdy stand. I put it all together and got it working without reading any instructions so its definitely very easy to use. Overall I think its excellent value for money
5,I bought this light to take pictures of my sons work for educational purposes. It was so easy to set up my son helped me as you can see. The base is so sturdy he also likes to use it as a drum base. I've bought a few other taller ring lights for work but this little one had the strongest base. Just make sure your desk or space you use is big enough or it won't  fit on your desk.

5,Great quality Ring light! Has many different light settings. Very easy to assemble under 5 minutes. The best part it holds the phone sturdy to take great quality videos or pictures.
5,Awesome light!  Very easy to assemble and to use.  It‚Äôs nice and bright. Very cute and well worth the money.  The kids love it and use it also a lot of the time.

4,I love this ring light! My only issue is the tripod legs are flimsy!
5,I love the different light settings and the stand makes it easier to place in one spot and grab the needed pictures. It also is super helpful when I travel and do my makeup as not all hotels have the best lighting. Definitely recommend!
5,This LED ring light works pretty well compare to other similar products this one offers a great price and same function. I like it a lot.
5,My son and I tiktok and we got this and it has been working great love it so much it‚Äôs also great for selfies
5,I really like the multiple settings for brightness. Good value
5,High end selfie ring light. I use for my live make up videos. I can easily adjust the brightness with the controller on the wire. The wire is long enough to where I don‚Äôt need to be stuck to an outlet. It is very large and could be used for so many things.It is very light weight so it‚Äôs easy to travel with.
5,Helps me take pictures and make them look more professional.  Live how the light affects the look of the items.  Easy to setup and use.

Everything is good just like advertising. I Don't know if I order something wrong but I do know my phone does not fit on the mobile cap but that's the only thing
5,I don't write alot of reviewsbut this item is one of the best items i brought off amazon by far....I have been using it to take photos of my jewelry and its also good for selfies it just makes my low budget camera phone seem like its better quality overall...
5,As advertised
5,Great buy especially for the price. Makes you look great for live chats or recording videos!
5,I was in need of this tripad light as I have right space in my office with all gadget. Sometimes need to take a quick phone shots to a product. Bright light multi functionality and very easy to put together haven‚Äôt tried my canon camera if there is a way to attach it to it will update in future.
5,Like the different light colors and adjustment settings. Works well and doubles as a desk lamp.Easy to install
5,Buen presio
1,It broke the first time I used it.
5,Super easy to set up. I love that it came with a scan code linking the YouTube video for instructions.Has 3 settings but multiple options in between the 3 settings with brightness and dimming buttons.Perfect for selfies and my vanity. Price point it is worth every dollar.

5,For some weird reason I was expecting an smaller ring light.  I was very happy about the size and the practicality of it.  I can take it with me to different locations and it is easy to carry around.  Love the fact that has three different tones of light that's a plus is super easy to set up either with your IPhone or a regular camera.  I like it a lot for my desk camera selfies and small videos.  Some times the camera's flash is not the best so this light comes very handy.2 thumps up!!
5,Great quality  love the different light settings especially for the price .
1,Does not live up to the product image. Poor quality poor lighting and the tripod is flimsy.
1,When I turned it on only a part of it was glowing. The whole other side of it was out. Not really sure what happened. Will be sending it back
5,The ring light is awesome! It really helps with making videos from your phone!
5,Like
5,This ring light impressed me and that‚Äôs hard to do because I buy so many gadgets on a regular basis. The packaging keeps all the components to the light secure and the instructions are easy to follow. I was able to slide on my Logitech web cam without an issue and found that making adjustments to the angle of the light was incredibly easy to do with a twist of a couple of knobs. The light gives a studio-quality appearance to your video which makes this a worthwhile investment for anyone who has to be in front of a camera.

It helps me look good when I record my videos. The tripod only has one stance. The part of the phone holder is adjustable to fit any phone and it plugs into the wall.
5,With my money i am in love
5,I use it to make TikToks and take pics/vids. I‚Äôve had it for a while now and it‚Äôs still working fine. They lights are a little glitchy but that‚Äôs only Bc the wire was messed up in my suitcase. It‚Äôs still useful and makes everything look way better
5,For the longest time I‚Äôve been struggling with the lighting for my plant account! I‚Äôm a rare plant collector and love to capture all the colors of my rare plants. This ring light has made the process quick and easy!!! no more endless frustrating moments editing photos to correct the lighting. Very satisfied!!!
2,when i got my package in the mail it physically looked good but once I turned it on it didn't light all the way up. Im going to exchange and see if maybe I got a bad one ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,Easy to assemble with directions provided.  Provides great lighting for pictures of videos.  Holds your phone.  Easy to click controller on cord.  Let‚Äôs you try different lighting choices.  Lighting is very good!  Definitely would recommend.
5,This little LED ring light is perfect! Brightens up my face for live videos and photos. Plugs right into my computer. The pricepoint is really good for a device like this.

5,Bright and versatile ring light gives your streams or videos a bright and vibrant light which gives a great viewer experience. I highly recommend this light if you are an entry level youtuber or stream You will not be disappointed.
5,There is 3 color can choose and it comes with USB charger. I was starting to do vlog and social media. this come across my mind. It come with expectations the phone holder is a must when I am trying to do tiktok. Well the more of the light the better for me.  My pictures came out Great.
5,Really bright I see how my makeup looks before going out and I can see how to do my hair and do my facial correctly.its ok for a table top light haven‚Äôt use the camera option yet.
5,Liked the product. The stand is firm and the 3 shades of light is perfect for making videos with your cell phone.It helps in face recognition and also very helpful where light is bit low.My wife uses it when she was doing her makeup. She was reallyamazed with this one. I didn‚Äôt tried it yet but can be used as a table lamp as well.
5,Great powerful light with good support for the phone. Seems well built and I like the length of the cord.
5,I really liked this ring light! I have a few already but they are mostly used to photograph things for sale. This one I already used for make up  face cleaning and photographing smaller items. It gives very good balanced lighting. If you have a darker room or bathroom this ring light is a must have!
5,I was pretty surprised about the quality of this light! It has three different settings with the ability to lower brightness and such. It really enhances videos and pictures and I'd even go as far as to say the price is quite generous! The only complaint I could think to give is that its tripod is quite short but worst comes to worst you could always buy a longer one.
5,Works great!
5,Perfect desk light with three different light modes. I love that its short so i can use it on my desk and use it for selfies and videos.. phone holder is a life saver..
5,I was surprised to see how big this product was I expected to receive something smaller and this exceeded my expectations! I love it! I really like that the 3 light settings can be automatically switched and the ring light is  big and bright. I love that it comes with a control to turn on and off or change lighting. Definitely worth the price!
5,The light is so bright it is perfect! Gives a good all round light to me when I‚Äôm talking to the camera. The switch on the cable is well made and responsive when changing modes. The tripod good quality  and the price point is so good for the quality light. I would highly recommend!!!
3,This ring light is very bright and I like the tripod that comes with it. My only problem is that it feels and looks cheap.
4,This ring light is mostly great EXCEPT the legs are so weak that they won‚Äôt stay in place. If you move it at all they bend to a new shape. If you‚Äôre trying to do transition videos that require a STEADY tripod this isn‚Äôt it. The light is great though. I like that it does not get hot.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Light works as expected good quality for the price
5,Absolutely love this ring light. When it came in me my fianc√© and his brother played with this thing for about an hour. We love how there‚Äôs different lights to choose from. It helps take the most amazing pictures as well.
5,This light makes the video quality really pick up. Super impressed at the brightness of the ring light.  I love that the phone fits right in the center so when you speak to the camera you don't have any shadows on your face. Highly recommend for table use in stationary vlogging.

5,This is very hard to put together it did not have clear instructions that came with it. But once I figured it out and start using it it is a great piece of equipment the only thing that could be done better is making it a little bit more sturdy to hold larger phones
1,Bought the product to use as a lamp for Zoom calls and the light turns off on its own after 20 or so minutes. The buttons become unresponsive and I can't turn it back on for 1-2 hours. Very frustrating. Will be returning.

Can‚Äôt wait to try this with my friends on our girl‚Äôs getaway this weekend!
4,the legs kept sliding around and it wasn‚Äôt stable. the weight of my phone would make it slide down. other than that it‚Äôs pretty good lighting
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Great size just like the picture worth the money! Perfect if you don‚Äôt have much space home to get the big ones.
5,Gifted this to my girlfriend. She loves to take selfies. She has also integrated it into her makeup routine. You can safely say she‚Äôs really upped her game. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with this product!
5,This Ring light is a great basic starter! Attaching is easy!
1,My product arrived with faulty parts and the light settings don't work properly. Save your money and go for a different ring light. This one shouldn't even be sold.
4,The three tone lighting is really great. My least favorite thing about this was the legs on it and trying not to have it fall over. Additionally one of the grips have already come off the area where it holds my phone. Otherwise; I‚Äôve used it mostly on the background on meetings and it has been super nice.
5,I love it!! It‚Äôs so cute and works perfectly my phone fits well the light is awesome. Is easy to use perfect for my IG videos and lives  perfect size very light weight easy to carry around. Ships fast!
5,I purchased this for make up application and it is great. It ended up breaking but it was my fault because I kept dropping it. I tried to re-order a taller one from another company but ended up coming back to this product to order again. The lighting is very good.
5,The bottom part that they tell you to unscrew on the bottom of pantilt 3 requires the strength of an elephant. Lol! All in all the quality of lighting is amazing!!
5,Love how I can instantly see the difference in pictures and videos. This light is great easy to control and the quality is good.
4,First one didn‚Äôt work however seller responded IMMEDIATELY to my email and helped me get a replacement.This is excellent. It does take power so I can‚Äôt plug it to my PC needs to be plugged into an outlet to get the power it needs. Works great and so much less expensive than the competition
5,This is just so amazing for a great price you get a ring light with 3 different colors that let the picture and videos amazing. I did some videos and the quality with the ring light is uncontested I was just shocked. I use a lot a lot my Instagram it‚Äôs happy!
5,Yo the other reviews were like it‚Äôs bomb but it was one of the cheaper ones.I already have a flexible tripod so just needed the light. The stand is kind of awkward but the light itself is A M A Z I N G.

It has great light with different intensities and color changes.And the support is really steady too; It holds an iPhone 11 with no problem.I'm not sure if the video appreciate the color changes but the are quite notable in person.

5,Great brightness! Really helps the lighting for indoor photos and I love the adjustable brightness feature.
5,Shipping Was Fast. I Ordered This for Lighting When I‚Äôm Cooking and Recording. Everything Was Just As Described.
5,Super happy with this purchase! I bought it originally for helping me take better photos of clothing. Since then- I have used it all over including to help my bad eyesight and help me with my makeup! It‚Äôs perfect bright light makes it super easy for me. My photos are much clearer and look more professional. Highly recommend !
1,The light doesn‚Äôt work! I read all the reviews hoping I could narrow it down to one that was good quality and the I got one it and the light just flashes it doesn‚Äôt stay on. Such a disappointment.
5,This light is awesome! It came with very easy instruction and once it was set up it was very easy to maneuver. The 3 different lights make your pictures look amazing and more professional. I have no complainants! Would definitely recommend.
1,it‚Äôs plastic & super cheap material. Don‚Äôt recommend!!!! Just buy the $90 version! TRSUT ME
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I highly recommend this product!! Great to use in bathroom counter a table vertical and horizontal. The lighting is great and it changes to adjust your preference.
5,First it was used to take pics for online sales. Now it's being used by my online streamer. Works great
4,The only thing that I dislike about the light is that it‚Äôs not as compact as I thought. It‚Äôs not flexible enough for what I need it for.
4,I was pleasantly surprised by all of the light settings. I was disappointed that it is small. It does come with a tripod but it only balances on a table.Nice quality though!
5,I purchased this as a last minute gift for my teenage daughter. I must say that I am pleased! Her photos came out beautiful. The brightness is perfect and great camera quality. This is the perfect size for selfies! It was worth the money.

5,It was a gift and she loved it ! She said its as good if npt better than some of the higher priced ones she has used.

5,I absolutely love this light ring. I use mine for makeup and for tik tok videos! The warm light setting is perfect and makes me look flawless. It‚Äôs easy to set up and move around.
5,Bright and wsy to adjust.
4,For it's price that I got it not bad. The part that holds the phone slips out a little. And it's not exactly adjustable in height. It really only stays down but overall it's okay.
5,Love this product!! Lighting is perfect & adjustable.
5,I LOVE this camera light for my phone. It takes beautiful group photos and selfies. I love how it has different shades of light to choose from and that it perfectly fits your phone. a PERFECT gift and a must have!!
4,I honestly was surprised at how great the light was when I streamed. It made my cheap Webcam look way better then before. Everything else feels cheap. It was difficult for me to set my phone up so I just set it up behind my Webcam.
5,great for cutting hairwish I had gotten 18 inch though.
5,BUY THIS. If you're skeptical don't be. You can get a taller tripod much cheaper and connect it to this light ring.
5,I love this ring light! It has 3 different types of lighting options and you can adjust the brightness. It's perfect for my live makeup tutorials!
4,This is a nice table top ring light.  My 11. & 18 year old love them!
5,i still use it to this day since 2019
3,El control se descompuso en 30 minutosüòí
5,This ring light just stepped my selfie game up a notch! I have already bought two more for my sisters. This light is so helpful with makeup too. It‚Äôs not too yellow so it gives off a true filtered look
3,Concern about the stability of the tripod. it could be improved.
5,Very good ring light I ordered it and I came a day after I ordered it I don‚Äôt have prime ether
5,perfect!  exsctly what I needed.

5,Works great holds the phone and makes me look better on conference calls!
5,I like it
2,The item looks like it was purchased before it didn‚Äôt not come with the phone holder and the tripod!! Was looking forward to using this item the led ring like works perfect but have no where to hang it or hold on too.
5,The light is a great value not so much the tripod
5,This is so great my selfies look amazing!
3,light is amazing but it won‚Äôt stand up on its on. very disappointed
5,Can‚Äôt beat this and it has an amazing price!
5,Great quality and cheap price best for video calling!It has 3 different brightness levels with cool and warm light options.Definitely recommend.
2,Fall when you put the phone and the stick is very short. The light is good
5,I love it. So good for the price
5,I love this thing. It‚Äôs perfect for a little extra light or just to keep on your vanity!
5,Once you get through setting this product up it works wonderful! Would definitely be a great gift for teenagers or young adults!
5,It‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs cheaply made
5,Easy to assemble plug in and get to work! Very nice light with some bright settings. Easy to adjust solid base and i like you can plug it into a charger or i just plug mine in right into my laptop for faster setup.
5,I love it
5,This thing is awesome for the price i just hook up my power bank and boom on to streaming
5,I really like this tripod stand! I got one because I‚Äôve started making more videos. The circle light around it really enhances my video quality more than a regular tripod stand. It has three different light settings and each setting can be dimmed a cool light warm light and a combo of the two.

5,I really love the ring light it work amazing  good quality and shipping is also on time.
5,Very satisfied
5,I already had took it out and used it but it's a very good lithg will be buying again
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I purchased this light to make tiktoks. The light is self is good its varies settings work great. My issue is shooting vertically and trying to switch from rear facing camera to front facing camera is not real easy. The adapter that attaches to the light as to be removed and flipped around instead of just an adjustment.
5,I was happy upon receiving this that it came with a QR code to a video to show you how to put it together rather than have a big confusing pamphlet. The types of lighting and brightness are perfect for any situation you‚Äôll need it for and the range of motion that holds your phone or whatever device you put in the holder is very versatile. The only thing that‚Äôs a potential problem (and I‚Äôm not going to mark down the review stars because it‚Äôs just basic physics) is the weight of your phone or device you put into the holder may pull down the light. But thankfully it‚Äôs adjustable in the right sense where you can fix it up right with enough fiddling. I would recommend this product for someone who needs a separate ring light or someone who would like a short ring light the plus side is the mobile holder adapter. It also comes with a USB plug-in which is helpful.
5,excellent. Buena calidad hace su funcion perfecto.
5,My teen loves it
5,Broke in less than four months.
3,It‚Äôs ok can‚Äôt get the stand to stay up
5,Face recognition" is awesome and brightness  is great levels
5,This product works great the light is very bright and makes my pictures look flawless. I love it because it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. You can also change the setting on how bright you want the light.
5,It was exactly what I hoped for!
5,I had to buy this after seeing how good this light works for my son ü§£ so we‚Äôre both in here being bougie ü§£.
4,This ring light is practicable for what it can do. The brightness is great! Wish it was slightly longer so I could switch from my desk to the floor but other than that does what it needs to do!
5,I am using it for my live feed to sell jewelry. All the items can be seen so clearly. I am happy with my purchase.
5,Picked up this ring light after trying out a few other lighting solutions. This is simple to set up and control it does a great job for both zoom calls for work and recording videos for my youtube channel. I would recommend this based on value and performance.
5,Love the fact can be used anywhere camping in car or at home works great
5,This is a solid product that I would recommend. I like the three different temperatures and the levels of brightness control. Great mechanical variations too. Just wish it had a remote but not a show stopper for my use.
5,First ring light I‚Äôve ever got and I got to admit I‚Äôm in LOVE!! I got it on sale too so it makes it even better. 10/10 satisfied! ü§©
5,BRIGHTNESS IS JUST PERFECT !!!!!!  All the light levels are amazing in all of the 3different colors that have just depends on what type of selfie or photo you want to get just get it you will love it ! Plus it can fit in others selfie stands I also have a taller one that it‚Äôs not even from the same brand and this ring definitely fit the base on the stand I already have!
5,LOVE THIS SOOO MUCH!!
5,good
3,Light works well but the stand never wants to stay especially with weight.
5,I needed this stand/light to create professional videos. It works great!
5,I love this light! It is the perfect size and holds my large phone well! I like that there are three colors and different brightness settings!
5,Great product and price very fast delivery.Love it.
5,Buy this light if you‚Äôre looking for something small but effective. The light is super bright and it has three settings. I love it. My selfies look great. But it ladiessss
5,The product is good Works great fits perfectly overall good purchase!!
5,Illuminates everything great. I also use it to do my paintings.
5,Love the brightness and different tones
5,BUY IT!!! Definitely worth the money. I had it for a year and if you look at it and test it youll think i just bought it!. I use it for my computer webcam when i stream or video chat with friends and the lighting is very strong that you dont need another light in the room! The settings are all legit and definitely worth it
5,I figured out how to do it. Keeping it.
5,Works pretty well not a great improvement over just using flash.  Easy setup and easy to use. Rather flimsy the white and round plastic that covers the lights was cracked but didn't notice it until it was too late to return.  Lesson learned always use the product while return window is open.All in all it will probably serve my needs which generally will be for phone conference calls with doctor.
5,I love this ring light! There's 3 different lighting options and ways to turn the brightness levels up/down. Was very easy to put together and set up.
1,It‚Äôs a pain in the butt and I returned it honestly
1,Absolutely garbage
1,I purchased this ring to click selfie and use it as a tripod but to my surprise the total height is not more than 12-15 inches. So I have to keep it on a table to use it as a tripod. The legs are so week that it falls almost all the time if not used carefully. The phone clip is also not very easy to use with ring. The LED brightness is good though.
5,This was very easy to put together. The tripod is small like i wanted so I could put it on a table. The brightness changes from dim to very bright. It held the phone strong enough with the case on. Theres also yellow white and blue settings for different occasions. Easy to take apart for storage.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This was the perfect portable pair to my full sized mirror. I can move it around and it is steady yet lightweight. It‚Äôs really useful for recording quickly face related things make up or skin care clips.Also for product pictures but for that I used the bc one more as I Can angle it. But I can record really well with this one.It has three shades of light and I like having the option to make it cooler or warmer.
5,Perfect lighting
5,I bought this for my Son for Christmas! He's starting a YouTube channel and will need good lighting. So I bought him this one. I couldn't beat the price. I had to try it so I could tell if it was bright enough it is!  I'm very pleased with the brightness but also the face recognition! This is going to be a fun gift for him to open. Great for camera quality purposes as well. This came nicely package and I received it fast! New customer hereüñëüëçThank you! I love the tripod as well! Just buy it!
5,It‚Äôs really easy to put together and gets very bright. I‚Äôm impressed!

Searching for the right one has been difficult but this one is affordable and easy to set up! Did not disappoint. Usb enabled and the lighting is picture perfect!
5,Very nice product. Would purchase again
5,Nice light. Works as described. The stand is decent but  isn't adjustable. The legs collapse and don't stay open midway. They're either all the way open or all the way closed. For the price I am happy with my purchase
5,For my uses it is great. It has the three different color temperatures and the brightness level goes very high and or low
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Definitely get if you want a ring light! I have another tripod and these parts screw on to that one just FYI if your lucky
5,Loved it! Have used this at my desk during zoom meetings and it does a great job at illuminating my face and washing away blemishes. I've also used it as an accent light during photoshoots and it worked great. I did have to use a separate larger tripod since the one attached is for a desk use.
5,This is a wonderful ring light works well with iPhones and has different light modes.
5,I really love it! It works perfectly for me!
5,Works great my daughter loves it It's not as tall as she was wanting but can put it on dressers and tables
5,love it
5,Excelente
5,love it
5,Purchased this light for Hair and make up tutorials and it is perfect.  Lightweight. Light goes from dim to very bright. Perfect for tutorials as I am able to place a mirror directly behind phone and record at perfect eye level. Product came with cell phone attachment. I am really happy with purchase.
5,Girlfriend loves this product. Originally received the first one as a gift but after a couple of years the lights finally gave out so here we are part two.
5,Really bright and has a lot of life levels to switch from I would recommend
4,Esta muy cheveree para el precio aunque esperaba que se pudiera extender para darle altura es para cooocarlo en una mesa

Perfect for extra lighting when I‚Äôm doing my make up. It has 3 different lighting tones. It also has two buttons where you can brighten or dim the light.
4,A gift for my Grandkids. They love it.

5,Top
5,Nice for the price
3,Started off bright when I first started using it. Now it doesn‚Äôt get bright anymore the remote is faulty and pushing the button is useless. I‚Äôve even had my son try it to help me out... nothing.
5,Purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas
4,My office layout at work is not changeable with a window behind my computer and terrible office lighting. I have a webinar I‚Äôm leading and I needed to improve the video quality.The stand was not impressive and I could not get good lighting with just one ring at 2pm position so I tried balancing it (not exactly most secure) on top of my monitor and it‚Äôs perfect this way. I thought there was an adaptation to be able to use it at a desktop as advertised but there aren‚Äôt any components to clip the light to the monitor.I was able to work out a solution but it‚Äôs tentative. See pics for reference. Probably works great with a smartphone not so great (at least sturdy wise) for a desktop PC. The light is strong and I prefer the warm light setting. 1st pic with light on. 2nd pic without light on big difference!
5,Good Gift For Kids Or whoever
5,WOAHH!!I‚Äôm amazed  for this price range this ring light is amazing!! I love love love it! I‚Äôm not even exaggerating! Get yours before it runs out ü§©
5,As advertised
5,super practical I love to use it to make up it gives me an incredible light and it has different light you can change it to your liking see how beautiful your makeup looks in good light
5,I Absolutely Adore It...
5,Calidad
5,Exactly what I was looking for does the job and was reasonably priced. Delivered way earlier than expected date. Very satisfied.
5,Good use for the price!
5,Does its purpose the lights are impressive. Can lower or brighten and change between 3 light settings. The stand could use some tweaking.
2,Piece of crap sace money to pay for better version
5,When events went digital - purchased many of these for a professional session.  Options for coloring and intensity - highly recommend.
5,I am so happy I talked myself into buying this. The way it makes all my photos now and videos is outstanding. It is such a great thing to have especially if you are very picky on how your photos and videos look.
5,Very nice product!  Only wished it wasn't so bright and has setting to dim the light further.  Very sturdy!  Good buy overall.
5,I love it and it still works
4,This product is good for the price that you pay definitely make my makeup pics and videos look nicer. And just in case you can‚Äôt tell from description it‚Äôs a tabletop ring light you‚Äôll have to be sitting to use it the height is not adjustable but it‚Äôs still good though.
5,Good quality for this price
5,I did not receive the tripod part however I did receive the lamp which is great! They made everything right by contacting me and compensating back with a refund. Thank you guys!
5,My niece loves  this mirror
5,Super easy to set up and it works great!! Amazing lighting!! Three different modes and you can control brightness!
5,I use this for live videos an pictures it‚Äôs amazing
5,Love it. Did not expect this to be legit but it is! It‚Äôs fantastic for selfie photo shoots or videos. You‚Äôll be pressed to find a better deal
4,This is a ring light with stand and phone holder. It is very bright with lots of dimmable settings. The stand is small and kind of short and wobbles a little. Overall it‚Äôs fine for my desk.
5,I played around with it when it first arrived and overall I'm pretty happy with it!!!
5,Grand product
5,Holy cow this thing is BRIGHT! It has 3 types of lights on it and you can lower the intensity if you need to. All in all I am super happy with my purchase. However I now know I need to sit still for a moment before walking if I want to avoi
5,Daughter loved it had to buy 2 more for my other daughters
5,Perfect!
5,I love the different light settings and the way you can adjust it. The phone/camera holder was an added bonus. Works perfectly and is really well made!
5,Awesome
5,For the price of this small unit it delivers great quality pictures! I actually use it behind my computer when I do my Zoom meetings for work. Very happy with this ring light!
5,Buy it
4,I've only used this once. The lighting is perfect and dimmable at three different settings. My only con is the tripod and how far it goes down to support the light.
5,This ring light is very bright and has made my camera quality awesome. I used it to take professional head shots and they came out amazing.
2,This is crap!!!  Very cheap!!  Don't waist your money!!  The light is bright and has 3 different settings but that's the ONLY nice thing about it. There is no camera that comes with this. It's asking me to rate the "quality of the camera". You use a camera WITH THIS LIGHT. Don't let it confuse you. This is ONLY A LIGHT With a VERY CRAPPY TRI-POD!!!  Don't waist your money!!!
5,I love the light very bright. Makes you videos very clean.
5,Does everything it says. Good travel size. Durable but lightweight.
1,My ring light no longer can stay on it turns off after 5 seconds . What‚Äôs the issue ?
5,Perfect for kitchen if you‚Äôre a beginner food blogger or beauty room if your aspiring make up blogger.
5,Great ring light for the price! Does the job. It won‚Äôt light up a whole room but it works well for somewhat up close pictures.
5,My girlfriend was really happy and she loved it thanks
5,I really like this product! It is small enough to fit and take anywhere.I really love the brightness!!! It works very well in poorly lit conditions!!!!
5,I am in LOVE with my ring light. Not only do I use it for selfies but when applying makeup in dim lite areas. I like how you can collapse it for easy storage.
5,Excellent product
5,Excellent for online meetings.
2,I like that there are three settings for lighting on there. However the little screw to tighten the position on the phone is jammed and wouldn‚Äôt tighten so my phone wasn‚Äôt positioned to face me properly. The legs to hold the ring light are also a bit annoying cause they were a little flimsy and not strong. Returned the product and will be looking at other brands with better quality and reviews
5,Honestly better than expected for the price amazing
5,Super bright and it fits right on my desk next to my bed so I can use a makeup mirror with it. I can switch the phone holder and screw in my camera and use my other longer tripod if needed!! Love this.
5,I mostly bought this item just for the ring light. This is my first ring light ever and I can honestly say it‚Äôs BRIGHT!! It has three different light settings and you can adjust the brightness. I already have my own tripod so I just attach the ring light onto it. I use it for when I take pictures of myself or others. You do need to plug it in but if you are no where near an outlet you can plug it into a portable charger. It works just as well. Would highly recommend for beginners or for someone who wants an affordable ring light.
5,i love this ring light so much it make my video more brighter
5,Great for pictures and videos. I like that there are different settings for how bright it gets
5,Light is nice and bright. A bit better than I expected . Great buy easily pieced it together!
5,I love the light I did not get it for selfish but I stream games and it is great cause of the adjustable dimming feature
5,The product is good  its easy to use and the result is very satisfied. This is good quality product and easy to use . It has 3 different lights colors and light levels are also so good .
5,Good product for the price! It works exactly as expected.Sweet little light that gets the job done. It's great for my plant photography.I'm selling my plants and it really helps me out to give me the best photos in order to easily sell my products.The lighting is nice and gives me the ability to easily capture the details. In addition it is easy to transport to different areas of my house for different photography sessions.
5,Perfect height and lightening for my poshmark page sales/photography :) thank you
1,Have used others and they worked awesome - I thought by not going with the cheapest one I would get a good quality. The stand doesn‚Äôt stand well difficult to get your phone attached and the light - though bright - doesn‚Äôt seem at affect photos at all. Also had to buy a remote for my phone to adequately test and still wasn‚Äôt great. I was really hoping due to the reviews that this purchase would be worth it. Spend a little more and get a better quality.
5,Great!
5,I'm in love with this ring of light and from what I needed I can work on my videos and put the phone on it! it has many colors and the result of the photos and videos is impressive. I loved
5,I love it. It‚Äôs easy to assembly and illuminates everything perfectly. It‚Äôs perfect for great video conference lighting during quarantine
2,The light itself is cool. The tripod stand is smaller than I‚Äôd like Very weak(falls and leans easily). The holder for the phone is very annoying it doesn‚Äôt stretch well and is a constant struggle to put my phone in it. (Don‚Äôt recommend for people with big phones (i have a 7plus.) all in all it was a waste of money for me. But the light is good.
5,Easy to set up lighting is very good
5,Very good
5,Great lightning I love that we can carry around easily. Takes up rarely any space.
5,With the work from home situation; this is a great short light for placing on your desk while in work meetings. It has different settings for the light brightness and warmth. It is very easy to set up and takes only a minute or so. The phone is held steady on the holder with no issues. Great buy and worth the price!
5,The product has a nice and bright ring light. It has three different colors. The phone holder is also expandable so it can hold an iPhone 5 or an Iphone 7 plus. It fits phones of all types. I would recommend this product to everyone
5,Love it!
5,I gifted this to my niece and she loved it! The light is a perfect size it fits nicely on her make-up desk without taking up too much space. The light is bright and helps take beautiful pictures/videos. Inexpensive easy to use and good quality!
5,Great product
5,Perfect size really good quality. Some of the parts are kind of confusing but it‚Äôs extremely adjustable and very nice.
4,Small but works for what we needed it for!Perfect for beginners in vlogging.
4,Light quality is great but the phone mount is way to small for most large phones. I'll have to buy a separate mount to use within the ring.
5,This ring light is bright indeed that's why content is coming out great and good quality.
4,Good product no problems with it so far however had to buy another ring light from a different supplier as this took 10 weeks to deliver. Benefit of doubt given to the seller as this was ordered at the start of C-19
1,NO PUEDO EMITIR UNA OPINION PORQUE NO ME HA LLEGADO EL PRODUCTOSI ME DAN UN NUMERO DE GUIA SE PODRIA RASTREAR PERO NO HA LLEGADONADA
4,Man muss sich wirklich Produkt Info lesen denn daraus ist dann auch ersichtlich dass man hierf√ºr nicht jeden Adapter benutzen kann anfangs hatte ich Angst dass es nicht funktioniert nachdem ich aber einen Adapter mit der empfohlenen Leistung benutzt habe- Siehe da hat funktioniert. Ist f√ºr mich pers√∂nlich aber ein kleiner Nachteil deshalb ein kleiner sternabzug sonst passt alles
4,In the winter months it is really hard to take good photos for Instagram. This solves the problem. Great different colours in the changeable light and I alternate between using the stand or even holding it. Love it.
5,Brilliant ring light easy to assemble and we got on offer to so win win. Very happy teen
4,This ring light was great for about 18mo then suddenly stopped working suggesting not the best quality. I treated it very well and never left it running for extensive periods of time. If you need a ring light as a business investment for regular use and don't want to keep re-buying I would recommend going for a better quality one.
5,It works no complaints here.
4,Easy to assume and great quality
4,Ich habe dies f√ºr mein Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra gekauft. Welches sich problemlos mit einem Schutzcase in die Halterung einklemmen l√§√üt.Allerdings w√§re es super gewesen w√ºrde man die Handyhalterung nicht nur unten im Ring (also zum Stativ hin) sondern auch seitlich links oder rechts befestigen k√∂nnen. Dann k√∂nnte ich mein Smarthpone vertikal geneigt (im Hochformat) einklemmen.Das w√§re vorteilhaft wenn man TikTok oder Snapchat verwendet. Insbesondere in Verbindung mit Windows PC Apps wie Link to Windows oder Samsung DEX. Was mich bef√§higt die h√∂here Aufl√∂sung der R√ºckkamera zu verwenden und dank Spiegeln auf meinen Desktop all meine Bewegungen beobachten zu k√∂nnen.Allerdings um 90 Grad geneigt.So wird das Ger√§t vertikal eingeklemmt aber das gespiegelte Bild wird horizontal wiedergegeben.W√ºrde ich das Handy seitlich einklemmen k√∂nnen w√§re eine vertikale Lage m√∂glich. Und die Spiegelung w√§re identisch.Aber sonst ganz okay.
3,Did what it said for just over 12 months and now stopped working. Pretty cheap so not surprised just letting people know what you're getting for your money.
4,Bought this for a long Zoom meeting and was not disappointed. Used in combination with my iPhone running EpocCam this sat slightly to the side of my monitor so I could try for better eye contact with the person to whom I was speaking.The LED is really bright (as in nearly painful) but is easily dimmed to a more comfortable level. It has three light settings: warm cold and both and switched for increasing or decreasing the amount of light.My only complaint is that the tripod legs will only stay in the fully-extended position because the ball joints are pretty slack. There is no way to adjust the height of the light. There are two other ball joints with wing-nuts for tilting the camera mount and the entire light+camera combination but these come loose really easily. So it's not very easy to adjust the angle of the setup without it falling over.All in all a decent piece of kit and will be used for most meetings going forward. Much better than if I had a webcam in my monitor (which I don't).
4,It's okay especially if it's not something you use super often. I only use it once every 1-2 weeks and it's been fine so far.Only problems I've had is the light itself is very lightweight which can cause problems when putting your phone in the holder. Sometimes it makes it too heavy to stand properly. Other times the holder doesn't keep my phone secure. It could just be my phone (Samsung galaxy... S9?) as it is pretty slippy to hold without a case but my phone will slide down in the holder sometimes.The stand on the light can be an issue. Sometimes it's hard to position it so it stays up. The legs seem too flimsy once my phone is on it I imagine a camera may tip it.It doesn't come with a normal plug it has a USB on the wire so you will need a plug with a USB port. (I just use my phones charger plug).Overall it does what I need it to. Creates good lighting etc. I wouldn't say it's bad but it just has a few things you may have to work around.
4,I needed a basic setup for a local pilot project funded by the National Lottery helping elderly people learn to use a laptop tablet or smartphone during the pandemic to combat loneliness; to this end the charity asked me to create some instructional videos on the basics from turning on the device to texting email and zoom.The LED Ring Light 10" is good providing more than adequate lighting though it's difficult to stop the desktop tripod legs from spreading I like to keep the camera at eye level so it may be necessary to use some kind of platform or blue tack on the desktop unless you want to be looking down on your viewers and they up your nostrils.My setup:LED Ring Light 10"I use a Sandstrom SWCAMHD19 Full HD Webcam although I had to hack the camera to turn off the auto-focus and built in microphones (no app) just plug and go. Don't judge it was the only HD cam available at the time (¬£50.00).I used a Lavalier microphone which gave superior audio quality to any built in microphone on my laptop or HD cam and it only cost ¬£10.00 (bargain).I use Free professional quality software (apps) to capture and edit the videos.OBS Studio and Shotcut (both free) and used by many YouTubers.Tip for beginners: Windows 10 has some free basic video recording/editing apps built in to W10.Xbox Game Bar (record screen built in W10)Camera (record self built in W10)Video editor (built in W10)Voice recorder (voice overs built in W10)
4,Das man hier f√ºr nicht mal 20‚Ç¨ qualitativ nicht viel erwarten kann ist wahrscheinlich jedem klar dementsprechend sehe ich die nicht ganz saubere Verarbeitung und das wacklige Gestell nicht wirklich als Problem denn der Lichtk√∂rper l√§sst sich auch auf ein richtiges Stativ montieren und damit ist das Problem f√ºr mich vom Tisch.Sonst tut das Ringlicht was es soll. Leuchten und das sehr hell und gleichm√§√üig. Die Stufenweise Regelung funktioniert gut und die 3 w√§hlbaren Leuchteinstellungen sind f√ºr mich vollkommen ausreichend.Wer das Ringlicht komplett einzeln als Gesamtpaket verwenden will sollte sich nach was anderem umsehen wird in dem Preissegment aber wohl kaum f√ºndig werden. Wer einfach nur ein ganz normales Ringlicht zur Ausleuchtung sucht kann hier bedenkenlos zuschlagen.
3,Did well then just isn‚Äôt tight enough and sturdy after couple uses. Legs just fall apart. Crap!
3,Rather disappointed with this product. The tripod is not sturdy on polished surfaces and glass surfaces. Its pointless to have that much of an extension and no locking Mechanism or stop/locking point on the legs. The tripod has since been binned.The ring light does its job and I like the size and the fact its lightweight however within first the first 2 uses the slot that fits the phone holder adaptor cracked and eventually fell off. I am still able to use the ring light however a higher strength plastic may need to be considered.Positive: Good picture quality with light.
3,Naja es macht halt was es soll und wa sman f√ºr 17 euro erwarten kann.F√ºhlt sich sau billig an und die halterung reicht f√ºr ein smartphone aber nicht f√ºr ne richtige Kamera.Naja macht was es soll und man bekommt genau das was man f√ºr den Preis erwarten kann.
4,A bit wobbly tho.
5,I didn't need the mobile phone holder and I also substituted the tripod for a camera tripod I already had. However I was really pleased with the ring light itself. You can choose the intensity of the light and also have a slightly warm yellowish light a pinkish light or a bright white light . These are subtle colours so you can use any of them without looking odd. I think it is great value for money and I'm so glad I bought it - it gives me a bit more confidence on Zoom meetings. The all-round circular lighting means that any shadows (and eye-bags!) across your face are minimised.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I wanted a ring light so I could shoot short videos of my nail designs.The fact that this one came with a moveable phone mount was a big bonus for me. The phone mount is fully adjustable so was able to securely hold my IPhone X would easily hold phones both larger or smaller than mine.I‚Äôll admit that the tripod is a bit flimsy and doesn‚Äôt support the light well when it‚Äôs tilted downwards (whole thing tips forwards) however this doesn‚Äôt bother me as I don‚Äôt need the Tripod for my purposes anyway. The Tripod seems fine if you just intend to use the light at a straight forward angle.Love the brightness of this light I took this video at 8pm (very dusky natural light) and with no other lights on and the result is still beautiful shows up all the details and true colours.Overall I‚Äôm very happy for the price this light is a bargain!
4,Quite hard to set up. Very flimsy
3,Bought two of these to use for work Teams meetings and they are perfectly adequate for that use. They have been getting on average 2 -3  hours use per day 5 days per week. One of them has failed after 9 months which is pretty frustrating.
3,Dieses Ringlicht stellt mich echt vor eine Herausforderung. Wenn ich einzelne Aspekte des Produktes bewerte rangieren diese Einsch√§tzungen zwischen "Sehr gut" und "totaler Schrott".Positiv hervorzuheben:+ Beleuchtung und Helligkeit+ Anwendungsbereiche+ Brauchbare Gr√∂√üeMittelma√ü:o Kein Ausl√∂sero Einstellungsm√∂glichkeiteno Standfu√üo Feststellschraube KugelgelenkGrenzt an Schrott:- Verarbeitung- Material- HaptikAusformuliert:Wie Sie sehen handelt es sich hierbei um ein sehr ambivalentes Produkt.Steht es auf dem Tisch sieht es gar nicht schlecht aus. Nimmt man es in die Hand klappert alles und man denkt dass man es zart anfassen sollte da es sonst umgehend zerbricht.Das Pastik ist absolut minderwertig die Verarbeitung l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig der Standfu√ü ist von niedrigster Qualit√§t.Innerhalb des LED-Rings stehen Plastikreste √ºber weil die Produktion offensichtlich m√∂glichst g√ºnstig gehalten werden sollte.Dennoch steht das Stativ stabil l√§sst sich gut einstellen und tr√§gt auch mein vergleichsweise schweres Galaxy S20 FE NE ohne Probleme. Jedoch muss man bei dem Kugelgelenk unten schon Kraft aufbringen um die Schraube anzuziehen.Die Teiel sind aber nicht aus Plastik und sollten zumindest nicht aufplatzen.Ich wei√ü deshalb noch nicht so recht ob ich das Produkt tats√§chlich behalten werde.Vielleicht bin ich an der Stelle einfach nur kleinlich.Abgesehen davon h√§lt das Produkt jedoch was es verspricht. Zum Einstieg bei kleinem Budget vermutlich eine gute Wahl.
4,I have mixed feeling about this product. The ring light itself is great. It does exactly what it says on the tin it‚Äôs bright controllable and big enough to be of use with a phone behind it. I‚Äôve already used it for a late night vlog and to take a passport photo of my son - both with great results. The accessories are pretty good too especially if like me you already have a good tripod and/or gorilla pod. And I say this because the tripod that is included in the box is absolute junk. It will just about support the weight of the light itself with a little height control but add a phone to the mix? Hah! No chance. I have an original iPhone X and this thing cannot support its weight. On its tallest setting you can just about get it to stand up but it‚Äôs unstable and on its shortest setting the feet take up a lot of desk space and it‚Äôs too low to be useable.I‚Äôm still giving it four stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Because I didn‚Äôt buy it for the tripod and it suits my needs well but if I _needed_ this to be my only tripod for this use I‚Äôd have given it two stars only ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - it‚Äôs that bad. So bear that in mind when ordering.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Ich hab mir dieses 10 Zoll Ringlicht gekauft da es einen sehr g√ºnstigen Preis hat. Das Hauptfeature f√ºr mich ist das man eine normale Kamera auf das Ringlicht schrauben kann. Das ist in diesem Preissegment nicht selbstverst√§ndlich. Die Handyhalterung macht einen guten Eindruck. Qualit√§t des Ringlichtes ist dem Preis entsprechend gut und wo ich wirklich √ºberrascht war war die Qualit√§t von dem Stativ. Die ist n√§mlich 1A! Ich nutze allerdings ein gr√∂√üeres Stativ.  Die Kugelk√∂pfe sind durch das Gewicht der Kamera sehr locker und fester gehen sie leider nicht mehr. Alles in allem ein Top Produkt
4,Lieferung war p√ºnktlich und sicher verpackt.Einsatz ist problemlos. Die Lichtst√§rke ist nur f√ºr Objekte in der N√§he (bis ca. 1 Meter) sinnvoll ausreichend. Ist aber sicher auch von der Anforderung an Qualit√§t Objektiv und Video/Foto abh√§ngig.Die "Handy-Halterung" ist so ok. Im Angebot wurde dort alternativ eine Kamera Halterung gezeigt. F√ºr meine Spiegelreflexkamera erschien mir die Halterung als ungeeignet. Die beiliegenden Halterungen erm√∂glichten aber auch eine Montage vor der Kamera an einem normalen Fotostativ.Netzteil liegt nicht bei aber ein USB-Handy-Netzteil geht auch.
4,The light its self is good The feet on the stand aren't that great has to be spread all the way open to be sturdy but does the job for my vanity table.
4,Ich habe jetzt nicht allzuviel erwartet bei dem niedrigen Preis aber dass hier wieder mal ohne Netzteil geliefert wird empfinde ich fast als Frechheit.Immer mehr Hersteller liefern wenn √ºberhaupt einfach nur ein USB Kabel aber ohne 220/5V Netzteil.Also wer diesen Ring kauft denke daran Netzteil gesondert mit zu bestellen falls ihr keins zuhause habt.Die Leitung k√∂nnte auch ruhig 1 Meter l√§nger sein - denn man hat nicht immer eine Steckdose oder einen PC dort wo man gerade Aufnahmen macht.
4,The light works amazing it was a lot brighter than I expected. It can hold my phone to which I was a bit worried about to start of with. However it can only my phone landscape and not portrait. The other issue is the legs the are not very strong and very loose. When I stand it up it the legs will slowing spread meaning when ever I'm using it for my camera the camera will start to lower as the legs widen and spread out. Wish the legs were more stiff and stronger if they were i would of gave 5 stars. But I am super happy with everything else
4,I thought it would be height adjustable but the legs just splay out to the lowest point. I have fixed this with a rubber band around the base of the legs to make the light sit higher.  Arrived slightly damaged but not enough to be worth returning. Does the job though.
3,Etwas billig verarbeitet. Das ringlicht knart ganz offt. Der aufsatz f√ºrs Handy h√§lt leider nicht so gut und f√§llt √∂fters um und die Beine halten leider auch nicht umbedingt gut. Daf√ºr sind die 3 verschiedenen Licht Stufen echt super und auch die Helligkeit ist der Wahnsinn
4,Great ring light. The tripod legs aren‚Äôt very secure. One leg slides out so I have to prop it against something so it doesn‚Äôt end up flat but otherwise it‚Äôs great.
3,Schnelle Montage und leicht zu bedienen leider etwas instabil
4,AmaIng purchase. Highly recommend.
5,Einfacher Zusammenbau und gute bedienung
4,The light and size are perfect. Stand is a little wobbly though and the legs are a bit flimsy so do have to be careful when using as it could easily fall over or be knocked down.
3,Decent light and brightness. Unfortunately the wiring is a bit iffy and half the lights did not work half the time for me.
5,Ich nutze das Ringlicht f√ºr Zoom-Meetings und Videos welche ich am Handy drehe. Das Stativ ist vielleicht manchmal etwas wackelig aber f√ºr meine Zwecke reicht es v√∂llig aus. Die verschiedenen Helligkeitstufen sind top und auch dass man das Licht w√§rmer und k√§lter stellen kann. Die Halterung f√ºr's Handy passt auch ich habe keine Angst dass mein Handy runterknallt. Das einzige Manko was ich aber schon gewusst habe ist dass man die Lampe nur √ºber USB betreiben kann dh man braucht immer einen Laptop in der N√§he. Trotzdem w√ºrde ich das Produkt empfehlen.
3,Es wird nicht f√ºnf Jahre lang halten aber f√ºr den Preis v√∂llig ok
3,This is okay.The stand never really stays put once the weight of your mobile is attached and  constantly slight outwards. It wasn't made clear that it was USB powered either which wasn't great.The light is the only pro nice and bright 3 different shades that can also be adjusted.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I've just started using this!Sadly it does not adjust when you press the settings ... and does not make any difference to my workstation whilst on ... have tried switching to different USB plugs  .  No difference... very very disappointed
4,It was extremely easy to assemble and the light modes/ brightness is perfect. The only downside is the stand sometimes topped over and it isn‚Äôt 100% sturdy all the time but you can just readjust it- I would still recommend that you buy it as it‚Äôs good value for money
4,Our grand daughter is very pleased with her present it was just what she wanted.
3,I should have paid for better quality because the light was faulty. It flickers rather than a constant light and intermittently cut out altogether. Not helpful for the video calls I bought it for. I accept this may be a one off.Update: I have reviewed my rating because I received a refund from the seller and a polite apology with an offer a replacement free of charge. I have already bought an alternative product but the customer service was excellent.
3,‚Ä¢ Das Produkt ist preislich gut‚Ä¢ hat drei Stufen- Kaltes Licht- Lauwarmes Licht- Warmes Licht‚Ä¢ Es ist leicht zu bedienen und l√§sst einen super aussehen
4,Does what it says on the tin
2,Product had power issues to begin with and after little use over 2 months it will not power on at all. Poor quality product would not recommend .
5,Eine Helle und in 4 Farben verstellbare Ring-Leuchte mit 10" Durchmesser.Enthalten sind Befestigungen f√ºr Kameras und Smartphones.Diese sind zwar etwas wackelig und schwierig festzuschrauben aber man kriegt den Dreh raus.Leider etwas hoher Schwerpunkt dadurch ist ein Kippen des Ring-Lichtes ohne Umfallen schwer.Aber insgesamt um die eigenen Fotos aufzuwerten oder in Videokonferenzen deutlich besser ausgeleuchtet zu sein sehr empfehlenswert.Empfohlen werden Netzteile mit 10 oder mehr Watt.Von mir eine Empfehlung da f√ºr den Preis die Gr√∂√üe und Ausstattung sehr gut ist und √ºber die kleinen "Nachteile" hinweg gesehen werden kann.
5,F√ºr den Preis bekommt man was man erwartet: einen Lichtring mit einem kleinen Stativ.Meine Kriterien:- Helligkeit:Die Helligkeit ist soweit in Ordnung auch dem Preis entsprechend. Man leuchtet nat√ºrlich nicht ein gesamtes Zimmer aus aber f√ºr Homeoffice-Konferenzen reicht es v√∂llig aus. Man kann beim Licht zwischen warm - gelb - gemischt wechseln und insgesamt 9 Helligkeitsstufen einstellen.- das Stativ und die BefestigungF√ºr die paar Euro habe ich nichts besonderes erwartet und bin auch nicht √ºberrascht worden.Ich benutze das Stativ nicht da ich den Lichtring anders befestigt habe; auch nutze ich die Smartphone-Halterung nicht. Trotzdem habe ich beides nat√ºrlich anfangs getestet. Das Stativ und die Halterung sind ok aber f√ºr den dauerhaften Gebrauch vermutlich zu wackelig. Aber wie gesagt f√ºr den niedrigen Preis in angemessener Qualit√§t.- Haltbarkeit:Die Beleuchtung ist seit einigen Monaten in Betrieb ich hatte bis jetzt keine Probleme.Fazit: Ich bereue den Kauf nicht. Wer kein professioneller Streamer werden m√∂chte dem kann ich den Lichtring durchaus weiterempfehlen!
5,When I first received the product I couldn‚Äôt assemble it as it came with a faulty part. Rather than returning the item I contacted the seller and got a response straight away asking for my address so that they could send me a replacement. Great quality sturdy. Only issue I have is that the tripod is shorter/smaller than I anticipated but this doesn‚Äôt affect me too much. Overall very satisfied
4,Good for the money but check you have the right adapter for it -  the standard iphone adapters don‚Äôt work!
4,Gutes Ringlicht tut was es soll bei dem Preis kann man echt nicht meckern..
4,Good product
4,Feels fragile. Wish it has a separate remote.  Not the control attached to the cord
2,Wont turn on anymore after only a couple of months
3,its ok i suppose you get what you pay for
4,Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis in ordnung. Ist nicht sehr hochwertig aber erf√ºllt ihren Zweck!
4,I had a good experience
4,Very easy to assemble and does exactly what it should do
3,The light itself was fine with good adjustment but done be fooled into thinking this is robust it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs cheap plastic and the tripod is not extendable so you‚Äôll end up using your own.
5,Wonderful product
3,I bought this item as WFH and don‚Äôt have great lighting at home. Its main function works (ie it does light up) but there are three things that let it down.1) the mobile attachment does not sit well and therefore keeps coming off. Thankfully I don‚Äôt use this feature often but you should be aware that there‚Äôs a high chance this would come off while you have your expensive phone on it.2) the control module is not good quality and has now worn off. You can see on the photo that the ‚Äònegative button‚Äô is worn out as this is the most used button as the light automatically comes on as full light.3) the stand is very flimsy and have not used it.After 9 months of use sadly the item doesn‚Äôt work anymore due to bad connection either with the wire or the control module.
3,Der Preis ist durchaus angemessen f√ºr die durchschnittliche Qualit√§t.Die Verarbeitung ist einfach Stabilit√§t und Einstellung etwas hakelig.Gut f√ºr den Einstieg um etwas zu experimentieren.Nervig ist dass die Helligkeit nach dem erstmaligen Einschalten nach dem Einstecken des Steckers auf Maximum steht und man erst dimmen muss. Das w√§re anders herum sinnvoller.
5,Standfestigkeit ist etwas schwierig aber dieses Ringlicht macht durchaus ein sch√∂nes Licht daher w√ºrde ich diesem Ringlicht f√ºr kleines Geld eine Kaufempfehlung geben.
5,Lieferung: Wie gewohnt kam die Lieferung blitzschnell.Verpackung: Das Ring Light war gut und sicher verpackt. Alle Teile waren dabei samt Anleitung.Aufbau: Die Aufbauanleitung ist einfach mit Bildern erkl√§rt. Das Stativ ist in weniger als 5 Minuten aufgebaut und hat ein √ºberraschend hohes Gewicht was f√ºr die Stabilit√§t sorgt. Ich habe mein Ring Light direkt mit meinem Laptop verbunden damit es Strom bekommt. Sofort leuchtete der ON-Schalter der Bedienung auf. Und dann konnte es schon losgehen.Nutzung: Ich war wirklich √ºberrascht wie extrem hell das Licht ist. Es gibt drei verschiedene Licht-Temperatur-Stufen - warm kalt und neutral. Mit der Tastatur kann man dann auch noch das Licht stufenweise dimmen. Das finde ich richtig gut und hatte ich f√ºr den Preis nicht erwartet. Absoluter Pluspunkt! Das Handy ist auch leicht einzuspannen quer und auch hochkant. Der Drei-Fu√ü steht sicher und stabil und ist auch etwas h√∂henverstellbar. Hier muss man vielleicht etwas darauf achten einen nicht zu glatten Untergrund zu w√§hlen sonst rutschen die kleinen F√º√üe die mit Gummi √ºberzogen sind doch mal weg.Verarbeitung: Der Lichtring wirkt von au√üen etwas billig in der Verarbeitung aber alles andere ist hochwertig und gut. Ich bin f√ºr den Preis echt positiv √ºberrascht und darum gibts auch 5 Stern.
4,Good one at !! Perfect for small online appearances .. most importantly I found it quite good to take photograph of documents with mobile at night.  Almost scan quality when shot with iPhone 11 at night.
4,This is a really lovely tabletop ring light. It has adjustable brightness and colour tones to make any pictures look good! The phone holder is sturdy though I could only get it to hold the phone in portrait mode - whereas I‚Äôd have liked it landscape. I did return this however as I required a much higher tripod as I couldn‚Äôt find a resting place high enough for the 10‚Äù tripod to reach standing height. It would make a lovely desk tripod for makeup/videos.
5,Works well for an online skype/facetime call
4,It works really well and has been great for taking photos or videos for my business. My only real issue is taking it apart and putting it back together seems to weaken it and has ruined the threads on the screws which is an issue for me as I do not have the space to keep it assembled. Other than that though it is amazing!
5,Wow this light is great and I wish I would of bought one of these years ago i love the fact there is 3 colour modes and 10 brightness settings so its easy to get the effect you want. I used to have multiple cheap lights but now I only need this one
4,The only thing I don't like about this product is the legs they're very fiddley and have a tendency to move in whatever direction they please which can be a tad embarrassing mid MS team meeting! However it was very easy to assemble face recognition is good and the 3 category adjustable lighting is very good quality. Would recommend to those who opt for a more aesthetic background during meetings zoom calls pictures/selfies etc.
3,Good value but the tripod footing is slightly unstable and can easily tumble .  The highest brightness is not as intense as it should be .  Gaily good for the price
4,The light itself works really well however there was a piece of the stand missing.Luckily I was going to use a different stand anyway but thought I'd mention it just in case.
5,Na
4,I do very much love this tripod. The lighting is so versatile from the levels of intensity to the levels of warmth. The instructions of assembly are all pictures so it‚Äôs literally so easy to put together. The photos you take look so bomb as well - I have dark skin and it just flatters my melanin way better than my phone flash ever could.The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is that I‚Äôd really have liked the tripod to be extendable it‚Äôs so short and that‚Äôs literally the only way it isn‚Äôt versatile.
3,Light is good but the stand is pretty flimsy
4,Preis Leistung in Ordnung das Licht ist sch√∂n hell und man kann es verstellen. F√ºr einfache Bilder Videos/optimal geeignet. Der St√§nder k√∂nnte h√∂her sein . Ansonsten Top
3,Eigentlich darf ich mich bei dem Preis nicht beschweren. Das Ringlicht tut was es soll und auch so wie es beschrieben ist wobei ich die Helligkeit/ das Licht nicht ganz so optimal finde. Die verschiedenen Einstellungen sind super. Jetzt im Nachhinein nervt das mit dem USB Anschluss sehr - ich h√§tte da lieber einen Stecker gehabt. Leider sind die F√º√üchen nicht so super stabil. Das Handy h√§lt aber gut. Es kommt darauf an m√∂chte man das professionell nutzen w√ºrd ich gleich mehr Geld ausgeben und das wo im Fachhandel kaufen. Soll es nur ein Gadget f√ºr zwischendurch sein wird es schon reichen. Ich arbeite nicht gerne damit und benutze es deshalb auch kaum.
4,Works great and you can choose which type of light you want. It is so easy to use I didn't have to read the instructions The only downside is that the cable is short so sometimes I have to use an extension lead to take a good photo
4,Licht an sich ist ok.Die Halterungen und Verschraubungen sind nicht sehr stabil z.B. wenn man ein Handy drin hat und bewegt das Teil kann es sein dass einem das Handy mit Halterung aus der Verschraubung f√§llt.Auch die Beine m√ºssen komplett gespreizt werden damit geht das ganze halt nicht sehr hoch z.B. wenn man es hinter einen Laptop Bildschirm stellt ist ein Teil des Ringes unter der Oberkante des Bildschirms (klar kann man was drunter legen um es h√∂her zu machen).Wenn der Preis nicht relativ g√ºnstig w√§re h√§tte ich weniger Sterne gegeben.Liegt nicht am Produkt aber mir war nicht klar wie stark der Ring in der Brille (die entspiegelt ist!) spiegelt.
4,This does what it says and is easy to construct . Had a slight issue getting the camera connection to stay in place .
4,OK for its purpose
4,The brightness and settings on this are really great. Only downside is that it comes loose quite quickly. Definitely good for anyone that isn‚Äôt really moving it around too much
4,Ist nicht so gut es h√§lt nicht oft aber sonst ist es gut üëç
4,Overall a handy wee buy the 3 lights setting are amazing they each have their own 10 adjustment settings and it does a really good job. It's really easily set up and the phone holder works perfectly. They only small issue is that the legs are just a little bit awkward and are almost too small for the light so it has a bit of trouble standing but once you get the right angle it's fine!
4,This is a pretty good product and simple to use. I love the smart phone grip you get with it. The light ring works well but seems a little flimsy. The tripod isn't very good but overall I like it.  Be aware that this light uses a fair bit of electricity in the space of an hour. I use a battery pack that can charge a smartphone nearly twice. This light will empty this battery pack in less than 2 hours.
5,Ein Geschenk f√ºr meine Schwester die ihre Backvideos filmt. Super f√ºr Beginner. iPhone f√§llt nicht raus und das Licht reicht f√ºr ihre Bed√ºrfnisse aus.
3,Die Lichtqualit√§t des Ringlichts ist wirklich gut und hell leider ist der St√§nder nicht sehr schnell montiere ich das IPhone an das Ringlicht bricht dieses schon nach kurzer Zeit zusammen was bei Videos sehr nervig ist
4,Seems a really good ring light! However I had contact seller just due to a issue I found. With the phone I have (iPhone 11 pro max) as my phone is quite heavy it topples the ring light over and was a lot of messing about trying keep it steady. Other than that tho is a real good ring light  just a shame! Lovely and bright.  Good affordable price just a shame I won‚Äôt be using it. No use to me :( please don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs not a good ring light it really is! ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Bought this for my wife as she's creating videos and hosting online sessions as part of her job. This is a great set up and easy to use but the light is very bright even on the lowest setting so using it is painful on the eyes after a short while. There may be a way to dial it down further but haven't found it yet.
4,Lasted four months and died. It was fine at first but after a few weeks I noticed the USB plug getting very hot even after a one-hour zoom meeting. I'll use the tripod etc but the light is non-recyclable and non-reusable.UPDATE: the manufacturer has contacted me and offered a full refund. This is exemplary customer service and much better than I expected. I think you can trust this company given that they want to make it right.
2,Freudestrahlend habe ich die Ringleuchte ausgepackt und zusammengebaut um dann feststellen zu m√ºssen das sie total ungeeignet ist.Die 3 Beinchen sind sowas von locker das sie in keiner Position wirklich fest stehen. Mit dem Gewicht vom Handy und einer schr√§gen Stellung des Lichts war es ganz vorbei. Das Ringlicht kippte ....Gleich wieder eingepackt und zur√ºck!Bin entt√§uscht.
3,Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs a great product for its price .Brightness was fine although its stability might sometimes be disappointing
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Das Ringlicht eignet sich sehr gut um Nahfotos zu machen oder um auch einfach nur den Raum zu belichten.Es ist sehr Hell und ich finde f√ºr den Preis kriegt man hier sehr gute Optionen der Lichteinstellung mitgeliefert.Es ist leicht verstellbar und L√§sst sich sehr leicht aufbauen.Einziger Kritikpunkt.Handyhalterung ist aufgrund der Qualit√§t dieser nicht sehr feste. Die Halterung verstellt sich oft da es das Gewicht eines Handys (Iphone XS) nicht tragen kann.
5,Very bright :)
3,Light recieved
5,I bought this product for the purpose of live streaming.I have no regrets. It does what it says on the tin. I just install my phone on the bit provided for phones and everything is sorted.I did try to use it in tandem with my laptop but the effect is not the same so I will keep using my phone instead.I gave the assembling a 4star because I did struggle to assemble the bottom pan-tilt after I'd accidentally and unnecessarily disassembled the pieces the last time I had used it. I am not very techy/DIY.Other than that I would highly recommend it especially if you want something simple uncomplicated and non-heavy duty.In the future I will have to get a different tripod if I change my set from sitting to standing.
5,I brought this for my daughter to use when putting on make up in the dark or when not near the window and she loves it! She stands it just behind the mirror and it's perfect - bright enough and very sturdy!
3,This started off really we;; but after a few weeks the ringlight just wouldn't switch on or would switch on sporadically. The brightness modes weren't necessary for me as I always used the brightest one but a ringlight makes a huge difference I have a dark room with poor light so this was really helpful to use even in the evening with lights on on zoom or video chat. Easy  to assemble and the tripod was sturdy enough for me I would have liked it to be higher to avoid glasses reflection and to have a vertical phone holder as I never use my phone horizontally. The phone holder could have been sturdier though.
5,Gerade in den Herbst- und Wintertagen wird es schwierig vern√ºnftige Lichtverh√§ltnisse f√ºr Foto- oder Videoaufnahmen zu haben. Riesige Softboxen waren gestern - heute helfen lichtstarke LED Ringlichter in verschiedenen Farbspektren. Egal ob Portrait- oder Produktfotos ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem kleinen Stativ und dem recht gro√üen Ringlicht.¬†Es ist schnell aufgebaut was gerade f√ºr unterwegs ein Vorteil ist weil man sein Equipment minimalistisch halten kann. Das Stativ ist √ºberraschend stabil und sehr flexibel. Das Smartphone¬†kann horizontal oder vertikal angebracht werden. F√ºr Videos ist das besonders n√ºtzlich.Zum Schminken ist das Licht auch super und f√ºr Fotos und Videos kann man zwischen unterschiedlichen Lichtfarben wechseln und das Licht bei Bedarf auch dimmen. Es gibt 3 Lichtarten in 10 Helligkeitsstufen.Ich benutze das Ringlicht inzwischen auch bei Zoom-Meetings weil das Tageslicht nicht mehr reicht und die B√ºrolampen oft unvorteilhafte Schatten werfen :)Ein erstaunlich gutes Produkt zu diesem Preis. Der Versand erfolgte gewohnt schnell und sicher verpackt aus Deutschland.
3,Schon sehr umfangreiches Zubeh√∂r und Ausstattung. Die Streuscheibe ist irgendwie nicht ausreichend es gibt kein diffuses Licht sondern die einzelnen LEDs erzeugen Lichtpunkte.
3,This ring light was easy to assemble and the quality is great. However it goes off by itself very quickly so you have to rush to get your pictures done as it goes out and turns on after a long while after. The height may cause issues for some people as you cannot use it standing up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I won't say much but it's awesome. I can even power it with my phone.High recommend cause it's affordable. Don't drop it though.You may need a little something for the legs to keep high. But a little mcgyver will do. I like it 9/10
5,With these cheap products you never know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package today. The light is really bright and I ran some test photos which were improved by the brightness and colour temp. The tripod is pretty solid metal construction and the 3 mounts are useful and also of good construction. Overall more than worth a tenner.
4,Refund resolved quickly -
4,Bought this light to support teaching virtually ‚Äî works really well.Love the different settings pending on surroundings and time of day.Would be even greater if the tripod would be a bit more stable if standing in a higher position easily toppled over if something brushes against it.
4,Good
1,Wouldn't waste your money very flimsy. Being in Ireland free returns didn't apply so given the low purchase price wasn't worth paying return postage.Found a better one at IKEA even if it did cost more money.
5,my first one didn't work very well but the company were clear with communication and sent a replacement as soon as they knew so excellent customer service - thank you.
5,Very easy to assemble. The lighting is perfect for what I needed it for which is a table lamp.
4,I am recording a few bits and bobs at home so thought this would be helpful and it's been great! Delivery was incredibly fast (next day) It comes with clear instructions so it's very quick and easy to assemble. I had it up and running in less than 5 mins! It has 3 main functions and they all illuminate the face perfectly to give the right glow. It's been great for my zoom meetings. Highly recommend!
4,I am really pleased with this light and it creates a lovely warm glow when used during meetings. There are 3 colour shades to choose from.  Portable and light weight easy to put together and use.
4,These do the trick and there‚Äôs three different lighting settings. However they took me a while to assemble and when I try to stand the stand up it slips down. It‚Äôs ok just take extra care when setting up
4,geht besser aber f√ºr den preis okay
5,I have tested this LED ring light for several days with both photos and videos.It is excellent for our children who like to have a good time taking photos and videos and then upload them to social media.By having a ring shape it avoids having unsightly shadows on your face and the images look more professional. There are three light options cold neutral and warm.It is easy to assemble and set it up. It is also very easy to disassemble in case you want to put it back in the box.The tripod is very wide and stable. The power cord is long enough to put the ring where you want it.Some friends liked it a lot so we bought two more units for them too.
5,I think this ring light is fab. I love how many different settings there are for brightness! So far I‚Äôve used it to take the obligatory selfies but also to take photos of my Christmas things around the house :).Setting it up was easy just took about 5 minutes to put the different pieces together. And to get it to work you just plug it into a usb slot.I‚Äôve got the iPhone 12 pro and that fits in the phone holder perfectly too but I also tried my husbands Samsung and that was fine as well :).I‚Äôve actually been wanting one of these for a while and this was hasn‚Äôt disappointed so far.
3,Leider sind die Beine nur in zwei Positionen zu nutzen und bei der hohen Variante auch nur eingeschr√§nkt. Man hat M√ºhe das ganze gerade einzustellen weil es in sich schief ist und durch das Hartplastik schwerer einzustellen.Das Licht ist allerdings super ich benutze es jetzt im B√ºro als Lichtquelle morgens.
5,Very Good and Useful product specially for those who are creating videos using mobile phonesPro: The product is useful and it brightens the subject very well. I have recoded few videos of my son earlier I used to record it using the normal ceiling lights but the results were very bad with shadows overpowering the subject. With this gadget it focuses the light directly on the subject no issues with shadows and since it is LED light it does now overpower with extra brightness. My son and I love this productThe option of 3 shades (Warm Cool and Daylight) is useful but I personally didn‚Äôt t like the warm white as it does not look good on recordingsBrightness levels is really helpfulCons: I personally think the cable restrict your movement to an extent and would have preferred rechargeable to make it completely wireless
1,First 1 month of using it it worked well! But after some time I came around an issue when I plug the light in and turn it on via the remote the light lights up for like half a second and then it stops working. Anyone know a fix to that?
3,Pros: great light settings I use it for my Zoom calls.Can switch easily between neutral cold and warm light with intensity levels.Brightness is great and gets the job done.Cons: wobbly construction (very delicate tripod) and quite unstable. I don't move it/change its angle at all because I don't want it to topple (again)
4,Light is perfect size is perfect the only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is because the tripod legs could do with being a bit tighter for movment. Slightest touch and the legs move and you have to reset every time. Maybe worth getting so super glue with this order
3,Tripod it comes with is not sturdy at all and very small. The ring light doesn't come with a plug socket only comes with a USB wire that is NOT compatible with an apple charger - so I have to plug it into my laptop to use it. Bit of a faff really. The lighting is okay not fabulous
5,Great light well made and a good price. I use this for Teams meetings and have it set next to the laptop screen. It makes a big difference to the video quality and I no longer look like I'm sitting in the shadows. I haven't needed to put a phone in the middle attachment yet but I imagine that would give good results too.
3,The light works brilliantly however I have only given it a 3 as the attatchment for the mobile phone holder doesn‚Äôt work. The part of it you‚Äôre meant to ‚Äúslide in‚Äù to attach it to the light has a large plastic screw around it your meant to loosen Before attatching it however the screw on mine is completely stuck. Multiple people have tried (and used tools) until our fingers were raw but it isn‚Äôt moving at all. As a result I can‚Äôt use the mobile attatchment so will need to find another way to attatchment my phone. For the price it‚Äôs a good like just disappointed I seemed to get a dodgy mobile attatchment
5,I honestly didn‚Äôt expect the earth due to the price.I make YouTube vlogs (Bella vlogs life) and as I‚Äôm slowly progressing I needed something to improve my lighting so I looked all over the internet for a ring light within budget and decided on this oneIt arrived yesterdayI‚Äôm impressed!This is really good quality although the part that holds the camera could have been a little tighter it's more than good enough.I wanted one that will sit on my desk bc my last one was floor standing and i had to really pull my desk out to fit it behind I love it! It‚Äôs miles beyond what I hoped for and is the best thing I‚Äôve bought in a long time! I‚Äôm well chuffed to have it ‚úåÔ∏è
4,Good for a cheap light! First impressions were that it has a great range of settings but take it from me as a media graduate ... The tripod supplied is rubbish. It cannot support any weight. I luckily had a Manfrotto mini tripod that could take the weight.I'll write back if I find any issues with the product.
5,I bought this having purchased a ring light that was far to big a diameter for my needs my primary purpose for using this was for putting a phone in it for video calls given the year that we have had but I'm plesantly surprised with its performance and easily has enough diameter to shoot a DSLR through it. LOVE the fact it is USB powered I keep a powerbank in my pocket and I am good to go. Really easy to use and the buttons are a great feature I especially like the powerbutton as it means when it's on my desk I can just leave it plugged in and turn it on when required.
5,It's very basic and light weight but it does what it states and is perfect for when you want to film and don't want a larger ring light. I have one with a stand but wanted this to pop onto other surfaces where I don't have the use for the stand. Perfect. I have bought another. One for my office and now one for home too. Great price!
4,Great light but legs aren‚Äôt sturdy so always falls down to the lowest height. I end up having to adjust height the old fashioned way by piling books on top of each other. Everything else about this product is spot on!
1,The ring light was good for the first couple of tries however the legs on the tripod don‚Äôt fully support the weight of my iPhone 12 Pro would constantly tilt collapse or fall if not in a specific angle which I wouldn‚Äôt want to record in. It fell from the weight the last time I used it and cracked the screen protector of my phone and soon after the ring light stopped working and was so hot to touch on the light and at the plug socket that I believe it‚Äôs dangerous to even attempt to use again.Would recommend shelling out extra money for an actually sturdy setup where you can fully adjust the stand and a setup that can actually hold a phone like it claims it can.
4,Reading the reviews I was scared that the lighting of this product wouldn‚Äôt be the best but it was actually really bright (you can also adjust the level). But one thing which I didn‚Äôt like is how my phone wouldn‚Äôt fit on the tripod. But it‚Äôs fine because I don‚Äôt mind I can just hold my phone and take pictures.
5,Ich benutze das Ringlicht wenn das normale Licht nicht ausreicht oder ich das Foto das ich machen m√∂chte besser damit belichten kann. Es gibt 3 unterschiedliche Lichteinstellungen. F√ºr meine Zwecke v√∂llig ausreichend! Es tut was es soll und ich bin zufrieden.
3,(picture: product and 15cm ruler)most of it is plastic with the legs and stalk being metal(?)the legs are weak and can‚Äôt stand up properly so the highest it can stand stable is with the legs fully spread like in the picture.the light isn‚Äôt super bright in daylight but very bright in the evening/at night (indoors)
5,I love this ring light so much as an influencer I am constantly taking photos for my socials and this ring light means I don‚Äôt have to get other people to take my pictures for me! It comes on a tripod so it‚Äôs steady and can be popped anywhere for that perfect angle it has a hand free phone holder right in the middle of the light so you can do perfect pics/videos if you blog. It also has three different settings white light warm light and one in between both - it‚Äôs SUPER bright and has so many different levels of brightness! I have a few ring lights and this is my favourite one 100%! Super affordable and such good quality 10/10
4,It‚Äôs good but the bottom doesn‚Äôt adjust to change height it just stays low like that. Pinched myself with it once
5,Product as described. No power source would need your own. Apologies to delivery man for negative delivery feedback. Amazon you need to separate the buttons for phones and make more clear.
4,It‚Äôs good when it‚Äôs on. Bright good range of shades however It occasionally won‚Äôt turn on. I have to unplug and try again and then it works.
4,It would have been helpful to include the right adapter plug as most household (like us) will only have phone adapter plugs around and these don‚Äôt have enough wattage to use the light ring.But good lighting and not too hard to assemble.
3,Ich weiss nicht ob es defekt ist aber das Licht ist krass dunkel
3,It's a good ring light it makes a massive difference to my photos and I like the fact it has 3 settings and you can alter the brightnessThe advert however is misleading one of the pictures shows it on a large tripod I thought this was part of what I was buying but it wasn't.  I wouldn't have bought if I had known
5,Easy to set upVery easy to assemble. I bought this so I can take better photos and making videos.Phone can fit in the middle of the ring. It has very good brightness and makes any photo look great quality.The ring seems pretty sturdy. Was very easy to attach it onto the tripod stand and easy to put the phone holder into position too. Overall really happy with my purchase and I know I‚Äôll use it a lot when taking photos and videos.
5,Bought this for my 12yr old to use with her phone she loves it and good size easy to assemble
2,It was great in the beginning especially for the price. The lighting part is fine good as the brightness can be adjusted.  My problem is with the stand. It just doesn‚Äôt stay tight anymore and just flops back! So not staying upright which is why you have it in the first place is it not. I can‚Äôt record my tutorials for work if the light that‚Äôs holding my phone doesn‚Äôt stay upright! So I can‚Äôt even use it anymore. I suppose you get what you pay for and it is super cheap! The legs of the stand were always falling down too so even when it did tighten they didn‚Äôt keep position very well.
4,This what I totally needed in my desk for me to do perfect makeup........I love this ring light to moon and back while I am doing my videos for tiktok I love to use it to get clear photos...THANK YOU FOR THE BEST RING LIGHT ever I highly recommend this I will be buying it again and again.
2,Leider funktioniert das Ringlicht (sehr selten benutzt in 4 Monaten) nicht mehr obwohl die LED am An/Ausschalter leuchtet. Zur√ºckschicken geht auch nicht mehr.
4,The light itself is great and comes with lots of settings however the attachment piece that holds your phone isn‚Äôt that sturdy and falls off the actual tripod so you can be keep tightening it up. Apart from that it‚Äôs a good ring light.
5,Unfortunately I received what would appear to be a faulty ring light that I first opened far beyond the returns window. I was very impressed by the quality and brightness of light it gave off but sadly the product's tripod didn't seem to be as expected. I have since had this light recommended to me by multiple friends so it seems to have been just a one-off issue my end.AIXPI aftersales team have been amazing offering me a full refund even though I'm a long way outside of the returns window. Thank you!
3,I really like the ring light the only annoying thing was I didn‚Äôt understand whether size 4 came with a stand or not based on the FAQ‚Äôs I thought it did but it didn‚Äôt and then someone replied to the FAQ saying if you want the stand you need to order size 3 (I saw this after I already ordered and had the light delivered but hopefully this helps someone else)I don‚Äôt think the price of ¬£34.99 is good for a desk ring light of this quality without a longer tripod.Other than these 2 points I like the item.
4,Really easy to use.
5,Great product just plug it in and you‚Äôre ready to go!
3,Quite likes this at first but found that the light trips when plugged into mains power. Have to use a powerbank to use. No complaints with lighting. Probably same with most ring lights but i find the tripod and legs quite clumsy.
5,This product is AMAZING. It is life-changing for my Instagram posts and stories it makes my photos much better quality & just overall makes me look a lot better! It was very easy to put together thank God! Also the bit that holds the ring light & the bit that holds the phone both are able to be moved separately so you can turn around the phone or move the light up or down (change the angle).
5,I‚Äôm really impressed with this product. I bought it because of the amount of video calls I am now having in lockdown (so many pub quizzes!) and I was finding it annoying to hold the phone up and write my quiz answers. I was only looking to purchase a stand but saw the one with the ring light and thought I would give it a go. I am so pleased I got one with the light it really makes a difference in the picture/video quality. It was super easy to set up and put together but it does need to be plugged into a USB port for the light to work. I would highly recommend!
3,The light is great for the price but the tripod is not strong enough and moves too easily.
1,It was very difficult to assemble and then it would not stay upright. The light part was too heavy for the tripod it seemed. Ended up throwing it after a few weeks. Purchased for my daughter but she could not use it without proping it up. The power cord was not long enough to do this without using an extension lead. We gave up. I wasn't expecting amazing for the price but I did expect to be able to use it.
5,Great price and great quality. Lighting settings are perfect
5,Gutes Licht gute Qualit√§t
5,War sehr zufrieden mit der Qualit√§t und w√ºrde es jemand anders auch empfehlen
3,A really good light very bright and makes doing my makeup a lot easier! Only issues are it isn‚Äôt very stable and it has cut out two USB ports even though I only have it on for a short amount of time and unplug it when not in use.
3,Trips the electricity when plugged in upstairs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3,The light is great but sometimes doesn‚Äôt Stu on for long the tripod is hard to balance with a phone clipped in it tends to fall over very easily
4,Das Licht ist sehr gut die Gr√∂√üe ebenfalls perfekt. Leider f√§llt der Halter schnell ab und egal wie fest ich ihn schraube es f√§llt. Die Beine sind auch nicht die stabilsten da die nach etwas stehen langsam weiter auseinander rutschen und das Ring Licht dann an halt verliert. Wenn man aber endlich einen guten Punkt gefunden hat bleibt es auch zum Gl√ºck stehen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Great quality easy to set up will make my product pics go from a 5 to an 11 straight away love the 3 brightness settings and then you can change the intensity on each with a handy remote. All you need is a USB port to plug in and you're ready to go I'm so happy I bought this it is exactly what I needed and for an unbeatable price
5,I just bought this product in order to use it for taking videos and filming myself live from my phone and it is really amazing !! The brightness is great and real really make your eye pop and smooth your skin. The tripod is very stable and the the phone holder make the operation so easy. Highly recommending !
5,Bought for my wife to help her when putting her make up on. Good bright light!
4,Very quick set up! It‚Äôs super bright and a good height from a desk. However I didn‚Äôt realise there‚Äôs actually no plug that comes with it but that‚Äôs my error for not realising. Good thing I have many spare ones around the house!
2,It all looked good went together ok. As soon as I put my phone in the holder the tripod feet just fall under the weight and can‚Äôt support it at all. It‚Äôs not fit for purpose. I have 2 stars because the light is good but the rest is useless.
5,I experienced some problems but they contacted me and the issue was solved
5,You know what can't go wrong with this.I expected it to be a little cruddy but it's fantastic good quality.The plug does have to be 10w plus to work properly.
4,Qualit√§t entsprechend des Preises v√∂llig in Ordnung. Alles l√§sst sich ohne Probleme zusammen setzen. Das Licht ist mit den drei Helligkeitsstufen gut dosierbar und funktioniert gut. Das Stativ ist allerdings etwas labil. Die F√ºsschen m√ºssen stark gespreizt werden um das Licht und Handy zu halten.Will ich Stabileres muss ich auch mehr ausgeben.Hier passt Preis/Leistung
4,Great product amazing lighting. However if it‚Äôs used for too long my light turns off and I have to change the plug. I believe this is because it over heats. Also I don‚Äôt use the tripod it comes with as it‚Äôs flimsy and doesn‚Äôt support the weight.
5,This ring light is amazing. It comes with three different settings which include cool  warm and a normal white one. It also comes with its own remote which is so handy as you can turn the brightness of the light up and down. It is perfect if your someone who needs it for making videos or even just to take really good pictures. Overall I am so impressed with this and didn‚Äôt expect it to be this good for such a low price. I will definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy a ring light.
1,This literally stopped working after 5 mins and overheated my plugs!!! Such a mess and a waste of money
5,This is the first time I have experienced using one of these. Having looked in to it for a while I chose this one based on Amazon and review recommendation.This is a really excellent product. Packaged really well and arrived the next day after ordering. Really easy to put together but a user manual is included if needed.It's certainly enhanced the pictures I take for social media as it includes a smartphone holder and there are a number of brightness settings to play around with.I would really recommend this product!
5,Fantastic light weight light. Easy to assemble and great that it has different brightness and warmth settings to achieve that perfect look. I'm a freelance hairdresser so it's great to use to snap pictures of the clients hair after their makeovers. The tripod is fab for selfie style pictures and it's lovely a light for me to hold myself when photographing my clients. Many of my clients come in the evening when light isn't so good and I can't wait to be able to snap great pics whatever the day and time with this light.
3,Only allows you to have your device in landscape mode despite the landscape option. The clip literally doesn't fit inside the light in landscape position. Other than that this device works well but less than ideal expecting it to be portrait mode use able.
4,The tripod was delivered fast it work perfect and it is good for what I paid however the tripod advertised was longer so it advertised it could be as tall as you and thats NOT TRUE the tripod is small to be put on your desk.
5,brightness and the shades of the lights are ok if u close the blinds. BUT the tripod is very very flimsy on top of that it only works for 15 mins in a go. then it turns off on its on and i cant turn it back on. horrible for filming videos only buy if u wanna take quick selfies from time to time im gonna need to invest in another one definitely.
5,This was bought for me as a gift to help with the increase in self tapes for castings I was getting during lockdown when we couldn't;t audition in person. Great portable versatile and easy to use product. I needed some advice about the product and the team responded quickly and offered a great service.
3,Assembly is very easy product is solid it fell several times with no breakage.It is not tall enough to put on the floor you have to place it on a table. Also it is not strong enough if you need professional production.

5,I really didn‚Äôt expect such a pro style light ring. being able to dim the light is perfect as it can be quite bright. In regards to the ‚Äòwarmth‚Äô rating although i haven‚Äôt had it on for long touching the ring after 10 minutes doesn‚Äôt feel hot or warm at all whereas some light products do! Overall i really recommend this light ring it‚Äôs affordable & does the job really really well it can be a bit fiddly with the stand but it‚Äôs still worth it :)
5,This was such a great buy especially for the price! There is a good range of settings and it‚Äôs steady yet lightweight!! Was also super easy to assemble. 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è
5,So happy with this ring light. For little money it has a lot of different brightness settings
5,I bought this for my daughter who is into making tik toks and various other platforms. She has wanted one of these for so long. So today it arrived (quickly too) it was well packaged and easy to set up and works lovely too. I now have one very pleased daughter.The only think I was disappointed with is that if you dont know the smaller option comes with a small stand that does not adjust. If you are after a larger tripod you need to buy the larger light.Other than that we are really pleased.
4,As a front facing light for video conferences this works very well. Sufficient light option to create a professional picture.
5,
3,It works fine overall does what it's supposed to do but even when you tighten all the bits it still wobbles. I am using my camera on it which is heavier than a phone but it is supposed to be handling a camera so I was unpleasantly surprised that it cannot hold its weight very well
3,It works okay and it nice and bright for the price but mine turns itself off after about 2 minutes and then I have to leave it for a few minutes until it will work again I‚Äôm not sure if my one is broken?
5,Very happy with my purchase. Good quality and the fully adjustable tripod makes it easy to move the light around while holding your phone securely in place.  The 3 different light modes and 10 brightness levels lets you see how your make-up will look in different lights. Perfect for posting on Instagram or YouTube.The remote usb lead makes it really ease adjust the colour while your phone stays securely in place.  Took me less than 1 minute to put together.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,Alles wie beschrieben top üëç
4,this was a christmas gift and the recipient was very happy with the product and found it quite easy to use and assemble
5,As we all seem to be involved in online meetings or social chat this is a very useful gadget. I ise it stand alone with a PC as during the day I often have a window behind me which means the camera struggles. This gives a number of light levels and colours which help balance the picture. I havent used it with my phone inserted in the middle of the light ring but it does look like a very good option
4,Came faulty buttons on the remote did not work for the right thing had to press power button to change brightness. Then it stopped working after a few months.
4,Really decent little ring light for the price - legs are a bit flimsy/loose - it‚Äôs a shame they weren‚Äôt a bit tighter as id have probably 5**Shipping was so fast arrived next day.Would recommend :)
1,I was unable to film due to the tripod sliding and staying straight. The tripod does not hold my iphone 12 pro max well. Very disappointed! The stand is very flimsy and weak it doesnt stand straight or it bends automatically. Wouldnt recommend at all
4,This seems to be good quality and works OK. The stand is metal and quite strong and well made so should hopefully last.
5,for the price it‚Äôs so good and if your room is small or you don‚Äôt want a ring light to take up your space this is the one to get.The assembling process it really easy BUT phone stand is a bit flimsy but if you get it at the right angle etc it‚Äôs absolutely finethe modes and the settings are exactly like the ones in the photo 10/10 would recommend
5,I have recommended this to many colleagues. Brilliant bit of kit for WFH.  Noticeable improvement on Teams calls and you do look better in the 'warm' dimmable glow.  Feels fairly good quality and looks the part on the table stand bought.  The included tripod is weak and would not use. Has the ball joint to allow a web can to be fitted inside the ring - fantastic!
3,Brightness is really good can‚Äôt fault it only problem is with the cable or some connection in light as turns off then doesn‚Äôt turn back on for a while. Other than that not too bad for price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Package came really quickly and was very easy to set up includes product manual which is helpful. Ring Light is very bright and has 3 different settings which are really nice and versatile depending on what look you are going for. Definitely makes a huge difference to the quality of my pictures and videos! Great buy!
4,Really effective and super simple to use
5,Really happy with this item! So easy to put together use and dismantle!This is a great little asset to help me with my online start up which I will be relying heavily on social media for! I‚Äôm so pleased there are three different light settings as well as adjustable brightness so you can create the look you want anywhere! Also uses USB connection so very handy as with my work I‚Äôll constantly have the laptop nearby!Great price and worth the small investment! Happy Customer!
3,The lighting is good and its very easy to set up however the stand is awful and needs major improvement. Not stable at all. Everything else was as expected but if the stand is no good then it kind of defeats the purpose.
4,The actual ring light is great with lots of different light settings.  The tripod is not so good very hard to adjust and that's why it only gets 2 stars for easy to use.
5,Ordered this yesterday to help me take professional photographs of projects I am working on and love it.It is defamatory value for money. It didn‚Äôt even take three minutes to set up and It comes with three light settings and you can also dim the light or brighten. 100% recommend
3,When it works it great but mine keeps turning itself off every minute. It refuses to stay on. I think it‚Äôs an electrical fault and the legs are pretty flimsy and won‚Äôt stay in one position.
2,It stopped working when I only used it 3 times.The light started going on and off. And it switched off. The button wouldn‚Äôt also work. I changed the plug that I put it in 3/4 times and they didn‚Äôt work either. It would come back on for 2mins then go off again. Midway makeup I had to stop and constantly change plugs again and again. It‚Äôs so bad. The legs are also very weak and they constantly slide. The phone holder bit fell off too. It‚Äôs too late for me to get a refund so it was a waste of money don‚Äôt buy. Might aswell pay ¬£100 to get a decent one then to pay ¬£30 / ¬£50 twice.
3,Just received this today and to be honest i am disappointed having paid ¬£26.99 for this even though i can find it cheaper the stand is VERY flimsy and does not stand right. I cant adjust anything without everything just falling around.The brightness is good im happy woth that.Too expensive for something that has bad quality stand:(
3,Light is pretty good but the stand is extremely flimsy. No strong enough to hold up the light and a phone in the holder.
5,As a youtuber a ring light is a myst have item this particular ring light is easy to assemble and use. I use a Samsung s10 and found this was a little snug in the holder but otherwise it was good. It's small so easy to store and although the difference isn't massive all 3 of the light settings give a subtle glow to the skin. Would definitely recommend for someone just starting out or just wanting a but of light for their selfies
3,Could buy a better alternative for cheaper or same price
5,Ideal for zoom calls in the evening and darker evenings super simple to use several settings and helps to bring some brightness to my face without having to have the main bright light on.
3,Ich habe mir ehrlich gesagt wegen der vielen guten Bewertungen mehr versprochen. Hier meine kurze Zusammenfassung:Geplanter Verwendung:- Zus√§tzliche Ausleuchtung des Arbeitsplatzes f√ºr VideokonferenzenPositive Merkmale:- G√ºnstiger Preis- VerpackungNegative Merkmale:- Geringe Ausleuchtung trotz h√∂chster Stufe bei normalem Tageslicht- Ein Bein des Tripod war sehr lose so dass ich der Tripod nur ganz ausgeklappt genutzt werden konnteFazit:- F√ºr Videokonferenzen nicht zu empfehlen
3,was highly satisfied with this ring light and thought it was a bargain also  until I realized the phone part was not able to be assembled. The phone holder part and the part that attaches to the light couldn‚Äôt screw together as there was no threads on the inside of the part the phone clip is meant to screw into
4,Great value for money. Easy to use...only complaint is the legs move easily ....they need to be more stiff/ stay in place once set in place for filming.
4,The ring light is great you have three settings I personally love all of them if your wondering if you want it but it worths it‚Äôs moneyb
5,I purchased this ring light after searching for ages for the perfect one. As an influencer it's really important to get the perfect lighting in photos. This one is really good. It has three light setting all adjustable in strength. And all really bright. It's really easy to ensemble too and it has a handy phone/camera holder which is adjustable so it's universal to all phones. The package also arrived really quickly and the seller is really polite and helpful.
4,A very easy set up which my camera sits in perfectly has proven very solid for streaming and does a good job with chroma key removing my green screen
5,As pretty much all my prime orders this came really quick. My girlfriend tasked me to find her a decent size light ring and in my opinion this was it. I was a bit nervous as I wasn‚Äôt sure if she will find it perfect but anyway. It came in a small pack with a printed image of how to set it up even though is pretty straight forward. Once you set it up make sure you have a genuine or good USB adapter otherwise the ring light will continue to switch off. It has multiple functions and it lights up to a really nice dim. Really happy with the purchase
5,I‚Äôve been looking into getting a ring light for a while come across this one I decided to give it ago thought it will produce good colours on video/pictures and it certainly did. There is no messing around changing plates if you want a warmer colour the LED bulbs are built in all you need to do is adjust the dial. Easy to setup takes less room. A little issue is the stand sometimes is not firm enough but still is a good buy in the price offered.
3,i just got it out the box and set it up and put it on my bed side table(not very high at all) it fell of and the ring light completely smashed. but the light is very bright and makes your photos good quality
1,Bad
3,Plugged it in for all of 5 minutes before it cut out changed the plug and continued to cut out! Brand new and never used before this happened. The plug was also very hot and smelt like burning.UPDATE-Although the item was faulty the customer service was amazing and agreed on a full refund within 24 hours of me emailing with the complaint!
3,I bought it as a present but then the person I bought it for said that it broke her plugs and the sockets i don‚Äôt know if it just happened to her but I don‚Äôt recommend it as it ruined all of the chargers
5,quick delivery and work for whats its need for
4,3 light modes. Very bright. Does what it's supposed too. Very fiddly to put together
4,I love the fact that this light can be both cool and warm (white and yellow).  The only problem I found is that it can be a bit top heavy sometimes especially when the phone is attached.
5,Ich verwende es um fotos zu machen und die helligkeit ist mega gut.
3,Die Helligkeit ist gut und man verschiedene Helligkeitsstufen einstellen. Leider ist es nicht sehr stabil und das Handy wird sehr eingeklemmt. Man kann ihn nur auf dem Tisch verwenden. Ich habe mir ein anderes gekauft
4,Love this ring light so efficient and easy to store away but when plugged in to a plug is can often stops working. However when its plugged in a usb wall socket it‚Äôs fine and works perfectly üëåüèæ
5,Yeah yeah yeah it's gret!Id recommend and dont get a heart attack when turning it on please..Need to get me poor heart checked up on!
4,I like the ring light it has 3 colour options and several brightness levels.
4,Found the advertisement slightly misleading as I ordered this thinking it came with a stand. However the light is great and perfect if you are wanting to use it on a desk.
4,Passt alles so wie auf dem Bild
2,Unfortunately this started to flicker and then died within a month of using. The tripod was flimsy and the USB got a bit warm. I don't like posting negative reviews and at first I thought it was great (bar the flimsy tripod) but for me this was a waste of money.
4,Needed this light during my makeup sessions as there is less natural light coming in my room seems to work wellno issues.
3,There are better options on amazon if you spend a little bit more. I returned mine as soon as it arrived. The light was nice and bright but the legs and the phone clip parts look and feel very flimsy.
5,Very good quality for very little price
5,The seller responded very promptly and courteously to messages and agreed to a refund because I was unhappy with the unexpected requirement for an additional charger.Be aware this light requires a special charger plug - 10w(5V2A) which is not included and not mentioned in the description. If you use a standard phone/kindle charger it will overheat (may eventually burn out) and the light will keep switching itself off.
3,very easy to set up and ring light is very good however tripod legs are flimsy and does not sit up easily. It topples over when I place my phone in the holder (iphone 11 pro max) so I‚Äôm guessing the phone is too heavy for it. Otherwise good product. But had to return it.
5,Tolles Ringlicht f√ºr den Preis! Man kann Kaltes als auch Warmes Licht einstellen und die Intensit√§t Steuern. Die Handyhalterung f√§llt leider immer ab aber das liegt denke ich daran das mein Handy einfach zu schwer ist. Alles  in einem sehr gutes Produkt. Kann ich weiter Empfehlen.
5,Super super easy to set up the fact that this is usb powered is amazing as it makes streaming a lot easier and gives a good all round light to me when I‚Äôm talking to the camera. The switch on the cable is well made and responsive when changing modes. Was skeptical at first because of the price but this is really well made and the tripod attachments are actually good quality! Considering buying another one of these already!
4,I love this product my photos have never been better!
4,My daughter loves this but the legs of the tripod are not that stable
3,Great light but when I have recorded a video with it for the first time I have already noticed that there is this kind of squeaky sizzling electricity noise from the lamp and every time I have used it it became more and more intense I am not sure if I will be able to use it as my viewers have pointed it out as very annoying. It would be a great product otherwise...
4,Easy to assemble
3,Nach 7 Monaten hat dieses sonst wirklich gut funktionierende Ger√§t den Geist aufgegeben. Es war bei mir in moderaten Ma√üen im Einsatz.
5,I purchased this light with not many expectations as it is at the lower price point. However I received it today and it is AMAZING and perefect for videos and pictures. It‚Äôs bright bright with 3 light settings. It is easy to put together with clear instructions. The phone holder is really secure. I purchased a more expensive ring light before this called NEEWER and is hyped and it was rubbish. Highly highly recommend.
4,Easy to assemble and does what it says. Only thing is the part got the camera is landscape only
3,Was great it when it worked but after a few weeks it broke
4,Good
5,Habe dieses Produkt urspr√ºnglich nur zum Aufnehmen von Bildern bestellt. Muss aber im Nachhinein sagen es eignet sich ebenfalls f√ºr meine Frau zum schminken zum Beleuchten des Raums und etlichen weiteren Dingen.Die einstellbaren Helligkeitsstufen sowie die W√§rme des Lichts machen es um einiges leichter die richtige Beleuchtung zu finden. Sei es f√ºrs Foto Video zum Schminken oder zu anderen Zwecken.Habe es jetzt auch schon mehrere Stunden laufen lassen um zu schauen wie die Hitzeentwicklung ist doch auch hier mehr als positiv √ºberrascht.F√ºr mich eine ganz klare Kaufempfehlung !
2,Product is real ly good different light settings are amazing and the brightness is really good. I‚Äôm using an 18w adapter as recommended (at least 10w recommended) but my light only works for about 5 mins and then cuts out. When I switch it off/on and unplug and replug it it still doesn‚Äôt work for another 5 mins. So not very ideal as I bought it to apply my makeup and I have to stop/start so it doubles the time I need to take.  Not sure if my one has a fault or if anyone else is experiencing but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend based on this.
3,It's not as bright as I expected
4,Very nice ring light easy to assemble and the lighting quality is quite good. Wish the tripod itself was a little bit sturdier but not bad for the price I paid.
3,The tripod is a bit too short and is difficult to adjust - the brightness and ease of use is fine though.
4,It‚Äôs brilliant altogether. But not the sturdiest. The lighting is immaculate it could light up my whole neighbourhood! I would recommend it yes just build it up very careful to avoid wobbles and bentness
4,Das ringlicht hat mich sehr beeindruckt: die Beleuchtung bzw. die Helligkeit kann man auf 3 Stufen √§ndern welches die BILDqualit√§t √§ndern. F√ºr dieses preisleistungsverh√§ltnis gute Qualit√§t w√ºrde es jedem weiterempfehlen.
4,Stand is very useful EAsy to use and set up . Mult use screen for make up and view  video such as youtube. I used it for my S7 and Iphone X. Works fine. The phone holder sturdy and it charges the phone.
3,Really love the light but it‚Äôs no good if you want to use it as a tripod. The part where your phone fits in is fiddly and it does not tighten up enough to secure it. My phone has fell out so many times and the whole thing has fallen over a few times too. I‚Äôve had to buy a separate tripod for my phone and just use the light.
5,I liked this because a friend of mine ordered one which prompted me to order one as during lockdown every week 5 of us go on zoom and Houseparty on our phones and it‚Äôs great for your phone and gives a nice bright light for to chat and see faces to faces thankyou
3,the lighting is fantastic. however if you even touch the tripod it will fall over. it nearly broke my phone so many times and I've had it for one day. The tripod can barely handle any weight. So if that is important to you buy from somewhere else.
5,its alot better then I thought it would be easy to put together and just handy to have
3,Ich benutze es als Schminklicht.  Es ist auf Kaltweiss voreingestellt was ich etwas l√§stig finde da man es bei jedem Anschalten wieder umstellen muss auf Warmweiss.  Bei einem anderen Ringlicht was ich noch gekauft habe ist dies nicht der Fall.  Benutze den St√§nder selbst nicht er kam mir aber sehr instabil vor.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I absolutely love this ring light and I use it to take all my videos and pictures! It‚Äôs so easy to assemble and you assemble in two different ways I choose to assemble this way because I use it for IG stories and IGTV. Would definitely recommend this!!
4,It works well when your on zoom  as a black filter light. The light is very light and works well.
4,Bright
5,This item is as described and it is easily to put together. It it great if you need more lighting for videos or Instagram photos makeup tutorials or even video calls. It has 3 different colour temperatures and each one you can make brighter or not so bright so you can adjust to your needs. Overall this is a great product.
5,This ring light is perfectI was able to screw it on to my tripod.It is a desktop only so very short. But I had a separate high tripod to attach it tooThe USB wire To the plug is average size not the longest so depends if you want longer but it did fine for me. Can easily use an extension lead.
5,Couldn‚Äôt recommend more. This is my first one and was worried with it only being ¬£20 but I‚Äôve never been so happy to have ordered something! Brightness can be dimmed/ altered and have 3 different colours depending on how you want it. When I say buy it!! Buy it!!!
3,Works for the continuous demand for online meetings. However tripod legs are not very sturdy so use a box in order to stabilise legs
5,Bought this for my niece as a birthday present  she has got a YouTube channel thought she might will like this. When she opened she was over the moon. lightening is great  works really well and the price is very good and affordable I will definitely buy this for myself as well
1,Licht Helligkeit sind f√ºr den Zweck okay. Haltbarkeit der schwarzen Kunststoffteile sind unzureichend. Die Kunststoffteile rei√üen und verlieren ihre Funktion.
4,üëçüèª
5,Having had dodgy lighting for the last year I am really pleased I bought this light. With 3 light tone options and variable brightness I am much happier with this light. It was really easy to assemble and something I usually struggle with. Great value.
3,Mit Premiumpualit√§t habe ich nicht gerechnet. Das Zubeh√∂r ist etwas besser als unbrauchbar. Die Lampe flackert auf warm und kalt im Normallicht Modus ist das flackern weg. Habe mir die Lampe f√ºr ein Fotoprojekt geholt daf√ºr wird sie reichen. F√ºr einen ernsthaften Betrieb w√ºrde ich sie allerdings nicht wirklich empfehlen.
5,I am very satisfied it is a very good manufacturer it shines well I recommend it to anyone who is interested. Thank you for the package.
2,I love this light but it cut out on me after less than 30 mins. Either faulty or maybe overheating. Was plugged into iPhone plug which I‚Äôve googled and seems to be 5 volts which is recommended I believe. Would be great to come with the right plug or to be pointed in the right direction so I can buy the right thing so it works. What plug adaptor should I have? May need to return it if I can‚Äôt get it to stay on with alternative plug
5,Okay
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Absolutely obsessed with this this is the best item I have bought on Amazon the light is super bright and great quality 3 different light setting which are all great and dimmer which I love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3,This item was great - until you want to unscrew the base - and it will not go back together! Now useless.
5,I love this ring light stand. I no longer have to ask people to take my pictures it‚Äôs so easy with this stand! Also the quality of the picture comes out so good due to the LED light ! So glad I purchased it for such a reasonable price !
5,Ordered this to use for photos and makeup such a good investment and it‚Äôs so cheap for the quality ! Comes with a tripod for the ring light and a phone holder for your phone. Brilliant quality I keep mine in the box for easy storage and so nothing gets lost. 100% worth the money.
5,Brought this as a gift for my nephew for his TikToks/YouTube. He is loving it says it makes his videos a hundred times better. I gave it a whizz with a selfie and have to say I love that you can change the strength of the light as well as changing the feel i.e. warm cold light. Might have to get one for myself...
4,Nice set nice lights
4,Mir gef√§llt die Auswahl zwischen den drei verschiedenen Lichtquellen. Sch√∂n w√§re es wenn man das Smartphone nicht nur waagerecht nutzen k√∂nnte.
5,My ring light came so quickly and I put it together straight away there are just a few bits to screw together it was so easy and quick to do.The light is so bright and I am so impressed that you can change the colour of the light I hadn‚Äôt realised that when I ordered this! Plugs into any USB port!
2,Product details aren‚Äôt sufficient stand is very small quality isn‚Äôt for professional use more like for kids. Product quality in general is poor compared to the price and alternate options.Totally not value for money product. Infact abit over priced on Amazon.
5,excellent value for money - ive been using it for over 4 months - it has 3 light options and several brightness modes and its just a super product.
5,Ich habe mir diese Lampe gekauft um meine selbst gemachten geln√§gel usw sch√∂n presentieren zu k√∂nnen.Es ist sehr einfach aufzubauen und die Gebrauchsanweisung ist auch leicht verst√§ndlich mit Bildern.Das Licht kann man in 3 Farben einstellen warm  kalt und  das andere ist etwas bl√§ulich wie Ich finde.Man kann auch die Intensit√§t mit Plus oder minus einstellen.Im gro√üen und ganzen finde ich es  sehr gut f√ºr diesen Preis.
5,Good quality
5,Habe gleich drei St√ºck gekauft f√ºr meine Nichten alle sind ganz happy Top-Qualit√§t kann es nur weiterempfehlen.
4,The product was not fit for my purposes but the seller has offered me a full refund.Good customer service.
2,Der Lichtring war nicht unbedingt leicht zusammenzubauen der Einsatz f√ºr die Handyhalterung lie√ü sich gar nicht festschrauben. Das Handy w√§re also immer wieder rausgefallen. Die F√º√üe sind so d√ºnn und wackelig dass es ewig dauert bis man eine Position gefunden hat wo alles gut steht. Ging also wieder zur√ºck.
5,Don't pay attention to the negative reviews this product is an absolute gem It has upped my video quality to an unbelievable level couldn't be happier.
3,Wirkt qualitativ sehr billig. Ich glaube auch nicht dass das Ding lange √ºberlebt. Aber es tut f√ºrs erste was es eben soll. F√ºr den Preis kann man da wohl auch nichts anderes erwarten.
4,Really good condition but unfortunately I thought it would be bigger than that As it shown on most of the pictures.
5,I had once a bigger version similar idea. The good thing is I can still attach this on a bigger tripod if needed but also have it standing on a desk without a big tripod thing underneath. Only small complain is about the USB cable that is sometimes too small but I will see if I can use a powerbank Instead.
1,What can I say about this product. The light and phone holder are fine but unfortunately the whole thing is ruined by the tripod.The tripod is literally hot garbage. Never mind being able to tilt the phone and camera: The tripod legs will tilt at the slightest touch. Getting them to support anything at all is an act of precise balancing. The tilt action for both the light and the phone holder are held by a simple screw: loosen and the whole thing is floppy tighten and the whole thing is rigid but it doesn't really matter: by the time you've gone to do that the tripod legs have moved again slipping out like a spider on ice because you touched the damn thing!Edit: I tried to update this review but Amazon wouldn't post it. The sellers are now harassing me changing their emails to get past me blocking them trying to bribe me into removing this review. I bought this in June and they are still emailing me frequently.
5,It‚Äôs a nice little tripod works fine  easy to assemble and few lighting modes.It‚Äôs a good product ‚ù§Ô∏è
2,Leider ist das alles sehr wackelig und unstabil die Befestigung f√ºr die Handyhalterung lockert sich oft.. Die Beleuchtung ist Super.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This item is quite bright and easy to assemble.Also helps with my picture quality ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
3,Only problem is it dosent come wit a remote  control which makes it harder to do natural photos unless you press the button on ur phone camera
3,I have the iphone 11 and it doesn't fit in the phone holder which is a huge disappointment. It's adjustable but even at the widest it doesn't fit and sideways it's too heavy.
4,F√ºr online Meetings alle paar Wochen vollkommen ausreichend.
2,There are so many better light rings with a tripod on amazon... I wish I hadn‚Äôt bought this one. Power cable is short (and it needs to always be plugged in) so you‚Äôre tied to a plug. Then tripod is absolutely tiny (I was misled by the pictures). So small it‚Äôs only good for a small table. Because of coronavirus my post office is closed but otherwise would have sent this back. For the same amount of money you can get a better one on amazon. Shame on me for choosing this because the delivery was quicker. Light is ok when it‚Äôs plugged in.
2,Can use it a it broken in very disappointing with it
5,really bright lots of settings
4,Das Ringlicht an sich ist super auch die drei verschiedenen Farbt√∂ne.Das begelieferte Stativ ist recht instabil
3,Ich habe heute mein Packet bekommen und leider ist der Kabel bereits kaputt...! :-( da das ein Geschenk f√ºr mein Kind war kann ich es nicht benutzen und werde diese ger√§t auch wieder zur√ºck senden m√ºssen. Echt schade.
4,the stand keeps falling because my iPhone 11 Pro is too heavy but apart from that it‚Äôs great !
5,As a content creator you need the best lighting solutions that are not too cost effective especially if you are just starting out and not looking to invest a lot of money from the beginning. Cant fault the Price for the product that you get. Really would Recommned this product.
5,
4,Supplier has reached out to resolve my issue.
4,Nicht so tolle Qualit√§t was man schon beim aufbauen merkt!Licht ansich macht was es soll!Geht leider zur√ºck.
2,Die LED-Lampe ist unter Beleuchtungsaspekten ok. Allerdings gibt es ein paar Dinge die deutlich verbesserungsw√ºrdig sind:- der Aufbau ist fummelig und hakelig;- die Positionen von Handyhalterung Ringhalterung und Stativhalterung ver√§ndern sich st√§ndig so dass permanent korrigiert werden muss eine exakte Mittenposition ist unm√∂glich;- das Smartphone droht aufgrund der Handyhalterung wegzukippen;- das Stativ "streckt alle Beine von sich" sobald ein Handy in die Halterung gesteckt wird.Wem es gen√ºgt ein flachliegendes Stativ zu haben das dann mit B√ºchern oder anderen Objekten in (wackelige) Positionen gebracht wird kann gerne zuschlagen. (Allerdings sollte man dann immer ein Auge auf das Smartphone haben denn es k√∂nnte wegkippen.)Allen anderen empfehle ich dringend etwas mehr Geld f√ºr eine bessere Leucht auszugeben.
5,Great quality ring light capacity to go very bright with options for warm cold or neutral tones.Easy to set up with ability to mount phone (or small camera inside ring)Would be great for selfies tiktoks or product photography.Will edit with use.
5,we already had an 8 inch ring light and wanted a bigger one.  this was great for the price easy to set up and does the job.  really pleased with it and would definitely recommend to friends and family.  its light and compact so easy to transport.  we wouldnt be without it for filming our tiktoks
4,I like the led light settings of the lamp. I have tested it yet putting the phone in the kiddle of the led circle.
5,Schnelle Lieferzeit bin zufrieden. Sch√∂ne Helligkeitsstufen.
5,Really bright havnt had a chance to use it properly yet but i cant wait to. I didnt want to pay to much for a ring light so went from the reviews on this one as they were all really good & im glad i did
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Good qualityEasy to assembleWorks with my phoneCan adjust intensity and colour of lightCan be plugged into laptop or anythingCompact in size and easier to carry anywhere
5,Great item for the price! Perfect for my 17 & 16 year old daughter's and also gifted a friend one for her birthday too (which she loves).Stand is sturdy and the lighting is perfect for their make-up videos.
3,Within a few months the orange light stopped working. Now only the white one works. It still has full functionality for the light levels on the bright white but a shame that now I can't change the hue of the light.
5,Used for tiktok videos.Brightness is perfect it has a number of settings for brightness.Even when you are not close up it lights up a small room.Thickness shown in the picture next to a standard size pen.Easy to assemble.Delivery great.
5,Easy to use for video calls on your phone or when used plugged into your laptop. Gets used in most of my work calls and makes a difference. Also like the option of a warm and soft white light or both combined.
2,habe das Licht bestellt um gute Fotos von meinen Fingern√§geln zu machen (Nagelmodellage)privat. Jedoch alles wackelt f√§llt um es h√§lt nichts es ist unm√∂glich gute Fotos zu schie√üen. Das Produkt ist sehr schlecht verarbeitet die drei Lichtstufen sind noch ok aber es bringt nichts wenn die Handyhalterung zu locker ist und das Handy verrutscht das Licht keinen guten Stand hat und bei kleinster Ber√ºhrung f√§llt alles auseinander. Keine Kaufempfehlung lieber etwas mehr Geld ausgeben!
5,It is exactly as expected.
5,Das Ringlicht ist f√ºr meine Bed√ºrfnisse genau das richtige.Die Helligkeit ist sehr gut.
5,I wish the legs were a bit more sturdy? They just kinda move around a bit and with a little wobble of the table it just flops... But the lighting and overall quality is stunning so I really recommend it despite its legs..
5,Die Lampe ist gut gemacht und sehr hell. Ich hatte sie mir urspr√ºnglich f√ºr Videocalls und Fotos geholt. Wenn man den Handyhalter jedoch abmacht ist sie auch einfach eine schicke Lampe und kann super zum arbeiten oder zeichnen verwendet werden. (Zu diesem Zweck habe ich mir zus√§tzlich noch ein g√ºnstiges Monkey Stativ gekauft. Funktioniert super da die Verschraubung genormt ist.)
5,I‚Äôd heard a lot about these ring lights & all the good reviews I heard weren‚Äôt wrong. A bit fiddly to put together but once assembled couldn‚Äôt believe how bright it was. It made such a difference to photos taken. Was well impressed with this
5,I bought for my daughter for Xmas.Initial problem with plug which was resolved very quicklythe communication with the seller was excellent.they advised me to get the correct plug its working great now.excellent product and after carewould use againthanks
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Great price for the ring light! Best one I‚Äôve ever bought! Love how bright it will go! Beautiful pictures taken with it! Video review of the brightness and colour lights.Would highly recommend.
2,I ordered this in April / May and it's been great!!! I was really pleased with it until recently when the light just doesn't stay on. It started by just dimming and I'd have to just push the USB in harder but now it flickers and then dies as if the connection just isn't good enough (I have no idea of the technicalities). It seems as though the USB has broken and I have no idea how to fix it which sucks.
4,Great light very bright good for the price. Bad tripod is very flimsy
5,I was so excited when this product arrived I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it was to put together. I expected it to be a real headache but it was so quick and easy. I bought this for my instagram selfies and I‚Äôm so impressed with the quality of the lights absolutely love it. Would definitely recommend!
2,This product was under ¬£25 so did not have high hopes for a wow factor but expected basic functionality. The set up was unwieldy and the tripod barely supported the light whichever way we fiddled with it it kept collapsing and keeling over which meant my phone would keel over with it with risk of damage. The light itself gave an even tone but was not as bright as we require. Sadly have to return and go for something more expensive to get better quality.
2,I just received my order yesterday evening opened it up no instructions to guide its set up. I was expecting a lot for some reason. It looked discouraging at first to be honest like is this all? I wish it came with it's own adapter to avoid searching around for one that is 10W  because it is now so discouraging. I will set it up and see how it feels then give a rating that applies but for now? I am not impressed.
4,For me this product falls down re the legs the they unstable and awkward to position .The light however is excellent.
3,Overly bright wobbles and falls over a lot. Had to fix it to a different tripod.
5,This ring light is super useful! a very bright and powerful light source and fairly easy to assemble. just be careful when you first switch it on as its very bright and harsh. also be aware it doesnt come with a plug!!
5,Nice
5,Schnell geliefert. F√ºr den Preis gute Qualit√§t.
2,Das Stativ ist super wacklig die Konstruktion ist unsinnig das Stativ wackelt die Verbindungen sind unsauber... das Ringlicht ist ok leuchtet aber weder gleichm√§√üig noch sch√∂n aus... nee sorry.
5,Brilliant item really easy to put together - it took me less than 5 minutes. It has three different colours and you can adjust the brightness. Recommend definitely. Easy to use and great quality.
4,Works well
2,I am very disappointed to see that this product cannot be charged as stated in the description. It must be connected to a power source at all times. I have attached a screen shot of the offending description and this must be removed. I wanted to charge this light and use it anywhere without having to be near a power source.I shall be returning this item for a full refund.
3,Jedoch ist die Halterung echt nixht optimal sie h√§lt einfach nicht gut das Licht richtig zu positionieren ist ein graus damit.
5,I was skeptical buying at first as I really needed this light to take quality photos and wow! It exceeded my expectations. It is SO bright perfect for photos and anything else! Fits my iPhone 11 in perfect highly recommend.
5,I love this it even goes on my taller tripid but the stand that comes with it is brilliant and sturdy as wellLove this defo worth buying different settings the amount of light its brilliant
5,Arrived quickly  in working order thanks
5,I bought this to help with videoing content for my social media pages and I am very happy with his productIt‚Äôs very easy to assemble and even easier to use and fits any size of phoneIt has improved the quality of my videos which I am delighted with
5,Habe ehrlich gesagt gar nicht so viel erwartet und bin jetzt restlos begeistert. Zwar muss man die Schraube bei der Handyhalterung richtig fest zuziehen die wackelt sonst ziemlich bin ich einfach begeistert. Egal ob Video oder Foto man wird immer perfekt ausgeleuchtet und die Handhabung ist super simpel. Absolute Empfehlung!
2,Brightness is good but wire movement messes with the line too much
4,Works fine  thanks
3,Tripod is very lose and doesn‚Äôt stand up properly.
3,I don't understand how to make the ring of light work and where to plug the USB cord-also it really is toodifficult to steady my phone on such a wobbly tripod.
3,its easy enough to assemble but very flimsy I've dropped my phone countless times from this (Samsung s10) and have damaged my screen because it struggles to hold it
4,Cheap and effective. However cheaply made and easily broken. Easy set up. Basic
4,Awesome product
5,Perfect for my son and his TikToks. Great value for money.
5,Excellent quality for the price
3,Hmmm naja. Hat bei mir n Monat gehalten da ist das Stativ abgebrochen. Naja gut das Licht ging ja noch aber auch das geht jetzt leider nicht mehr.Habe mir jetzt n anderes Ringlicht bestellt aber das ist einfach viel zu billig verarbeitet. Sehr schade.
5,not actually for me but for the wife who recently has got into tic-toc (whatever that means) recently and I see her using this a lot.  she does tell me she is very happy with the product.  well packaged delivery was almost the following day.  a good seller would recommend.
5,I brought this to provide better lighting to do my makeup and oh my gosh!  The lighting is amazing! It will hopefully make visibility much easier!! I have this placed around my vanity make up mirror and it is ideal!
5,In this days of COVID-19 shutdown I am using ZOOM or Hangouts extensively for meetings. Sometimes the lighting in my room is not good and people cant see me properly. Ring lighting gives shadowless lighting and I looked on amazon to find this as the best seller. It works so well that my presentations look professional and people can clearly see me. Well worth buying.
3,This is the first LED lamp that I bought for taking pictures of my makeup. It's a bit difficult to install and doesn't hold in place for most of the time wouldn't recommend getting it.
5,Great product just what I wanted
5,Das Produkt kam in einem gro√üen Paket bei mir an alle Teile waren einzeln verpackt. Durch eine Bedienungsanleitung (auf Englisch inkl. Bildern) war das Ringlicht sehr einfach zu montieren. Alle Teile wirken hochwertig nicht billig. Es funktioniert einwandfrei und ist sehr leichtg√§ngig. Die vorhandene Halterung f√ºr das Handy ist verstellbar und somit f√ºr alle aktuellen Modelle passend.Die verschiedenen Einstellungen des Lichts sind super. Ich bin rundum zufrieden
5,BEST THING I HAVE ORDERD!!Works perfectly it is really bright and has options to dim down to a Lower brightness! So easy to use.Reasonable pricing and really fast delivery.Such an easy to set up I recommend to people who make Tik toks Instagram pics YouTube videos and photo shoots!
3,Perfect although sometimes the light just randomly turns off and you have to completely un plug it and plug it back in again for it to work.
4,Very good great light and easy to set up and use :)
2,So... I started off loving this product okay it isn‚Äôt very sturdy but I loved it.It has 3 different light settings and you can turn the brightness up and down. The lead is long enough too!As time has gone on it has blown 4 plugs (which you plug the USB in) so unable to use this anymore. I‚Äôm unsure why.
3,The lights are good but the mobile holder doesnt stay in place tried all the ways tO make it thigher without luck phone always ends up on the floor/table!
4,Easy to use & powerful lighting
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Cant work out how to get it to stay still. The adjuster on back isn't tightening it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Such a good little ring light for recording insta stories it‚Äôs perfect! Easy to put together too
5,Wow this light is amazing. Bought as doing a lot of Zoom meetings and now it‚Äôs getting darker I wanted more light. It‚Äôs great for brightening the image up but also like having a permanent filter on! I‚Äôm so pleased !
5,Love it it sits on my desk rather than on the floor. But I still love it and it has so many settings also
5,Nothing to dislike
1,Pros:‚Ä¢ I liked the option to be able to change the colour/brightness of the lights.‚Ä¢ comes nice & securely packaged.Cons:‚Ä¢ isn‚Äôt the easiest of things to assemble as it didn‚Äôt come with any instructions‚Ä¢ the ring light broke really easily because it‚Äôs so cheap and I couldn‚Äôt return as it was a few days over my 1 month return warranty.‚Ä¢ the phone grip isn‚Äôt really strong so my phone kept popping out of the holder.‚Ä¢ customer services are useless and unhelpful.I posted an honest review of this item before and customer services were so persistent with me that I removed my honest review for a full refund so I got my refund and now here‚Äôs my honest review of the product back on Amazon!
3,Leider sehr filigran und l√§sst sich auch in der H√∂he nicht mal minimal anpassen. Auch der Neigungswinkel bleibt dank schwerem Smartphone nicht wie ich ihn einstellen will.
2,Poor quality it's not the same as my first one I don't know why
2,Bin damit √ºberhaupt nicht zufrieden. Bricht st√§ndig in sich zusammen oder die ‚ÄûF√º√üe‚Äú rutschen weg.
4,It's exactly as it shows and works perfectly.
5,I‚Äôve been looking into buying a ring light to improve the quality of my social media videos. This ring light has 3 different light settings and works via usb. Perfect size to have on a table while filing as well as easy to take with you when travelling.
4,Ein tolles Produkt..Jedoch der St√§nder sehr unstabil. Aber f√ºr Anf√§nger genau das Richtige üëçüèª
5,Absolutely love this! Been desperate for a ring light for a long time but they were always way too overpriced. The quality of this is so much better than I thought and is just as great as the bigger ones I have at photoshoots. No complaints so far. 100% recommend.
2,The light it‚Äôs self was great but i have used it maybe 3 times and the light today has just went out in it. It no longer works. Thankfully it was only a ¬£10 so I can not expect to much but I would have like to get a few more goes out of it. Disappointing.
4,Really great light only thing is it doesn‚Äôt hold a charge but apart from that it‚Äôs perfect üëå
5,I had no problem in setting this up and switching it on. It's easy to see how to switch from warm to cool light. I bought two as there is definitely a better effect if you have one on each side of your face.
5,My girlfriend needed a passport picture but all photographers are closed during the lockdown.This did the trick she is very happy.Also I thought that the key to a good picture on Instagram is an expensive camera but now I know it is a proper light.
5,I got the lamp for better lighting for video filming and it did not disappoint. It's bright easy to assemble don't take up much space have plenty of light settings.  Handy little product.
5,bright light setting which is easy to use. you can dim the lights too if they are too bright. there is also a warm setting. it is 10 inch which creates the perfect lighting and i loved using this produc
5,The product was great  such a good quality light and does everything it says it does. It‚Äôs so handy and easy to use and I can take it anywhere with out a faff. It holds my phone nicely without the worry of it falling out.
5,Nice small sized ring light perfect for those who don‚Äôt have much space in your room. Easy to assemble and it does come with instructions. Did think the stand at the bottom is a little weak.
5,Good light weight light that was easy to assemble. The 3 levels of light make it good to use everywhere.
4,Sehr gut!
4,Support is a little bit small
3,Leider wurden meine Erwartungen nur teilweise erf√ºllt. Ich hatte gehofft dass Ringlicht w√§re noch etwas heller. Au√üerdem... verdunkelt sich nach 5-10 min die hellste Einstellungen und l√§sst sich auch nicht wieder heller stellen.
1,i have used this product only a couple of times and the light flickers on and off constantly. i have tried it in different plugs to see if they were the issue but it keeps happening. tonight i tried again and it kept flickering so i went to unplug and the usb was so hot that i burned my finger and the usb is bent which explains why the light never stayed on. the actual tripod is very flimsy and not very sturdy at all. very disappointed in my product. unsure if i just received a faulty product but i am not wanting to use it again due to how hot the usb just got as i do not want it to cause a fire !!***UPDATE***got offered money to remove my review. this is a serious hazard on the item therefore people should be made aware
5,I am using this product . This product works verg well and this is very usefull for making tiktok videos specially. This ring has 10 levels of brightness with six different ligts. This is very simple to use i really like this ring light .
2,I am really upset with my purchase! I got it a month ago and I have barely used it - it keeps falling apart and it can barely hold my phone!! A waste of money! Do not buy! The stand is not secure and it‚Äôll just randomly turn off. I‚Äôve been using it for self tapes and tiktoks so when it falls or turns off I have to start again and it‚Äôs very annoying! I would like a refund
4,Gut f√ºr l√§ngere Videotalks mit Freunden.
5,I bouggt this to use when Im photographing products. I was amazed at how bright it is with lots of options to even dim each light setting. My granddaughters liked it so Ive just purchased 2 more. Great value for the price
1,This product worked for about three weeks then broke. The connection for the phone holder crumbled and the light switch broke
1,In boxed it after it arrived was really impressed for the price. Put it away and after about a week tried to use it and it was turning on for a split second then turning off again. Maybe good if your looking for a strobe light.
5,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she is really pleased with it. It is multipurpose and lets her do her favourite things. It was very easy to assemble. Very recommended.
5,Super Show! Mein 25-j√§hriger technikafine Sohn besucht mich und sagt Mensch sowas hab ich ja noch nicht einmal!  Und wenn man dann bei einem Video-Chat erst mal alle Beleuchtungsstufen durchprobiert und am anderen Ende den Teilnehmer fragen was denn f√ºr ihn am ein angenehmsten sei: ganz gro√ües Kino!
4,The product was received on time and works well.
5,Given that it was a low price I didn‚Äôt expect a lot from the light. As if is it is very bright works extremely well and does everything i want of a ring light.
5,Gives great illumination of my face for when using a camera. No issues but I have had no use for the phone mount so I cannot comment on that.
5,does exactly what it says on the box! literally. fab light great settings and fab value for money. I do find the stand which the light is on needs to be more secure but this could be down to myself and not finding how to properly secure it tight enough as it wobbled a bit when I put my phone on the holder.
5,Liked the weight- very light to transport. Like the adjustable brightness and ability to add some warmth. I use it mainly for close-up and macro photography as main light.
5,Selfies
3,Really good product only problem is with the phone holder I can't go landscape because the fitting it to large see picture
5,Iv been using this for a couple of days and so far I love it. It‚Äôs easy to use and gives photos and videos a wonderful brighter look. Excellent product
3,It looks and feels like a very cheap piece of plastic taken from a Chinese Shopify.
5,Absolutely love this light. Has lots of different settings. My face looks so flawless with the orange ring I love it so much.
4,Bit flimsy but does the job
5,We used to hide in the shadows like Deepthroat but no longer!We've got this set up behind our laptop with a webcam clamped in the phone mount and it's great. no quibbles at all.
5,I got this for zoom it is really good light and brightness is amazing it is so good I started using for makeup light
5,Ich bin ziemlich √ºberrascht √ºber diese Produkt. es ist f√ºr diesen Preis echt super in Ordnung und erf√ºllt seinen Zweck.Die Helligkeit sowie die Farbe des Lichts lassen sich einstellen was ich super finde.Kann es nur empfehlen.
5,Absolutely amazing product was extremely bright easy to use and assemble everything you want from this product and more. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more with a price like this. Highly recommend it to everyone that wants to brighten up their photos & selfies!
3,The item works fine and is super-easy to assemble.  However the stand legs are a bit filmsy
5,Excellent light for video conferencing. I mounted mine on an angle poise arm positioned behind my monitor so that the ring encircles my webcam. Fantastic results. Very pleased.
5,This is a Christmas gift for my daughter but it looks very good well packaged and fast delivery update my daughter loves it she using it every day well worth the money
5,I‚Äôm a makeup artist and i use this to take pictures of my looks it‚Äôs the perfect size to fit into my desk (it‚Äôs smaller than you think it‚Äôs a desk ring light) but I like that as it means I have more space
5,So worth it makes all the difference when apply make up my partner even uses it now when lining up his beard !
5,I love it. I use it to film videos it just provides great light. It can be really bright which is needed sometimes. The assembly was super easy that I didn't even need to read instructions
1,It was a great ring light. I bought it on 17th November and it stopped working 5 months later. Waste of money.
5,I have a proper  sturdy tripod that works fine with this ring light.. The ring light is worth it. But the small tripod that comes with it is flimsy.
5,This lamp is amazing. It has so many different light settings. The tripod is really easy to set up. I‚Äôve recently started Instagram influencing and this is perfect for making my photos look good. Would recommend this to anyone.
5,Super Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis. Die Helligkeit ist regulierbar und ausreichend. Mein Tipp f√ºr Outdoor-Chats oder -Portr√§taufnehmen o.√§.: Da die Stromversorgung √ºber USB l√§uft funktioniert dies auch mit einer Powerbank mit min. 3A Output und 20.000 mAh.
5,Well it's lasted 3 weeks at least!Easy to set up good quality light and handy accessories.Perfect for chucking some light on to me during Video Calls.Bravo sirs!
5,This ring light is great quality. Handy phone holder also. 3 settings with ability to dim and brighten for desired light. Would recommend!
4,Good ring light  does the job
1,Mine didn't come with a tripod stand so abit disappointed really as to why it didn't as it stated it did. Can only sit it on my dressing table and on there it's not stable as it slips then falls over it's quite small so not sure why other people are saying it stands round 5ft. Not very sturdy and tends to be quite wobbly. The little legs on it can't take the weight of the light or even the phone. Wished I had of shopped around before buying as I'm definitely not happy with what I've got. The only good point is the light is of a good brightness but tends to get quite hot so I'm abit cautious of using it now. Unless you want very cheap flimsy quality I would spend your money else where. UPDATED!!
1,Artikel sehr wackelig und instabil.
5,Great stand with lights to use for making video or even make up.Often I use this as a light in the room :)
5,This product is for use with a mobile phone camera for the recording of indoor videos. Quickly assembled with 3 degrees of light intensity it is perfect for the job.
3,The product is ok but I thought the lights would be brighter.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Super Teil. Nicht nur zum Bloggern sonder auch seine Kreativit√§t ausleben zu lassen. Bei uns flackern es ab und zu bei h√∂chster Helligkeitsstuffe aber es kann auch an den Netzteil liegen.
5,This is definitely a brilliant quality for the price. Great for taking pics filming vlogging! The instructions where easy to follow and set up is quick
3,Terrible tripod thing barely stands up broke my phone trying to use it don't bother buying the cheaper one spend a bit more and get a decent tripod
4,Happy with product
5,This is a fantastic light the brightness was great compared to a different brand ring light that I previously had. The different options in colour and brightness are great - it really makes a difference when trying to get the perfect lighting.
1,If you adjust the legs to try and raise the height the legs will slowly space out therefore causing the entire thing to collapse in the middle of recording. It happened to me and as a result of this It spilled my glass of water all over my keyboard and earphones I had to replace them since they broke. The legs are really bad.
5,Fantastic item great fun
2,Beim Zusammenbauen fiel sofort auf dass die Halterung f√ºrs Handy defekt war ‚Äì keine Arretierung m√∂glich. Das Handy konnte also in keine feste Wunschposition gebracht werden.Trotzdem habe ich das Licht neugierig noch schnell mit meiner Webcam getestet die ich einfach auf die herunttergeklappte Handyhalterung gestellt habe. Ich fand die Ergebnisse entt√§uschend: Bei keiner der Lichtfarbeneintellungen wirkte die Hautfarbe nat√ºrlich.Bin mal wieder erstaunt wie so ein Produkt so viele positive Bewertungen bekommen konnte.
5,It‚Äôs amazing I like all the different lights. It‚Äôs easy to use and travel with.I also like how it‚Äôs easy to pack away and it has instructions on how to put it together etc.
3,Das Licht ist gut der Standfu√ü ist nicht stabil und h√§lt leider nicht bei Einstellung
3,Good colour and brightness but not very stable
4,Well packaged delivered on time and perfect for recording courses. Would recommend.
2,Gutted I really wanted to like this light. The light setting and brightness is brilliant and I can‚Äôt fault the light in any way. It‚Äôs does exactly what I want it to. HOWEVER the stand on the other hand is flimsy and doesn‚Äôt take the weight of my iPhone causing it to collapse and fall over Cracking the screen on my phone. Luckily it has a glass cover. Really really disappointed!
5,I bought this to help with participating on line with my phone camera. It works well although it‚Äôs a little frustrating that the LED light reflects back at the camera from the lenses in my glasses - my fault for wearing glasses though! Technically perfect.
5,Got it as a present for my daughter she spends hours with this each day taking pictures and recording video's on her phone. Gives me hours of peace and quiet so 5 stars from me !
5,Brightness of this light was good very east to assemble and use. Customer service is brilliant
5,Didn‚Äôt expect this to be as good as it is for the price! The tripod is small but this product is great overall!
5,Granddaughter loves it  I personally can't say much about the product. But if my granddaughter loves it  it must be ok
5,This has be extremely useful for me. Its not very tall but that makes it practical to transport everywhere
5,I initially bought this light in August but there was an issue with the product however the seller quickly got in touch with me to offer a replacement straight away . I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it for photography selfies and videos to add that high quality finishing touch.
5,Great value for money. Better than I expected.Good selection of light brightness/tone.Legs could be a bit stronger but for the money it‚Äôs absolutely great.
5,It is a very good purchase. You can take it anywhere as it is a usb powered light. A must-buy!
5,a great ring light! has two different colour settings (warm and cool) and can adjust the brightness of the light so easily. comes with clear assembly instructions and has a handy phone stand built in! great product!
5,This is a great product. I mount my Logitech C920 webcam onto this for live streaming and it is of great quality. It is very short so it needs to be placed on a surface of some sort.
5,Love this! Has 3 warmth settings for the light and many brightnesses easy to put together and works perfectly !! Would recommend
5,Bright light and sturdy. Good value for money.
3,Incredibly flimsy tripod can barely hold my phone (huwawai p30 pro) without falling. And can only hold phone in landscape.
2,War nach eine Woche schon kaputt
5,Only just tried it out seems like a really nice light good quality at a very reasonable price sturdy base bright light. The only thing I was debating about losing a star is the actual phone holder seems slightly flimsier than the rest. Decided to leave it at 5 stars as the positives out weigh.
5,Brought as a gift arrived promptly and looked as it should. As it is for a birthday present it hasn‚Äôt been used yet
5,Product is amazing no doubt for the price I paid but their customer service is 10 out of 10. I bought ring light for my lash extension station. It‚Äôs very light weighted and easy to carry as well. Very professional value customers and their opinions well impressed.
5,Brought this for my daughter for Xmas. She loves it!! Wish I had a got a bigger one but overall this is great!
2,Having read the reviews on this product I requested it for Christmas. It‚Äôs fiddly to put together and doesn‚Äôt stand in place so saying it‚Äôs pathetic would be quite kind. The tripod needs to be considerably stronger. The light itself however is ok. I‚Äôm on the search for a better product.
5,So bright just what I was looking for and such a handy size for my dressing table and was delivered before due date
5,Arrived in great condition easy to set up and good range of settings (in terms of colour and brightness levels). Only thing I wish is that there was a larger tripod option.
5,This is a very good ring light the brightness is excellent
5,Great little product.  The only downside is that I was expecting the stand to get taller - but I hadn't read the description properly - that's my fault not the product
3,Stativ ist leider Mist. Das Licht an sich ist ok.
5,Very nice for the price. Has definitely come in handy.
5,Product was purchased a christmas present so hasn't been fully tested.I've plugged it in to make sure it works and checked it over.Seems very sturdy and the brightness is great and can also be changed to different setting and different colour of light to suit your preference.O
3,This is ok but I struggle with the legs slipping and the phone holder is difficult to secure.
4,Staff helped a lot and would recommend this
2,1. Can tell product has already been used. Ring light has few scratches. Some pieces were already mantled together (incorrectly!). Really upset its been used as you pay a full price for a brand new item.2. Flimsy not strong enough to hold the ring light3. Turned off in 20 minutesHowever the light itself is good. I would have not bought this given what i know now.
3,Love it
3,Good enough but glitchy. Phone can only be held in landscape which isn‚Äôt helpful. Quite fragile but ok for the money
5,Sturdy light ring easy to assemble. 3 light colours. Fits perfectly on my side table.
5,Used this to film videos for my students that are currently home learning arrived same day easy to assemble and use!
5,Would recommend to anyone! Perfect size and three brightness settings!  Love the size easy to travel with
5,Sehr zufrieden: Helligkeit und T√∂ne lassen sich gut einstellen und mit dem Magic Arm dank dem Standardgewinde super am Mikrost√§nder anbringen.
5,Great product I use for zoom meetings
5,Exactly what it says holds phone very well tripod legs can be a little unstable so its best to make sure its fully balanced before leaving go. But once stable its perfect.
4,Loved my purchase exactly as described
2,I haven't use it till recently. Bought it to take pictures with Iphone 12 max pro. it didn't hold the phone and it falls down more than once. if the time of the return hasn't passed I would definitely return it.
5,Excellent light only downside is it‚Äôs a very small tripod but not a problem if it‚Äôs sitting on dressing table etc and can buy a stand to accommodate otherwise
5,Amazing product! East set up and does exactly what I need it to do - thank you!
5,Does exactly what I expected to boost lighting around home office desk. Easy to set up and operate. Good value for money.
5,This is great really bright and great for selfiesYouTube videos and home work video callsGreat quality very impressed
5,Highly recommend. Works really well for the video meetings
5,So good the only problem was I have a iPhone XR and my phone didn‚Äôt fit in the phone holder but apart from that it was really good :)
3,It dosent keep the charge it works only when I plug it !! What to do ?
5,good value for money
5,Face recognition good.  Quite easy to assemble however I may have for it wrong as it keeps collapsing.
5,This is an excellent light for product photographs selfies and to create an ambient light setting. Great price point too.
5,Works surprisingly well for cheap ring light. I mounted mine in a tripod.
5,Even with everything happening atm this product arrived the day after i had ordered it (didn‚Äôt pay for extra delivery or anything like that) such a good light for your desk. Worth the money! X
5,Sorgt f√ºr ein tolles und gleichm√§√üiges Licht in verschiedenen T√∂nen und Stufen!Nicht nur super f√ºr Selfies- ich nutze es au√üerdem zum Drehen von Homeschooling-Videos und Zeichen-Tutorials.
2,Weak stand  wish I didn‚Äôt get it  the light quality is not too bad  but doesn‚Äôt hold the phone  easy to set up
5,An useful tool if your room is dark and if you spend a lot of time to video chat or if you are a youtuber or streamer.
5,Great product had a little difficulty getting the light to come on but I contacted the seller and he very quickly helped me out. Turns out there was nothing wrong with the light  I was just operating the switch incorrectly.
5,So simple gives a front light you can choose fresh 3 settings takes 10 years off
5,The warm light adds some colour in your face rather than looking washed-out. Easy to use.
5,Great item. So easy to use my daughter uses it for make up and tiktoks she loves it
5,Love this light! Ordered it yesterday and it came today easy to assemble and bright the phone holder is very sturdy too. Definitely worth how much you pay
1,Leider ist das Teil nach 2 Monaten schon kaputt. Das Licht flackert in guten Momenten nochmal kurz auf aber das hat es nach kurzen Lebenszeichen auch aufgegeben.Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung selbst f√ºr EUR 20 kann man eine l√§ngere Lebensdauer erwarten.Daumen runter ‚Ä¶.
5,Sehr gut
1,Was very happy initially until it started switching off by itself. I changed the plug and that wasn‚Äôt the problem. I then went to unplug it and it was extremely hot! Very disappointed waste of money.
3,Its a good product but its a little flimsy
5,Bought as a gift and it is loved. Great settings and options.
5,Absolutely love this! So easy to put together and is perfect for my Instagram photos! Good size for my dressing table and I love how many different settings there is.
5,Now look human again in my zoom meetings. Brilliant little thing. Arrived quickly well packaged easy to assemble. I keep it on my desk for when I am on work video calls.
2,Bought this as a gift unfortunately the tripod part can't even sustain the weight of its own light...much less with a phone attached. Tried over and over but we couldnt get it to stand without tipping over (without a phone on). Had to buy a different one in the end but by then it was too late to return. Avoid.
5,Arrived promptly. did what it was meant to do. neat compact and effective. Id recommend.
5,I bought this when I started my own skin care and beauty company to use for live streaming and it's amazing  very easy to use and set up
3,Super Licht gut einstellbar. Das Stativ ist allerdings etwas wackelig.
3,Great light but dodgy electrics. Had blown 2 plugs so I‚Äôve have to stop using it.
2,Not quite sure what to even do with this as it turns off every 10 minutes and overheats? I‚Äôm using it with a regular plug in the socket and now I don‚Äôt even know what to do. I would of rather of spent the money on buying a more expensive ring light that works. won‚Äôt be buying again.
5,Absolutely brilliant value for money.. Highly recommend.. Love it.. Will be purchasing in the future for friends and family! :)
5,I really like the product. It is easy to use and I find it easy to use the different settings. It‚Äôs bright and works well for my makeup pictures. Only thing is I wish it had a better stand as the legs are quite thin but seems sturdy. Recommend
5,I love this ring light help me so much with product pictures.
5,Gef√§llt mir sehr
5,Love the Ring light it‚Äôs for my daughter and she is very happy.
5,This is great for those zoom / face time calls on the evening gives a lovely brightness.
5,This ring light is fab !! Really bright great for taking photos ! Very comparable to ring lights which are much more expensive !! I highly recommend it !!
5,Just so simple and surprisingly good light with blue or warm light too.
5,It is a very bright light perfect for applying make ect. Sellers discription was spot on unfortunately not sutible for photography as it attaches to phone and not a camera. Seller refunded with no hassle would highly recommend.
3,The stand is unsturdy  but it‚Äôs good aside from that
5,Worked great with my iPhone XS Max was able to quickly record videos with nice lighting.I used an external battery pack to power the ring light worked nice and made everything very mobile.Simple ring light cheap does it‚Äôs job.
2,Does the ring light have a timescale on how long it stays on? Because I was using it and after around 10 minutes it automatically turns off. I don‚Äôt like that if I‚Äôm recording a video I need it to stay on
5,Easy to setup
5,This ring light is fantastic. I place it behind my laptop for great lighting on Zoom calls.
5,I used this to take abroad for a Make up job on a bride  it was perfect especially for a badly lit hotel room .Works great  so easy to carry and use .Would recommend to anyone üëçüèº
5,Great light for doing make up. Also great for video calls  turn down the brightness for a warm glow to your face .
5,Great item no problem at all recommend to friends and family
1,Worked for 20 minutes then just switched off and broke
1,This product has been temperamental since purchase becoming EXTREMELY hot to the touch after use flickering on and off and when checked the USB was bent and loose inside.I have used this product around 5 times and the light is now compltely broken will not turn on and has a very dangerous USB socket.Unusable FIRE HAZARD
5,I got the product delivered in Stockholm in less than a week.Product works great just exactly the same as per product description.Really recommend this one!
2,The whole reason I ordered this specific ring light was to film using my phone however the part to attach my phone will not attach to the light as the plastic has all eroded
1,I received my product and it was easy to assemble the lighting was fab especially with the different settings but the light doesn‚Äôt actually stay on for longer than 2 minutes and then I can‚Äôt use it. What is the point of a light that can‚Äôt even stay on for a period of time??
2,The tripod is unstable for the size of the ring light. The light was good until it fell over. The bulb gave out after 2 months. This may have been because of the effect of falling over.
5,Bought for may sister apparently she is happy with that
5,Great gift
1,It shakes it rattles I have an iPhone mini and it could barley hold the weight if it the light is awful it feels tacky it feels very cheap would not recommend this
5,Purchased as a gift for my best friend. She loves it
5,Great product and great customer service  this first ring light didn't work so they sent me replacement very fast too worth money
5,Not had any problems with it. It‚Äôs really good
5,I used it for making a video at night with my phones camera and it was lovely. Just try not to have any reflective surfaces behind you such as screens though.
5,Bright light and good size ring works well with iPhone
5,Daughter loves it good for putting makeup on and vlogging
5,Really good for a great value price
5,Use a webcam with  PC  software  for aura photos  sometimes if the light is poor it's difficult to get a well-defined photothis product does the job well for a very reasonable price.
1,it kept flickering and when i went to go unplug it i burnt my finger on the plug horrible product i hardly even used it. dont even bother buying this its so unsafe :(
5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It can sit on her dressing table or stand in the floor. It is very bright and worth the money.
5,My daughters birthday present hours of fun.
1,Bought this for my daughter and was really not impressed with this product at all - whilst easy to assemble the overall quality is awful the legs are very flimsy and once you put a phone (iPhone x)  into the holder (can only use landscape not portrait) the whole thing collapses as the legs cannot be fixed. So need to hold the frame when taking a picture which defeats the point. The actual phone folder also moves around despite it being tightened. Would not recommend as not at all fit for purpose.
5,Brilliant. Quick delivery and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up
5,Fab
5,The light is very handy to do my daily make up there was a part missing on the order but the team fixed the issue quickly and efficiently. Love it
3,I would have given this product more stars if it‚Äôs stand was sturdier!
5,I bought it for my Youtube Channel since the wintertime gets darker earlier so this light is so useful to make my room brighter which is perfect for selfie and video! Would recommend üíó
5,Love everything about this light  really good size easy to assemble and a lot of light options. I use mine for both makeup and just to use as a lamp in the nights on the dimmest options.
5,100% recommend! Easy to put together and so bright and all three settings are different and fun! Fits my phone perfectly too.
5,It arrived quickly and works very well with multiple lighting functions.
5,great product for a small office desk brightens up for my zoom calls etc
5,Various light settings for different effects. Great for any YouTuber/Tik Toker etc.  Daughter found it really easy to use.  Flattering light for selfies and videos.
5,I‚Äôm really impressed the light works really well I brought for doing YouTube videos and I must say it makes a big difference to the videos. It‚Äôs easy to put together I really like it
2,Excellent lighting but i expected the tripod stand to be longer. It's more of a Desktop/makeup desk studio ring light rather than a recording for TikTok type of ring light. Disappointed with this purchase.
5,I've used this a couple of times for my cake photos and I'm so glad I bought it. üíØ
1,Anything that it plugs into a second later will shut down for a good 10 minutes I hate it however the lighting is good
5,Very nice and the light change is awesome
5,would buy again. light is great. . One thing is it is not super steady the tripod itself easily falls.however overall good
5,Nice lights for recording videos or selfies. Bought it as I thought it comes with the stand as it says on the reviews but it didn't...
1,Only used this twice and it won‚Äôt turn in. Clearly faulty cable as  the usb connector is loose. Avoid
5,It was delivered promptly is packaged very nicely is easy to set up and is exactly as described. Great purchase - makes quite the difference in photos and filming!
5,Amazing light very easy to assemble and my photos and videos look gorgeous i absolutely love it it‚Äôs worth every penny
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Very nice ring light - unpacking and setting up is easy to do - also if you have no desk lamp this is perfect :-)
5,Easy to put together & works!
2,The only issues I have with this tripod are the legs don‚Äôt stay still they slip and spread apart. So when trying to take self tapes it makes it difficult for it to stay in place.
1,I brought 2 of these lights and both keep shutting off after only being on for a couple of mins. It's impossible to use either of them . So disappointed
5,Light works perfectly love the different light settings. Easy to assmemble as long as you read the instructions first lol!
5,Easy to set up! Really bright love it
5,Leider mit Handy nicht immer so gut standhaft aber  Preis-Leistung passt
5,Easy to use took some time to assemble but it wasn‚Äôt too hard.Good value for money would recommend ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2,This I bought for my 8yr old. Suitable for her. I wouldn‚Äôt say I would recommend for serious buisness as it‚Äôs really really flimsy . It‚Äôs a table tripod too not a tall one.
5,Really impressed with this especially for the price it‚Äôs so easy to set up and makes pictures/videos look great! I would highly recommend
2,It‚Äôs good quality but every 10 mins when I‚Äôm using it it decides to turn off? Which means I can‚Äôt use it for going live and doing my makeup? It‚Äôs pointless having it when it turns off every few mins
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I would like to recommend this ring light. I have been using it for few months . Brightness 10/10 . Durability 10/10 . And it can change colors as well.
5,Bought this to improve the look of my face when on work conference calls on laptop. Works brilliantly so far
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†F√ºr mich die beste Ringleuchte √ºberhaupt.Kam sehr gut verpackt an alles dabei wie beschrieben. Das Licht ist dimmbar die h√∂chste Stufe ist sehr sehr hell. An sich Ein super Teil w√ºrde es auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen.
3,The light itself is amazing but the part that holds the phone falls off all the time
5,Das Ringlicht ist sehr hell und kann in drei unterschiedlichen Lichtfarben scheinen und dabei auch abgedunkelt werden. Das Ringlicht ist aus Plastik mit einem Metall-Dreibein was einstellbar ist. Ne Handyhalterung gibt es auch dazu.
5,Such a good ring light!
5,Great quality and bright LEDs. Not much hight adjustment though.
2,The ring light is great.. it only lasts for around 5 minutes before it cuts out though. Can‚Äôt find contact seller option to find out why.
5,I would personally recommend this to others and I can‚Äôt stop using it hahha thanks so much xx
2,It‚Äôs decent light but you need a plug that‚Äôs like 12w to use it busted my 10w one!!Label said use 10+ it means 10 should have been enough
1,Works for about 5 minutes then turns itself off and won‚Äôt turn back on. It‚Äôs great when it does work but it only lasts a few mins.
5,I bought this for my daughter she is very happy with it. It gives a good daylight effect to photos and videos
5,Great lighting on it
5,Product was very good value for money. Light settings where perfect.  Stand very sturdy
5,My daughter loves this product

5,Easy to assemble my phone fits in without being squeezed too hard and it's very bright!
5,This light is a very bright great wee light. The phone holder part doesn‚Äôt sit in as tight as i‚Äôd Like but this is very minor and my kids are enjoying using it aswell #thumbsupfromme
5,Excellent value- great for illuminating you for online meetings
5,My selfies and lives are so much better now with this ring light
5,Easy to assemble and use with lots of levels of brightness
2,Good light strength but my gosh it hardly balances. Have to adjust it 100 times before it stays standing
5,This is just perfect for my makeup and photos . The phone holder i dont use .it doesn't look very strong either but i dont care .It does the job xx
5,It‚Äôs really beautiful great quality the light is powerful .
5,Shipping was really quick! Light is easy to set up and use no complaints. It‚Äôs really bright too
5,fine
5,What can i say amazing allrounder for my makeup and nails wish i had got one sooner. Better late than never ha
2,Well my phone kept falling everywhere and it keeps over heating and turning on and off but it also spawned a le monke in my room and it won‚Äôt leave I keep asking my mum to get rid off it but she won‚Äôt
5,Mir gef√§llt das Ringricht sehr gut. Ich benutze es um mich zu schminken und Fotos aufzunehmen. Eine perfekt Beleuchtung die ich jedem Empfehlen kann.
5,Perfect thank you
5,Use it for video recordings.
5,Really great light. Good quality. Easy to assemble. Nice metal stand. Plus 3 light settings. Perfect
5,Came rlly fasteasy to use and helping alot for someone who's making video.
5,Easy to assemble easy to use like it enjoying my new videos and photos. Good quality
5,Work.
5,Excellent product with great delivery
5,Superschnelle Lieferung. Wesentlich besser als erwartet. Bin begeistert von dem Teil. Ich kann es nur weiterempfehlen.
5,Great size and qualityVery quick delivery
1,The price is cheap but the quality is also badFirstly the tripod does not stay up if the phone is attached to the light. The legs are too loose and slip apartSecondly the area to hold the phone is very flimsy.All together bad and would not risk using this with my phone as it already dropped my phone once!The light aspect of is good but construction is cheap and poor
5,Bought this as doing some music recordings and I wanted to look prettier. Worked a treat
1,I don‚Äôt often write reviews but I am so disappointed in this product. Initially I was thrilled as the first two settings were great and then I got to the last - which only a quarter of the light lights up. It also bleeds onto one of the other light settings.The camera holder fell apart within seconds of trying to set it up. Thankfully the return policy with Amazon is so easy and I‚Äôm not out money from purchasing this. Perhaps I just got unlucky with a defective product. I‚Äôve a cheaper ring light that works beautifully but wanted something that was bigger. Very unfortunate.
5,Great product. Could be a bit more easy to set up and position phone. Other than that good value for money
5,So quick and great product
2,Not great quality. Legs are too easily moved and therefore wobbly and easily knocked off position. Every time phoned is attached or taken off you have to reset the legs.
5,Amazing product I'm. Working makeup artist and this is small and light to carry with my kit. The light is so bright and on dark mornings it is perfect! The price point is so good for the quality. I would highly recommend
5,Amazing better than I thought well worth the money ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5,Bought for a sibling who is extremely happy with it. Better light quality than her mirror bulb array
5,The brightness settings are good
5,Habe dieses Ringlicht meiner Tochter geschenkt. F√ºr Teenager optimal.. Selfis video usw :) es macht ein sehr sch√∂nes bild.
2,Mine broke extremely easily and it‚Äôs not very sturdy great brightness but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Super Ringlight toll f√ºr Selfies und Videos schneller Aufbau und die Helligkeit/Farbe kann man auch √§ndern. Zu empfehlen üëçüèº
5,Lighting is great
5,Quick  delivery and great product!  Packaged well with instructions too
5,It was great especially for video calls working from home
2,Can someone help me please why does my ring light not stay up ? Also no intructions in my box
2,Good brightness but after having used this for just over a month the legs are starting to collapse. On a few occasions the ring light has just fallen flat on the table.
3,Partly didnt worm
5,Super sch√∂nes Ringlicht mit unterschiedlichem Licht welches sich per Knopfdruck einstellen l√§sst. Ist toll in der Handhabung! Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Quite a few different settings and worked well.
5,Perfect for the money I paid. Great for sitting in your dressing table while doing hair and make up!
2,Camera fine in general but legs are very poor quality and falls over if you aren't careful to make sure nothing touches it
2,Worked4 a while then went off
5,Amazing product and a bargain price.
1,Die Stabilit√§t des Stativs ist nicht gegeben. Das Handy ist so weit vorn angesetzt dass das ganze Ger√ºst nach vorn kippt. Zus√§tzlich kommt hinzu dass die Schrauben schlecht verarbeitet sind sodass man die Gelenke nicht fest verschrauben kann. Es ist also nicht m√∂glich das Handy in die Gew√ºnschte Position zu bringen.Das einzig gute daran ist dass das Licht funktioniert die Farben einfach gewechselt werden k√∂nnen und auch gut dimmbar sind.
5,Great value for money! I purchased it as an additional light for photo stand at the party and everyone loved it.
5,Works well
5,Love this product
1,Bought for live-streams and videos this light is a nice brightness however I only took it out the box yesterday and the first time I‚Äôve used it was less than 24 hours after unboxing it a screw threaded the stand collapsed and the buttons on the control stopped working before they were used a second time... yesterday when I inboxed it and tested it the buttons were fine now it‚Äôs one brightness and hardly stands... the phone bracket also fell off with my phone in it! Not very well designed and very poor structure.
5,Better than i expected for the price! Lots of different light settings looks great and easy to use. Definitely recommend!
5,Very satisfied
5,Easy to use
5,Fantastic ring light it really does as it says and is really easy to use my 11 year old loves using it for her videos etc .
5,Super ger√§tSehr helle ledsSuper f√ºr Video aufzunehmen
5,Love it
2,Unfortunately the light isn‚Äôt as bright as expected and the tripod legs can‚Äôt take the weight of a phone and usually collapses so isn‚Äôt worth the risk of the phone getting damaged
1,I assembled the light which is simple enough however I used this lamp one time and during the time it was switched on it just went off there was nothing I could do to get it to turn back on again. Had to return for a refund. Seemed like a great product at first and if it didn't break on the first use it would have been perfect for what I needed it for. Incredibly disappointed with this product and i have no idea what caused it to stop working.
5,Really easy to use and works wonderfuly
5,Really good for videos or even just selfies.  Good size.
5,Great product! Love how you can change the lighting
5,Pleased with purchase .. does the job perfectly when self taping.
5,Love this light daughter alsoLoves it for her TikToks!
5,Excellent
5,I am in love with this table ring light. You can carry it in your handbag and easy to assemble.
5,Daughter absolutely loves this item she uses it to get ready for work as a beautician in mornings.
5,Large light very bright. Small problem resolved very quickly - great customer service.
5,Man ist einfach gut zu sehen ....prima Teil f√ºr online Unterricht
5,perfect light for taking selfies and doing makeup!
1,The light switches off itself after being on for a while
5,Good quality and fast delivery.
5,Tolles Produkt. Man kann damit super Fotos machen und ist einfach in der Bedienung.
5,Produkt hat eine gute Qualit√§t
1,I bought this to help with lighting for my work calls.It worked for approx 2 hours and then broke on the first use. I have reached out for a refund but not heard anything and its been over a month now. Very disappointed to say the least.
2,Licht Qualit√§t sehr gut handling einfach leider St√§nder wackelig und instabil kippt gerne um.
5,Meine Tochter hat sich gefreut.
5,Ehrlich gesagt habe ich f√ºr den Preis nicht viel erwartet jedoch bin sehr positiv √ºberrascht vom Produkt.3 Farbstile w√§hlbar und in 10 stufen Helligkeits einstellung.
2,I can‚Äôt put my phone in portrait mode using this and that‚Äôs what I bought it for.The light is really good tho!
5,sehr gute Qualit√§t.
5,Einfach spitze
5,Cooles Geschenk f√ºr meine Tochter  funktioniert und jede Menge Zubeh√∂r.
5,Arrived  very quickly and it‚Äôs easy  to use
1,I‚Äôll start at the first time I got the item definitely really bright and easy but then after a few hours it began to play up when I turned it on it wouldn‚Äôt come on or when it was on it wouldn‚Äôt last for no more than 10 seconds before it switched off again honestly so upsetting I will have to return it
5,Boss using it right now great product
2,This turned up damaged? So disappointed as had good reviews
5,Es ist toll das Licht ist sehr gut.
2,The product is fine but it's legs are not strong enough to support the ring...so it is inclined to become inclined....and fall over.
5,Super easy to use! Very bright! Glad I purchased!
5,Great for what I use which is painting miniatures in the evening and filming
5,Exactly as described. Great product I will order again!
5,der LED Ring passt perfekt und kann f√ºr Video Calls f√ºr gutes Licht sorgen !
5,Ich bin begeistert  macht richtig sch√∂ne Fotos üòç Licht ist einstellbar.W√ºrde ich echt weiterempfehlen üëç
5,Very good broke very quick though
5,Ich bin total begeistert üòçDas Ringlicht ist super .Ich kann es mit gutem Gewissen weiterempfehlen.
2,Seemed to work well however sadly it broke after a couple of times of using it. Not as robust as I needed.
5,Value for money and a fantastic light
1,Absolute rubbish.  Cant take the weight of a phone the phone holder slips off the light all the time no matter how tight you make it. The light itself is fine i guess but I purchased it to have zoom calls with and if the phone cant stay attached then yo me its as good as useless.  I am not one for writing Amazon reviews but in this case I felt compelled to.
5,Super simple to use and very High level of function I like it
5,Perfect little light
5,Qualit√§t super f√ºr den Preis
2,Doesn‚Äôt look like the product on the image shown. Wrong parts given and not enough parts provided.No one to contact.NOT HAPPY AT ALL WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.
5,Mega schnelle Lieferung einfacher Aufbau praktisch auch f√ºr unterwegs muss jede Frau zum perfekten Schminken haben
1,Absolute bag of crap.  Flimsy breaks really easy and the parts are just not well made or cleaned up.  Sharp bits of metal sticking out which should have been filed down.
5,Works perfect. Really worth it
2,Turns off after 3 mins most
5,Excellent product works really well
5,F√ºr Streaming bestens geeignet!
1,Just arrived today and it doesn‚Äôt work:( how can I return it back for refund ?
1,Does not work! Waste of money
1,I never leave reviews but I will for this one. Very bad product. Very flimsy and not even strong enough to hold a smart phone. Will have to use another tripod behind it for the smart phone. Look for something stronger this is not it.
5,Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.
1,HiI ordered this light ring because of numerous good reviews.However the quality is very poor.1) The product is not stable; the legs don't hold at all it's impossible to use it for videos.2) it fell off the table (because of the problem nr. 1) and immediately brokeI am very unhappy with this purchase.
2,I think my item has a missing piece because the tripod just wont stand it keeps slipping
1,Its been just over a month since i purchased this. Initially i thought ok great  bright light and its perfect. However today my light stopped working!! Yesterday spent half toe morning looking through the reviews and checking youtube for any hacks. We ended up changing the fuse!!!! Today the stand keeps tilting and the light will not stand on its 3 unsturdy legs. The ball joint keeps tilting and its just broken! Im just so annoyed at this point. Can you sort out a replacement please!
5,Boughtbas a gift for my other half and she loves it!
5,Ok üëå
2,The product turned off after 20 minutes of use and don‚Äôt come back on.
5,Fantastic light. My daughter loved this for Christmas x
5,Worth every single penny paid. Powerful lighting and photos look very professional.
1,Product was rly good easy to put together and warmth of light was nice and different options. However I only used it once with recommended plug and it blew the plug and burnt out the power so is now unusable and has broken my plug. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
5,Excellent product. This works perfectly on my phone and allows me to take the perfect professional pic
5,Great light that has 10 brightness settings
1,Second time purchasing this ring light and it unfortunately it switches itself off after around 10 minutes of use. I have used multiple usb plugs incase that was the issue and even repurchased to see if it was a one off but unfortunately it is not.
1,This lamp does not stand up properly and regularly disconnects from the power source despite being plugged in so I have to replug it back in frequently. I'm attempting to return it as it's a very poorly made product.
5,Daughter is very pleased with it.
5,Easy to use my daughter loves it
5,I love this ring light it has different light settings a mini stand perfect for your desk!!!
1,Am liebsten w√ºrde ich 0 Sterne geben. St√§nder h√§lt nicht richtig f√§llt andauernd um. Sehr schade!
5,make up
1,Worked for a day and suddenly just stopped working turned itself off and won‚Äôt switch back on.
5,Absolutely amazing !!!!! Quick delivery so good for money! Thank you so much.
1,zwei mal bekommen beides mal nicht zuverl√§ssig (f√§llt regelm√§√üig einfach aus). Nur wenig Helligkeit man muss schon nah ran an die Lampe mit dem Gesicht damit das Licht funktioniert. Kein Wunder dass im Text keine Lichtleistung angegeben ist.
1,Well packagedEasy to useUnfortunately the light seems to going off for no reason.I have purchased new adaptors tried different sockets to no avail.Quite disappointed really as seems like such great value for money - have i just got a faulty one??
2,This was great and then the end of the lead started to break and now it won‚Äôt come on!
5,Very pleased with this!
1,Bought this a month and few weeks ago I‚Äôve only used it a few times and it has stopped working.. return window has passed i would have simply returned it..
1,The lights on the light ring didn‚Äôt work. It also wasn‚Äôt fit for purpose as the tripod legs were too lightweight to stay in place when the phone was attached to the bracket so kept sliding and falling over. Had to return for a refund.
1,At first this seemed like a great deal and was working fine we used the correct voltage plug and all was good. Until it suddenly it gave out and tripped. Now it won‚Äôt stay on at all and I have no way to contact the seller as it doesn‚Äôt seem clear. Very very frustrated
5,Fantastic
1,Unfortunately the screw that joins the phone clamp to the stand completely disintegrated the plastic literally crumbled away after a few uses and there seems no way to contact the seller to get a replacement part.  The tripod legs are loose and uneven so if you get the tilt in the right position one of the legs will slip and make it off level again.
1,Bought this light for makeup. It‚Äôs perfect except it keeps turning off after 5 mins. I have to turn off at the switch for a couple of mins then back on! I am not sure if my item is faulty or if it‚Äôs the the design?
1,My product came USED. Everything was fine but the part that attaches the light to the stand was COVERED in scratches as if someone attempted to attach it and gave up. NOT VERY COVID SAFE - I was not expected to get a scratched up used product.
5,Amazing ring light for the price 3 different settings and dimmable
2,The light is very weak and doesn‚Äôt seem to make much difference to the lighting
5,Good product my daughter loves it
2,Doesn‚Äôt stand well and keeps falling.. although the light is good
1,It‚Äôs no longer working. It was working perfectly fine the first time I used it. However the second time  the ring light stopped working.
5,Brilliant
1,Really disappointed with my ring light. It won‚Äôt stay up it slides down and the light stops after about 10 minutes and then won‚Äôt turn back on for approx half an hour. I can‚Äôt afford another one. I‚Äôve tried to super glue it together with no luck.
5,Perfect I love it!
5,Amazing!! Exactly what I was expecting
1,The clip to hold my phone in place was completely the wrong fitting. I spent ages thinking it was me who just didn't know how these things were put together before finally realising I'd not been sent the correct part.It completely ruined the reason I bought the item in the first place which was to film an urgent self-tape. Consequently I had to blu-tak my phone to the light.Avoid this item at all costs.
1,Got a couple of good uses but the light no longer comes on fully and the stand doesn‚Äôt work as expected.
5,great light
1,Doesn‚Äôt work properly and turns it by itself.Heat‚Äôs up very quickly and quality is very bad not worth it.Don‚Äôt buy it waste of money!!Ring light not standing stay very fragile and bad quality.
5,cool
1,The product turned up with rust on it. Not what I expected. Did not test all the other features as it wasn‚Äôt worth my time putting it together. Very disappointed as it‚Äôs an Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù
2,Average quality but did the job
1,This item did not work plugged directly into the mains with correct charger etc.
1,Sehr schlecht √ºberhaupt nicht gute Qualit√§t es sieht wie eine Spielzug aus . Preis sehr hoch . Kann man gleiches von andere Gesch√§ft kaufen f√ºr 8 Euro . Sehr klein und nicht stabil. Deswegen w√ºrde zur√ºck geschickt
5,Nice just as seen
2,Ziemlich unstabil....
1,I didn‚Äôt think that this product was described very clearly of exactly what you was getting depending on what option you chose. What I thought I was getting I didn‚Äôt receive so I was returning anyway but when I plugged it in it didn‚Äôt even work so 1000% won‚Äôt both purchasing the one that I actually need
1,Unfortunately this ring light is faulty only two of the light filters work and the brightness doesn't alter. I shall be returning this faulty product. Very disappointed.
1,It turns itself off and the plug is ON FIRE after two minutes of being plugged in. Dangerous!I‚Äôve just seen another review similar saying the same thing. It‚Äôs a shame because I really wanted one but petrified to leave it on!
1,Nach Erhalt der Ware habe ich gelesen dass vor der Verwendung von Steckdosenladern abgeraten wird.Als ich es nach dem Einschalten dimmen wollte reagierte es weder auf + noch auf -.Nicht zu empfehlen.Ich habe es zur√ºckgeschickt
1,I thought it would be easy to jus quickly set up and go - have to fiddle around with it already broken now only have the light - where to stand it god knows.
1,Unfortunately I still have not been able to assemble correctly so have not used it therefore waste of money.
1,Das Licht ist ok aber sobald das Telefon im Halter ist sacken die Beine vom Stativ in sich zusammen.Das Produkt ist g√ºnstig aber sich rausgeschmissenes Geld. Ich √§rgere mich sehr dar√ºber und w√ºrde es gern zur√ºck geben da es seine Funktion √ºberhaupt nicht erf√ºllt.
1,***Update! The seller has kindly refunded me in full for the faulty ring light ***Hugely disappointed with this purchase. All was good to start with however after just over two months of very light use the light now doesn‚Äôt work. There seems no way of repairing the product so it is destined for the recycling bin. Such a waste of money.
1,When I ordered this the next day it arrived and I opened to packaging to find out the wire was snapped. I wasn‚Äôt happy about this at all. So I do not recommend anyone buying this as the wire is too short too.
5,Great
1,So.. I‚Äôm not entirely happy with product. When placed on the highest setting the ring gets warm to touch and then chips out. I legit had to wait 10-15mins for it to cool down before using it again. This has happened on 3 occasions.Another problem is the tripod not being strong enough to hold my iPhone 11I‚Äôm just not happy overall
5,Great wee product
1,FIREE HAZARD !! USB part broke after 1 week... the whole tripod is flimsy not worth the buy
1,Bought the ring light a week ago and used it for the first time last night I had it on for 5 minutes and now it won‚Äôt turn back on
1,It was easy to assemble but it doesn‚Äôt work. The light doesn‚Äôt turn on anymore after being assembled which is annoying as this was a gift for a friends birthday.
5,Works perfectly
5,Great
1,I bought two of these and both broke only used one of them once and the second one never turned on ! So annoyed
1,Das Ringlicht ist eigentlich ok aber schon nach 2 Wochen kaputt gegangen. Es blitzt noch kurz auf wenn man den On-Schalter bet√§tigt das war's aber dann.
5,Great product
1,The pan which holds the camera is keep on coming off even though I made it tight . Can you please message me to advise how to make this stay in one place. Also legs of the tripod are keep on moving and it‚Äôs just very difficult to keep the whole thing stable
5,I love it. Game changer.
5,Loved it
1,The bracket that holds the phone keeps becoming detached from the ring light I tighten it...it just works itself loose again.  I've tried messaging the seller they keep asking for a photograph of the fault but won't give me an email address to send it to!
5,My daughter loves it.
5,Looked amazing.
1,Mine came broken! I was offered to have it returned but I ended up getting ill and going to hospital and missed the time to return it.
1,This ring light keeps switching off and will not switch back on for a while and I have to plug it into another socket every time this switches off and it's supposedly BRAND NEW.SAVE YOUR MONEY as I need a refund for this faulty ring light.
5,Loved it
5,Very good!
1,My light worked for 10 minuets then turned off and won‚Äôt turn back on! I binned all the packaging as it worked at first!
5,Amazing
5,Great light & service
1,Absolutely terribleEvery time I plug it in it‚Äôs going on and off by itselfDon‚Äôt stay on more then few minVery disappointed
1,This ring light is useless. The legs collapse when trying to use and the phone holder only works on a side angle. I would not recommend this product. Waste of money.
1,Really disappointed after reading all the good reviews but after only using it twice it stopped working in the middle of me using it
1,I loved this when it came a few days ago however halfway through a zoom meeting today it died. Not working at all.
1,V√∂lliger Fehlkauf!! Ich habe es anhand der guten Bewertungen gekauft. Die Halterungen trotz feste zuschrauben - ist locker. Sodass weder das Handy sicher h√§ngt geschweige denn das Ringlicht stehen bleibt! Bin komplett entt√§uscht - daher direkte R√ºcksendung!
1,this product is okay but would not recommend it broke within a month it just stop working
1,Schon nach kurzer Zeit kaputt. Licht hat einen starken Wackelkontakt und l√§sst sich nicht mehr steuern. Qualitativ leider sehr schlecht.
1,Worked great for 4 months then broke suddenly. Half of led's failed. Just before a meeting too thus the one-star.
1,Was very good for use the first couple of times but then suddenly stopped working and wouldn't turn on. Don't recommend.
1,For the money I paid didn't expect the best I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box and the white ring covering the light was broken its too much hassle to send it back a lesson learnt
1,Have to hold the wire in a certain position to keep the light on bright enough setting. Disappointed.
1,Returned. Plus heated up in socket and made noise. Tripod flimsy.
1,Not happy....received the item with only a small part of the light working..needed for an at home photo shoot and was not able to get a replacement sent in time only told to return. Will not be ordering again.
1,Had to bin it after days of use kept switching itself off and plug over heatingNever Again
1,Rubbish broke straightaway  will not hold the weight of a phone
1,Can someone tell me how can I use the ring light with the phone holder. I have given a part that will not allow me to do so. I am seeing all good reviews but I'm definitely not happy.
1,Absolutely shocking quality! Doesn‚Äôt really hold an iPhone XR in place (legs actually collapse) all parts break SO easily with no real use. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this at all.
1,Ich habe diese Ringleuchte als Weihnachtsgeschenk gekauft. Leider funktioniert die Ringleuchte nicht. Da hier sogut wie nur gute Bewertungen sind habe ich mich f√ºr dieses Produkt entschieden.Sehr entt√§uschend...
5,Brilliant for doing videos for work
1,Product arrived and only three quarters of the ring lights up. Stand and fittings very flimsy. I do not recommend this product! The Customer Service email address on the leaflet inside just keeps bouncing back.
1,The tripod legs don‚Äôt lock into place so it falls over constantly DO NOT RECOMMEND
1,Set it up plugged it in and it didnt even work??!!!Faulty lightVery disappointed:(
5,Great ring light
1,This item was faulty on arrival - I have asked for a replacement but not heard back from the seller
1,Came with a part missing.
1,This light is AWFUL only works about 50% of the time and even when it does work randomly turns itself off mid-use.
1,Went off and stopped working after 1st use and won‚Äôt come back on. Not worth it at all!! Was great until it broke!!! Spend extra on one that won‚Äôt break!!
5,Love it!
1,I like the brightness of this product however I found that the phone stand in the middle just falls off even when it‚Äôs been screwed on. I would not buy this again
1,Broke so early it hardly lasted and now finally trying to find an alternative.
1,Very unstable  can't  hold my Samsung  S20.
1,I wouldn't suggest this product at all as you cannot fix it none of the joints has quality parts and your phone will fall all the time. Don't waste your time...
1,Very flimsy and not very bright not worth the money
1,Product does not work as advertised. The remote does not function and the light is permanently on one mode /brightness. I would like to return or get a replacement.
1,Product arrived and does not work at all no power working white ring looks cheap was unclipped from frame not happy with the quality for what was paid
