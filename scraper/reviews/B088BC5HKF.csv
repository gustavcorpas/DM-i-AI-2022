5,I had been using Dell U2415 24' 16:10 aspect ratio monitors.  One died and I tried this Asus.  I am very pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  I'd definitely buy it again and have actually tried to give my wife one of my old Dells to give me an excuse to buy another one of these.  I don't game but it is good to program on write on do amateur stuff in Blender on it and watch videos.  That's what I need.
5,PRO: Picture quality/color--both are great for what I do. I am not a gamer so I cannot comment on that. Power & adjustment buttons are on the front at the bottom edge of the monitor so no more fumbling on the side and guessing if I am hitting the right button. Substantially heavy base. Easily adjust height. Full use of the screen aproximately 1/4" black frame. FAST.CON: Hard copy user manual not included. Cord is standard 6' wish it was longer. Accessory/cable panel is behind and located under a shelf so not easily visible--you have to tip the monitor forward which is heavy and awkward.Great monitor for the price.
4,I wanted to write this and let everyone know that these monitors really are very good.  They come with all the cabling you will need and are very adjustable.  I bought them for the PhotoShop work that I do and wanted something that was color calibrated which I'm sure they are.  However I was under the impression that the monitors would come with software that would allow you to recalibrate the colors.  They DO NOT come with this.  I have created an account on the ASUS website and registered both of them and went to the downloads section of this model and other models of the ProArt display... it's NOT there.  I have also put in a chat support ticket with one of their reps.  I was told basically to go buy a 3rd party calibration tool.  I already have a Spyder but I picked these up because I thought they had their own calibration software either built-in or downloadable.  This is not the case.You can even Google around and find articles that show you how and where to download these tools those pages are gone.If I am wrong I hope an ASUS rep reaches out to me and shows me where to get their software.
5,I use my PC for both Editing and Gaming. This monitor provides a happy middle ground while providing S-Tier color correctness. I am incredibly happy with the color I am getting with this monitor while editing in Lightroom. Make sure you install the drivers and software from the website to get the full experience.I ordered from Amazon and not a 3rd party supplier. Paying the Full $700 and Prime Shipping.Now let us discuss the dead pixels. Like others have stated my monitor did come with 2 dead pixels. The GREEN portion of the pixels is off. that being said. I didn't know it had 2 dead pixel until I went hunting for them. 1 pixel is in the bottom right and the other in the bottom left corner. Neither are noticeable and I do not believe it's a cause for concern.I would have no problem buying this monitor again if I had to.
5,At first I was hesitant to get this because of the price but it was well worth it. I built myself a micro atx pc and I wanted to put a monitor on the side of my case for ultimate portability. I have it attached with velcro so it comes on and off as needed. The touch capacity works great and makes my computer usable without a mouse and keyboard. There are plenty of picture settings to mess around with and I like that it is calibrated so I can use it whenever I edit photos. It comes with a nice carrying case I don't use and on the back is a little kickstand. It feels very solid and premium. It was worth it for me to buy from a good brand and get something that would last rather than cheaping out.
5,Fantastic color accurate field monitor great for professional photographers. I am a professional photographer and digitech and this has been a great monitor for client viewing on location as well as a great second monitor when working remotely on just your laptop. Great one cable solution if you are using usbC/thunderbolt 3 or 4. Stunning color accuracy and being 1080p is actually a big asset in the field as it is far less taxing on your laptop's GPU. Resulting is faster rendering of preview images. One of my favorite features is the 1/4 20 socket on the bottom. Perfect for mounting on a tripod light stand or magic arm. My only complaints are no sunsheild/glare gard but you can make or buy one. However as it has a really good matte screen glare is not much of an issue. It's really just brightness in direct sun which really you can still see it it just would be better with a sun shield. My only other complaint is that the touch screen only functions on a pc. No touch support for Mac. I suspect this is mostly to due with apple not Asus but I'm not sure. It would be great to have touch support for Mac and also camera but i suspect that's impossible. That brings me to the last really cool thing you can plug it directly into the camera's hdmi out to get a live view while shooting stills or video to card. And it works great with one exception... It only supports 8 bit HDMI which means if you use it as a video monitor directly attached to the camera you can't shoot in 10 bit only 8bit at least with my cameras. That hurts. In conclusion you won't find a more color accurate field monitor with a 1/4 20 thread mount for this price. I have 3 Asus pro art monitors that run my business. A 4k 32" a 2k 24" and now this 1080p 14" I 100% trust the color accuracy and brightness of these monitors and I stake my reputation and business on them everyday.
5,The color accuracy is amazing the fact that MacBook pro isn’t supported is the main reason why I held off for buying this for so long. But for everything else this is a really good monitor and we’ll worth the price.*The sound quality isn’t great but what portable monitor has good speakers? -Remove the speakers and take off $20 bucks for the next version!
5,The price for this display is a steal for everything it delivers. Great picture quality the base mount is versatile for any position you might want to use it and the connectivity is great!Unfortunately I ended up returning it as the displayport daisy chain doesn't work on the M1 macbook air or pro (not for anything wrong on Asus Proart display but limitation on the M1 macbook chip).I still look forward to get another display by Asus for everything it offers (and better than any Samsung screen I ever owned).
5,So I’m not using this in a way that most other users seem to be….but that’s okay. I will be using this as my secondary computer monitor with hdmi for art projects….but what I really wanted was another smaller monitor to hook up to my old Samsung note 9 with the usb-c port cable. Straight talk made me upgrade to a 5g capable phone so this has now become my “tv” phone. I live out in the country with horrible internet and we will not be getting it upgraded any time soon (not our choice). Since I cannot use this phone as a backup cellular device anymore I am still able to pre-download things from YouTube Disney plus Netflix…whatever is available when I am at a place with decent wifi …and then just watch them offline at home. I have a larger Samsung smart monitor that this works on but when I’m gaming I like having another screen with something else going on for background noise. I was a little worried this wouldn’t work with my older phone but it works great! I do have hdmi adapters that do…work…but the video and audio doesn’t always want to sync up and this helps eliminate that extra cord. I could have purchased another type of display for this purpose but I wanted it as an actual computer monitor too. Two birds with one stone for me! I love that it’s easily rotatable and height adjustable as well since the ceilings in my room are very a frame and not everything always fits. It feels really solid and well built. This monitor is much easier on my eyes then the one I was using. So far so good! I’m really glad I went with this one.
4,The ASUS ProArt monitor is working great as a second monitor for my IMac.  It was easy to set up and connect to IMac.  Worked right out of the box.  The price was very reasonable.  It had the necessary wires to connect directly to my 2022 iMac.  The ASUS is monitor shown on the right in the picture.  The only drawback was that it is difficult to get a color match with the iMac monitor but I believe you sacrifice the display color for the economy.
4,I just received my new Asus ProArt display today and I'm impressed with the image quality.  With the display set horizontally a number of web sites default to a version of the site that's a mix between a tablet view and a desktop view which I wasn't expecting.  Despite that the major point I have to criticize is the hardware controls using the dial and button on the back of the display.  The button (in the center of the dial) pops out every time I touch it and the dial is not a very high quality either.  They need to improve these hardware controls and probably change them significantly.  After you figure out how to use the dial and button it's still a little awkward to use.  Something more traditional would have been better for the hardware controls.  Trying to be unique with the dial and button design has taken something away from what would otherwise be a really nice portable monitor.  Also the brightness doesn't go all the way down to black or even near black which seems silly to me.  Other than that it's great and the case it a nice addition that will make it easy when I want to take it somewhere.
5,I'd been buying 24" 16x10 Dell IPS monitors for a while and one day they weren't available. Gave one of these a try. Similar price but a much nicer display. The color rendition is great! Black is black as opposed to "mostly black" on the Dell. When viewing the same thing on both colors are more vibrant.It's also nice that it's 75 Hz at the same price others are 60 Hz.The on-screen grid is useful occasionally. I'd imagine that if I were a graphic artist I'd find it useful more often.
5,I bought this monitor to stand vertically next to my 34" curved LG monitor.It's 16:10 has excellent viewing angles good brightness and the builtin rotation works wonderfully.10/10
5,Beautiful color monitor. Accurate color right out of box.
5,Nothing to dislike for the price.
5,I am so impressed with this monitor - I actually bought two.  I believe that the 1920x1200 resolution is the best for desktops as it gives a bit more vertical real estate for websites and the clarity and crispness is perfect.  Full 4K actually makes lots of things too small and many monitors now use a shorter height to width ratio that makes it much less useful for actual work.  I didn't buy these to watch wide aspect ratio movies.  It's so hard to find a good 1920x1200 monitor.  These are replacing Dell monitors which I have in another office that are the same resolution and these are just as good (maybe better) and the stand and bezel w/controls on the front are actually much much better.  The monitor is also I believe $100 - $150 cheaper than the Dell monitors.  Highly recommend this monitor.  Excellent quality and great deal.
5,I've had two of these monitors for almost two years now and they are the best monitors purchased to date.  I like ASUS products and have had ASUS motherboards with great success with their products.  I started with looking at 4k and even 2k monitors.  Since it's more for home use there is no interest in spending that much on 4k monitor at this time.  While searching this monitor came up and peaked interest.  It's 16x10 which at first wasn't big on but in digging deeper and measuring compared to some of the other standard 1920x1080 it offered additional horizontal screen size.  It is also the perfect size for the space it is used.  A 27" was really too big for this particular application.  This fits two nicely in the space.  They do rotate so you can do landscape or portrait depending on preference or it comes in handy if adjusting/connecting cables.It also adjusts up and down on the base making the bottom of the screen itself approximately 7" above the surface.  it has 2 usb 3.0 ports on the left side.  It comes with audio display port and HDMI cables.  The screen is amazing from my point of view.  Around the top and sides there are practically no bezels.  The bottom of the monitor has ruler type markings.  Those aren't really used but may be of interest to some.  As stated it's been a great monitor so far.  Turning it on is a little different from experience since it doesn't seem to be "instant on."  it displays the ASUS logo for a couple seconds before showing the computer desktop.  I'm not a gamer so cannot speak to that aspect.  All in all a great monitor for a great price if you're looking to get a little more screen landscape and quality display.
5,The ASUS ProArt monitor color matches the prints almost perfectly.Works with Macbook Pro High Sierra.  I have always owned an i1Profiler for my monitors.  I don't have a print calibration.  I am Pro studio photographer for 25+ years.  I used to be a pro printer 25 years ago so I can see color and differences bother me.  The color matching to the Canon Pro 100 was always off with the other monitors including the Macbook Pro's monitor.  Even untrained eyes could see it.The ASUS ProArt monitor color matches the prints almost perfectly.  I would have bought this years ago if I had known.  If you are a pro photographer buy an ASUS.  I travel with my monitors so there is no way that I am going to spend $1-2k on a monitor.  They get knocked around too much.  This is a high quality affordable alternative.  I almost bought another when I saw they had gone to $200.
5,This is a very nice monitor – especially for the price.I’ve been a serious photographer for over fifty years and while I’m not a professional I occasionally shoot and post-process on deadline and consistent color is a requirement.This ASUS monitor replaces an NEC LCD 2490WUXi that I purchased in May 2009 for $1095 – which was a good price for a highly rated monitor.  Sadly after 11 ½ years of use the NEC was showing its age and I started to see inconsistencies across the screen.  This wasn’t burn-in from command bars and other application-related artifacts; they were irregular darker areas.  Age spots perhaps?Both the NEC and this monitor have native resolutions of 1900 x 1200 pixels and the screen sizes are almost the same – so I’m still getting the same photo editing look and feel – but in a $200 monitor.  If I was doing a lot of video and audio processing the 27” model’s extra real estate would be a plus.As for the new monitor’s performance after a few days:  I’m very pleased.  I ran a calibration with a DataColor SpiderX Pro and the result was 97% sRGB.  That was based on the “Standard” mode setting – where you have access to the contrast and brightness controls.  Some might complain (actually they have complained) about that but I think 97% is too close to the advertised 100% results to worry about.When I did another calibration using the sRGB mode the result was 96% sRGB.  I was expecting a little less using an ASUS special mode.  To make a digital photography analogy; calibrating on Standard mode is like using RAW – and the other modes are like using preset JPEG.For the price and even for $100 more I don’t think you’ll do better.
4,Pairing with the Macbook is wildly easy: just the USB-C chord. It also charges the computer! I bought this as a work monitor. I'm not in a creative industry but it's important for me to see fine print that's sometimes in color. The resolution is not perfectly sharp for things like macbook applications and the edge of browser windows but photos website and videos are very sharp. I think this is a Mac problem more than a monitor problem. Even then I haven't noticed it since the first day of use.tl;dr: From a non-creative professional this monitor does the job and does it well.
5,Very nice monitor for general usage and artwork. I liked it so much I immediately bought a 2nd one. So many reasons to like it and only one small flaw (see below).Pros:- 16:10 aspect ratio (1920x1200) I much prefer this aspect ratio because of the added height. Sweet spot for a 24-inch monitor.-  solid build quality. Every detail from the base the screen the bezel the rear plate seems well-designed and well-made. The materials look and feel a cut above.- base is very stable and screen position is fully adjustable (height tilt swivel rotate)- VESA compatible- many presets and fine adjustments for image/color quality- 3 inputs (DisplayPort HDMI VGA)- built-in speakers. No one should ever plan to use their monitor speakers as their main sound system but it's nice in a pinch if you need them. These completely lack any bass but otherwise sound surprisingly good.- 5 physical control buttons for the onscreen menu + power button are easy to find and press.- low priceCon:- there is only one glaring flaw in these monitors: it takes no less than eight (8) button presses to switch the input. Way too many! What's more ridiculous is it has the ability to assign shortcut functions to 2 of the buttons but switching inputs is not something can be assigned to them. If it could that would be perfect. (the functions that can be assigned to the shortcuts are generally useless.) Luckily I don't plan on switching inputs that often but if you did that a lot it could be very annoying.Despite that one flaw in switching inputs I still think this a 5-star quality monitor especially given the price point. (under $200) Highly recommend.
5,I am a Twitch streamer that uses a Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 49" ultrawide monitor as my main monitor (divided into sections with Windows Powertoys) and I really wanted a secondary display to go with it that wasn't connected to the main display for various functionality. Unfortunately because the ultrawide is so big it was logistically difficult to place another full size monitor to either side of the Neo G9 and I did not want to place a monitor up above it so this was the perfect solution to place beneath it.The color accuracy is extremely good in DCI-P3 mode the brightness is good and connects without any issues. The refresh rate is only 60hz so it feels significantly slower than the 240hz refresh of the main display but that is not a fault of the monitor but moreso just a relative comparison with my particular setup. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and it has been a great addition to my setup.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My left side is an Alienware AW2521HF $400 monitor. My right side is this Asus PA248QV $200 monitor.^When i got the monitor im surprised by the box being way smaller than my Alienware box. After that i got my camera and unboxed it... man... idk what happened the smell i sense was not the factory new smell it was like a weird stench even after a day it still smells bad. Other than that the monitor itself is normal. Also when it boots off the monitor will turn blue instead of black i found it really somewhat disturbing as a bit ocd triggering.=i do not know much about color calibrating so i just get it straight out of the box with that being said the color yet this Asus monitor looks good enough imo. With my eyesight alone i can tell them apart right away with a video of nature displaying the nature. This monitor has more white and yellow-ish color to it but that might just be the "pre calibrated" colors... yeah i mean my $400 vs $200 monitor has noticeable difference when compared side by side. Overall if i only have this one monitor the quality looks great.=Also on camera vs what we see with eyes irl is two different things. so if you are doing like a color related with this monitor i recommend tuning the colors of this monitor a bit or just look elsewhere. Other than that i like this monitor for its price over all.=tbh the colors are acceptable for casual use like doing social media stuff but i wouldn't recommend if you are doing vibrant color work related stuff.
5,I wasn't expecting to love the colors from this monitor so much.  I never realized how muted my regular screen was.
5,Not an excellent price in my opinion but not a bad deal for this screen. Being touch screen is the main reason I got it which was the pretty much the best deal in the price range also had payments available.I got this to use with a micro computer as a portable device. It does exactly that. Granted it does require its own power source but I can work with that. If you have Dex on a Samsung device this works the same as an external screen which is touch capable which is pretty awesome.Video quality is great sound is pretty good as well.I think the only thing I wish this screen had was a Versa mount holes. Being as large as it is it doesn't work with a tablet arm mount so having the ability to mount it on something like a custom built box would be cool. I still plan on mounting it to a box but ill have to get more creative.All in all its a good buy for the cost. Payment option is the final sell point on this for me. I could have gone with a cheaper option but I needed the payments. Excellent.
5,I am simply amazed with the value this monitor offers.  Everything appears to be high quality.  The stand and clamp well designed.  Very easy assembly and well packaged. I have owned a smaller ProArt monitor for several years and it has been trouble-free. I use this monitor for graphic arts..
5,This monitor looks great! Already bought a couple might buy a few more!I am using this for a at home study / daily activity monitor for my laptop and works great with no issues! I love the quality of this monitor.
4,For a first time monitor this is pretty great (coming from using a 15" ips laptop monitor for photo editing). Moderately budget friendly if you feel insecure about color calibration and want something guarenteed accurate right out the box. This has great colors although if you're doing work involving dark colors make sure to switch between sRGB mode and Standard mode if you feel some things are blown out or look at it from another display like a phone; gamma on this panel technology just isn't as good as an oled period but it's good as it gets for an ips. Didn't have to adjust a thing. Gaming on it is achievable however it is a 60 hz panel; you may feel you're missing out of you've tried 144hz and up so keep that in mind. In a room with lots of natural light coming in the panel doesn't get bright enough without needing to manually turn it up but again that's just the nature of an ips panel.The overall design is gorgeous and modern. The panel itself has a sleek and sharp modern chassis and the base stand make me feel i shouldn't get a 3rd party arm stand. Black and gray fit very nicely the boxy design sits best with the very thin bezels. If you come from a monitor with moderately sized bezels this will continually blow you away. A solid 8.9/10
5,I bought this 24" monitor because my old hand-me-down just wasn't cutting it for video and photo editing. It had pretty terrible color contrast range etc.This monitor is a massive improvement. It comes calibrated out of the box. When I tried to calibrate it myself I pretty much ended up at the factory settings. I compared it to the sRGB OLED screen on my laptop and they were nearly identical (laptop has shiny face vs matte on this Asus). I know others have had issues with these monitors not being consistent so maybe not perfect but works well for me. For the part time creative or the less than wealthy pro it's seems like a fantastic choice. Pros with money and motivation to spend it might look elsewhere.I've used it to stream TV and it's really made me appreciate watching shows and movies on a color calibrated high dynamic range screen.I've also used it for FIFA 2020 and I think it performs well. Serious FPS players might notice a slow response time or blurring but despite looking for it I did not notice it.I also appreciate having a speaker in the monitor. Trivial feature and not great quality by any means. But useful when it's providing background sound.I got mine about 10% off retail and I think it was a great deal! Might think twice about paying full price because who does that?
3,I bought this monitor because it is one of the few that still supports 1920x1200 resolution.  I work in design so the V resolution is more fitting for  me than all the new 1080 ones that cater more to gamers.I also have the prior model ASUS 248Q and I would say these are about the exact same with the difference obviously being the slimmer frame on the new 248QV.  It's a great look.PRO: once you use the menu to get out of "sRGB" or "Standard" mode and select on of the "CUSTOM USER" modes then it opens up all the variable color controls which is good.  Some earlier reviews made it seem like color control was difficult but it is not.  You just need to set it to USER mode and not standard or sRGB.PRO: sleek design sturdy base which is easily removed if you want to swap to mounted or your own stand via a simple "release" button.  The 4 screws/holes to add another VESA mount are underneath the standard mount panel once you remove it.CON: My main criticism is that these ASUS monitors all have pretty bad viewing angles.  If you are off from center much at all - if you stand up or move a foot to either side the monitor image starts to grey/fog out pretty bad.  Samsung monitors have WAY better viewing angles... their screens are designed better in this regard.  But I could not find a new Samsung monitor the supports 1900x1200 so I had no option there.CON: personally I do not like the two-tone look with the silver base.  I don't understand why they didn't at least offer an all-black version.  At least you can swap it our for another stand so I will probably do that.All in all a solid plug-n-play monitor (on Win10) with all the custom controls you could want in a cool design limited by a few shortcomings.
5,Got a set of these to both game on as well as work from home on A list movies as a vfx artist.  They don't have the color depth that far more expensive monitors have and I do notice some banding when I'm looking at subtle monochromatic grads.  I could have gotten better color for a little more with a far lower refresh rate but I wanted to game on the same monitors so this was a great compromise (I also couldn't go higher in resolution due to the vpn I'm on).  I also went with ASUS over some comparable models because I have and ASUS mobo and g-card and figured they would all play nice together.  I've had none of the sleep problems that some other people have mentioned.Fair warning they claim to come calibrated from the factory but mine needed calibration when they arrived (which wasn't a surprise I usually have to recalibrate monitors just switching computers).  But they calibrated great and have been fantastic for me.  I was so happy with them and saved so much over what I what I budgeted that I bought another one for my friend who also needed a monitor upgrade!
3,The brightness is not as good as the displays I use in office. I should have bought the same model.
5,Using two of these with my trading setup on the sides of my 34". Picture quality is very nice. Asus is still clearly making very great products. A little luxurious for the price point. Have not tried with gaming.
5,A great replacement for my old screen.  Very vivid!!!
5,There aren’t nearly as many reviews for the 24.1 inch version so I wanted to give a review. I will be using this monitor to edit photos and video. I’m happy that Asus cared enough to develop pro-level creative monitors at an affordable price. I was initially looking for a 27” monitor because it seemed like the sweet spot as far as monitor sizes go but I really didn’t need the extra specs / quality that came with ProArt’s 27” $299 price tag. Also I’m working on a small desk so there really isn’t much use for it even aesthetically. If you find yourself going back and forth between the 24” and the 27” ask yourself are you going to utilize the specs that come with that $100 difference? A lot of the features are the same on both (i.e. color accuracy / factory calibration 75hz). Is the added 3 inches going to improve your creative content or experience? Do you just prefer it? If yes definitely go for the 27”. But if you simply want a pro-level color accurate display at the best value get the 24.1” (it also has a 16:10 ratio which means you get more vertical space than the other model — less scrolling!) This monitor gets bright which is great! You’ll want to use the button controls for the best experience. Ultimately I decided to use the extra $100 I saved to buy computer accessories I needed to complete my desk setup and it was well worth it.
5,Great value monitor with excellent out of the box color accuracy. Extra height extremely helpful on MS Office applications and other business uses like stock charting. These flat podium style stands seem to be going out of style but I toss stuff like pens and wireless charging ports on top and find that they effectively take up less space than the stands with legs stretching out.Contrast could be better but that's the tradeoff with an IPS monitor. Refresh rate is too slow for gaming as well so I pair this with a curved VA monitor and use the ProArt in portrait mode. Side by side blacks are much darker on a VA panel and it's quite noticeable when paired side to side. I/O is great with DP HDMI and 4 USB outs including a powered one.If you're in the market for a solid general use monitor and thinking about this one and some cheaper options I highly recommend going with the ProArt 24". The extra vertical real estate alone makes it worth the price difference.If you're looking for a 24" monitor for work the bells and
5,As I don’t have a calibrator I needed a monitor that’s calibrated right out of the box. I’ll take ASUS word and their certificate for assurance. I needed this type of monitor for video editing and it works just fine for that. Simple no frills highly recommended for color correction type tasks.
5,I use two of these next to each other on my office desk.  Sharp display of Outlook Excel Word and other programs.  Definitely improved productivity.
4,The only thing I dislike is that my older Asus had a single button that when pressed repeatedly cycles through input options. This new monitor has no such button. Instead I press the menu button twice to get the secondary menu to appear I press a button to move to the desired menu then repeatedly again to move down to the correct menu selection for input then press another button to select a third menu then cycle through input options to get the correct input and then another button to select that option for the desired input (VGAHDMI Dusplay Adapter). Frankly what human factors idiot thought that could possibly be better?
5,Picture quality is great features and color calibration are wonderful.If anyone is wondering about M1 MacBook compatibility- it’s perfect. Just purchase a nice Thunderbolt USB-C cable with video transfer and you can use one cable to display and charge (a bit slowly) at the same time.I can use the monitor’s USB-A ports for all my dongles and my Scarlett Solo interface works through the monitor also - freeing me from the USB-C dock/adapters usually needed.It’s plenty bright for my bedroom (darker lighting). Unless I’m using it wrong it’s quite a few menu clicks to adjust volume unless you give up one of the two custom shortcut buttons. But I suggest external speakers anyway of course.For a budget video/music creator (not PC gamer) on an M1 MacBook Air I highly suggest this USB-C model over a cheaper or bigger monitor with HDMI/DisplayPort input. The charge passthrough and USB data passthrough is just so convenient for the 2 port M1 machines. Not to mention the picture looks great for a 1080p panel.
5,This is not a review about color correctness or gaming.  I had a Samsung 244T (2007) 1920 x 1200 that stopped working.  I wanted another 1920 x 1200.  I quickly found the PA248QV.  It was $197.95 when i bought it which I thought was a good price.  However I was a bit unsure because all I needed is a general purpose monitor.  I bought it and it's great for the way I use it.  The physical dimensions are smaller that the 244T and much cooler; I could feel the heat coming off of the 244T.  I've owned ASUS motherboards and have an Asus VH236 1920 x 1080 to use as a second monitor ($150 in 2010).  The PA248QV is MUCH better for not much difference in price.  AFTER I bought the monitor I received an email from Asus about a warranty extension if I wrote a review.  Obviously this had no influence on my decision to buy it.
1,I bought a ASUS PA248Q on 7/25/2012 and it was the best monitor I ever used in over 25 years of computer usage. But it was getting old and it had developed one bright pixel a couple of scratches on the screen so I felt it was time to get a new one. I wanted one like what I had so I bought a new PA248QV and when I received it on 7/5/2022 I gave the old one away that was a big mistake. Why you  say because if I could  I would trade this new one for my old one back and eat the cost! Here is what I found in comparing the two:What I found good on the new one: thin bezel; it has better styling; it cost a little less.What I found bad on the new one: the screen reflects almost as bad as a glossy screen where the old one had minimal reflections; the IPS “halo effect” is major on the new while the old one was very little; the USB Ports are almost useless because of location but the old one's were in a very handy location; a slight bump makes the screen shake where the old one's stand was solid; I've adjusted and adjusted and then adjusted some more but I can't get “TRUE WHITE” like I did on the old one that's a deal breaker!Bottom line: because of the major reflections major halo effect affecting the colors presented on the screen and no TRUE WHITE I'll be dumping this one and getting one that will work for me even if it cost a lot more money!!!!!!
3,pretty nice but later develop screen issue.
5,Just what I was needing! Very easy to set up and looks great!
5,I realize this is a weird thing to like most about a PC monitor but the best thing about this model is the stand.  I could say good things about the image quality but other reviews have covered that.  Seriously the stand on this monitor is worth $75 to $100 on its own.It is easily adjustable allowing you to turn the monitor smoothly and easily.  You can adjust your viewing angle without moving the whole base.  You can raise the monitor up and down with just one finger.  You can also rotate the screen from landscape to portrait or anywhere in-between.  Not that you would want your monitor at a 45-degree angle but you could.The base of the stand is made of hefty metal which makes it very sturdy and stable.There is also an option in the menu to disable the power indicator light (incase the LED bothers you) but honestly it is not that bright compared to other monitors that have a bright blue LED to let you know if the monitor is powered.
5,Hello. I’m using two of these for my home office / recording station. I’m on Mac so some adaptors to hdmi from thunderbolt needed  but these adaptors very available and affordable.I find the picture quality great adjustments easy to set to taste and viewing space excellent.  A 1/4 inch or less top and sides of the screen.Good QC. No bad pixels etc. I’m not a big gamer so will not address that but I’m confident the screens are good in that area too. Cost to quality is a win I think.Cheers.
3,This is a nice monitor but I wanted to use it to make videos. When the videos would play on other screens the color would be off and way too blue when all the while it looked perfect on this monitor. Also had pretty bad backlight bleed. I wanted to love it but had to return 2 of them after trying to get more luck with a replacement.
3,This slim monitor has blue tint on white background and pictures look underexposed in comparison with my used Dell U2410 that has the same 16:10 screen but CCFL panel. Soon after a few hours in use the LED-backlit screen made my eyes very strained. The case and buttons all have cheap plastic feel. Moreover screen has IPS glow and backlight bleed when viewing full black screen in the dark.The colors looked dull on the screen as well as noticeable color banding displaying 256-level gray scale gradients.The Asus is behind my Dell in attached photos. Dell provides more accurate colors of my artwork.
5,I bought 2 of these monitors for CAD design. They’re nice and clear. The filters make them easy on the eyes without straining after several hours of work.
5,I'm a WFH accountant and the extra real estate on these is great.  I have them next to eachother at an angle and the angled edge fits together in a satisfying way like a puzzle.
5,Se adapta perfectamente con las brazos estándar. La calidad de la imágen es perfecta. Lo trabajo en oficina que está iluminada  led y la imagen se ve perfecta.
5,Beautiful color accuracy. Great monitor for studio photography.
5,I am glad. Monitor works perfectly. Very bright and clear.
5,Outstanding monitor for Photoshop photo editing.  Amazon Services LLC delivered the monitor in two days.  Amazing.  Magnificent service.  It replaced a monitor that got "fried" in an electric storm.  Thank you thank you thank you.  Cheers Harry Branson
5,Amazing panel and build quality for just 200 USD. I work as a photographer and graphic designer and the colors on this monitor are great as long as you work with Adobe RGB/sRGB. I haven't tested it on other color spaces but for what I do it's perfect.And it comes with okay built in speakers and a small USB hub. For this price there's only good things to say about it as long as you're getting this for color sensitive work that is.Gaming in this is fine but I don't feel comfortable playing anything that I'm familiar with and highly competitive such as fighting games or shooters likes R6S. It's not horrible but it's not a gaming monitor either. For single player games or non-competitive games in general I definetly enjoy it a lot more. Just gotta keep in mind that it's still just a 60hz panel
5,Best for editing any art animation and gaming. My only regret was the size I purchased Take my advise and go bigger or get a couple more.
5,I got this after getting undatisfactory results editing astrophotography on my laptop. The photos would look vastly different on other displays compared to what I saw on my monitor. Using this monitor that is not the case. I'm not a pro so I can't speak to the various calibration schemes and the technical details. My photos come out the way I want them to look and they look more or less the same on other displays. For the $$ I am happy.
4,I bought this computer for all my personal computing needs but gaming. The equipment was easy to use and was very efficient and met all my needs. However I had to return it simply because it was shaking whenever my table moved. And I grew scared that it was going to fall off and break. It appears like the stand was less than 100% flat on the table. I tried ignore this error and tried hard to resist the temptation to return the machine and so I changed tables but the error persisted and because I have the habit of moving my table every now and then I decided to return it. In effect this fault was noticeable only when my table was moved. Otherwise this monitor is unbeatable.
5,I ordered a high end PC for photography video and 3d content creation and needed a great monitor to go with it but didn't have 500+ to spend. I was very nervous buying anything below 500 as color accuracy is important to me but I listened to the reviews and specs and got this.No regrets! So far as I can tell the color is accurate to my printed images and albums.It can slide up and down and go vertical - I didn't know this when buying.It also has 4 USB3 ports built in to the monitor! - Another thing I didn't know.I almost left this monitor a bad review though mentioning the poor speaker volume but had the bright idea to look in the menu for a volume control and found it at 50 (default) and turned it up.
5,I don't care about gaming.This is for my Mother who needs a big display and minimized scrolling.I position the taskbar / dock on the side to get even more scroll-reduced browsing.I purchased a QHD 1440P that was bigger... but it was too big.  This is the right size.I would  accept slightly larger... but don't really need it...Would like higher resolution not willing to pay too much more for it..Would like squarer aspect ratio (but 1x1 displays are 10x the price! I would pay more)This has a grid feature that we have accidentally turned on a few times.I would pay more for better integrated speakers. ($20 more if I knew how quiet these were)Our setup is connected with HDMI from a docking station.
5,Use this monitor with 2 others for work and play.  Very good for gaming and photo shopping.
4,I was so livid after receiving a monitor with lots of dead pixels I don't think I really gave the monitor a fair shake in my original review. The second replacement monitor had a single dead pixel that I think I can live with.After using the monitor now for a while I can say the 75Hz feature when properly working is fantastic. The colors are great although I don't have the eye for that. Certainly they are noticeably better than my previous T260HD. So far the best thing about this monitor for me has been all its angle and height adjustments. Its vertical range is huge and the monitor has quite a bit of range to angle upward. Its downward tilt range leaves a little to be desired however so if you need lots of downward angle you will need to use a different mount.
5,My wife paints from photographs and this monitor is high quality. We are very pleased.
5,I use it for editing photos. It has good dynamic range without changing the shadow detail. Many monitors manipulate the shadow areas so you can see extra details in movies or games. This feature makes it hard to edit for accurately printing photos. This Pro Art display is very good for editing photos.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I did not purchase this monitor for gaming and won't be able to speak to that. My main uses are work Photoshop Premiere Pro Lightroom and Movies. Here's what I can share:1. Weight is just under 14lbs2. HDMI Display Port Audio In and USB are the connections I use3. Great viewing angles4. Adaptive color profiles for different applications (see video and picture). On occasion there is a slight delay5. Resolution is 1900x1200 @ 75Hz off of an AMD Radeon RX Vega 11 (Ryzen 5 3400G)6. Easy menu navigation7. Set up on monitor arm
2,For something labeled "ProArt" there seem to be a lot of issues regarding dead pixels with this monitor. I thought I would try my luck since it's a relatively cheap monitor that has a USB-C connection and charges my laptop while in use. Turns out that's the only great thing about this monitor. I ran a dead pixel test as soon as I got it started up and found a dead pixel. It's dead not a bright pixel. So it doesn't affect my user experience enough for Asus to provide me with a new one. But I think when you purchase a product and expect it to work out of the box you are not wrong in being upset that it doesn't work properly and fully. Asucks will not provide me with a new monitor and I will just do my part in letting you all know that this brand has failed us in maintaining good quality assurance for their customers.On the bright side the dead pixel is in the taskbar and does not interfere with my day-to-day use. However if I were a photographer or I did something very art-heavy I would be pretty upset when it came time to edit in full-screen mode and all I could focus on was the dead pixel in my line of sight.Anyway don't do it. Buy a different monitor from a different brand. Unless of course you just don't care if your monitor comes with dead pixels and the company doesn't think it's that big of a deal.
5,I'm a CPA and use a three monitor set-up. I've tried 6 monitors in portrait including this one. The other 5 failed miserably when rendering text readable. This monitor is crystal clear for text. I will be ordering two more so I have consistency. I've tried Benq and other Asus monitors. The other ones worked well in landscape mode but failed when turned to vertical / portrait. I tried both an IPS and VA Benq. The other ASUS I tried were TN and they work well for landscape only. I highly recommend for 12+ hour days doing taxes. My only criticism is the blue light filter. There are 5 settings. When turned on the brightest level is a bit dark. But that's probably what I need to be viewing to reduce eye fatigue and headaches.
4,I gave it four stars because the USB-C cord that’s provided doesn’t support power delivery even though the monitor does. It’s a great monitor especially for the price! Even with the additional thunderbolt 3 cord I bought it is cheaper than other monitors with similar capabilities.
2,Colors: 0/5Practicality (as a work monitor): 2/5Ergonomics: 5/5I felt compelled to write this review because this monitor heavily boasts its color accuracy and functionality for creative professionals but I've been really disappointed by this product.The screen has a pinkish red hue that distorts colors when you're web browsing watching movies/Youtube videos or viewing pictures. Black colors look grey and white colors appear rosy pink.Also I connect this monitor to my laptop via the provided USB-C cable. At first when I wasn't using the monitor screen and it was turned off I could still use my laptop normally. Now 3.5 weeks into owning this monitor my laptop keyboard and trackpad will occasionally not respond while my laptop is connected to the monitor. I've tested this with a friend's laptop and the same issue occurs. This problem did NOT arise in the first few weeks of using this monitor. I use this product for 10-12 hour work days so it glitching (or causing my laptop to glitch) while I'm working on deliverables is really not ideal.The saving grace for this monitor is its stellar ergonomics. Its ability to tilt and reorient is perfect for any working professional.Overall it's a disappointing monitor that is definitely not worth the $240 price tag. I'm currently in busy season for the next two months so I need a monitor but I wish this product didn't have the aforementioned issues which cripple its practicality as a reliable work monitor. I'm probably going to get another monitor from Dell or Acer.
4,It’s the monitor on the left it’s very nice and all for a second monitor but keep in mind the dimensions. It’s a 1920x1200. This means if you have another monitor and the display is 1920x1080 that this other monitor will be a bit bigger on the Y axis meaning vertical it’s larger than a regular display so it would look awkward side by side another display unless you have it tilted in portrait mode or you have another monitor that’s also 1920x1200. Other than that it’s pretty good. Only had it since yesterday colors are great. Haven’t tried for gaming but I’m assuming it wouldn’t be that good especially at only 75hz
2,I have professionally calibrated monitors for a few years and am familiar with the complexities of that process. I was excited this monitor claims to be perfectly pre-calibrated. I am a pro photographer and videographer so color has to be spot on or very close. My clients screens or monitors may not be but I must be able to tell them "I'm starting from a professional calibration and can't control your screen colors."When I hooked up this ProArt I immediately noticed a strong green / yellow tint to all the whites and grays. It's no where close to my other professionally calibrated monitor. I borrowed my wife's ProArt monitor to compare on my system and without any adjustments that one looked very very close to my calibrated monitor. Perfectly acceptable variance.So I guess I got a defective one? Not sure but I'm very doubtful about the certified calibration process for this product as I read a few other reviews with this issue. I really don't want to fudge the settings in Windows or in the monitor itself to trick it into being similar to my other monitor. And I really don't want to go through the pro calibration process on something we paid for that claims this is already done. Likely returning.UPDATED: Did return and exchange. Second monitor was calibrated just fine. Night and day. Asus support tried all sorts of things with the first one but nothing helped. Interesting the second one’s calibration certification card was different with less error.  One more downside is the rubber bumpers under the monitor stand left a permanent oily stain in my wood desk.
5,The 24" monitor is perfect for my desk 54"x24".  I am a Landscape photographer so I wanted this monitor to better process my photos.  It did not disappoint.  I have had to reprocess many of my photos originally edited using my 15" laptop screen (Not intended for photographic processing).  The monitor is large enough the detail in the photographs shows up clearly and the colors are outstanding.  I am pleased with my purchase.
5,It’s almost impossible to edit photos using a tv as a monitor.It’s still not always easy to edit photos using a standard computer monitor.The camera uses the true colors the printer uses the true colors... so your monitor needs to let you see the true colors too.This monitor cut my editing time in half and now my prints match what I see on screen!Before this monitor: I’d edit beautifully only for my print to be off in shade or something... then I’d edit the file according to the print. A horrible way to do things. This monitor solved that problem immediately.
5,I previously had the pro art Asus PA248Q over time they die in which one of my monitors did so but they do not sell these models anymore to be honest the Asus PA248Q were the best monitors i have ever owned. These come out of the box just color ready no fidgeting with colors and what not. These monitors ASUS ProArt Display PA248QV 24.1 just came out and they are very cost-efficient and I had no dead pixels these are great monitors especially if you are a graphic designer in which that I am. However I personally feel that the Asus  PA248Q is better  it is very confusing on how to fix the color to match the old monitors. This is not good UI in my opinion. my only complaint.
5,I was turned on to this monitor because of the 16:10 aspect ratio and the color accuracy claims. The extra screen height does make a noticeable difference and it is especially convenient when using the monitor in portrait orientation. The stand is quite sturdy and it's nice to be able to adjust the panel as needed when most alternatives only allow tilting backward and forward. Picture quality is very nice and the OSD provides a useful range of adjustments. Strictly for gaming you may want to consider a 16:9 144hz panel instead. Even so this monitor offers great image quality at 75hz. I'm pleased with it
5,I bought this monitor for its color accuracy.  As a photographer having accurate colors in my images is extremely important to me.  I calibrated the monitor with a software program and had to tone down the colors a bit which is normal for processing photos.  My only complaint is that the built-in speakers are located in the rear of the monitor.  I am somewhat hard of hearing so I had to buy external speakers so I could hear the audio.
1,Have three stuck pixels. One right in middle of the screen and might even be a dead pixel. The other two are far corners and are not as noticeable but annoy you when you know they are there. Probably cannot return the monitor as it is technically with in “tolerance” for monitors as it’s three pixels out of millions. But still is annoying to spend upwards of $700 on a monitor that now has a spot in middle of the screen. I bought the insurance from Amazon maybe I will contact to see what can be done. Overall disappointing. The display is okay on brightness but not with  HDR just not as bright. I would look for something different even if a few hundred up in price.
3,For people with a yellow tint/hue.In the monitors settings change your mode to standard mode and then lower your gains red and green and maybe up your blue. Mine is 40 red and green and blue is at 50.I originally bought two monitors from b&h. One monitor was perfectly calibrated right out of the box. The other one had a yellow tint. The whites did not match at all. I tried changing chords viewing angles and various settings but nothing worked so I returned it and bought another one from Amazon.The new one had an even worse tint. As I was preparing an exchange I changed the setting on the gain and it matched my other screen perfectly.While they look great asus advertised that these came pre calibrated so the fact that I can’t use any of there preset modes and have them match is a huge disappointment.After matching these screens I am very satisfied they are gorgeous displays and fit my needs as a beginner graphic designer.
5,I like that I can see what I'm drawing at my writing hand on the touch screen. Many "white boarding" solutions require user to look at a separate monitor instead of looking at your hand which is awkward. For mobile presentation or discussion where white boarding and sketching are needed this external monitor is perfect.
5,This product is a good product for the price. It has so many fetuses and settings that you can find the right settings for you without being to complicated
5,Due to way to many "zoom" meetings I wanted a larger screen than what was on my laptop.  It has worked out very well. Although it was somewhat more expensive than some other monitors given that it is also color corrected for photographic editing the difference in price was more than worth it. Even without the photography angle it would still have been a good buy. Unlike some of the other less expensive products it came with all the required cables. Plus it has extra USB ports which was wonderful since my laptop has only a few ports and they were all full.
5,If you are a designer photographer or videographer the ASUS ProArt PA248QV is an outstanding monitor with deep blacks crisp contrast and calibrated sRGB colors. This is my third ProArt display (the others are going strong five years and counting) and I continue to be amazed at their ability to render accurate colors. Browns and earth tones are particularly difficult to render for most monitors but the ProArt series brings them to life. Competiitive graphic arts monitors may offer slightly better specfications but at double triple and quadruple the price. (I did not receive any financial or other consideration for writing this review.)
4,Working as expected.  Had one time where the DisplayPort didn’t wake up one time after the computer timed out the displays.  Had to remove the cable and plug it into a different DP output.  Could then change back to the original and it has been OK since.Others have complained about ports dying after some time has passed so will wait and see.
5,Got this off of a follower's recommendation. My monitor needed an upgrade and I lost the power block for it....after 5 years of trusty service I decided it was worth looking into an upgrade and my god I've found my power block since but I'm not going back! this is so much brighter and better quality. It needed NO adjusting with my colorimeter and makes me wish my cintiq had the same brightness and color quality.Haven't played around with the adjustment options yet or the stand (I don't need to to be vertical) but for this price point I'm shocked theyre there. It's clearly quality.
5,Looks great on my Mac Book Pro.  I use it as a second monitor for software development (email text editing etc).  I also use turned 90 degrees.My only complaint (if I want to nit pick) is that there is no in monitor setting for screen rotation (to make it report the resolution as HxW instead of WxH) this is a common issue with most monitors though so no loss of star.Good quality monitor at a good price and it’s a 16:10!
4,The only issue I had was the USB Hub on the back which was a selling point for me was not compatible with my Mac customer service claims this is only usable with Windows. Given my MacBook only has 4 USB-C ports I was hoping this feature would work out for me.  Everything else works and looks great. Colors are great and seem accurate.  Great option for Graphic Design Students looking for a second monitor at an affordable price.
5,My Mom is in a nursing home and her echo is our daily means of communication with COVID-19.She kept having issues accidentally turning volume or video off when the device did not have this stand to aid in the pickup and handling of the echo. The legs on this stand are a great way to accomplish this now and to allow better positioning of the device for viewing. But in my testing I felt it was too easy to dislodge the device from the stand so I duck-taped it for a more secure fit and since she does not need a quick disconnect option this is working well.
4,I can’t expect more for monitor with this price. Since I use macbook pro so when put together the display from monitor is quite bad with macbook screen but for movie with distance. It’s really nice. I like the color
5,I bought this during the pandemic when we shifted to full-time work from home and I have been using this for months now. I didn't have any issues whatsoever. I'm using it both for work and my hobby (digital art) and I must say-the colors look stunning! It's easy to switch between work and hobby because of the different ports it has. So far I've used both HDMI and DisplayPort and they're working as expected. I'm planning to connect my Nintendo Switch via VGA so in total I'll have 3 inputs connected to this thing right here. So worth it.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! Within the first month of my purchase the HDMI input was causing me problems. It would briefly display the display from my laptop and would immediately make a click sound and then display and HDMI Display Not Valid. Just as a I was going to send it back the problem resolved itself and worked fine for four months. The problem again arose and became permanent making the HDMI display useless. I called Asus customer support and as a "solution" they suggested to use the monitor in a different way using a different port method and not use the HDMI function. I told them that it was not a solution because a product should function as it should and I should not have to resort to using the product only partially. They proceeded to sent me a link to create something they call an RMA (type of service ticket); I created the RMA only to find out I am responsible for paying the shipping label. Mind you my product is still under warranty. I researched their service procedures only to find out that their repair service is garbage and they will deem it damaged if anything happens during the shipping of the product. At this point I wonder if it is worth sending. If a product less than a year of purchase has problems and is still under warranty it should not be on the customer to pay the shipping. It also appears that they will attempt to find any little thing wrong to void their warranty and not repair it. In essence BUYERS BEWARE if any issue arises from your monitor you run the risk of throwing your money in the garbage and better of just buying another monitor. I would give it 0 stars if it was an option. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AS A PURCHASE!!!!!
2,I have been through three of these in the span of a month purchased from separate vendors. Each one had dead or damaged pixels upon arrival. For a monitor hovering around 700 dollars this kind of thing shouldn't be a problem. I don't have the time to keep returning these screens.It's really too bad because otherwise it's a pretty fantastic display. That's why I've tried three separate times to obtain one in perfect working order. The overall build quality is top notch. I just wish ASUS had better quality control on the actual screen part. It's a massive disappointment.If you can live with one or two malformed/dead pixels go for it otherwise beware of this product!
5,Honestly beautiful. A friend used my Amazon account to buy it for me as a Christmas gift and ive had it for about 1 month now. I've never had any issues and set up was so easy. I have another one that is very similar but a different brand as m second monitor and... this one blows it out of the water. It is definitely a must have for anyone who loves a good display.Also has a little ruler on the bottom of the frame!
5,As a semi-pro photographer I purchased this monitor for image editing and I’m very pleased. The black levels of the IPS panel are much better than my old ASUS TN monitor and the colors are gorgeous. Much better viewing angles as well.I would definitely buy it again.
5,Great resolution and color. Most important to me is how I can adjust it to any tilt or height at the touch of a finger. SO IMPORTANT when you spend the computer time that I do. My neck and head aches are no more. I bought the 24" on the advice of another artist reviewer and she was right - it is plenty big with a pleasing aspect ratio. This is among the most perfect purchases I have made in years.
5,It charges slower but that is to he expected. The output is a lot different than the regular charger. Picture quality is great. Not recommended for gaming.I use it for both work and school. Overall great product!
5,I have always had issues with my color being off from the time I upload them to social media or sending them to someone. I did some research and decided to order this monitor. I am extremely pleased with my photography work now from what I see and what my clients see. My only complaint was the package arrived in original packaging and left in plain view. I just think they should have been packaged in a large box.
5,I bought this bec. it's 16:10 which was once the norm (these days HD 16:9 is the norm).  16:10 is taller so you can see more of a document or photo.  This monitor costs more than the 16:9's but works very well.  Nice low-refectivity surface good color rendition very pleased.  I have 2 of them.
4,I read many websites looking for a good budget photography monitor. I really like how this is calibrated. I love the USB 3 port extensions even though I thought I didn't want them. And I really wanted a stand that had vertical height adjustment not just tilt. Very happy with it so far.
5,Impressive color detail and accuracy definitely a good product and a winner on pro budget monitors. I have connected mine to a MacBook Air and I’m more than satisfied with the results and how well the color get so close to Retina Display. I will not recommend for gaming due to the 75hz of refresh rate. But very recommendable to graphic artist web developers and editors.
5,I like this monitor a lot. It has made it easy for me to process my photo's. You do have to make sure it is in the right mode. It has several pre-set lighting modes to make it easier on your eyes.
5,Perfect size and sharpness
5,Bought for home office for multi-tasking from PC Mac and security video monitor. Wow the definition and quality is impressive. Great for creative work while using the laptop for copy. Navigating around inputs is a bit clunky yet that is a high-class problem.
5,Great picture right out of the box. No dead pixels. Several presets make it easy. This monitor is definitely as bright as you would want a monitor to be and then some. I'm using this with an 8 year old HP 8570W and the picture is still very good. With a new desktop or laptop with docking station I would imagine it would be amazing. Great monitor for the price.
1,First off I am a photographer and I was very intrigued by the specs promoting this little monitors color accuracy. I travel a bunch so I thought OMG this is perfect! My primarily laptop screen over saturates colors and is made for gaming not true to color editing… so here it goes1. Hardware problem - I have a razor 15 advanced and getting this thing to work properly via hooking up cables has been a nightmare. You get a few different types but the most convenient is the USB 3 to USB 3. In theory you should only need to connect one cable and you’re good but alas I probably have a faulty unit because the “ding” sound when new hardware gets connected just keeps going off non stop when it’s plugged in. Yes I have correct drivers and firmware installed and yes I restarted the machine. It’s a bad glitch.2. When I do get the monitor to work it is very fuzzy the image quality is not very clear and therefore useless to me. My work relies on not only color accuracy but also sharpness. This was promoted for photographers and so far the image quality of the display is subpar.Due to these issues I will now be returning and DO NOT recommend if you are a photographer. I do believe Asus has a $4000 model that probably works fantastic but that is out of my budget. Hope this helps.
5,Its a bit slow on the refresh and the viewing angles arnt spectacular but for the price this is a great value. You can game on it just fine it just wont blow your mind on performance.The monitor gets really bright! I have mine next to a big window and even in the daytime I rarely crank the brightness up beyond 50%. The controls and menu are also pretty well designed and user friendly.
3,Speakers are woefully inadequate
5,I've been using this as a second screen for about 2 months now - it's linked to my MacBook Pro with an HDMI cord and works fantastically well. The picture is great colors are sharp and it makes my software demos with customers a breeze. Really beyond thrilled with this purchase and plan on purchasing it again for my other home office.
4,Solid monitor with some extra features like USB and internal speaker.Purchased due to the size cost and calibration of color.The other option I considered was a 4k monitor.  Wish I could have saw them side by side.
3,I love 16:10 monitors! This one is on the cheaper side while still retaining quality aspects such as sturdy and adjustable stand and pretty good picture quality. The main downside is that it uses PWM (pulse width modulation) for backlight which causes eyestrain. I didnt know about this before buying... for my next model I will try the Dell version which costs about $100 more but doesnt use PWM and has thinner bezels. Based on online reviews I found that 20 brightness with 80 contrast was a nice sweet spot to reduce eyestrain while retaining picture quality. The default sound is set to 50 so you may want to adjust that.
5,Purchased as third monitor for home workstation. Great quality with multiple ways to connect to laptop or desktop.
5,really really love this monitor. being used for programming and the size and contrast are perfect. plan to get another as soon as i can afford to.
5,Excellent resolution sharp and clear with amazing color accuracy. If you are looking for something to replace your older LCD panel with a new 1080p panel put this at the top of your list. The added height of its 1920 x 1200 (16:10) configuration is a great bonus. While some complain about the OSD menu it's really not an issue. Use it a few times and you'll have it figured out. Highly recommended.
5,I needed a new monitor when I switched from a desktop to a laptop for full time use.  It has a good number of ports and is very easy to set up.  My only criticism is the built-in speakers aren't great but if you have your own like I do its not a problem.
5,Only thing I mounted but my mount did not fully fit in recession in back of monitor.  I needed about 1/4 inch longer screws to reach through the gap where the mount did not fully enter recession (small plastic things block mount from full going in)..  The screw size I used is M4-.70x16  (metric) from lowes need 4 screws.
3,My copy of product had a few dead pixels from a box for some reason.Image was not as sharp as I hoped to see.Regardless in the end I ended up getting ASUS ProArt Display PA278QV 27” instead.
5,Very happy with my purchase. Will be getting another eventually when I have the money. The dimensions are a bit taller than your average rectangular pc monitor but this makes it very very nice for editing photos/videos without having to scroll up and down as much!Very satisfied :)
5,Great stand and mounting without! Great display! I have never had a problem with an Asus Monitor!I don't use for gaming so gaming is not rated.
1,I wanted to like this monitor at the price point. The color accuracy sure it’s okay when it works but the fonts as a computer monitor are blurred and pixelated. Interestingly enough my M1 MacBook Air wouldn’t connect to this with my Apple usb-c cable that cost an hour of time then I used theirs and it worked half the time. Mind you two hours in playing with controls and finally color grading from a photo I finally realize the fonts are blurry AF and this wouldn’t work at all and then boom it shut off for the 3rd time in mid email. It didn’t work properly in clamshell mode the way I intended to use the monitor kept shutting off the screen and when I open to reset it then kept shutting down. Cords fully in spoke to support just overall very buggy. The rest of the evening I played around hoping to find YouTube videos for this issue but nothing. So I boxed it up watched a horrible Bruce Willis movie his newest one on Netflix and dropped it off for a return this morning.Like I said I wanted to like it the monitor looks nice thin bezels heavy stand multi direction but straight out of the new box issues. It was packed nicely and no damage.
5,Seamlessly connected to my MacBook for extended display. Good picture quality and reasonable response time.
2,Low on brightness even when cranked to the highest setting. Idk if I got a faulty model but there's this weird green hue that overlays the monitor screen and its set color profiles are either too low on brightness or has a terrible color combination. Doesn't project white or blacks very well. Extremely disappointed...
1,I tried several monitors trying to find a portable 2nd monitor for my 2021 Macbook Pro and this was one of the worst of them all... It may have something to do with how the Macbook handles 2nd monitors and this monitor MAY be fine for a PC but when I tried it with my Macbook Pro it was VERY dim Dull and slightly blurry text... Even after messing with it for hours and maxing out the brightness it was terrible!! It made me feel like I was losing my vision. And the worst part is that THE TOUCH SCREEN WILL NOT WORK AT ALL ON MACBOOK!! When I called ASUS they answered pretty quickly and very helpfully told me ASUS DOES NOT SUPPORT MAC THEY DO NOT HAVE DRIVERS TO MAKE IT WORK... If you have a Mac DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!! I DID finally find a monitor that matched my Macbooks monitor but I'm not sure if Amazon would allow me to name it here but I'll give you a hint. (it's not a well-known brand but if you have a MacBook it will make "U PERFECT"
5,This monitor is amazing for the money.  I'm used to high-end photo monitors that cost 10 times what this costs and this comes surprising close to them.  It helps if you can use the digital port (HDMI) directly into your video card.  Really a great picture for a budget monitor.
5,I am a professional/hobbyist photographer and i really like the monitor. True to colors that i print well calibrated right out of the box.
5,I was positively impressed by the image quality. Blacks are black. I am a photography enthusiast and need a quality display for photo editing. My dell monitor died and saw the specs and review for this asus. I think it was a good acquisition. Looking forward for it to last. Very satisfied so far.
5,This monitor is the best you can get for the price for photo (or video) editing. The color clarity is unbeatable! Keep in mind that in sRGB mode the brightness is about halved and the speakers are as subpar as you'd expect. Otherwise this is an amazing product for a very competitive price
5,This monitor has pretty good colors if you are upgrading from an ordinary 1080p monitor. The 75 fps is a good addition too. My only complaint is that since this monitor is 1200p and diagonally still the same size as most 1080p monitors the screen width is going to smaller.
5,We have about 20 of these monitors at our work office.  I've never seen a problem with any of them.  Image is bright crisp and sharp.  Price is reasonable.  Love the slightly taller aspect ratio too.
3,The screen I got has image retention.
5,so versatile but even without considering the rotating screen and stuff like that it is easily worth the money.  also note that the internal speakers do exist and are not exactly atrocious.
1,I bought this monitor for my online - studies in the middle of the pandemic. But unfortunately after less then a year one day it stopped working for no reason. ( as a note I only used it very much for 6-7 months I haven't been even using for the last 3 months or so...)Overall qualities were okay while it was working. Screen is generally mat does not get too bright and resolution is going to be different if you are using a MacBook. I was still happy because the size and the price were good considering the product and I used graphic programs with no problems.As I said it was VERY disappointing that it stopped working and I am actually writing a bed review about an ASUS product for the first time. And yes it is a good quality for a price but price is also def not that cheap - especially for a student.
5,I use it for general use with a Mac mini.  it is compatible and that is what I was looking for. I do not game but I think it would be fine for that use.
4,Great true bright color.  Actually prefer it to my 27"Dell U227 photo monitor.  But I'm being careful because the case is thin flimsy plastic
5,If you want great image quality for editing on a budget then this is a solid choice. It looks really clean on my setup as well so the design and functionality are a win.
5,This monitor really brings out the color of my Mac Book Pro. I don’t do gaming but website photo and application colors are super crisp and colorful.
5,Once I figured how to enable HDMI to our older PC this monitor the best that we ever had and it makes my lenses look better. The price was quite reasonable and for photo editing this is real luxury for me for a change
5,Dreamy! Amazing for graphic design and digital artwork. It even has speakers. Great swivel/rotate and easy to set up. Resolution is terrific.
2,The display resolution is not even CLOSE to sufficient for graphic design work. The pivoting the features are all fine and otherwise this item would be solid.  But fine lines were fuzzy in Adobe Illustrator meaning that this item heavily marketed for graphic design doesn't manage to do the most important thing right which is display stuff well with detail.  This should be at a QHD resolution and the next one up probably would do better at a 4k resolution for designers.  But that would mess up the price points I guess. Designers are better off getting at least a 27" screen with at least 4k resolution.  Also two HDMI ports would be nice though the USB are great and the pivot swivel and tilt features were great.
5,Second monitor same as the first; do not want *any* differences in images when bouncing between machines. No gaming but I stream video enough to appreciate that capability.
2,I have this monitor and I'm a professional photographer.  This monitor is not even 1440p and to be honest I made the mistake of buying something like this.  I just didn't pay attention as to what else is available out there right now.To be honest the "Pro Art" name is just a gimmick IMHO.  I don't think much about it's image quality and I just ordered a new 27 inch 4K monitor.  4K monitor prices are so lot these days that (to me) is kind of pointless to throw my money away on a 1080p screen.  It just doesn't make any sense.Also when I look at this monitor my eyes get irritated and the colors are not professional.  Is just an okay but is definitely not for professionals.
5,I love it!!! I'm a professional photographer and it works amazing!!! The best product for the price by far!!!
5,For the price this is a great monitor. Bright screen can use with Mac and PC. Easy to setup and plenty of connections. Also like that it an easily be put into portrait mode as well.
5,Great product. Nearly installed itself once I plugged it in. Replaced an older monitor but even so picture is crisp and colors brilliant
5,Great product.  Working from home was made easier with this monitor.  Wished I'd bought it months ago. Nice base to the monitor.  Ability to raise and lower or pivot screen on desk is very easy.
5,An absolute steal for the price point. Text and colors are vivid and the multiple preset configurations work well for me. Works great through my thunderbolt ports on both my older iMac and my New Air. Would absolutely buy another and highly recommend.
5,Great monitor.Way sharper than the previous Dell u2412mb monitor that I had before.
5,Definitely not geared towards gaming but decent refresh rates. Amazing color accuracy no tuning required and results are amazing. Really helps find a accurate color when editing pictures or video
5,Mainly use it for gaming but the quality is amazing and it is just so cool that it is adjustable.
5,Excellent monitor for the money. I paired it with my new M1 Mac Mini
5,It was easy to set up and the picture is very sharp. No dead pixels. Made working from home a lot easier.
5,Love ASUS stuff!  Incredible monitor.  It amazes me the technology you can get for such a low price
5,I love this screen. It's a good size and I love the portrait option. I don't use for gaming.
5,Great colorEasy to setup
3,I was really excited to get this monitor. It advertised 100% sRGB and color accurate. When I received the monitor and calibrated with my Spyder X Pro It was only 97% sRGB (GB LED/Wide LED). The color was white washed quite cold temperature straight out of the box. Still a decent monitor just not true to advertised. Will update if anything change.
5,Works well. Love the adjustable height feature and usb connection that enabled keyboard and mouse for this display.
5,Easy set up and gorgeous colors. I returned it though upon realizing that it would bug me to have two different size monitors. Wish I'd gotten this one first.
5,Very happy with this display. I needed something not too big colors and clarity are great.
5,Reasonable price too. Other brands with almost similar specs sell for $500. I've had it for a month very happy with it.
3,Description says it cover 100% sRGB. However I did calibrate using Datacolor SpyderX Elite Color Calibration in Darkroom and Bright condition result show it only cover 96%. Very disappointing results.UpdateBrought 27 inch version PQ278QV and tested it cover 100% SRGB.
5,Crisp and good color.  Use it most for accounting finance and tax....amazing monitor for business purposes.
2,You can find a better one for the same price computer cable broke after 3 days no rough movement simply just plugged in on my desk.
5,gorgeous picture quality colors are spot on perfect for web development
2,Power doesn’t run to peripherals plugged into monitor unless my laptop is also awake. Monitor doesn’t wake up when laptop wakes after sleeping unless I re-insert cable into my laptop which is a hassle I didn’t anticipate.
5,This is a great monitor. Great picture quality. Has both DP and HDMI ports. Really like the highly adjustable stand.
5,wow awsome picture its packed like it was worth $1000 monitor
5,920x1200 is better than 1920x1080 for designer. It came with HDMI USB upstream and Power cable in it.  and stand is kinda metal with good texture.
5,Bright with great resolution!  Excellent for photo editing.
5,The resolution of 16:10 is very comfortable for the office work like Surface pro.
5,Color accuracy is the advertised quality but the 1:1 size accuracy is much more useful.
3,It's a little small and very ugly. Boxy not sleek.
5,Great for WFH!
5,This monitor is bright clear crisp.
5,the picture quality is excellent and it makes photo editing a breeze!
2,Good display sadly dead pixel
5,. The only poor feature are the built-in speakers. Otherwise I absolutely love this monitor
5,lo colores son increibles
5,I love this gaming monitor.... It’s HDMI high quality video...Love it....
5,Increíble
5,Good value for the money
5,It is fine.
5,High quality monitor with beautiful colors.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this monitor to use as an external monitor for my 2019 macbook pro running macOS 11.13.1 (Big Sur). It worked the first day I got it but ever since when I connect my macbook pro to the monitor via USB-C my mac doesn't give me the option to select the external monitor. I know there's power going from the monitor to my mac because my mac will actually charge when connected to the monitor.  In other words it's not a loose cable issue. I've also tested various combinations or power on / power off / plug in sequences to no avail.Maybe Big Sur is the issue but in either case this is a disappointment. Next time I'll shell out the extra $$ and buy a Pro Display directly from Apple.
2,I ordered this to use as the primary monitor for use with a new MacBook Pro.  I could not get adequate image quality even for word processing files or spreadsheets.  Quite a disappointment.  My comparison was a 12-year-old iMac whose image quality was vastly better.
1,The HDMI output failed after just 2 months of using it.I tried to connect the HDMI cord to a  different laptop still did not work. USB C is fine.I'm not sure if the HDMI port broken or the cord itself.
1,Nice idea to have a smaller portable screen. But when I received mine the touchscreen didn’t work. You could essentially look at it like adding another plain monitor to your setup and that was about it. After all the settings were gone through and calling Asus for assistance the touchscreen part still didn’t work. Sadly I returned it and picked something else out.
1,Yellow out of the box. Not calibrated or they want me to believe otherwise. I changed the color settings black level contrast and even used Windows calibration yet I was not able to reach white balance. Sucks.It came with a color calibration testing report which is all fabricated.
1,I got one of these at first it was fine but after a day or two i noticed a yellowish tint coming up from the bottom. I assumed this was just an error and got the monitor replaced. The replacement has the same issue. I will be returning it and would not recommend if you need accurate colors for photography video or graphic design.Without the tint issue it is a nice look large display but this is unusable for my needs.
2,If using this to double as a TV/Roku don't bother. The sound is horrible.  I currently have sound up to 100 with headphones and it's at a 'normal' sound.
1,I recently purchased this product and was enjoying it! Now after you just owning it for a couple of weeks the HDMI port doesn't seem to work. I've tried utilizing a few different HDMI cords and dongles but nothing seems to help - it just shows as "HDMI Port No Signal"
1,At least 10 dead pixels scattered around. I wish i noticed sooner. I didn't use this monitor for awhile and i just noticed outside the return window. $200 waste
1,The box arrived with a dent on the side of the box (see two photos). Once I set it up and turned it on it had a few dead pixels on the bottom left corner of the panel. Huge bummer.
5,Replaced my old dell u2142m 16:10 24 inch monitor.  I can confirm this is a good monitor with good build quality good color adjustable stand great viewing angles and a nice matte screen that feels almost glossy.  It's well done let's hope it lasts.For those unfamiliar with 16:10 it's more of a golden ratio for more vertical space than 16:9 monitors which are the norm.  The mix is great for both productivity and entertainment almost too much so easy to get addicted and just sit in front of the screen all day.  These monitors are bigger than you think and hardly anybody makes normal sized (20-22 inch) monitors anymore in anything other than 16:9.Yes you can downsize resolution in Windows but it just doesn't feel as good.  The downside to these 24 inch 16:10 monitors is how much space they take up.  Be prepared with a large desk.But then again what do I know.  Apparently the norm now is for 27 inch and higher screens.  Insane.
1,Arrived damaged very disappointed. Shipping box was completely fine—definitely a product quality issue.
5,I bought this for work from home purpose so it saves me the hassle of getting a separate power chord for my laptop. I could use the type c cable to connect my laptop as well as providing power.No complain at this price point.
5,Very solid all-around monitor. Slightly higher (1980 *1200) resolution than standard Full HD monitors as well as 16:10 aspect ratio allows for more information to be displayed on screen which is great for coding graphic design even audio production.
4,This is a preliminary review; I've only owned my pair of ProArt 24" monitors (model PA248QV) for three weeks as of this writing.image quality for the price: four starsmonitor stand quality for the price: five starsinitial product quality: five starssuitability for most office work: five starssuitability for graphics design: three starssuitability for gaming except for super fast-paced titles: four stars+durability and longevity: unknownI wanted two monitors for coding and design and to read and watch stuff on the Internet including a great deal of black-on-white text complex images requiring careful interpretation and video for business and pleasure.I chose this monitor for the pivot to vertical the extra resolution (helpful for viewing of text in both landscape and portrait orientations) the extended color gamut (at least 100% sRGB) high color fidelity correct display of hue when facing head-on and wide usable viewing angles (good for collaborations or stand-up work). But see CON at end of review.Nice-to-haves included the abundant USB3 ports screen brightness (300 nits while low for graphics professionals is high for consumer monitors) easy brightness and blue light reduction and the 75 Hertz refresh rate. I didn't care much about response time (this monitor is merely average in that regard).A missing feature is that with only one DisplayPort socket these monitors cannot be daisy-chained. I have one connected on a DisplayPort and the other on an HDMI port.Owning the monitor revealed some additional pros and also a con or two.PRO:* Solid classy-looking metal and plastic monitor stand. It's clean and professional looking - I like! My one unfilled desire is for the stand to allow the bottom of the screen to rise further than 5 1/4" off the table.* Monitor gets as bright as I want it and it's easy to dim. it's also easy to reduce blue light but obviously that changes display colors to a warmer palette.* Yes the colors are solid in standard mode. This is just an entry-level design tool but it really does work hard with the budget it has. You want to review your material in sRGB or Rec. 709 modes? This monitor makes it easy.* While there is no remote the control buttons work well (not true of all monitors).* Low but faintly noticeable monitor edge bleed. Even for serious movie watching it's not too bad and it's more than adequate for any other purpose.* No bright or dead pixels in my two units on delivery. No obvious flaws in the red green or blue display anywhere on screen. Fairly good display of both very dark and very light colors. This is an IPS screen so blacks will not be super-dark but I didn't need them to be.CON:This monitor is not without tradeoffs. It's a ~$200 monitor and these will appear somewhere. The one that really caught my attention is vignetting - darkening (and slight yellowing) around the edges particularly near the bottom edge.So my preference for placing the top of my monitor only just a bit above eye level needed revision. I had to raise my ProArt monitors so that my gaze centers no more than 2/3rds of the way up the screen in order to reduce the darkening (and yellowing) of the bottom of the screen to a level that I was satisfied with. The monitor stand was not able to do this so I've had to extend it with a home-brew solution. The correct answer would have been to use a VESA mount but I didn't feel like paying for one.Another con is that colors are only true when looking at the screen face-on. When looking at the screen at an angle on either side colors appear slightly bluer and the screen slightly dimmer. This effect appears faintly on both sides even when sitting directly in front of the monitors ~2 feet away.These CONs don't stop me from being glad I forked over the money for this particular monitor at least as an early assessment. Where will do you better for the price? My ProArt 24"s really do match my particular use-case quite well and they get four stars. Whether they will be as good for you depends on your own desires and your own preparedness to pay for them.
4,The color is very accurate as described. The design and material look premium. However I bought it from the ASUS US store. One port of USB type-c didn't connect to my laptop. I can’t connect my laptop to the second USB Type-C port—only the first one work. I did call ASUS support. They said I got defect product and recommended returning it. I tested the monitor after I received it within a day. Make sure you checked all the ports for the connection.[UPDATE] I order the new one from Amazon the week after. For Amazon stock both USB Type-C ports can connect to my laptop perfectly. I can use a monitor with only one USB Type-C thunderbolt connection. However you can use it only for display. If you watch Youtube using speakers on the monitor you need to use an adapter since it requires more energy consumption for both sound and visual.
5,The monitor is very usable just out of the box. I only connected it to the computer using the included HDMI cable and checked black levels white labels contrast colors... it all looked good.The monitor is okay to use by one individual maybe with one close friend sitting shoulder to shoulder. I am saying that because when sitting more to the side the image gets somewhat washed out. Lateral viewing angles were better on my old Dell and Planar VA monitors (contrast too).I have one dead (sub)pixel just out of the box - one red one half towards the side of the screen. Not normally noticeable.Colors are great. Color and overall image uniformity are great. No noticeable light bleed on black background display tests using uniform backgrounds show uniform colors.Very nice adjustable stand. I was also considering the Acer CM2241W but the rounded shape of the stand kept me off - I need flat space on my desk where I can set things down without them rolling.This monitor is not supported by Asus ProArt Creator Hub so that's a drawback.Power consumption seems to be 15W (LED backlight). That's the only positive compared with my old and trusty Dell 2408WFP which uses 68W while in use (CCFL backlight) and still works like a champ - great colors/contrast/viewing angle and no dead pixels after 15 years.Internal speakers work (not great but useable in a pinch).Overall a very nice monitor especially for the price. I remember paying a few times as much for my Dell (not counting inflation). Great for both productivity and video/media consumption.
5,Asus - What a difference a Monitor makes!My previous monitor was showing its ass with dead pixels weird white spots and deterioration around its edges. From the day I got it the colors were ok but not great. I judged the colors on how they registered color bars. A friend came by with his 'Spyder' thingy a couple years ago. I couldn't really see the difference.That said; Amazon.com delivered my new ASUS ProArt Display PA248QV 24.1” monitor.OMG! What a difference a monitor makes! the calibration straight out of the box is off the chain! My RAW files coming out of the Ricoh GR III are amazing! Older images from my Nikon(s) D700 D3400 and even the older D70 have a freshness of detail to me. Now I'm NOT talking cranked up sharpness saturation and color. I'm talking 100% sRGB rendering depth and freshness.OMG #2! The tilt and swivel is a joy on this monitor. The OMG comes with its ability to go from landscape to portrait. I did NOT know that I needed this feature until I tried it. For me this is game changing. I absolutely LOVE composing documents this way. More importantly I had to change the layout for my 'ACDSEE Photo Studio Ultimate 2020' software and now it's better than it was before! I'm coming up a winner all around!My final budget led me to the ASUS ProArt Display PA248QV 24.1” monitor (just under $200) and I couldn't be happier.#DeColonizeTheMind
5,What I liked the most is that it is actually a big screen for what used to be an standard one. The size as you'll see will become an standard base model it's design is simply beautiful modern and for the many setups ways you can use it is great for the price. The only thing I didn't like is you cannot change as default another setting of audio output than the one you are using for screen display which means every time the monitor goes to sleep or you turn it off you have to change again the setting to external jack if you don't want to use HDMI or ViewPort over and over. Good color and good quality.
5,Work wanted me to buy a budget monitor for work-from-home and I was floored to see Asus had a ProArt monitor at the $200 price point. The 24.1" version is perfect for my needs and also suffices for light video editing and gaming. Out of the box the image quality is superb. Refresh rate has been good for console and various racing games. The built-in USB hub came in handy since I'm generally a laptop user. You don't need to calibrate it like mad but if you want to there are plenty of pinpoint controls for color white balance etc. My complaints are nitpicks. First the monitor has 5 buttons but none are dedicated to the SIMPLE task of switching inputs. Second the amazing sRGB mode is tuned for dark rooms but if you want to save a brighter version of it it's a clumsy process to adjust and save a user mode.  Like I said nitpicks.
4,This is a decent monitor I purchased to replace an older ASUS. The only issue I have with this monitor is with the sound levels which are not very loud. It's not a deal breaker.
2,I purchased this to go with my new PC. It’s is mainly used for work or socializing.  One day I turned the pc on and the monitor didn’t come on.  And I disconnected everything reconnected it and checked the power outlet. Everything is fine but I have nothing. I can’t even get the menu up to do a reset as advised.  Don’t buy it. I am stuck with it now because it’s been more than a year but not worth it.
5,I've been looking for a monitor with true colors speaker and adjustable base for a year.  I finally find all 3 for $200!  I didn't know if I'd like the 16:10 but I love it!  The preset color is slightly dark and I wish they'd provide a preset that allowed control of brightness and contrast but those complaints are nits.  I love my new monitor!!!
1,I was able to adjust the brightness (per my last review as it was too dim).UPDATE:  There are NO driver/Utility support for Mac OS.  I can't use the touch control feature where you can make this small screen as a digital control board with Jog wheel and Slider controls.  It's only available on PC.  Firmware is only PC compatible...  I bought the wrong touch monitor and too late to return...  No wonder it was on sale... ugh!!!
5,Great product definitely would recommend for gaming crystal clear image and vivid colors
5,I bought two of these for my dev setup.  I wanted 1080p because that's what my laptop resolution is and I plug in/out to a Thunderbird dock often (so windows are sized consistently).Anyway any bigger than this and the pixel density will be low enough that my text could look mushy.  And since I look at text all day long I wanted it crisp.I also appreciate the flicker free tube and blue reduction settings for eye care that was a major factor for me.The monitor is nicely built.  The stands are exceptional.  They rotate and adjust easily and are very sturdy.  It's a shame I dont use them but I was really impressed with their quality.Side bevels are very thin so these are great for a multi monitor setup.  Vesa mount compatible.  On board speakers are actually pretty good. ​The color is great.  The brightness is way more than I can use.  The 16:10 aspect ratio is nice it's like bonus screen real estate.The menu buttons are on the front for easier use.  You may not this is that important but there are some nice use options like reading mode I probably wouldn't bother using if the menu was difficult to access or navigate.  So I'm glad for this.I can't speak for the color accuracy.  Don't know don't really care about that being knowing they are calibrated so both monitors will look the same with the same display settings which is nice when they're side by side.One of the monitors these replaced is also an Asus and that was about ten years old.  It still works fine so I figure these will have a long life.Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend if you're looking for a 1080p 24/25 inch monitor.
5,This is probably one of the best monitors I’ve used in terms of color reproduction and the size is perfect. Even just for every day usage you can’t beat the picture quality for a monitor that costs only $200. There are plenty of ports including its built-in 4-port USB 3.0 hub. For those that are more sensitive to blue light there are also multiple levels of a blue light filter that can provide a pretty drastic reduction in blue light (just don’t use this if you need absolute color accuracy as obviously it will change how the colors look on screen.) This monitor is also very easy to lift/lower and swivel and it raises high enough that you don’t need to tilt the screen to swivel it to portrait orientation. The only con I could think of is that it could get a little bit brighter for my liking but otherwise it’s an amazing rare-find 16:10 aspect ratio monitor.
5,Loved it! I was looking for a monitor for a while I'm a graphic designer so the color and picture quality was important for me the colors are very accurate to my macbook. This is a great all around screen.
5,this monitor was purchased to replace my previous monitor which died after 10 years.  Its' brightness by default is outstanding.
4,Was downsizing from a 4k TV as a monitor; had the oportunity to do a side by side with ASUS TUF Gaming 23.8" (VG249Q) while I was figuring out what to go with. I did not have any calibration set up (this montior does say it comes that way). Look at the difference VG249Q on bottom; PA247CV on top.Did plenty of reading reviews and watching Youtube videos and both monitors had great ratings but I think  the PA is a clear winner. I'm not a gamer so the faster VGQ doesn't really do it for me. For multitasking and productivity this sceen is awesome with great color reproduction and no black crush. Hope this helps someone or at least saves you some time in making a decison overall. I bought a bunch of them to make my setup; that's how much I love them.
4,It's a beautiful display with thin bezels (except for the chin). It delivers power and data over the included USB-C cable to my M1 MacBook Air. Also comes with a power cable HDMI and Display Port cable. Really great service at a very good price (below $300).It has plenty of USB-A ports on the back and side so it acts as a hub for my other peripherals. The included stand is great too! The 6-axis rotation gives me an ergonomic workstation.I use this monitor for office work and some graphical design. The HD resolution for this is fine but I wish they offered maybe a 2K resolution version. A 27" model with 4K resolution would be very interesting and highly tempting.I deducted 1-Star because the monitor's brightness can't be controlled by my mac. It has to be adjusted manually by clicking the buttons on the chin which makes me feel like a caveman.All in all it gives me a c
5,Super easy to setup - literally plug it in and it's connected to my new M1 Macbook Pro. Great resolution and colors - perfect for design and artwork. Using it while I travel full time in an RV. Perfect solution.
5,What a difference compared to my last monitor. 21.5" to 24". What a beauty! anyone looking for a quality monitor this is the one.
5,I bought this to use a second monitor for my portable workstation (I use a Surface Book 2) while I was traveling. It's a great little monitor that provides an impressive experience for the package that it's in.The monitor is very light and it + the included folio easily fits into my existing PC bag. The screw in attachment for a tripod is super handy I bought a small 1.5' AOKA tripod that collapses down that I use as my monitor stand. It's sturdy and doesn't wobble screws in nicely and gives it added variability on top of the included foldable standing case.There are a plethora of settings on this monitor for brightness color and temp adjustments blue light filtering etc. as well as plenty of good looking presets. The included speakers also sound pretty good and do a good job if you are plugging in something like a phone or Switch for enhanced sound.I use it with an Anker 7-in-1 USB C hub and it works great. I'm able to get 1080p 60 FPS through the mini HDMI out to regular HDMI on the Anker hub. with no flickering or issues as I've had with many other setups through this PC. One wire for the HDMI one for the usb C power (which I plug into an outlet with the included adapter)Really love this monitor would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a second portable monitor for traveling/working/entertainment.
5,I was looking for a portable touchscreen monitor with good color accuracy so I could edit photos while on the go but with a laptop lacking a suitable display. I'm by no means a professional so you'll need to look elsewhere if you plan to use this for jobs.I somehow stumbled across this at $250 so I pulled the trigger despite there being few reviews at the time. I've used it a few days now and my first impressions are quite good!Color accuracy: calibrated out of the box colors appear quite good to me (again not a professional) and certainly several steps up from my laptop's display. Good contrast and vivid colors without appearing too overly saturated.Touchscreen: Good responsiveness no complaints. Somewhat rare in that it's a matte finish touchscreen a lot of touchscreen offerings at least in laptop displays are primarily gloss finish. But the matte finish is nice; blocks reflections and fingertips move smoothly across the surface. I absolutely love having a touchscreen to edit photos in Lightroom as well messing with the sliders is effortless compared to using the trackpad on a laptop.Cons:My review is confidently 5 stars none of these detract enough from the utility of the product to dock any stars but you should know them before buying.The dial on the back is not flush with the back of the display. Fine if you plan to use the kickstand most of the time but i think in a lot of cases I find myself inclined to lay this flat on the lid of my closed laptop which I can't do because the dial is in the way.No internal battery. I knew this when buying but it would still be nice to see as a feature seeing as it's marketed as a portable device. But it doesn't seem to use an outrageous amount of power from my laptop's battery so can't complain too much.2 WEEK update:Starting to pick up some more nuanced flaws in the monitor. Although none that would change my overall opinion of the monitor. Overall sentiment is still very positive.I've been mostly using this as an additional work monitor as I haven't needed it on the go. The adjustable kickstand is an awesome feature because I can lay the monitor down flat enough so that the top bezel doesn't interfere with the bottom of my primary monitor.Works well as a single-cable solution for my laptop just USB-C plug and play no issues.Linux compatibility: I work off a linux laptop and the monitor works as a touchscreen device with a little configuration required although requires the same reconfiguration (which I ended up just setting up a simple macro for) anytime the display turns off or is disconnected/reconnected which is mildly annoying although I don't use the touch functionality much anyway and this is more likely just a linux quirk than anything.Complaint: backlight bleedThe corners control backlight bleed very poorly but for me (again not a professional) this is not of major concern. It's pronounced mostly when viewing dark content on the screen.Kickstand has a small amount of wiggle so getting the exact angle correct can take a little bit of fidgeting but once it hits the tension no issues with it falling down or anything like that.I'll continue to update this review as I encounter more noteworthy characteristics but impressions are overall still very good. Hopefully you find this useful!
5,The PA248QV 24.1” screen quality is excellent for business use. Blue filter makes whites bearable. Many ways to adjust the display quality. Run through a universal dock with HDMI output I achieve the specified 1920 by 1200 resolution at 60 Hz with integrated laptop graphics. The base attaches by the usual ASUS slot and screw mechanism. Very sturdy. The display orientation is extremely adjustable. Height and vertical angle are particularly useful. My webcam sits higher than before but I need to improve my posture anyway. Recommended.
5,I bought this monitor as a gift for my son a graphic artist who uses a MacBook. It had a good combination of important features (accurate color USB-C connectivity) and an excellent price. The display is lovely.One strange hiccup though. When we connected his MacBook to the monitor with USB-C they refused to recognize each other. The monitor worked just fine with a different MacBook using the same USB-C cable. We didn't have time to try his MacBook with a different USB-C monitor.What we ended up doing was buying a USB-C to HDMI adapter and connecting with monitor with the HDMI cable. That works just dandy but it kind of defeats the point of buying a USB-C monitor in the first place.For what it's worth it's a MacBook Pro 13-inch from 2017 and it might not be the monitor's fault at all.
5,Color and adjustments are very goog.
5,Es un monitor muy bueno práctico y liviano. Si lo que necesitas es una segunda pantalla para tu laptop y trabajar más agusto sin duda esta es tu opción. Soy diseñadora gráfica y la diferencia de color es mínima trabajo con una MacBook Air del 2016 y no tuve ningún problema de conexión solo necesité comprar un cable DisplayPort para conectarlo directamente al monitor sin necesidad de adaptador la imagen es clara el texto súper legible no se deforma para nada y además tiene bocinas integradas mi Mac la reconoce instantáneamente 😌
5,Compre este monitor para usar con un iMac MINI M1.  Hice bastante research en linea antes de optar por el sus ProArt.  Hasta ahora muy contento con la compra.  Empaque professional fácil de instalar muy ajustable en todos los sentidos - altura ángulo y muchas opciones en el menu para ajustar brillo etc.  Para trabajar creo que es un tamaño casi ideal.  No lo he usado para juegos solamente como monitor.
5,To stat well packaged it was delivered before schedule.The monitor itself is ready calibrated out of the box I made the calibration with a colorimeter and no changes needed to be made.
5,This monitor is very nice.I already had a proArt and I love them
5,Nothing to complain about ….
5,Nice monitor with tons of adjustments and very easy on my eyes for an 8 hour workday. Highly recommended.
5,nice monitor
5,great product!
5,This display is an upgrade from my HP Paviliom 25xi.Recently returned ViewSonic VG2448 because the image was not clear for 1080p.Positives:- No noticable plastic/chemical odors- Fully adjustable Sturdy Stand- Built in power brick- Clear picture for native resolution of monitor- Fair price for what you get- No noticeable light bleeding- Good viewing angles and no noticable flickering- 16:10 aspect ratio makes the monitor look much bigger.Negatives:- The factory sRGB setting is useless as they had to make it dim to meet Energy Star rating- Blue light reduction option is only available on the factory sRGB setting.- Restrictive menu options- Built in speakers are not good for watching movies or listening to music- Distracting Asus logo- Average black levels- No USB C Video Input- USB ports will not charge anything without a USB computer connection
4,Los colores son efectivamente precisos y tiene modos predeterminados más saturados o con menos brillo para distintos casos de uso y condiciones ambientales de luz.La resolución de 1920x1200 es la mínima para trabajar (escribir o diseñar) si tienes otro monitor. De otra forma para trabajo "serio" recomiendo mejor uno de al menos 1440p aunque estén más caros.La variedad de puertos de video es suficiente. El hub de USB es también apenas suficiente. Con 3 puertos (2 de 900mA y uno de 2A) se gana sólo 2. Conecto una webcam impresora y receptor de ratón y teclado sin poder utilizar el de 2A para cargar un teléfono o algo si fuera necesario. Un multiplexor de USB es necesario para varias PCs si no quieres estar desconectando y conectando cables.La versión más actual (y más cara) soporta Thunderbolt si menos cables es algo que necesitas. Este monitor lo conseguí en menos de USD$200 (a finales de Oct/2020) así que relativamente salió bien dadas las circunstancias con funcionalidad más limitada pero suficiente.
3,This monitor comes at a good price for what promises to be a high optical quality. However I am initially discouraged for several reasons. Firstly the two cables that came with the monitor were an HDMI and a USB distribution cable – no display port cable. Secondly the HDMI cable was very inflexible and I could only get the monitor to work occasionally with it so I had to replace it with one of my own HDMI cable. Thirdly I was disappointed in the stability of the mount which compared unfavourably to my Dell monitors.
4,Great monitor. I’m a graphic designer and the screen real estate plus the calibration makea my job much easier. Only serious flaw is for the VESA mount. After removing the stand and the supplies VESA screws I tried to mount it to the plate. There are very small tabs all the way around the interior of the VESA frame perfectly aligned with the holes. This causes the VESA plate to not actually fit right or align (see attached photos) if unless it’s a couple mm smaller than the inside diameter. To get around this you’ll either need to grind down a significant amount of your VESA plate or cut the tabs from the monitor.
4,Aunque dice que es un Monitor pre-calibrado es difícil entender para que tipo de trabajo. El perfil que según esta precalibrado sRGB es muy opaco y poco brillante con colores desaturados. El cable HDMI es muy malo y desde el inicio me dio problemas con pixeles brilantes y parpadeantes. La calidad es muy buena pero una calibración extra es necesaria.
5,I haven't had any problems of the sort with this screen. My old screen was 7 years old with a pixel discoloration line on the top so I figured it was about time to update especially when I game or Draw.Can't live without a second screen anymore~!Bonus is the movable screen comes in handy in the oddball moments.
5,La verdad que es un extraordinario Monitor grandes colores y sobre todo para mi trabajo que soy desarrollador ayuda mucho poder ponerlo en forma vertical. Recomendado.
5,personnel pour avoir un document word au complet 8 1/2 par 11
5,Excelente
5,Very good picture quality colour and contrast nice clean packaging small frame..  Not used for gaming so can not comment.
5,Exactement comme la description. Très satisfaite de mon achat. Bons paramètres de constrôle de la luminosité et des couleurs.
5,La calidad es muy buena el brillo es el justo. Los colores son muy fieles. Excelente.
5,Excelente funciona de maravilla y tienen una excelente calidad solo el sistema de audio es muy bajo.
5,Awesome monitor worth every penny!
5,good
4,It has a speaker which is nice but some external programs to control the brightness using a connected laptop don’t work on it. Overall has a good space for reading code on it and the colours are nice.
5,La imagen que subo es una página de manga lo increíble es que en persona se ve casi tan real como el papel eso lo pongo por que en lo personal eso es una señal de lo bien calibrados que están los blancos y lo profundos que son los negros. Las imágenes a color son muy nítidas definitivamente si trabajas con colores como ilustrador editor de fotos o videos diseñador o si solo quieres disfrutar de un excelente monitor no lo dudes este es el bueno.Lo que se ne hace interesante es que también es compatible con DCI-P3 para trabajar con impresiónes yo lo compré pensando solo en el sRGB pero el primero es mucho mas útil si eres diseñador.La certificación CALMAN no es nada más para presumir realmente cumple también tiene un modo para trabajar con animación que reduce casi por completo el rastro que dejan los píxeles al cambiar de color en otras palabras una imagen en movimiento no se ve borrosa. Incluso si juegas el monitor es de 75 hz y juegos que no sean fps se disfrutan a lo grande por que los paisajes se ven increíbles. Es un monitor todo terreno.
5,This is a very good monitor with good colour.  Stand is very nice and well constructed.  I have not had occasion to turn the monitor vertically and not sure I ever will but I am very happy with the purchase.  Arrived as expected and I have been using for 6 months now in my home office.
5,Nice picture easy setup and integrated well with our companies new software roll out. Happy with purchase
5,Los colores se ven muy muy bien colores vivos muy brillantes que le dan un toque extra de realismo a las imágenes lo uso como segundo monitor para mi laptop y aunque ambas son ips se ve mucho la diferencia.Tenía mis dudas por qué por la resolución que tiene el precio no es barato pero encontrar un monitor de diseño bueno a este precio es imposible. Es difícil compararlo con otro por qué  no he conseguido otro en Mexico que venga calibrado de fábrica y aunque hay otros por el precio que tienen una mayor tasa de refresco o resolución que venga calibrado es muy muy útil para diseñadores que van empezando y no quieren gastar en las herramientas para calibrar muy recomendado
5,La ergonomía es muy buena puedes ponerlo vertical y horizontal aparte que lo puedes subir y bajar en su mismo eje la imagen para mi es mas que suficiente y los presets que trae me gustaron.
5,amazing for anyone doing photo work 100% colors the only thing i do not like is the base is too big but not bad would buy again !!
5,display adjustment tools are not intuitive and rather clumsyused for CADD work
5,I have a lot a monitor to tv all 4k and wqhd. I Run it on a mac mini the best thing I did is going back to 1080p with this monitor at 24 inch it doest get pixelated and it doesnt eat you video card memory now my lightroom is going well. The mount is sturdy and all the option from rotation to height is very great. The quality of the color the luminosity and the viewing angle are awesome. I bought two of them right away. I finally get a professional monitor in my workflow. Asus Pro Art you rock solid.
3,Colors look strange and picture looks blurry
5,Excellent monitor for photography true to colour 100% rgb
3,La caja del producto estaba dañada tenia cosas escritas y estaba toda llena de cinta. al abrir el producto veo una etiqueta que dice que el producto es reacondicionado eso no lo dice en la publicación.
1,Me toco la desgracia de venir malo con fugas de luz aparte nunca logré calibrar bien y obtener un blanco total se iba al amarillo  decepcionado lo regrese!
1,Total desepciónMi monitor actual es un LG IPS de gama media-baja de hace 10 años.Quise hacer el salto a este supuestamente "profesional" me llamo la atención porque se puede ajustar la altura y el ángulo en todas las posiciones. Además que al ser "Profesional" la imagen venía calibrada para sRGB por lo que este monitor me daría una mucho mejor imagen que mi monitor de gama media-baja.El problema es el siguiente cuando uno tiene un monitor gama media-baja y te gastas $5700 en uno que supuestamente es profesional esperas que la imagen mejore no que empeore.No sé si me tocó una unidad defectuosa pero el balance del blanco no era un blanco neutro si no un blanco amarillento.  Sé que no es el blanco neutro porque mi TV sí la calibraron con herramientas profesionales y comparando te das cuenta incluso comparándolo con un iPad Pro que también vienen relativamente calibrados.Incluso el monitor de hace 10 años da mejor balance de blancos otro problema es la saturación de colores tienden los colores al grisaceo y si intentas subir el color con el RGB Gain o el Six Axis Gain te los satura de inmediato.En resumen mi monitor LG económico tiene mucho mejor imagen que este monitor supuestamente calibrado y profesional mejor lo devolví la verdad no le vi sentido gastar $5700 pesos para empeorar en lugar de mejorar.
5,Listo para ser usado practico
5,stellar piece of equipment for the price.
5,The monitor had one dead pixel out of the box but otherwise an excellent monitor. Used for graphic design college studies and gaming.
5,Looks great.  Functions well so far.  Image quality seems just fine.  A day after getting my first screen I ordered a second one.  Two of these side by side are great (especially with the thin edges.I do not edit video or photos so I won't comment on their colour accuracy.I'm not fussy about the grey base on the unit but the flexibility the stand has for angle and height adjustment is as exceptional as the picture itself.
5,Calidad de imagen muy buena
5,Amazing monitor for the price you pay. I used it for editing photos and the precision of colors is really accurate. Always in SRG.
5,Gran sopresa me he llevado con este monitor. La reproducción de los colores es excelente espero poder pronto comprar el segundo monitor.
5,Relación calidad precio excelente
5,Great monitor for everyday use and for designing.
4,Purchased one for each of our MacBook Air laptops working from home and perfect also for zoom calls.
4,Good display quality but bad sound.
5,Excelente monitor y de muy buena calidad!
5,These screens are great for colour accuracy.  I also like the screen proportions (slightly more square than most).  They work well when using 2 that are side-by-side.
5,Nice screen size for my desk top.  Allows for extension of my laptop and good for looking at test as well as videos. I don't use the speakers for my audio and the sound is not particularly high-fidelity but passable.  Good connectivity .
5,Genial producto!
5,Excelente calidad me gusto mucho la calidad de sus materiales se siente fuerte la imagen se ve de excelente calidad para lo que la utilizo edición de fotos y videos el sonido nada bueno pero eso es irrelevante para mi.
4,good monitor I bought it for photo editing gave it 4 stars because when it came there was a burnt in pixel in the screen. I have a red dot that won't go away. Too much of a hassle to send it back and get a new one so just dealing with it.
5,Me gusta poder cambiar los perfiles de color como diseñador gráfico le encuentro bastante utilidad.El tamaño es muy cómodo y se ajusta la altura fácilmente.
5,I live this and saved my photography when I was editing.  Great value for your money
1,Instead of buying new at $279 I bought a used one on Amazon Warehouse for $249 (Used- Like New). Usually when I buy from the Amazon Warehouse the products come in pretty good condition that I wouldn't notice.While placing the monitor on the stand I noticed it wouldn't stay clipped in and kept falling out. So I'm worried it won't be able to hold the monitor up and looking for a stand to hold it in place instead.I regret that I should have just bought it new spending the extra $30 which I'm doing for an extra stand anyways.The screen when I turn it on  it's overall great for what I need it's just the fear that the monitor will fall out of the stand.So I recommend just buy it new!
5,Everything is perfect that's it
5,Habitué à des moniteurs Dell 2k et 4k uled je trouve que ce moniteur a une résolution adéquate 1920 x 1200 avec un rendu des couleurs supérieur. La carte vidéo de mon laptop 5591 réussi a en driver 2 a 1920x1200 60 hz alors qu'elle n'etait pas assez forte pour 2 en 1540 60hz. J'utilise un hub Dell avec 2 displayport 4k de 3pieds. Meilleures resultats vs 1 hdmi et 1dp. La base est similaire a celui du Dell serie p donc tres stable et ajustable tilt portrait et hauteur. Aucun probleme de reconnaissance avec le hub usb integré soit 8 usb 3.0 pour les 2 ecrans... le tout à travers une connection usb c de mon laptop. Le fait d'avoir le transformateur integré au display aide la gestion d'espace pour un bureau avec 2 moniteurs 24p. Avec les Dells je ressentait le besoin de retoucher la tonalité des couleurs de mes photos avec appareil haut de gamme. Avec le Proart je retouche beaucoup moins les couleurs et contraste... Je suis critique quand à mon setup et ce moniteur me satisfait. La durabilité reste à voir de ce côté je confirme que les Dells de serie P ne déçoivent pas.
5,This is the budget monitor that I’ve been waiting for to pair up with my MacBook Pro. I can easily tweak the colours to match any profile and the build quality is absolutely amazing.
5,El monitor da unos colores espectaculares además puedes modificar cada aspecto del mismo también lo utilizo para jugar en mis tiempos libres y la verdad 10/10 claro si vas a jugar a nivel competitivo este monitor no es para ti pero si juegas más casual es un muy buen monitor
5,La verdad por las características que tiene el monitor es una opción realmente buena para quienes buscan portabilidad y calidad en imagen.
5,Es un monitor de excelente calidad y práctico cuando se necesita usarse en varios equipos por ejemplo lo conecto en mi MacBook Air y en una laptop lenovo  y ya que el puerto usb c carga los dispositivos me he olvidado de usar cargador  y además puedo usar los puertos del monitor para conectar un disco duro externo y un driver de mouse  así usándolo en las 2 computadoras sin necesidad de desconectar todo cada vez que me cambio de equipo
5,Does what I expect
5,Este es un monitor excelente si eres diseñador o te dedicas a la edición pues se nota l la gran diferencia en n cuánto a colores brillos y sobre todo los grises ten seguridad que tendrás colores reales a la hora de trabajar lo recomiendo ampliamente para el trabajo profesional de edición tampoco se queda corto a la hora de jugar por el freesync pero a un así vale totalmente la ñenat
4,Love the monitor or and all it’s features
5,El monitor lo uso principalmente para desarrollo de aplicaciones para lo cual utilizó el filtro de luz azul para evitar la fatiga de la vista y es muy apropiado. También lo uso para revelar mis fotografías digitales en fomato raw razón por la cual me incliné por este modelo y debo decir que los colores son muy vivos y realistas lo cual no lograba con mi monitor anterior Benq. Me encantó ya que desde el angulo que lo veas no se altera el color y ademas tiene un diseño muy agradable con bordes muy delgados. Lo recomiendo.
5,Well worth the extra buck. I don't do gaming.
1,El producto llegó abierto sin sus cables (ni para transmitir video ni de corriente) y sin su C-Clamp ademas parece ser un producto devuelto porque no viene calibrado correctamente y no trae ningún plástico de protección ni siquiera tiene sus tarjetas de calibración ni de pro art ni ninguna documentación. Ya solicité la devolución espero eso sí lo hagan bien.Box was already opened without any seal indicating is a new product. None of the cables came with it (not even power cord). C-Clamp isn’t in the box either. It seems to be a returned product since it is not calibrated and has any protective screen on the bezels or anywhere. Calibration report ProArt Welcome Card and all other documentation is missing as well. I already asked for returning I hope they do this well at least.
