5,love it. Splendid packaging. Exceptionally fast delivery. Excellent service. Splendid seller. An immensely exceptional seller.
5,Great price
5,Perfect product! Exactly what I needed! Will buy again
5,I  liked them very much. I've used almost all of them for our movies.  Thanks ðŸ˜Š
4,These DVD sleeves are a bit thinner and flimsier than those produced in the past but inflation being what it is one might expect as much. Still they do the job of protecting the surface of the disk quite well and the poorer quality is mostly cosmetic.
4,Little thin
5,We make a lot of cd copies so these are perfect for our needs
4,The product was used for sleeves for cd's.
5,Thee product was late reaching me and was three days later than the expected delivery date. But I do not feel it was the seller nor Amazon's problem. I think it was our "efficient" Postal Service.The envelopes are well made and of a heavier material so I was pleased with the produce when finally received.
5,We use these at Robotic Orthopaedic Institute when patients bring a disc of their MRIs and x-rays. So often they are sent in bubble wrap from the imaging center by mail and they don't include a cover. We then use our software to create two identification labels that are placed on the envelope and the disc itself. We put them in a shoe box because it fits perfectly in the cover. We also purchased the CD alphabetical guides to sort them by last name.
5,No issues
5,It's a paper CD cover that I've had for about a month. Well actually it's a pack of covers. It looks like there's 100 or so in the pack. I'm not gonna count them. I did notice that a CD fits inside nicely. Oh and there's a clear window on one side that lets you see the CD. How cool is that? Besides the folding top that keeps the CD inside that's my favorite feature and I don't think they charge extra for these features. 5 stars!
3,not thick but ok
4,Great product and I would purchase again
5,No complaints
5,Let me start by saying I used to buy only the 500 count of Kodak cd/dvd paper sleeves that is until they quit making them years ago.  I liked the quality as they were thicker than other brands and withstand the test of time.  I am down to my last two boxes of sleeves and had to start looking around for an identical alternative as I will go through these fairly quick.  I use the reference for Kodak as they were high quality and had more high reviews at the time they were made than the other brands.I saw the reviews of these Maxtex Premium White Paper cd/dvd sleeves and though priced a bit higher than the 500 count Kodak boxes (you can only buy these 100 at a time and not 500 so cost per 100 is higher) I thought I would give them shot. Since they were sold only in packs of 100 i've spent $6 or so in worse ways and i'd be able to use them for something if they turned out cheesy.  Well to my surprise they were very good quality paper sleeves and very comparable.How close in comparison?  Well I put them side by side and then mixed up a couple of them and showed my wife.  I told her to pick the Kodak one.  She said they were the same in looks and feel and both were Kodak.  One was Kodak and one was Maxtek that is how close they are in comparison.  There is a slight cosmetic difference in the fold and the size of the little flap the holds the fold if you elect to use it.  The differences are so minimal and you really have to look.If you want a thicker higher quality paper sleeve these Maxteks will make you happy.  These are the 100 pack and not the 1000 pack that seem to be a more generic and thinner paper according to many of the reviews I read here though both are made by Maxtek.  I'd much rather buy them by bulk but not through loss of quality so I will stick to these 100 packs.
5,These are good envelopes for your DVDs and CDs
5,I needed sleeves.  I got sleeves. They work and they are reliable.  I will order more when I run out.
5,I looked at most of the CD and DVD sleeves and this looked liked a better quality than most.And at a good price.
5,Exactly as described
5,Quick delivery on order.  Timely for the DVD+Rs I just received also.  Nice match!
5,I was just telling a friend about them today and will give him a few to try!  They are VERY sturdy and well made - not to mention the size is "just right" in that I don't have to squeeze in the disks and fear having the sleeves rip like what has happened with previous sleeves I've purchased!
5,I cannot comment on durability or sturdiness because I've only just begun to use them.  However they seem to be strong -- only time will tell.Pricewise they are a good value.
5,So for the last 30 years I've amassed several hundred CDs DVDs and Blu-rays all ripped to a home server. Instead of wasting valuable storage space by keeping them in their original cases I decided for CDs I would keep the disc and the liner notes and for the most part these envelopes hold up wonderfully. I can fit two to three CDs and their associating liner notes in one envelope though normally it's just the one CD and its liner notes. For DVDs I only keep the disc and toss the rest and these work great for that too. This has reduced my overall storage needs by about 60%. I'm currently storing the envelopes on their sides (don't store optical media face down...) inside Sterilite 18 quart containers (the ones with the clear lid are best). These envelopes are a godsend.
5,Value
5,I order these CD/DVD envelopes several times a year. They do the job and always arrive promptly.
5,Work good cds and dvds fit perfect.
5,White
5,Iâ€™m looking for a different way to store and organize both DVD/BLU-RAY  and CD. Iâ€™m frustrated with album style storage - always running out of room and difficult to add new releases with like stuff. So far just placing the disc (and info sleeve with some of the CDs ) has been easy and they take up way less space. The envelopes appear sturdy enough to handle shuffling through and occasionally taking them out and allow sorting easily. It should make it easier for kids to make choices and find what they want and for me to grab a couple CDs for long trips(even with lots on my phone and many playlists to chose from there are times when popping in a CD is a welcome change. Happy with product.
5,I am a curator and manage multiple archives that has thousands of M-Discs and other optical discs to conserve. I had been using Walmart Onn sleeves which were unbelievably the heaviest sleeves available I could find. Walmart  discounted them so was looking for a new heavy sleeve. The Maxtek Premium sleeves are about the same in thickness as the Onn sleeves. Very happy with the Maxtek sleeves.Daniel D.Teoli Jr. Archival CollectionDaniel D.Teoli Jr. Small Gauge Film ArchiveDaniel D.Teoli Jr. VHS Video ArchiveDaniel D.Teoli Jr. Audio ArchiveDaniel D.Teoli Jr. AdvertisingÂ ArchiveDaniel D.Teoli Jr. Social Documentary Photography
