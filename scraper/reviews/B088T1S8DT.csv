5,I really love the bag. I haven't put it into a lot of use so in terms of durability (since it's not that long ago that I received the item) I can't give an accurate review.In terms of capacity it lives up to its size. It's able to hold my laptop along with the wireless mouse a notebook a too do list as well as a pencil holder with enough room for the cables for all my electronics. The bag still has enough room to include other items without an issue of closing the zipper. Plenty of room and pockets to separate the items anyone would need to include in the bag.My only issue is that when receiving the bag after removing the shipment bag and inspecting the item there was this unnatural smell. There is no good way to explain it other than it was unpleasant and i feared any items stored inside might get the smell attached to them.I had to spray the bag inside and out with Lysol and continually let it air out for days before the smell eventually died down. It's a tedious and time-consuming extra step but the bag worked well afterwards with no other present issues. All the other reviews mentioning the smell kind of makes you expect it but not really look forward to it.It does live up to the water prof feature after needing to spray it so much there was no damage or visible water invasion inside the bag of any kind that wasn't intentional.Overall so far I would recommend the bag it's not bad at all for the current price but id prepare to possibly have to fight off the smell before being able to use it immediately.
5,I love how sturdy it is and the fact that it expands is great too. It has more than enough pockets the padded strap makes it really easy to carry and the color looks exactly the same as it did online. I would definitely recommend this bag!
5,It is the zippered compartments for me! I was in search of the right bag to transport a 16 inch laptop cords mouse  folders and other  office accessories while traveling. This is it! The padded pockets with zippers made the difference.  Additionally the wide shoulder strap is a plus! Everything fits perfectly. I highly recommend.
5,The main pocket has a nice padded divider to keep your laptop snug while leaving plenty of room for your books charger etc.. The bag feels sturdy with metal and padding and even after getting caught in the rain everything inside was completely dry.
5,Sturdy and straps are strong. I just used it on a trip to Florida and it's exactly what I needed for my bigger laptop. I was able to fit my husband's chrome book and all power cords in too. I highly recommend this bag!
4,Good and durable  but gets filled fast when u add 15" laptop and accessories  with room for nothing more  could have had more pockets. Good but not great.
5,It's a Computer Case.  It has adequate alternate storage.  I ordered it on Thursday and it was in my possession on the following Monday.
4,It doesn’t have any extra corner padding. But it is a pretty good bag and would recommend.
5,It works great computor fits perfect
4,The bag looks like the one I ordered it has lots of pockets and storage. However it STINKS like hot melted plastic and rubber. I can smell it from feet away it’s pretty gross.
5,Really like this bag. Good padding and light weight for travel. Has pockets and separate compartments for all your needs.
5,Durability
4,This is exactly as described.  I ordered a purple one and received a gray one but love !
5,Handles are a must which I didn't realize until I helped a friend carry hers once.After that I won't use my old computer case anymore.This one is so much better than my old one without handles.It is padded well and has plenty of room for the cord and other stuff.
5,I really like how it perfectly fits my laptop. Product came in perfectly no scratches no issues whatsoever.This is now my daily laptop bag - it has nice storage for different items. The "extendable" zipper is great to have in case you want to carry more items in the bag.Great bag!
4,Feels and looks great!
5,Love how roomy this is. My 15 inch laptop is more like a... 15.5 inch laptop? So the 15inch holder I bought for it would NOT fit since it's thicker and has a stylus on the exterior. It wouldn't even zip if you could get it in and it was so thin that taking it back out usually resulted in a broken nail.THIS case however is amazing. Lots of room extra pockets-- which are ALSO roomy thank you-- expandable nice padding 2 handles so you can carry it like a briefcase and metal clips to install the shoulder strap. I love it. It's great. It's roomy enough that I can fit my charger alongside it as well.
5,This laptop case is perfect for either of my two 17" laptops. The case can hold the laptop plus accessories and still look great hanging from my shoulder with the included strap. It's an elegant solution to carrying my oversize laptops. I'm very pleased with this case.
5,I love this bag. Comfortable to ware. Well made with lots of storage and pockets.  Not flimsy but also not too stiff.  You look like a straight G wearing it.  Happy with my purchase with no complaints.
5,I was looking for a light-weight bag to easily hold my 17” laptop computer charging cord and a few other incidentals in one bag.  This fit the bill.  It was reasonably priced and came in a lovely shade of plum. So far I have only good things to say about it; however if I had one thing to ‘improve’ I would probably recommend the designer add a bit more padding around the area that a laptop goes.  I am moderately careful how I treat my computers and so I’m not overly worried about it traveling in this bag but life happens and a little more padding would go a long way.  Having said that I like this bag overall because of the price what it can hold and it looks stylish!  :-)
4,It looks sturdy but I just got it so I don't know how long would it last me.I have a 17.3" computer and it fits pretty tight or snug. It's not big enough to carry all the stuff I need.I bought another brand for my husband and it has lots of room for all his stuff.
4,I bought this bad for my spouse but she does not like it. The bag is too large for a slim bag. The shoulder strap is not comfortable.
5,Love the color and inside storage
5,The case is compact easy to access the computer and sturdy.
4,It's fantastic. I'd give it 5 stars but they forgot to send me the shoulder strap. I sent an email to their customer service but they never responded. Perhaps they'll read this review.
5,It's much better than the free bag that came with my laptop I think it's good to go!
4,Quality is as I expected. The fabric feels like it would be more appropriate for something akin to outdoor upholstery however the functionality of the laptop bag seems to be practical enough for four stars at the price I paid.
4,I like that this item accommodates my laptop cooling pad and mouse. However It is only lightly padded and I am not sure how much protection it provides if dropped.
5,Have not really had a chance to use yet-just got it yesterday!  You guys are so prompt in delivering (a good thing!) but then want a review right away-doesn’t make sense.  It looks great like the color (grey) like all the pockets shoulder strap looks good.  All I can say right now.
5,I gave this book bag to my mom she loves it great quality and has enough pocket to hold her Bible and song books in them and magazines. Yes I would recommend this bag too others very nice made
5,This bag fits my 17.3" laptop the power cable+adapter my portable monitor (Asus MB169B+) travel mouse notepad and a few other things.  Excellent stitching very sturdy. I love the option to carry as tote or messenger bag and outside side+inside pockets. Another inch or so on the expandable part would have been nice.  Otherwise I'm pleased with my purchase.
5,Just received this Voova laptop bag. It is perfect for my Dell 17” Laptop. Includes several pockets for business travel needs and expands when you need a little more room.
5,Fits my Dell 15' laptop without any problems.  A little more padding at the bottom (opposite the handle) would be an improvement.
3,I want to like this bag - for the price point it's well constructed with solid zippers and decent padding for a soft laptop bag.  You could accidentally drop your laptop in the bag and you should avoid damage.  Despite it's slim size it can hold more than you'd expect.  Strap is not the best but good enough and I use this strictly to carry my laptop and some files back and forth from work.The only major downside was the smell - it had that smell of plastic and chemicals some new luggage have and it was overpowering both inside and out.  I tried the usual tricks - baking soda Febreeze charcoal dryer sheets - but ended up soaking it in a mixture of 1 part vinegar 4 parts water before taking advantage of a heat wave to dry it off in the sun.  After that I tried the dryer sheets and baking soda and now after 10 days from receipt I can finally start to use it though there is still a faint plastic-chemical odor.  Hopefully the residual smell goes away with time.Update:  Smell hasn't gone away after a month despite all the tricks.  Can't return it with all the different attempts at cleaning it.  I'm hoping the smell goes away but it might take a lot longer than I thought.  Disappointing since the bag itself is quite nice.Update #2:  After 3 months of every attempt possible to get rid of the smell I had to give up and throw it away.  Even the shoulder strap stank so I couldn't even repurpose that for some other bag.  I don't know what the hell that smell is - I had this bag soaking a couple days in a tub full of a vinegar solution (3 parts water 1 part vinegar 1 part lemon juice) and you can't smell the vinegar or lemons (color didn't change so that whatever dye they used is amazing or might be the source of the smell).
5,I got purple. Lol so cute and so much better than my 20 yo green case. Lots of pockets and seems to be well padded
4,This was a bigger laptop bag than I really needed.  It doesn't unzip "all the way around" - just at the top which may or may not make you like it.  However the zippers are nice and strong and they're easy to use.  All the compartments may be superfluous unless you're like me and carry around lots of stuff in addition to your laptop.  My machine has a 14" diagonal screen and is 13.89 inches wide and fits with a lot of room inside.  Again - this may be good or bad depending on how you view it but the bag easily swallows the power supply bluetooth mouse bluetooth external speaker plus documents and printed materials very easily.  I can't vouch yet for the weatherproofness - some might come in through the zippers so in a pouring rain you should still be wary but the main case seems water and beverage resistant like the photo shows.It's not a "premium" bag but for this price it's a winner.  I wanted something with strong handles and good stitching because I carry around a lot of stuff in addition to the laptop itself.  This will do the job.
5,I've used this bag for a few months now and I can't say I've had any issues. I did however drop my bag and it landed directly on one of the corners and managed to put a dent in the corner of my laptop. Not a fault of the bag it was my stupid clumsiness that caused this. However I think with additional padding or a hard plastic insert or some kind would have prevented the damage to my Lenovo.That being said I really like the bag and it accommodates my 14" 2-in-1 a mouse my ethernet adapter & a note book with ample room to spare. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.
5,Its inexpensive and very handy for carrying laptop
4,I just got this in the mail. I immediately loaded it with:In the main compartment:15in 2019 MacBook ProKindle (probably 8in or so. I can't remember)4 chargers and 4 respective cordsWalletIn the back compartment:11in 2020 Ipad Pro2nd Gen Apple Pencil (magnetized to ipad)In the front organizing pocket:PhonePassport (if we can ever travel again)2 pocket sized booksAnd I clipped the case of my over the ear headphones to one of the metal loops.First impressions after loading it up:• The front organizing pocket fills up rather quickly but it seems like there's still room for the random airport purchases that are predictable yet I always forget before I leave. Stuff like gum advil napkins kleenex portable utensils granola/nut bar etc.• The Apple Pencil is too tall to fit in the pen/pencil compartments and still be able to zip the pocket closed. My phone had to fit horizontally in one of the organizing pockets.• I really like the feel of the fabric and the cushion on the arm strap. I walked around my house for a bit and it seems pretty comfortable.• Unzipping the extended portion was a must for how I wanted my stuff to fit.That's pretty much it. If you travel light then this is a great bag. If you like to bring or need to bring more with you then I think a bigger bag would be a better fit.
4,So far looks good professional maybe durable is the size and the fabric
5,Great size for HP 17.3 laptop. Too bad the laptop had to be returned. For now I have a pricey bag to carry my lunch.
5,Here is a basic laptop bag that does the the minimum.. It carrys the laptop mouse & charger. It can fit a few more trinkets & folders or what not. But this is just what I needed for a decent price & nothing more.
5,So far I like everything about the laptop case but I have only had it for a short time.  It has plenty of room for my laptop the charger cord the wireless mouse an external hard drive and any additional items I think I might need.  Seems to be well made.
5,I love this case.  I feel like my 17 inch Dell will be secure and protected in this case.  There is also room for my backup hard drive cord and mouse.  There is also a nice spot for my ipad and cell phone.  It is well padded.  I got the Blue and I really like it.  Have no complaints at all.
5,Perfect size durable but good weight space for notebook/files without bulk!
5,I love the style the color and that it is well made.
4,I like the color I bought this for a portable DVD player and it works but the pictures makes it look like you can get a lot more in it than what you can. Even unzipping expander I still can't get everything init I need too. I still end up putting the rest of what I need in another bag. I use this for my daughter homeschool stuff for travel. I can get the DVD player (which is the same size as a 17" laptop we measured) and about 7 folders in the main compartment. The front pocket will hold her charger and pens and pencil and the back compartment holds her DVDs. Was hoping to get her three textbooks (they are not the big hardback books normal school use they are half size paperback books.)to fit as well but nope I have to carry them separately. But that's not to say it isn't a good bag just be advised mostly  just a laptop and very few other things will fit in this bag even fully extended.
5,I GOT THE BURGANDY COLOR. ITS BOLD LOOKING AND I CAN'T LOOSE IT.I CAN TELL AT A GLANCE IT IS MY CARRYING CASE INSTEAD OF BLACK.
5,Love the expanding width to accommodate extra files along with my laptop.  As this case is larger than my last one I often find myself digging for small loose items.  There are small pockets for pens cards and other traditional brief but it could use a zipper pocket for change and a key hook.
5,I always find writing reviews on a new item a bit problematic but so far this bag has been exactly what I asked for. Routinely I haul the laptop and multiple attachments from our town home to the farm and back.  Everything fits and nothing has broken or come undone.  The bag quality is very good.
4,Not enough protection directly on the bottom of the casing. Added some myself DYI
5,It’s a nice fabric simple and strong. Can’t pack it full of items but I like it.
5,I love the bag and its very sturdy. I have a 15inch lap top and it fits perfect
5,So far I’m very happy with this bag! It fits my HP ProBook x360 and still has room for documents and files. The zippered compartments on the outside are great for your charger and other items that you want to keep secure. I love the color and the shoulder strap is a plus! The only reason that I didn’t give it a 5 for durability and sturdiness is because I haven’t traveled with it enough to really say how it holds up. So far it seems to be perfect for my needs. I would recommend this bag!
5,Me gustó mucho porque aparte de la laptop también le cabin un par de libros y cuaderno.
5,Lots of space color beautiful!!  Overall great bag
5,This bag is great for a larger laptop - I believe my work laptop is 17 inches.  It travels well and has a large pocket in the back that is open for all your cords and charging cables and the front pocket has areas for pens etc… love it!
5,Love my laptop bag’s durability. The construction is very sturdy and it makes traveling comfortable and easy to carry. No worries of damaging my laptop!
5,is in fact water resistant. well padded. i dropped my laptop in this case and it was completely protected.
5,Gracias
5,Nice bag for traveling with your laptop.
5,Very Nice sturdy back for laptops Ipads and accessories.The only negative there is are no straps on the back of the bag to hook onto your large suitcase.
5,Love the style and functionality of this bag. Has a lot of pockets to store different items. Laptop is stored very well while still allowing room for other materials.
5,This spacious 15-15.6 inch laptop bag is well-built and the main compartment easily fits my OMEN HP 15 Gaming Laptop. FYI my laptop dimensions are: 14.17 x 10.35 x 1.02in (W x D x H). Additionally it has enough room to comfortably fit the following gear:1). A fairly large A/C power adapter;2). A full-sized corded Logitech G500s gaming mouse;3). A USB-C cable that's more than 6 feet long;4). The included shoulder strap that came with this sleeve;I was then able to easily fit the loaded laptop bag into a regular size JanSport school backpack. I can probably fit my cell phone in it and a few other small items as well.The build quality material on the Voova Laptop Bag is excellent and appears to be durable and tough enough to last for many years to come. In my opinion this bag is sufficiently padded to withstand and protect my laptop from accidental drops and falls.With the added feature of converting to a shoulder carry bag this sleeve is a very good value for the price. This laptop bag has all of the features and functionality that I was looking for and I heartily recommend it.
5,This was perfect as a laptop bag and enough space for additional items. Beautiful color and sturdy material.
5,Lots of space and storage spot options
5,Have not travel yet but soon will be gravy with it.
4,This is a good laptop bag. I haven’t traveled with it yet. But I did use it to transport my computer when I moved. I’m very skeptical though when it comes to the padding to secure the laptop. I believe it is too thin. I guess we shall see.
4,This case is sewn well and made from acceptable quality material but unfortunately it does not afford great protection.  There is ample padding for the two large flat computer sides but little to no padding for the edges and corners. There is also no material built in to prevent the zipper from scratching the computer (though a neoprene sleeve would help in this regard).  There is insufficient room to tuck a piece of 1/4" foam (that is dense enough to afford protection) in the pocket formed by the outer zipper which makes the bag expandable.The case is a good value if all you need is a carry bag that does not offer better protection or an expandable bag is a priority but it falls a little short where protection is concerned.
5,Excelente producto muy espacioso y confortable.
4,love how deep this is and the expansion zipper is awesomethe 4 stars is because the color was not what was picturedit is ok I just don't love it
5,Keeps the computer safely and has compartment for other items. Sturdy and easy to travel with. Good for the money.
5,This laptop bag was a perfect fit for my 17" Dell laptop.  It is very well made and waterproof.  It was everything I was looking for in a computer bag.
4,Great product! But I did NOT  receive the shoulder strap and I have been attempting to reach you guys to see if you could send one.
5,I've now had this laptop bag for a couple of months and made several trips with it. It's not fancy or expansive but I'm all about durability and practicality and this was a really great choice for me.I have a 15.6" laptop and this 17" bag is really the perfect size for it. Lots of zippers & pockets expandable made of a very tough synthetic fabric and very nicely stitched together. Most importantly for me the handles are the perfect width to fit over the retractable handle on my rollaboard suitcase. This computer bag is a great buy.
3,Too thin for what I want Thought it would be more spacious . Thought it would slip over large luggage handle but does not.
5,It's big enough to carry around my 13 in drawing tablet (about 17in with bezels) 15 inch computer and all the accessories for both
5,Light and cheap good quality . Love it !
5,My 17" laptop and my 10" tablet along with their cords and chargers both fit into this case with room to spare and I haven't needed to unzip the expander gusset yet. I like the full width zipper outer pockets on both sides too they're padded outside and inside. The velcro secured inner divider keeps the interior organized plus it's padded too. The fabric and construction feel sturdy and I'd say this bag is a good value for the price
5,Fits 15.6 - 17in with lots of room for phone pens even a tablet or Ipad. Also strong and sturdy strap that helps. There is room for a charger ethernet cord planner wallet too. Really good buy but don't overstuff it.
5,My 13 year old needed a laptop bag with a shoulder strap for school. They are very picky at school about the bags being padded enough and sturdy. This bag is excellent. It’s lightweight but offers great padding. Has a zippered pouch for chargers cords etc. This is a great little bag for a great price
4,Just a basic computer bag with decent padding.
5,I got this bag based on the reviews I read and I'm glad I did.  It is well made has good padding for my 17" MSI laptop and has enough room in its pockets for the MSI's large power adapter and my mouse.  The side pockets aren't as expansive as my old Dell laptop's bag's pockets but they hold what I need for this laptop so I'm happy.  Appears to be well made.  Time will tell how it holds up.  At this point I've very happy with it.
5,Well made just as described. Love the extra zippered storage/pockets on both sides but doesn't make it too bulky.  I ordered the purple & it's beautiful.
5,This is a quality laptop bag so impressed!
5,It is a beautiful briefcase laptop bag or whatever you want to call it. I got the red one even though it's not really red as you can see in picture. It's actually burgundy or maroon like color. I just wish they change the color name in title. But yeah briefcase has lots of pockets to put your stuff in and it is very beautiful. It is also optional to use it as a shoulder bag as it comes with that piece separately placed inside. Amazing briefcase and color.
4,It's ok. Does the job. I'm not impressed with the material. When staples or office max have a sale. You could do better for about the same price
5,For my laptop
5,My son is using this for his new school bag.  It fits his large binder his chrome book with the case on it as well as 2 pencil cases.  The expanded bottom is nice.  We got the 17 inch one.  Color is exactly as pictured.  Very nice.
5,I absolutely love this computer bag! I bring it with me to work every day and am never concerned about wear or tear. Super cute too—turns out my coworker independently got her own Voova bag in the exact same color! Good taste.
4,I like the product but near the main opening the hem is coming unraveled and may have to take to a seamstress to fix.
5,I LOVE this bag.  Super slim and easy to carry and at the same time has alot of pockets to carry things.  In addition to my computer I carry a mouse mouse pad powercord folders pens sticky notes etc.The only thing I would add to this bag is a flat strap that can slide over the handle of a suitcase so that it sits on top of the suitcase and stays put.
5,This has made packing my pc trac ball cord and a few files much simpler when I am traveling. I think it is well made and I have been using it for about 6-8 weeks now. Would definitely recommend. There are two zippered outside pockets. One of these includes a place for pens cards and other items. The interior section is padded on both sides with a center divider that holds your pc in place in one section with a velcro backed tab. Plenty of room on the other side for file folders or paperwork.
4,This bag is a nice basic bag. My only complaint deals with padding . . . I wish it had more padding on the strap the handle and more padding for the laptop. It has padding for the laptop but not as much as some other bags. The bag has plenty of room in the bag and pocket for the power cord mouse and mouse pad. After those items have been added you still have additional room. Very roomy for an economical size bag.I would buy this bag again . . . even without the extra padding.
5,I have business that I keep spare laptop computers for my employees should one of the computers go down I have one ready to go and these cases are great for them to transport the computers in and for protection to the computer.
5,This is large enough to carry my 'mobile office' but also fits my smaller frame. I like: all the sturdy zippers and compartments handles And shoulder strap sufficient padding and sturdy material. A value for the price. I ordered the purple which is more like eggplant and love it!
5,no dislikes so far.  everything is positive
5,Sturdy
5,I used this bag for three first time today and it was already tested with a jaunt through a good ol’ Florida summer storm! I’d forgotten it was water resistant and am impressed with its sturdiness. The color looks just like the ad pictures and it is perfect for my 17” work laptop. I am quite impressed and will update if things clashed after prolonged use.
5,This bag was purchased as a gift for my daughter. Who is a bag collector!!! She loves it. Uses it all the time to carry her laptop and tons of other items. She is very happy with how many pockets there are the color and it's strength. Love it!
4,Well constructed and looks and feels durable.
5,This is very nice.  Just the features I wanted.
5,I really like the slim look as well as the zipper below to expand the bag. There was enough room to fit a laptop inside its sleeve too if you want to add some extra protection. I recommend for similar laptops.
5,I was actually surprised how spacious and high quality this bag is. The material feels durable and relatively thick. It comes with a zipper on the bottom to widen. However I did not even need to use it to fit both my 15 inch laptop as well as my 13.5 inch laptop (that is still in its slim best buy case)! There's also a bunch of pockets which is always nice
4,This bag is still pretty new to me but so far it has met my expectations. I wouldn’t say it has exceeded them but the bag has done everything I needed it to. It fits all of my computer gear including my huge power brick and mouse. I’m also able to store both my laptop and my cooling fan which in itself is about the same size as my laptop.As far as durability first impression is good.
5,This laptop bag was so perfect for my 13' MacBook Air (2020). I loved how soft it was on the inside so it limits the amounts of scratches on my MacBook and adds extra protection. The pockets are great as well. My charger fits perfectly in the big pocket. I use the smaller pocket for an extra phone charger and my magic mouse. With all of that stuff in there the bag still does not look bulky!!I love this bag and it was a great purchase for a great price!!!
5,It is amazing  I love the size and the space it has.  ITS VERY NICE.
5,Love the expandable gusset at the bottom to allow for this to become a true travel buddy. The zippered compartments mean no dumping over of the contents when you rise from a seat (yes I'm talking to you old laptop bag) saving your precious electronics from damage. The fabric exterior is easily cleaned with a little soap on a towel. Price is affordable enough to accessorize with your fav color!
5,My mom bought herself a new laptop so as a gift I decided to buy her a laptop bag. I wanted it to be simple yet nice looking great quality and have a few pockets. The Voova 17 17.3 Inch Laptop Bag Briefcase fit the bill and I'm so thrilled with this bag. It's held up really well and there's been no issues with it. Definitely recommend it!
4,Well made seems very sturdy perfect carrying case for my larger Toshiba
5,I had to buy a 17 inch computer for Zoom meetings and classes. I really wanted a bag that was slim and would fit the big computer. This bag does that very comfortably. It is so well laid out. I can fit my cords in easily and it also holds my 15 inch Mac and cord as well. It has another storage area for pens and papers and pads.  Highly recommend this bag. The shoulder pad on the strap can be moved which is very helpful! It looks so slim and nice.
5,This bag fits my laptop and my chrome book as well as the chargers.
4,This was purchased for my personal use for a recent HP Laptop.  I have no issues with this carrying case with strap.  It is as advertised in the description for this particular accessory.  Time will tell the overall story.  Currently recommend you read as what this carrying will hold regarding a laptop.
4,A little too tight I can barely force my laptop into it. I hope the zipper holds up.
5,I have a big 17 in HP laptop. I was afraid I wasn’t going to find one that fit it. It even has something to hold my laptop in place. My laptop fits plus my mouse and folders for my paperwork without having to expand it. I’ve only had it a couple of months and it looks new. I have to lug it in and out of work. I love the sturdiness of the handles. I haven’t used the strap yet.
5,Very durable!
5,I needed a bag for my large work laptop and this product did not disappoint. It's got plenty of room for a 17" and its accessories
5,I loved the bag and the color.  It looks strong and of good quality.  My 17.3 inch laptop fit excellent.  I hope it lasts for a long time!Me encantó el bolso y el color.  Parece fuerte y de buena calidad.  Mi portátil de 173 pulgadas encaja perfectamente.  ¡Espero que dure mucho tiempo!
5,I bought this for travel to a convention next month ! Excited to use it. Thanks !
5,Very happy with the bag. For the price it's got all that is needed to transport from place to place. Love all the pockets. Durable material. Would definitely order again and recommend to others looking
5,This is just what I needed for my laptop. Four different compartments places for pads pens paper etc.Very professional looking.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great Bag! Especially the fasteners. Very well made.It is definitely a laptop "sleeve" not laptop bag. I could have gone for a larger bag but this one Is great quality well made and exactly as advertised.
3,The products is good. It was not the original bag I wanted. That bag was sold out so I got the second best bag. I also like that it came in different colors.
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT - WOULD BUY AGAIN
5,Its perfect and I LOVE the color (purple)
5,So far this bag has been really nice! Have had it now for a few months and use it almost daily. The quality is great! Zippers are very strong which is important when carrying around a computer. The straps are nice and strong as well which is great because I carry around a fare amount of weight in it. I have been very happy with this bag so far!
5,This shoulder bag is great! Perfect size for any larger sized laptops! Very spacious for all your accessories
4,Fabric is cheap.  Looks like it can easily rip.  Doesn't expand as well as the description.  But I paid about $25.00 for it so I'm not that upset.
5,Very nice quality and very durable. I would recommend easily.
5,I bought this bag because I needed to be able to fit in my wireless keyboard and the laptop. It is perfect for that!  It is sturdy and has more than enough pockets. It also comes with a shoulder strap. I would definitely recommend this bag.
5,This laptop bag is extremely nice looking and well made.  It has a well padded inner laptop sleeve next to the large inner compartment.  There outer storage compartments on each side which fit everything I need.  On one side I stored my laptop battery and wireless mouse (I still have room).  On the other side I stored four DVDs in their hard cases.  A thirteen CD set and my pens sticky notes etc. (and also still have more room).  It holds its shape really well. Even with all that stuff in there (so far) you can't tell there's anything in it from the outside.  I am extremely happy with this bag.
5,Great laptop briefcase for the price.
5,Roomy. Fits my 17 inch computer books and other items with ease. Plenty of storage pockets strong zippers can expand to hold even more. I'm glad I purchased.

4,This is a nice looking smart style slim case but there isn’t much padding inside. I would have rather bought something that had a little more protection from any outside bangs or knocks.
4,I bought it for its light weight on business trips and to fit my new lightweight laptop.  Everything was a tight fit and I didn't pack much except a laptop flat mouse & pad  electric cords and a folder with documents.  Another inch of room would have been perfect.  But I'm keeping it anyway.
4,Love this case it can be made a bit wider which is great cause i can fit my charger in the bag as well as a few other things.
5,This bag is so well made and so well padded I can't believe I didn't pay 3x what I scored this gem for. It looks great protects my laptop and has a ton of room.

5,This is a nice quality laptop back with lots of room. However it does not fit a Lenvo P15. It's not quite wide enough. I will be ordering the 17 inch version instead.
3,Perfect fit but I received the bag with a broken shoulder strap. I will try to work with it because I'd rather not deal with the hassle of returning it. But it's because I received a defective item that I'm only giving 3 stars
5,I bought this for my new PC & I love it. It has all the room I need for everything & it's waterproof. I was impressed also with the packaging. It is real durable.
5,I was looking for a bag that could hold my heavy MSI gaming laptop and its huge charger + cables and that would protect it as well. This bag has done an amazing job so far.I haven’t had to unzip the bottom to expand it either it has plenty of space. I’ve even added my iPad and it fits with no problems.I’m glad I decided to get this bag hopefully it doesn’t rip because of the weight but so far it looks sturdy and well put all around.

4,Purchased this bag for work. I love all of the compartments that are available while keeping the bag slim. I’m able to fit my laptop its charger and a few files from work. The only think I dislike about it is its strap. The shoulder pad doesn’t have a rubber or slip resistant material so it’s always falling off my shoulder.
5,This Bag is dope I'm not even gonna lie and it is waterproof iv tested I guess you can say more strongly water resistant so water beads well off o fit

1,This was a good product for the price. Bought it as a gift for a friend and he loves it.UDATED REVIEWI originally bought this for a friend and I saw him with it with this big hole I felt so bad and it was less than 3 months of purchase. I had to come back and buy another bag bcuz this one for sure was no good.
5,It's a great bag.
5,Nice and sturdy laptop bag for a very good price!
1,I am not sure not sure if it's the product used to make it or what happened. But when I opened up case it smells horrible like dead fish or death. In every compartment. I had other people verify the smell and they gagged. I like the case and seems durable but I thoroughly disgusted. I have it in the garage trying to air it out to see if that helps.

5,He was very pleased
2,Lap top did not fit
4,I bought the 17.3 inch laptop bag for my Samsung Galaxy 17” tablet because the tablet is bulky and it fit just fine with room to spare. Not only is there enough room for my 17” bulky tablet but there was also plenty of room for my Kindle Fire. The front zipper pocket is very roomy and holds a lot including power cords with wall adapters a cordless mouse I.D. and credit cards pens and pencils business cards and a lot more. The large back pocket on the carrying case is great for magazines (paper) notebooks or even a small to medium tablet. I bought the case 6 months ago and haven’t had any problems with wear and tear. It’s a good carrying case.
4,I bought it as a gift and although it was of high quality it was too large. It will be returned for a 13” size.
3,17" laptop
5,Excellent quality & Great features
5,Super Fast Excellent Quality
1,Defective product - shoulder strap was missing the latch on one end.
5,Very well made attractive and easily carries all the equipment I need for whatever I face before returning home.  I carry in it a 16" MBP a 10.3" ReMarkable in its case a Junior sized disc planner/notebook a Kindle in a thick case and a small Boogie Board Blackboard for temporary notes.  I can get all of that in and out without opening the bottom zipper but prefer to never have pressure on any of the screens so I normally leave the bottom expanded.  Still looks trim and as a bonus it generally stands up on its own.  Very glad I purchased it smile when I use it and it's easy to recommend to others.
5,The Voova Laptop Bag is excellent! Not only a great price but sturdy water proof roomy and thin with enough room to fit my charger and wireless mouse. The bag expands if need to and not too big when carrying it. A great laptop bag and well worth the price! Keep it up!
5,I recently purchased an HP 15.6" laptop and needed a new case for travel. This case fit the PC perfectly. I don't yet know about durability but seems well constructed.
5,I have been looking for the right case I already have too many so this time I really took my time and researched putting price second. The expanding feature caught my exe but in the end I was most impressed with the quality especially for the price
5,Excellent quality and beautiful color. Lots of room for my charger cables and mouse. Shoulder strap is comfortable and easily adjusts. Very happy with this bag.
5,Just as described. Fits my 15'' MacBook Pro mouse charger HDMI cord and extra items with plenty of room to spare. Has two zippered pockets in front and back and the interior has an additional pocket for an iPad notebook etc.
1,Used for work as a briefcase.  A little too long for me.
5,Puedo guardar mi laptop y algunas otras cosas adicionales.
3,The pictures advertisements gives a completely different impression than the actual bag.  Yet in all fairness its equitable for the price charged I suppose.  However thinking now what would one advertised and sold for $18 & $19 look and feel like?
5,My husband was so happy to get this bag for Christmas! He loves the padding that protects his things the gray color is nice and he really likes all of the compartments! He hasn’t used it much yet but he says it seems like really good quality!
5,My new computer fits perfectly in the bag.

4,I just got this so I didn’t rate the features yet. It seems well made and has room for legal pads books my iPad I think it will hold the things I will want to carry. The smaller interior pockets will help organize and hold my cord mouse.I like the outside pockets for the paper or magazines.I will have to see how it goes.
5,The bag is well made. Looks like good stitching. It's well padded too. Has two outside pouches and inside pouches. Lots of room. Overall a nice carry case for the 17.3 inch HP Laptop I have.
5,As advertised.  Slim and great for travel.  Soft!

5,I use this with my M17 R4 gaming laptop (taken to and from my job each day). This basically provides everything you would want from a laptop carrier. Offers as much protection without actual hard internal plating and water durable. Plenty of varying-sized internal pockets and pouches for extras. Well-made ZIPs and enough padding for me to feel comfortable using with my $2000 laptop each day.

5,Exactly what I needed to carry my laptop to work and home. It’s simple looks great and fit everything good!
5,We are retired but travel a lot and generally take our laptops with us.  When we do we are able to use the expansion feature to easily accommodate two laptops.  When there is only one it is more streamlined.  I also like the fabric and color vs the vinyl black one it replaced.
5,Sturdy bag. Light. Ample pockets.
5,Love the color. Lots of room. Fits my 17" laptop perfectly!
5,Seems to bit exactly what I was looking for!
5,Ordered 2 of these for our office laptops.  It looks even nicer than the pics and the fabric is very nice.  This bag is exactly as advertised.  It actually looks even nicer than in the pictures!  I wanted a bag that was big enough for our 17" laptops but nothing overly bulky.  I searched hard to find good quality bags for under $30 and this one by far got the best reviews for the must haves on my list...sturdy good protection/padding metal hardware for the zippers and snap swivel hooks. It also has an expansion zipper along the bottom so you can unzip to make it roomier.  When we received it the first thing my coworker said she liked about it was that the outside pocket zips to close and isn't just a pocket with a velcro or magnetic closure because everything tends to fall out with those.  Very satisfied with this bag and would highly recommend!
5,nice bag for the price.
5,Spacious light weight simple design. Perfect bag for just about anyone.
4,For carrying my 13" laptop to office.
