5,This product is great and please please please: read the instructions. they are simple and clear. all the things you need to install the screen cover and the lens cover are included and they work really well. The screen is about 1mm smaller around on the 13mini but I don't use those edges anyway. I am impressed with the touch sensitivity of this product (better than the last one I had on my SE)The lens cover will interfere with using this phone in a rigid case - if you are going to install the lens cover after you put the phone in the case (the lens cover extends past the lens just enough). I am using a silicone case so this isn't going to be a problem.
5,This was very easy to add to my phone. I love the fact that it came with a camera lens protector also. The price was a good deal.
5,It’s worth the money.
4,Lasted 3-4 months before my first crack. You get whT you pay for
5,Fits IPhone 13 mini perfectly.  Good product.
5,They really worked. Glad it came with two.
5,The product was on my phone when I dropped it. The protector cracked but my phone was intact. Will definitely buy again and recommend to users.
5,I dropped my phone twice same day! I know one of those days. This screen protector kept my iPhone 13 mini intact. The camera protector are the best! I recommend 100%!
5,I drop my phone constantly not to mention my kids’ playing with it and the damage that ensues with that activity...this screen protector saved my phone. It cracked after several drops but I pulled it off and my actual screen was good as new!
5,I like these easy to install fits perfectly and durable. Great product especially for the price.
5,having only had screen protector for about 2 weeks. can't speak to durability
5,This screen protector comes with the camera lens cover as well. That one is really useful and easy to install.The screen guard is good durable and easy to install as well. Took be less than 5 mins to stick the protector..!
5,Had this for a few months. Survived multiple drops including one face down onto the edge of a brick. That impact cracked the screen protector but did not affect the actual phone screen. Camera protector also works well. To remove the “damaged” protector you need a razor blade and patience but came off pretty easy with the right tool. Just popped the second protector on so glad it came with two.
5,Easy to install durability and value for money!
5,Love these things. Have always worked perfectly for my phone screens and smash them at one point or another but my actual screens always stay intact.
4,So far so good. A little tricky to put on.
5,I have use this same brand for all my iPhones and works great the protector has saved my screen and cámara great value when I ran from protectors I just order again and get it right away
5,Easy install and nice cover for back camera too
5,Applies well with no bubbles. Looks very nice and protects my phone. I’m very clumsy and I drop my phone a lit. I have cracked the protector piece many times but my phone always stays together. Before I used these I cracked my screen when I dropped my phone. So I believe this product really does help protect the screen.
5,For the money it’s fine!
5,The glass was easy to install and had the correct size. I had to remove the back glass though since it was a bit thick for the case I was putting my phone in. Overall a good product.
5,This was very easy to install. Now our phone screens and cameras are protected.
5,Easy to install and work great
4,Does the job in protecting the screen.
5,I phone screen and lens protector
5,If you've never put on your own screen protector before this product may leave you frustrated because the instructions are minimal. The camera cover in particular can go on 2 different ways but only one is right -- they don't give you a heads-up on that at all.However if this isn't your first time this kit is perfect. You get EXACTLY what you need to install the two sets of protectors nothing more nothing less. For each of the protectors the glass has just one peel-off sheet on the sticky side - other side doesn't have one because it doesn't need it. Two "handling" stickers one "dust collector" sticker and one set of wet/dry wipes. No extra wipes or stickers or other junk that you don't need.Putting one of these things on makes a lot of trash but this kit minimizes that waste about as much as I can imagine is possible and I really appreciate that.As for fit -- yes there is about a 1mm margin all the way around. I'm using a burly case (RokForm) and it matches up *perfectly* with this screen protector. If you use a more minimal case -- or no case -- you'll probably be happier with a different product that covers up to the edges of the screen.
5,Es muy facil de instalar
5,Follow the easy instructions and install this screen protector in minutes. Forget soft plastic protectors you have to clean constantly this one is glass. It feels exactly like your phone's screen while protecting it from scratches and dirt.
5,Used for my Grand daughters iphone
5,Perfect size for my mini and great privacy
3,2 months in I've already used both protectors. These seem more fragile then they should be. They're a pain to install but the instructions are good. I'll look for a better alternative eventually.
4,When I dropped it once it shattered the screen
5,I like it
5,Does what it’s intended to do easy to install no complaints
5,My iPhone  mini 13
5,This product goes on really easy and fully covers my screen and my camera lenses. I recommend it and have bought more to have on hand.
5,I love these - SUPER easy to put on lasts long time  works REALLY well. These have saved my phone quite a few times from drops scratches and even the claws of my giant 180 lbs dog. Highly recommend
5,Over the years I have realized that the number feature to look for in a screen protector is to look for one that is easy to install.  This one checks that box for sure.
3,I have more confidence in other products but it’s a good price
3,Product install was easy- typical glass shield- took a few times to get square and even (there’s no plastic guide you put over phone like others) but got it. Once done noticed there was dust and lent on bottom. Installed second because I don’t want dirt or dust under glass. Second had it too. Installed in clean area - no fans- Little disappointed but it fits flush with silicone case. Same for lens cover.
5,fit pretty well....still have control on touch screen...seems to be steady on the screen
5,This screen protector was very easy to install and it didn't have any bubbles! Yay!
3,This product is decent but it collects lots of dust
4,Flimsy  and I got a spec of dust under it
3,The camera covers crack too easily to be any kind of useful
5,Works great. I only wish it had a way to like stabilize the phone while putting the protector on
4,Applied easily and looked perfect but when I reinstalled my Otterbox Defender Case bubbles showed up on the bottom of screen. Tried to smooth these out and they came right back. Apparently the case contacts the edge of the protector causing the bubbles.
3,The camera protector is not for the mini 13 iPhone
3,Great product however....... why in the heck is there no Screen assist guide ( plastic piece to help align screen correctly ) included? thats the only down side to this.
5,Front Screen protector protected camera lens alsoExcellent
4,good
3,The lens covers change the quality of the photos
5,this screen protector kit has everything you need. In the past I always had the people in the store install the screen protectors because it is not something I am good at but this kit made it easy.
5,Protect phone screen and camera lense
4,Not sure why there is 2 in a pack. They are durable and easy to install.
3,So I bought this because it had good reviews. Also had camera protection glass. However I was disappointed that this does not cover the entire screen of your iphone mini. It has several areas where your glass screen is exposed. In event you hit the wrong side if phone falls then you basically on a huge loss. I am disappointed here as they should make screen protectors cover the entire screen.
3,Unfortunately it only came with one lens protector. Over all it’s a good quality
4,decent screen protector easy to install not fool-proof. Its nice that they have 1 set of wet/dry wipes per glass in the box.Where the product loses 2 stars:The camera glass still introduces lots of glare when trying to take pictures. This is true for both sides of cameras but it is more obvious with the rear cameras. The rear glass also introduces a weird haziness to all pictures from rear cameras.
5,This screen protector was very easy to install. Everything need was included in the kit. Installed first try with no bubbles or lint. Seems very durable & perfect fit with my iPhone case.
5,Great inexpensive screen protectors! Phone has been dropped. Protector cracked but screen did not! Well worth it!
5,Perfect fit and so easy to install.  I've had it on my phone for 3 months and there are no scratches on it and no signs of coming loose or peeling up.  Lots of these screen protectors perform in a similar way but there's something special about the quality being more "robust" or something with this.  It seems thicker smoother and just...better.  No problem with it picking up the most sensitive touches.
5,These are great. They really figured out the glue. Be super careful with dust and peel off the sticker banking with it facing downward to maker sure you don't get any flakes in the screen.
5,We each recently upgraded to an iPhone 13 mini. I was impressed not only by the screen protector but the camera guard as well. I like the phone but the lenses are hanging out in the breeze. In the month we've had our new phones this screen protector has "saved our bacon" three times. On the last drop the screen protector died but the phone survived so we ordered another set. Definitely cheap insurance that I highly recommend.
4,Would be great if there was some sort of alignment tool to apply the glass. Had to re-do it so now I don’t have an extra piece. Affordable so not a big deal
4,Easy to install fits well. Will find out how durable it is when I drop my phone hopefully later than sooner!
5,Followed the easy installation guide. The screen protector had no bubbles which surprised me as with other products I was continually smoothing out the bubbles . I would highly recommend this product.
4,Original: as stated in the headline the cover for the front screen appears ok (it does not completely cover the screen though). The smaller back plate for the cover in spite of careful preparation is not "sticking".Modified: I applied pressure for about 1 hour (lay the phone with the cover against a flat surface) and voila. It's now all good...for now at least.
3,Didn’t get a chance to use them . They were all broken.
5,Easy to install works well. I would recommend
5,It gets the job done.The camera part is an adhesive and will stick to your camera.
5,I didn’t know there was a screen protector for the camera as well and thought that was great.I’ve never had a screen protector come with one and I love it
3,Not able to avoid air bubbles how many times I installed it carefully. Felt like waste of money
5,Relatively easy to install. Protected my iPhone in a drop the glass screen protector cracked but not the iPhone screen.  Put the other one on and Ordered another set!
5,Easy to install no air bubbles
5,The product installs easily and fits well.  The package includes cleaning cloths and static reducer.
2,I rarely am compelled to write reviews but after thinking long and hard of which screen protector to get i risked it all with yall. This iPhone mini screen protector does not cover the whole screen particularly the bottom and both sides equally so glass is still exposed. I'm disappointed  and want to share this as a warning.
5,Iphone 13 mini perfect fit!
5,The installation was easy looks good and I’m waiting to say something about durability it’s been 2 weeks.
5,Is great
5,Great Price
5,Worked as advertised…easy to install
5,Amazing
3,Within a month both of my small camera covers have cracked- not even a small crack like so bad I’ve had to buy new ones already. The main screen protector is doing great. Just was disappointed in the small ones.
5,It went on easy and fit my 13 mini perfect. I have dropped my phone a couple of times and neither the screen protector or the camera protector have cracked. So far so good. Happy with this purchase!
5,Easy installation!
5,Excellent
5,A great video is available on YouTube  to demo how to apply. It’s easy to do and no bubbles underneath! One of the extras I really appreciate is the camera cover which protects it from scratches and lint-easy to wipe the cover and doesn’t affect the quality of photos at all!
5,Crystal clear very durable glass
5,Seems very durable and is easy to install.
5,Item was as described. Hardly notice it’s there
5,Me agrado
5,pretty tough but still cracked from pocket
1,Arrived on Thursday installed immediately no issues were doing great. Saturday looked at screen protector already cracked okay no big deal install the other one cause you get two for a reason. Saturday night on the couch lens protector happens to take a bump from a tv remote control had a weird feeling “like that better not break” but I didn’t check. When I did in the morning it to was cracked. The remote control to my tv tapped the lens protector and it cracked? Interesting. So yeah to recap I’ve been home this weekend nothing crazy no drops nothing of note and somehow I’ve already installed the second of each of these protectors and feel like itll only take until days end or tomorrow until I have to purchase more. Imagine if I had these on during more demanding activity or if I did actually drop it. Not impressed.
5,Easy to install feels sturdy allows easy use of screen
5,Clear instructions on how to install protective coating. The sheet is invisiable on my phone which is what I wanted. I would buy this again.
2,This could be a good product but it's impossible to install. When there is dust because of spending too much time trying to align the protector screen there are no double sided stickers to clean the dust between the screen and the screen protector. I wish I bought a different one with an easy install. One of the screens got too dusty and the other one has dust under it too. Seriously don't bother yourself yes it's cheap but you won't get a nice experience and extra screens if you care about the alignment and dust under the screen.
5,Easy to install durable product!
5,As expected
5,This is the best
5,Good product.  Great protection for your phone and easy to install.
5,I really like the product prettiest my phone really well
5,Quality and easy to put into phone
5,Step-by-step directions and cleaning wipes come with the kit. Very easy to do.
5,Nice response to touch. Excellent camera protection. My phone doesn’t have finger print recognition so that doesn’t apply.
5,Pretty good screen protector. Especially for for rear cameras
3,Does the job but the screen cover cracked a couple of weeks after I got it
2,Easy to apply. But quality seems low had product a week and already cracked.
5,Works great —- I dropped my phone and all is well!
5,Thanks
5,Just what i was looking for..
5,This is exactly what I expected! Great product
5,Fits like a glove.Heavy duty
1,We have 2 issues with this product. One is once we installed the screen protector the sensitivity on the phone we way down. Even after we went into the settings and adjusted everything up you still have to pound on. Without the screen protector the phone works great. Second issue is the camera lens protector. It doesn’t want to stay stuck to the phone. When we take the phone out of its protective case the camera lens protector just falls off. Even though we installed it per manufactures instructions.
5,Fit perfect and easy to apply.
2,Protects my phone screen but the protector itself cracks at the slightest pressure. Annoying.
2,So unlike screen protectors I've gotten in the past this doesn't have a frame or physical guide in order to lay the screen protector on straight. Otherwise the screen protector is fine.Also the camera lens protector is super bulky made of plastic is another one that doesn't have a guide to be placed straight and glares something terrible in my pictures and videos. As soon as my full case arrives I'm getting rid of the lens protector.
2,When I unpack the flat box it tells me to push somewhere. However this caused one piece of glass to break due to the pushing position just on the corner of the glass which can easily damage the glass.
1,Screen protector and lens cover all cracked within days of installing (3 out of 4 pieces) and the shards drew blood.
2,This is slightly too small for an iPhone 13 mini leaving about a 1mm border on all sides of the protector. Since the job of the protector is to protect the entirety of the screen I am disappointed. The camera cover fits well though so there's that.
2,unfortunately the protective screen for the camera on the backside of phone cracked within weeks despite no drops or incidents
1,It was difficult to apply and leave no bubbles. I have had others and they went on better.
1,It worked fine and eventually cracked. The problem is my screw still scratched behind the protector. And I never dropped it hard and it has a full bumper case.
1,I’ve maintained a perfect unprotected screen on my iPhone 13 mini for about a month but decided I should add a screen protector. Within an hour after adding this to my phone I pulled my phone out of my pocket and it looked like I’d hit it with a hammer. I’d been climbing up and down a ladder several times and I suppose maybe I rubbed up against the rungs. I can’t think of any other reason the protector would shatter and this is truly no reason at all. It’s so fragile I’d probably go through a two pack every day of the year. I don’t recommend this product at all.
1,My phone is a  I-phone 13.  Yet my screen is much larger than what I order. I also sent back the other item i purchased. Which was a temper screen protector. It also was to small for my I-phone.
1,Came unstuck after 3 days and camera lens cover made camera blurry
1,The product cracked in one day and the phone wasn’t dropped
1,My iphone was brand new and I took care to prepare the screen for installation. But after less than a week the first of these protectors lost adhesion and was pulling off. I put the second one on there and immediately had problems. I've used other brands on my previous phone and never experienced this so I'm going to go with another company's product.
2,Lasted 11 days it fell off the bed last night and the screen protector cracked instantly
1,Even with a case this screen protector is too small. Pretty sure all iPhone 13 minis have the exact same size screen so why was this designed with an incorrect size? It’s flush on bottom and has a noticeable gap up top.
1,one of the camera covers came broken
1,you need a clean room  air tight to get no dust on the lens
1,These did not fit well enough.  Slightly too big and could not seal without huge bubbles no matter how hard I pressed on the the cover to remove them.
1,The screen protector broke within weeks. Cheap product.
1,I thoroughly cleaned the dust off my screen and placed the glass on quickly to avoid contamination. Both of them still had a lot of specs. Not a good screen protector.
1,I’ve successfully installed screens on the several phones and iPads I’ve owned. I followed the instructions carefully but this screen wouldn’t adhere properly — I used both but each left half the screen loose. Very disappointed.
1,This product is absolutely horrid I’ll just cut to the chase scratches and cracks are made so easily on this creep protector it doesn’t stick well either. I’m absolutely 100% dissatisfied
1,I bought 2 screen protectors for my iPhone mini. The screen protector fits my new phone well. There was only one usable screen protector in the box because the other one was already shattered.
1,They all came with a small crack that quickly got bigger
1,Broken upon arrival- still awaiting my return. Beyond frustrating to go through this process- choose another product.
1,low quality.
1,Craptastic!!!! Packaging perfectly intact -  both screen protectors cracked!  Craptastic!
1,Horrible do not buy. It doesn’t line up with the phone. There is no applicator so you have to do it by hand
5,I like how there are two here and the camera protectors are good. It is durable but not too thick. I would recommend this screenprotectoer.
5,I will never have a phone without one of these. I've had my phone for about 2 months and had to get one of these ASAP. Sure enough 6 weeks into having it my phone was on the counter and I happened to knock a small bottle of sesame oil out of the cabinet right onto my phone screen. The screen protector did crack but kept the screen of my phone perfect. I like that I now have extra on hand to replace the damaged screen protector. I do like having the camera one as well. I do not see a difference with vs without the camera screen protector when it comes to clarity of the photograph. It does add some thickness to the camera area however since the camera area sticks out without a case or in some slim cases I feel this is helpful for added protection. Just make sure to install it when your toddler isn't around. He decided to take off my 2nd camera screen protector so I'll have to order more if/when this breaks.
5,I have trusted this brand with all of my screensavers for all of my devices. I love it because it’s durable doesn’t scratch or get very oily. And it’s easy to install
5,Fits perfectly and was easy to apply.I suggest using a small suction cup to hold the glass for easier application
5,Great deal on this pack.  Includes two screen protectors PLUS camera lens protection too!  Easy to clean with included wipes then align and affix.  Easy!
5,Comes with (2) screen protectors for both the front screen and the camera lenses. Also comes with wet/dry packs to clean and prep with. Went on easily!
5,Definitely had to get this for my new phone…
5,This product is well made and easy to install.  I was very happy to see that cleaner and dryer pad were enclosed.  Directions were great too.
5,Easy to put in and has protected my phone face on several drops.
4,Installation was easy followed the instructions.  There were really no instructions for the separate camera piece so I just did something similar to what the instructions for the touchscreen said.  Very clear and the touch works like it was not there.  Also works with my Smartish cover. However I've only had it installed for 2 days.
5,Worked as advertised
5,vary clear vary durable and cheap
5,Very nice for the price.
5,These things are awesome !! I’m not the best with installing screen protectors but this one was very simple to do and didn’t seem to leave many bubbles under the screen. The added camera protector is so convenient and fits under any phone case I’ve tried and doesn’t obstruct camera picture quality. I’ve had my screen protector on for 6 months and not a single scratch I’m a server so it’s always jingling around in my pocket and these have definitely helped
5,straight forward instructions comes with everything you need goes on like a glove must have!!
5,Es muy fácil de usar me encanto
5,Easy to install no glare
5,Was as expected.
5,Looks good on the phone; fit perfectly and provides an additional layer of protection to the screen
5,Dropped my phone SO MANY TIMES. I didn’t have a shock proof case on it but this absorbed all the cracks instead of my new phone. Great product- don’t notice it’s on my screen and easy install. Bought twice now.
5,This was a different style protector for the lenses. Wish they would have done this with previous versions but great protector for my phone!
5,Applied easily. Very easy and good product for its price
5,Great value!
5,Easy to apply.  Works as it should!
5,Installation is as easy as any protective screen is to install. No complaints from me. The kit comes with all the standard components. The camera protective case is easy as well. It pretty scratch proof I haven't noticed any scratches from putting in my purse or pocket.
5,Haven’t used the screen protector portion yet but the camera protection has been great! Doesn’t block the camera view at all.
5,Perfect for mine mint I phone
5,Great product!
5,It cracked instead of my mini 13 and was easy to take off!
5,It not only had the cover for the face of the iPhone it also had a cover for the camera section. It fits nicely with the Apple case I bought for the back.
5,Me encanto le quedo perfecto ami tablet
5,Very good product. I like it a lot it fits my iPhone 13 mini nicely
5,I dropped my phone at the gym and it landed screen-first on a metal corner of a weight bench. The screen protector absorbed the impact completely. In what would have otherwise been a complete destruction of my phone's screen this product saved the day!
5,Im very active and my phone falls out of my pocket daily.  This glass has protected my lenses well.I dont know what fingerprint reader is.
5,Is very durable and easy to use
1,Both protectors that it came with didn't attach to the phone correctly and left bubbles. Already a crack on it and barely have had it on the phone a few weeks. I kept it even with a huge bubble in it. Basically worthless.
4,This was purchased to protect the screen of the iPhone 13 mini what I find is the screen protector falls a bit short. Unlike my iPhone 12 mini protector this one does not fit edge to edge. For any screen protector it’s an expectation that the entire screen would be protected and I don’t find that to be the case with this brand. Unhappy with this purchase
5,Great
5,After installing on my phone it looked like a had a new phone. I had the Zagg plastic on before. This one is so much smoother.
5,It came with 2 of each protector. Very easy to install too. Worth the money I paid.
5,Fit well and went on easily.  Made me feel more comfortable that my phone was protected.  No problems so far
1,No alignment assistance provided so now my screen protector is misaligned and I have dust under the protector from trying to get it aligned correctly. Tried to get dust off but that attempt was futile more dust and debris got in. Tried the second protector same song and dance.
5,None
5,This is a great product. Best screen protector/set I’ve ever purchased (and I have purchased many). Also the easiest to install.
5,I had a little trouble getting my case over the camera protector on the back but eventually got it on. Will definitely purchase this brand in the future!
5,It was easy to install in fact I installed it several times to get it just right and had no issue.  And I still have a spare for later or another phone.
3,Este producto lo promocionan como que tiene dos  protectores de pantalla y dos  para los lentes de la cámara  en el paquete que llegó solo contenía  UN PROTECTOR de pantalla y NO  DOS como lo  promocionan. Tiene pocos días que instale el protector habrá que ver que tiempo dura.  Se instala fácil.
