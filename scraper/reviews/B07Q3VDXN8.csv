5,I used this cable to solve a problem with reusing Lenovo Tiny-In-One monitors with new PCs that only have HDMI out.The TIO monitors on have 1 DP input and will only work with Lenovo PCs in AIO mode (mounted to the back of the monitor) OR by using a DP to DP cable from a different PC.  These monitors will not allow any kind of passive adapter or cable to convert to DP.This cable has an active component that changes the HDMI from the PC to native DP which the Lenovo TIO monitors will accept.These cables will save me a lot of money during the upcoming company wide computer refresh as we won't have to replace perfectly good monitors saving money and lowering our e-waste output.  Win win!  This is a great affordable problem solver.

5,I tried two HDMI to Displayport 1.2 converters and this was the only one that worked.The other was this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082C7BHK8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details which did not work.
5,Monitor would not wake up with just a regular HDMI to HDMI cpu video input. Had to turn it on and off every time for it to work. Now used this Displayport output to HDMI input and it all works flawlessly.
5,I am working from home and needed to have more than one screen so I purchased this cord and used it to attach my laptop to a monitor.  Both screens work great!
5,I needed to connect a 2nd laptop to a monitor and this works perfectly
4,Worked as described
5,Bought a pair that wasn't compatible perfect cable that works both ways
5,This works for the M1 Mac Mini! My Dell Display with only a DisplayPort option limited my options for displaying 2 screens on my Mac Mini but long story short this works. One small quirk is that I had to plug the DisplayPort side into my monitor first and then plug into my Mac mini second for it to pick it up.
5,Exactly what I needed!
