4,This adapter was very handy since I could use it in London and then in Paris while on the same trip.  The only problem I had at all was that I couldn't get the button pushed down at first so that I could switch it from London to Europe.  I would definitely  endorse this adapter.
5,This is the one power adapter that you need if traveling abroad. I recently traveled throughout England and France. This adapter was wonderful absolutely love the built in usb and usb-c built in chargers. This adapter also has a US plug so it can be used as a charging station in your home also. Highly recommend this item for the quality and functionality.
5,We purchased this International Power Adapter for a trip we had planned. We just returned from two months in Europe and this adapter worked perfectly. We used it in England and in Italy. It quickly charged all of our electronic devices and powered my wifeâ€™s hair dryer curling iron and straightener.  We highly recommend this Tessan International Adapter.
5,I used this for a two week European trip from Germany to Ireland.It charged our phone/watch/camera well and I highly recommend this device. A single device replaces many AC charging adapters and plug adapters. Just bring this power adapter and a few cables and you are done with your charging needs.
5,Extremely useful!!!! I was so glad to have this when I went overseas. Very accommodating having the USB and USB-C ports to charge my phones and tablets. Never had any issues with blowing fuses or frying my batteries. I ended up buying another one for the spouse.
5,Easy to use
5,Just finishing up a 3 week trip through Europe I've ended up only using this adaptor. It has worked out well so far from Venice to Munich. Being that I've primarily only USB I would still be hesitant to use larger electrical draw electronics as it clearly states it's not a full converter.
4,Very good
5,It works in Europe and the U.K.
5,retractable
