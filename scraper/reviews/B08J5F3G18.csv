rating,review
5,Waited and waited and waited...  I finally pulled the trigger and purchased this card at $980 hoping it didn't go any lower...  It also helped that I had a $210 Amazon credit so I was able to get it for $770 before tax...  SCORE!!!Upgraded from an RTX 3060 XC (12GB version)...  Running on an Asus Z590 motherboard with an i9-10850k CPU mounted on a CoolMaster AIO 240mm CPU cooler Team T-Force Delta RGB 64GB DDR4-3600 RAM (16gb x 4 sticks) and an EVGA 1000w Gold PSU...  All running efficiently inside a white HYTE Y60 case with Lian Li's UNI SL-Infinity fans...  Display is a Sceptre 34" IPS ultrawide 144Hz gaming monitor...Undervolted the GPU via MSI Afterburner at 850mV @ 1800mhz...  At full load I get max GPU temps at 65c...  Besides games I also use this rig for my photography and videography workflow...  I'm loving the RTX 3090 and what it can do...  More so based on the price I was able to get it...  I guess the saying "Good things comes to those who wait" are true in this case...
5,First and foremost please do not buy this if you plan to use this *exclusively* for gaming; you'd be much better served going with a 3080 price/performance wise. (Unless an extra $300 for more or less 10% performance gain is worth it to you then go for it I suppose. It is a 3090 after all.)However if your workflow can properly utilize the massive 24GB worth of VRAM a 3090 comes with this is well worth it. Quite literally there are no other nVidia cards at this price point that offer this amount of VRAM. Now sure there are rumored cards and workstation level graphics cards that out perform the 3090 but they are vastly more expensive so if you're looking to do some serious ML prototyping/3D-modeling etc but don't want to go through the hassle of spinning up a cloud GPU instance (and burn through credits) this is the way to go.With regards to this specific card please note that while EVGA had a lot of growing pains with the initial release of the 3090 as of now these issues have all but been solved. If you are worried about rumors of VRM failures etc just make sure your card is not rev0.1(which you'll find next to the pcie slot). The ugly red "clown lips" at the edge of the card have also been removed in these newer iterations; however if your card does have those you can email EVGA for a replacement shroud. Thermally this card is decent; however it is helped significantly with some undervolting. My personal undervolt is 1890 @0.9V which drops overall energy usage of this card by upwards of 100W. Design is quite elegant with the diffused RGB LEDs and a solid feeling of construction throughout. The precision x1 software is solid for both RGB and undervolt/overclock control.All in all this card as this price point ($1000 or so) is a steal if you can properly utilize the 24GB of VRAM. The card's construction thermals and warranty support from EVGA are all superb and I would definitely recommend this product.
5,3 issues you need to be aware of that I wasn't.1. power - you need power. I upgraded to 1200 PSU2. HEAT! playing minesweeper will generate more heat than a small block chevy 350. I LEGIT had to set up flex tube piping from an ac wall unit to keep my temps in the 40-50 range. Without the ac my temps would be 80's to 90's. this card is the real reason why the ice caps are melting.3. Heavy the card is large and in charge buy yourself a brace.Side note they offered a cooler for the card however it takes away the pretty face and I personally love the look of the card so I didn't do the hybrid cooler option. Plus if I'm dropping 1300ish on a card I shouldnt have to drop 200$ to keep it cool.Now the performance is fantastic. Best bang for the $ hands down 100+ frames on EFT can't beat it.
5,The RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra is not a common GPU. It’s not for people running lower resolutions like 1080p or for people running older games that are not graphically demanding.It is however a complete powerhouse of 4K gaming. This card can max out every game I own in 4K except Cyberpunk 2077 with Ray tracing. But Cyberpunk is ridiculous so I don’t know if that really counts.The gaming capabilities are over the top and you pay a lot for that. You will not be upset if you bought this card for gaming. But if you bought it for 3D art or graphics design you’ll be even more excited. It performs so smooth and renders artwork so quickly that it makes your projects so much more simple to work on.All in all the only negative I have ran into with this GPU is the increased fan noise over my old card but this is mostly because the 3090 comes with 3 fans instead of 2. My number one tip for new users would be to go and modify your fan curve right away as this card is set by default to not hit max fan levels until 90c which is just dumb. With a more aggressive curve set I am able to easily keep temps in the mid 70s while gaming in 4K and pushing the card as hard as I can.All in all this is the best purchase I have made for a PC in many years. Amazing GPU!
4,I can't believe I could buy this GPU in a great price. Specially after announcing new RTX 4000 series. Everything arrived in perfect conditions according as it was advertised.Installation was smooth. Make sure you have minimum a Power Supply Unit of 750 W Gold to run it without any problems.In the other hand average temperature varies from 58 to 65 Celsius degrees and it will depend on the configuration of the game you want to play it might be higher around 85 Celsius degrees. Make sure you have a proper cooling system. Apart from the 3 fans in the GPU I have 4 fans in my CPU and water cooling for the Intel processor. In that way temperatures are normal. I hope it helps.
5,Update: one month laterStill running great but the temps on memory specifically the 12 chips on the top get extremely hot! I've seen them hit 105°C before thermal throttling took place. According to Samsung(who manufactures those chips) that's the danger zone. So I had to fully water cool with an active backplate from Bykski which keep the temps stable at about 70°C between the GPU and vram. I feel like this shouldn't be a problem as much as the card costs. Then doesn't think this through I think. A fan or something should've been implemented for the top memory chips. Beware even with proper intake and exhaust on your case you'll still have this problem.After the last two years of inflated prices I've finally gotten my hands on a 3090 at a really good price. I paid the same for this thing as I did for my 2080ti and for an extra 2000 points added to my Time spy score without any overclocking. It never hit over 75°c with stock fans. I never really heard the game like everyone claims but then again my hearing is almost shot anyway.I did find a hybrid kit for this(had to pay double MSRP because of scalpers) but it ended up being worth it. Maxed at 60°c with the fans blowing out on Time spy (gonna flip to pull cool air in) and still got a high score. Next step: overclocking.
5,Being in Video production it's crazy how much this sped up my workflow considering I was only using a 1060 before. 10/10 would recommend.
5,This is a beast of a card great performance and great build quality. Pretty happy with the purchase.
5,W graphics card to buy but if you want to get it will work well on games but if it is solely for gaming dont buy this
5,Better than expected. Perhaps better value for $ than the rtx 40series
5,This card was made for my needs. I bought this thing for a mix of gaming and for use with virtual machines. This has plenty of vram and speed to do everything needed and more.
5,The 3090 is a beast of a card coming from a 6700xt and a 2080s evga ultra which was also 900$
5,Normally I wouldnt tell anyone to get a 3090 over a 3080Ti but the recent price drops made the VRAM overhead worth it. Using this card for machine learning projects and do not regret having double the VRAM of the "best gaming card"
5,Despite the cost it is very good resolution and graphics quality the best so far
5,Snagged the card for 1233 brand new. Card came in perfect condition.Bought this card as an upgrade to an evga 1080ti(had a kraken g12 + x62 with 4 noctua 3k rpm 140mm fans on it). Honestly im impressed with how cold this runs on air. My main gaming use case is vr. In the same situations the 1080ti would be 23-26c this card runs 38-45c. Already ran against the vram limit more than once in vrchat. Noise really isnt as much of an issue as at those temps its quieter than my 1080ti.
5,I ordered on 9/5/2022 got my GPU a day early installed it and its been working great!
5,EVGA makes some of the best designs & cooling solutions for the Nvidia RTX 3000 Series of Graphics Cards.  The RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra is no exception.  It's well-built robust quiet cool and a proven performer.Pros: - Dual BIOS - Minimal Coil Whine - Excellent Cooling Solution - Quality Design Build and Layout - Runs Fairly Quiet at Max Fan Speeds - PWM & ARGB Fan Connectors on Back of GPU - Outlay of LED Lightning Looks Great in any Build - EVGA's Precision X1 Software Makes Updating BIOS EasyCons: - Price - Fairly Heavy - Requires 3x 8-Pin PCIe Connectors - Triple-Slot Design Can Limit Fit & Expansion in Specific PC Cases - May Struggle at 4K+ Resolution on High/Max Settings in Some GamesOverall the EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra is a winner!  I would definitely recommend this card for a Workstation or High-end Gaming Platform.  If you're on a budget then waiting until the RTX 4000 Series drops in Q4 2022 may be a better alternative.  Either way...  If you can afford it then the 3090 will not disappoint!
5,It massive and power hungry but the first time you start it up and your game auto detects extreme graphics you will smile and that is worth it! I have always loved EVGA products they have good customer service and listen to reviewers about things they can change. And a big plus no more clown lips! It does require a higher power psu so be ready for that but if you have the money it is worth it!
5,its amazing its huge its powerful and the best GPU for vr gaming
5,No issue so far EVGA delivers. Performance is great.
5,love it
5,Glad the price came back down. Finally bit the bullet and I'm glad I did.
3,Note that this GeForce 3090 card requires 800W minimum power supply and 3 PCIe 8 Pin cable plugs that have a special EVGA GeForce connectors. I had to buy a new power supply as my 3070 was running on a 550W power supply. Additionally the new 850W Corsair power supply I bought for an additional $130 only came with 2 PCIe cables and the card requires 3. Super inconvenient that is comes with no PCIe cables for a card the retails over $1000. Had to order another PCIe 8 Pin cable to get everything to work to make sure you have all the not included parts as most big box stores don't carry these.
5,Got this during scalper price times. This distributor was awesome in selling it for less than the inflated MSRP (VERY well below the scalp prices). I was lucky enough to get the last one at that price. Its performance is what it says on the tin and then some. Not many people can brag about playing Cyberpunk 2077 at 4k MAX ALL GRAPHICS including RTX settings on "PSYCHO" (which is apparently higher performance than Ultra) and still maintain a good 60fps. Only complaint is the delivery time. Other than that this distributor was awesome in getting me something this powerful at a very reasonable price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Absolute monster graphic card i got it in a very good deal! Shippped it all the way to my country hustle free!! Amazon handled it all!!
5,It's fast I play 4K AAA titles on max settings. Also running neural nets like a rockstar. It's also quiet - the fans never spin to their full speed (I guess that's what they call proper cooling). Truly speaking I didn't expect that level of silence from EVGA. Way to go guys!The downside is its high price I would prefer sub-1000 tag. It's much more expensive than the rest of my PC components.
4,The jury is still out.So far this card has impressed me with its raw power when compared to my 1080TI.What I notice right off the bat is it runs a lot hotter.The other nagging thing is paying (1699.00) so much for a two year old card. This was the most expensive card I have ever purchased and to start off with an almost obsolete card keeps telling me to send it back.The 4090 will be released in September and is going to be 2.5 - 3.0 times faster. That blows this away! Granted it might be hard to get Ive read Nvidia has already purchased 10billion in chips so we should not have the shortage issues as Ampere.
4,Works good but i pay for a NEW Graphic card this was renewed have the plastic protector but have scratches in the EVGA sing
1,Update: March 11 2021 This was a Four Star review - No longerI can not believe this card just died tonight. It died as I entered a room playing Bioshock Remastered on Steam. I had just launched the game so there wasn't even any crazy fight going on. The cards fans spun up and the signal to the monitor died. I put my hand over the case and the card was venting an unreal amount of heat. A complete brick.I've never had issues with EVGA cards before but after doing a search for 3090 failure rates it looks like EVGA has some serious issues.Given the price we are paying because of GPU stock shortages steer clear of any company that is having problems with their RTX cards. I understand that EVGA has awesome Customer Service and I really hope so because this is a major setback.________________________________________For starters the EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 out of the box performance is very impressive. I'm getting consistent frame rates even in busy scenes. Not one notable hiccup on frame drops in four days I've played using it.I upgraded from my RTX 2080 Super. The frame rates notably jumped with higher avg frame rates. This translates to smoother game play at max settings. Playing Borderlands 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 the increase was within 15 - 20+ @ 1440.  I'll also note this card has a physical onboard Overclock switch that is set Normal. I have not tested this.Its BIG and HeavyThere's no getting around this. Length and Width are considerable and I would really consider the case one plans on putting this into. ie: Your case should be running a cool ambient temperature and offer plenty of space for air flow. It's three lanes wide and those fans need little to no obstructions. See attached pics for reference comparisons to a RTX 2080 Super. Medium sized cases with plenty of components inside may present ambiet cooling challenges.RTX: Real Time Ray Tracing and DLSSYes RTX can have some really impressive effect when used but its still very expensive when enabled.  It saps an avg 20 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 and to be quite honest the game already has some impressive visuals for me those extra frames are better used for actual fights. DLSS 2.0 is the real technology here worth writing about. It really does create some impressive scaling that yields impressive performance gains.Power HungryI am running a two year old EVGA 1000 Watt PSU running an OC'd CPU 32GB sys RAM two HD's and one SSD and an optical drive. This card has three 8 Pin power connectors so it is power hungry. It is not advisable to use a power split cable (a cable with two 8 pin plugs).Now I have checked EVGA's official forums and the mods have verified that newer PSU's rated at 800 Watts or above are good to use two 8 Pin power cables instead of three. Having read reviews were people are encounter high temps excessive fans and frame rate issues I went with three separate cables running into my PSU. I haven't encountered any problems.I am running this on a Corsair water cooled system in a big case which runs very quietly and I've yet to hear the fans on the 3090 run up while playing any titles.If you are running a much older PSU and/or its rated below 800 Watts you might really consider upgrading it.What Frame Rates can you  expect?Unless you are running top tier Intel or AMD CPU's your frames won't match those posted on Tech Review sites. My frame rate increases are relative to my existing hardware particularly the CPU.  It shows in the fact that I am using a mid range CPU from two years ago. An OC'd Intel i7-7700K. So I will not be hitting those numbers until I complete my system  built around AMD's Ryzen 9 5900X.Final WordUnless you're a content creator this card is a bit of overkill in the cost to performance gains. I use editing applications that benefit from architecture in the RTX 3090.Due to its sheer size and power requirements I really can't see this going into a mid sized cases especially if overclocking is a goal. Cooling could be a problem.A card like this really is set back if its being paired with mid range components. I can see that with my build right now which is why im building a new rig around it.For that reason I would be hard pressed to recommend the 3090 just for gaming when the RTX 3080 is likely the best bet in cost and power usage. The net gains here are minimal in comparison.
5,This card was the one I intended to get when I wanted to get into the 30 series of cards however I got a gigabyte vision RTX 3090. It does the job and it really runs great but I wasn't a fan of the overall design and temps. I will keep it as a back up 3090 just incase this one hits the fan.
3,Was a little more scratched up then described  still have to test card function.
5,I liked the performance but out the gate the card was very hot after a few minutes playing call of duty vanguard. With very good settings.  My fans were 75 or pretty much stock out the gate however I found that I had to purchase a air-conditioning unit for my man cave the heat this card gave off was just incredible but the performance was out if this world. All in all the card is a beast but not worth the money until it's liquid cooled and in a room with the ambient temperature at 62 degrees. This is the only way to use this card
5,It's a hot card but destroys renders and blasts through encoding chores. Hopefully it lasts as long as all of my other evga cards.
5,Well worth the wait and pounce when the time is right...It is flawless. I have a complete i912900k water cooled 32gb 6000 ram 2 2tb samsung 980 pro Evga geforce 3090 with corsair xl5000 w/10 case fans... spaghetti in da back!!!
5,Original brand new evga product. The perfect match for my 3090 evga ultra gaming. This piece of hardware reduces my render times by half.This little monster is very thick (3 slots) make sure you have enough space if you go for a dual GPU setup.High temperatures. By rendering complex scenes temperatures reach between 85 ºC and 90 ºC degrees however it's nothing that cannot be fixed by a fan curve.
3,1 hit was that this thing couldn't run COD Vanguard on my monitor (Samsung Odyssey G9) at full 240Hz on Ultra. It capped around 150 fps with DLSS off. Also every jitter / studder in game and menus were still present with thing. With my 3070 I can play Vanguard on ultra (native resolution) with DLSS set to ultra performance and get around 100-150 fps while leaning above 120 on most maps. I know DLSS downscales and then upscales but I can't really tell any difference visually. The problem is that the 3090 costs more than double. It would also get so hot my PC would crash and I'm thinking that the CPU was probably getting too hot from the card. Ultimately I returned it and am currently sitting on fat stacks with pretty much the same performance. I'd rather have another mid-tier card after a few years than be stuck with a monster for a decade. Also I noticed that Vanguard only eats about 8GB VRAM regardless of the card.
4,I paid 3 1/2 times the value or MSRP for this card. And dammit if I just don’t love it! Now that the prices are coming back to normal there is some buyers regret but not for the card just for the price. If you’re a gamer you can’t do any better! If your self deprecating I think the seller has another one lol
5,The top-of-the line aircooled GPU performs perfectly out of the box.Thermals are about on par with the FE so the extra $300 is really buying the EVGA label and aesthetic.This was the first 30 series I could snag after months of trying every in stock notification on several sites for 3080 and 3090. I've always been fond of the EVGA cards I've had in the past and it would have been my preferred 3rd party seller even if I'd had full choice.Can't say how much of an upgrade this would feel like coming from a 1080 Ti or 2080 Ti but from the Radeon R9 390 I upgraded from it feels like several generational leaps.RTX has pleasantly suprised me. From the marketing prior to trying it I had thought of raytracing as a gimmick but seeing it in games and the way the scene behind your character is reflected on surfaces in front of you (windows puddles shiny cars etc) is subtle but psychologically impactful in immersing you in the world.Shadows are the element next most improved by raytracing looking a bit softer and more realistic than even those produced by the complex lighting systems of recent years.This model directly uses 3 full 8-pin connections from your PSU rather than being adapted to a 20-pin like the FE cards. The height is a true 3-slot card but it is very wide and very long - definitely measure your case. My case door barely clears the power cables.It is heavy too so if sag bothers you there are riser/pole/stand things that support the front of the card given that your case is long enough to fit that accessory.
5,Upgraded from a 3080ti and even though it is faster the improvements are barely noticed in gaming.Due to high memory temps the backplate cooling mod is a must.
5,This card is the best of the best right now. It requires a lot of power so make sure you have at least 1000 W power supply. It requires 3 6+2 VGA connections from the power supply. I use three separate connections so that there is no problems. I also have a corsair 1300 W psu. The card came packaged in the original packaging and it arrived fairly quickly and installed with no problems.
5,It heats a lot but its power is insane. Evga offers excellent warranty so that means more peace of mind.
2,I'm usually an AMD customer but the raytracing features and the general internet consensus of higher performance on NVIDIA won me over for this one. And to be fair the raytracing is fantastic and the performance was amazing on newer games like Cyberpunk and Metro: Exodus.But I'm used to not having to think too hard about getting my graphics cards to work and that's where this has been a major disappointment. Da Vinci Resolve has major issues unless you use a specific Studio driver from way back but new games have major issues if you're not using the latest Game Ready drivers. And then every game older than a few years that I fire up has crashes and other issues and after looking at the forums and troubleshooting for hours I discover that some specific driver from years ago is the only version that is stable for that particular application. On top of that part of the reason I bought this card was for a triple monitor setup for work and it turns out that having more than two monitors on these NVIDIA cards is guess what another common source of crashes and I had to unplug the 3rd for stability's sake.This is a premium product and I'm disappointed that I need to keep track of half a dozen driver versions and constantly swap between them depending on what game I want to play or what editing software I want to use. I can get it somewhat stable but for the price it should be stable without all the extra work and headaches and compromises.And then I also need to be afraid of new games potentially bricking the card due to unlocked framerates such as with the new Amazon MMORPG. If it happens once with one game and required a patch on their end how can I trust another new game to not damage this card? So now I need to worry not just about putting in dozens of hours to tweak it to some semblance of stability but I need to run away from betas and early access titles because who knows which one is going to start frying cards next?It is a more powerful card than I am used to as an AMD customer and wow was Cyberpunk pretty on it but at this point I don't think the constant fragility and insane price has been worth it. I'm going back to AMD cards when this one eventually croaks or overheats or whatever. I'm just hoping it lasts long enough to not leave me cardless before the end of the GPU shortage.If you're after the most powerful thing you could put on your motherboard sure this is it. But it's falling apart at the seams so you'll have to decide if it's worth that kind of headache.
4,Picked up two of these (way overpriced) for a rig built to render graphics.  One of them has a fan that rattles a bit much and may be sent back for repairs.  Download the Precision X1 software from EVGA to control the fans and LEDs.Build note had to run a cable out and over the cards from my Wraith Ripper that was prevented the top GPU from seating correctly.  Recommend a case that allows for additional mounting brackets that come with the GPUs these are heavy beasts.  Powering per GPU is 3x8 with those being 6+2 so please plan for extra cables.If you can get on a waiting list to pick them up at MSRP or wait until prices come back down after the recent mining craze dwindles away (Unless you are like me and "home office" needed some upgrades).  I know "gaming" is in the name which is a gimmick but I couldn't review that performance for you.  Fun fact two of these are more powerful than a Quadro 8000 (on sale for a cool $5k from the launch price of $10k).
5,This card is amazing and runs everything for me with ray tracing at high frame rates. You can't go wrong with this one.
5,My card fried on New World but was replaced by EVGA in like less than 48 hours. They really stand behind their products.Make sure you're running it on PCIE 4.0 x16 for quality performance.These run -HOT- like liquid magma. Watercool them. Evga sells a "Hybrid kit" that you can install on this card I know because I did it myself. It's essentially just adding a radiator and liquid cooling to it without doing a custom pump and tubes and stuff. I highly recommend the hybrid kit as well as this card.
5,Great for serious gaming and multi-tasking.  It can handle whatever is thrown at it. However this graphics card gets very hot.  You must have a computer case with a lot of airflow.
5,Got the card popped it in and it works great. Going from a 2080Ti believe it or not there isn't much difference. One thing that stands out is this card is very quiet.
1,UPDATE: after 2 months of barely working sometimes never posting at all my GPU stopped working during any kind of 3d program or game. RMA in progress. Will update when i receive the new GPU.Original: I bought this after throughly reviewing every possible prosumer card that could both play games with and produce videos with in Adobe suite. as far as performance goes the only reason to get this card over the 3080 ti is extra vram for 3d and compositioning apps.that being said I initially bought an 850 W power supply which ended up causing black outs. I had to upgrade to 1300 W power supply.Now that i've got the card to not drop out and have plenty of juice pumping through it my NXZT flow 510 case doesn't have nearly enough ventilation to cool this thing. It gets so hot it heats up my whole office it's unreal. you could get a cast iron back place and fry bacon on it.Anyway I did so much in-depth research there should be no way I didn't buy all the right things. not only did i have to buy two psus and two cases i'm gonna invest in a water block.I wish i would've went for the 3080 ti and waited for a prosumer card in the 40 series.Overall this was supposed to be a 1200 dollar deal but looks like i'm going to have to invest  more into cooling as well now. This thing is a damn air fryer in the case it's in now even when idle idk.
5,Very adept card. Works well for what I purchased it for.
5,Upgraded from a 3060ti and this is an insane card.Hands down best gpu I’ve ever used.
5,Very impressed with this card and what can I say the price was fair.  I'm very happy with this card and the way it performs.  Definately worth 2 grand.
5,great product for mining ... !
5,Very Good Card .
5,Very good quality unit
3,While it is a good product it was horrifically overpriced.  But as it was the only one available I had to pay.
4,While I do not  condone the practice scalping ppl the seller did process and ship my order without issue however the shipping could have been better for such a high value item.The card itself is as stated and  performs very well so far no issues.I rated this purchase at 4 star just due to the gouging price for the item.
2,This graphics card heats up and fast.It gets extremely hot to the touch.If your going to buy be ready to buy some kind of heatsink. Actually it should be a highly recommended suggestion when purchasing or they should sell in a bundle.I like it but frustrating.Now prices are dropping.Never again.
2,seems to get overheated then crashed while playing never had this issue with 3080
5,Great product and fast shipping!
5,This card is bonkers powerful. I finally can play Cyberpunk with raytracing. More seriously it really helps out in 3D rendering.Truth be told though I paid too much (not scalper prices but ~$1900 which is bad enough).One thing to note about this card is it's a power hog. My total system load went up about 150-200 Watts. My UPS even kicked off once and shut my whole system down.Also the memory modules get HOT like 95 Celsius hot.If you don't know you can customize the RGB with the EVGA Precision X1 software. Took me a while to realize that one.
2,It worked for a few days and all of a sudden it would crash under load. Tried everything still crashed. Temps and everything were fine. Put my old graphics card back in everything worked normal. I returned the graphics card.
5,Massively unnecessary upgrade from my 1080ti but hot damn is it amazing.  Running native 4K at 120hz is incredible.Recommendation for this card is get your Power Supply Unit and PSU cables in check.  For those that don’t know they recommend running the three 8 pin PSU cables to your power supply individually and not using the dual 8 pin splitter.  This will allow the card to pull the necessary power from three 8 pin ports on the PSU. Otherwise you limit the power send to the card thus limiting its performance.
4,Product was exactly what I was looking for and had performed like expected with great thermals. However this is probably the worst time to try and buy a graphics card as stock is so limited and prices are high. Each person’s situation is different so judge for yourself if the price is acceptable. Card is exceptional.
5,I know everyone in this game has to make there money and if you had a chance to get your hands on one of these and sell them like every third party company is doing you would do the same. But I will say this company I went with was the most fair price. The company responded insanely fast. Answered all my questions and shipped my package out so fast. I received  it the next day. Give this company a shot you won't be disappointed. Items are well packed. Thank you again sheerness :)
4,No factory issue with a card was able to get direct from Amazon at MRCP before official price increase by EVgA. Problem is that card runs hot so if you like me and have a mid tower NZXT 710 the card was hitting 80C at times with gaming. That’s with three exhaust case fans and front 360mm radiator with three intake fans. Had to purchase hybrid kit and install - that improved temperatures by 10C.
1,I know we’re in the middle of a shortage on computer components including every new mainstream GPU but I definitely urge you to stay away from this 3090. My problems started right away once I finished my new build in games like Halo MCC and GTA V.When I first ran Halo MCC the video output card would crash right away and I’d end up with a black screen even though the rest of the computer was on. Didn’t think much of it other than it could be a software/driver issue so stayed away from Halo. I started to play GTA V and the same black screen crash would happen intermittently where the card would lose power/die but everything else was still on. This started to make me believe it was possibly a hardware issue on the card. This happened for a better part of 3-4 weeks until one day last week it finally caught fire near the power connector on the PCB (you can see it in the picture). Thankfully the rest of my components were fine but as you can imagine I have completely lost my trust in all EVGA GPU’s this generation.EVGA has been helpful through the process and they are sending me an RMA card however I will likely end up returning it as I got my hands on another 3090 card. I highly recommend you stay away from EVGA 30 series cards until they’re able to sort out whatever is going on with them. At the time of writing this EVGA has yet to acknowledge this as an issue even though many people on their forums and Subreddit are reporting similar issues. (Loud audible pop followed by smoking up and then red LED lights).
5,I know 3080 might have done the job and this card is an overkill. But because its best in the line it will give you the comfort of knowing that something must be wrong with the game if it stutters. I have upgraded from a 1070 and the performance jump is mind-blowing. VR performance of this card is amazing as well. It stays super cool even when I run most demanding games.I think for now when getting a 3080 is almost impossible. My EVGA 3090 purchase has left me extremely satisfied
5,I managed to get this through EVGA here on Amazon MSRP. $1799I bought it for Rendering/Animation not for casual gaming. OMG.. 3 to 4 times faster than my old 1080TI depending on scene. Totally worth it. Once I upgrade my PSU to 1600W I'm going to get another onePro: If you are a content creator that depends on Cuda Cores for time this card is for you.Con: Everyday users.. No Just no. Unless you want 4K-8K and have money to blow. Not the card for you.
1,When if first got this card it was great but slowly over time it became more and more unstable to the point I couldn't even play a game a basic as CK2 or Half-Life 1. It would just Hard Crash every time. So after reinstalling Windows several times applying multiple fixes from across the internet Upgrading Drives Downgrading Drivers. I eventually RMAed it. I get a new one back and I honestly have to say at the very least EVGAs customer service is superb. I even went as far to swap out the Motherboard and PSU in my build just to reduce any potential problems. But fast-forward about 2 months later and the SAME PROBLEMS start popping up random driver crashes blue screens Hard System Resets. Only like a week ago did I decide to play a game only for that to be the final Nail in the coffin. It was completely dead. No Video Out what so ever. Other GPUs I used for testing worked but the 3090 is now dead. Im now on my 2nd RMA. Very Disappointed with the overall stability and build quality.
5,Definitely an expensive product. No way getting around that. But for the price it's an incredible buy. The GPU is dominating everything I throw at it without a struggle. Feels great to have future-proofed my system for a bit. As a bonus EVGA has actually been shipping out revised models of this card without the strange red "clown lips" on the side of the card. I was lucky enough to receive one without those lips. It's just a black side with the RGB EVGA logo. A much appreciated revision!
5,Yes everyone knows a 3080 is roughly 85% the performance of a 3090 at a better price but good luck getting one. I was able to jump on this at retail price by monitoring tracking websites. This is perfect for me especially with the higher vram than a 3080 as I do quite a bit of 4K video editing. Performance and graphics quality for gaming or workstation use are amazing on this card and personally I would absolutely buy it again.
4,The product is great no problems and came with in sufficient packaging to avoid any damage.  That being said it was at a scalper's pricing of $2249.99 when I bought it.
4,To start off the card is a BEAST it preforms wells from minecraft to triple A games. The only down part is that it was way bigger than I thought. I had to get another $150 case just to fit it. But I would recommend if ya can get your hands on one! GL!
2,It is great until...it isn't. Less than 3 months in I got black screens. Thankfully Amazon and EVGA have amazing customer service and resolved this swiftly. May need an update once the new card arives....to be continued.
5,Just wanted to mention that when I received my 3090 FTW3 card on 12/1/2020 I did receive Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War and Geforce Experience codes. It didn't display it in the item description when I ordered this card but it did come with it.EDIT. Received my second one on 1/15/2021 and it came with the black shroud (black lips)!!! So I’m sure you’ll get that version moving forward. Even the packaged box was updated.
4,The card is awesome. But there's no free game. (Maybe they will add it in the future)Purchased on Oct 23 2020.  Emailed EVGA about the promotion they told me the free game redeem code is provided by retailers (Amazon). Then I checked with Amazon's customer service. They confirmed it doesn't have any watchdogs/GFNow/COD promotion for now (Oct 30 2020).
4,If your a serious PCMR with money to burn this is still a bad value but it was my only option and you know what I've been having a blast running everything at max settings.Also this thing can pull 700watts by itself!
3,Loved having this graphics card.... It did everything so well! It was amazing!Until New World bricked it. :(
5,I bought this for my VR build I have in the living room and this thing is a beast of a card. The case we used was a Corsair Air 540 with plenty of airflow and a multitude of fans. I can hear the thing with my VR headset on. It does beautifully though. I don't expect I'll need an upgrade for some time.
5,So with graphics cards being in high demand I had to make a choice. Do I overpay by around $400 for a lower tier graphics card or do I pay $200-$300 for the best in comparison to their base price? I decided to go for the best and do not regret my decision one bit. If you can afford it this thing is awesome! 🙂
5,Performs very well as advertised.  It does get quite hot but that is expected.My system had difficulties with the PCIeX16 slot I had to troubleshoot with an old video card.  It was not a problem with the new RTX3090 but a problem with the motherboard (which is also new).  So don't jump to conclusions.The EVGA card is very good so far and I am glad I had found one to purchase.
5,Thanks for having this card available Amazon!  Grabbed it on Thanksgiving and had it 6 days later.  Originally had an ETA after December 14th.  Loving it so far!  Bought this and sold my 3080.  Mainly for the added vram headroom.  Games are going to be using more and more of it and wanted to be good for a few years.
5,Fast shipping arrived before it was expected to be I use it for gaming upgraded from a 1050 Ti highly recommend this seller it was exactly as described brand new and sealed
5,this card works great this is my first pc and i don't know what i was doing so i got the best of the best.don't really need this if your gaming. its way too expensive just for a gaming rig.if i could go back id probably get a 3080 insted. hope this was helpful. :)
5,Outstanding service by the vendor. However the price markup was definitely way to high. But with the lack of cards in the market I felt I had no choice. This card is the best I have ever purchased. Nvidia and Evga created a beast that is silent and handles any game or program you throw at it.
5,I went from a 1060 on my old pc  to This card  on my new build and it's an incredible card . a shame people  have to fight bots and scalper to get one ( It came with a copy of cod blackops Coldwars not sure why other people in reviews said they didn't get a code for the game)
5,GPU came in original box without any damage. Completely untouched even had the original tape from the manufacturer on. Works like a dream.Even came a few days early. Price was insane though.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La mejor tarjeta del mercado 24gb de video para los mas exigentes y un poder brutal.EVGA hizo un gran trabajo de fabricacion como siempre una tarjeta super robusta con buena disipación un RGB hermoso super estable.Muy contento con mi compra.
4,It's a solid card. Bigger than what I expected. Super quiet. It's a 3090 nuff said. But yeah love the overhead amount of vram feel safe in getting something solid for the next few years.
5,I absolutely love this card. I upgraded from an old EVGA 980SC and I don't regret my decision a bit. More VRAM then you'll ever need in the gaming world for now. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade if you're able to snag one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The RGB bar is amazing! It’s the best looking RTX3xxx card imo. The FPS is nice and stable on any games I have played so far. Warzone PUBG RE2 at 1440p 144hz. Great card from EVGA!
1,I still can't believe that they have still not fixed the blue screen errors with these cards. As a video editor the random crashes are just something I cannot tolerate especially paying as much as I did for this. Returning.
5,You can’t beat the price before tariff taxes. The card is a beast even at high gaming and a good mining card. Super cool and super money saving on power
1,Was so excited as this was the last item I needed for my new system—first build in 15 years!  System was built and configured with an old graphics card before this arrived today.  Plugged this beast in excited like a kid on Christmas hooked it up to my 65” QLED and hit the power…. A 1 second flicker of the RGBs on the GPU then the whole system shut down.  Checked everything called EVGA (they were incredibly friendly) but alas it is a dud.Hoping the new one gives me zero problems.  Also they dropped the price $100–so I hope they will credit that back to me too. 🤞🏼🤞🏼
4,I like it.
5,This will do anything you need.  Go see any review on YT it'll be better than anything I would say.  Perhaps over priced but lives up to the hype.  Sag is a problem so factor that in to your build.
5,I use this for gaming after work and it's amazing. No real issues and very rarely it gets loud when it's handling something intense which is normal for all graphics cards. I just wish it wasn't so expensive.
5,This is a solid card! It is NOT a great deal for the money obviously. A 3080 would be a much better value but if you want the absolute best no matter the cost then this 3090 is great!
4,Amazing but not bang for the buck
4,Overall satisfied with this product but the price was ridiculous
5,Insane performance jump. Even the most demanding VR title plays effortlessly. 240hz HDR Samsung G9 superultrawide monitor with settings maxed is pure eye candy. Runs pretty hot so invest in proper cooling.
5,This video graphics card is amazing. It is new so it is pricey. We use it for gaming in 4K and professional video editing.  It requires three connections to the power supply.
1,Well I do not know where to begin. The unit shipped advertised as new. Either these cards suck in general or this card was shipped used. I am averaging 80 fps @1080p in GTA5 a tile that is eight years old. I bought this card to run Star citizen in VR. A title that will require the beefiest of rigs. My previous setup never crashed this garbage has crashed eight plus times since I installed it yesterday. I am running a liquid build with two gigantic radiators and six high pressure fans and the bottle neck in my benchmark test was the GPU not the CPU which is years older.Everything about these cards is a lie; the price for these cards is unbelievably high; and it doesn't even deliver close to the performance advertised.I have built seven or eight full systems since I was twelve years old While I am not much of an overclocking enthusiast I do know a bit more about building computers than most.Trust me when I say do not buy this overpriced crap.
1,Contacted EVGA twice to get this RTX3090 Repaired on a known issue with RTX3090 that stops working. Went through all the information with them and they keep wanting me to send same information over and over. Wasted over an hour of my time getting the run around. This is the second new product that EVGA did not support. I went to other brands to avoid the frustration.
5,Really good card if you can get it. Would suggest a 1000w PSU to go with it.
5,At first I thought I was overpaying for this but prices have only kept going up thanks to the chip shortage.  Don't expect a cheap GPU anytime soon.
5,Exactly what you would expect from EVGA it's a beautiful graphics card for gaming if you can get it at or near msrp.
5,The value of money it’s overrated but it’s still decent graphics card in market
5,Fit perfectly but barely into my case! Performance is like nothing I've experienced before. So fast and smooth in many applications and gaming. Price could be lower but that's MSRP for you.
5,Will run at 2K no problems!
5,BUT DO NOT BUY FROM A SCALPER UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST.And if you must make sure it's "Fulfilled by Amazon."
5,I can play cs go at so many fps that getting noob tubed has never looked better.
5,Amazing card runs as anticipated. It is bulky though keep that in mind. And it’s LOUD (streamers take note)
5,YES. REAL NICE.
1,I received an item that was sold like new and it is not the performance my 2070 super performance is better than this supposed beast GPU. On the other hand I place the replacement request and the also sent me another USED GPU!!! What a shame!!
5,This card is huge. Games are awesome! A bit overkill for price since 3080 are unicorns at the moment.
1,The product never functioned as advertised an RTX 2080 I was able to borrow to help troubleshoot my issues performed better than it.  Mine also has causes the screen to flicker and may crash when under any serious load.
5,If you're looking at this you already know what to expect. The best air cooled RTX 3090 on the market.
5,This thing is HUGE and power hungry.... but it's quite amazing performance!
5,Way to high for the money but excellent other than that.
5,Upgraded to this from the RTX 2080 Super. It was worth every penny.
5,Where's the "for mining rating"?
5,Reliable unit
5,Powerful Stable and everything perfect.
5,Fantastic! Monster upgrade!
5,Great video card!!
5,Easy to Overstock
3,[Bottom Text]
1,very overpriced i should have bought from evga original website
1,I did like that they took my money right away  and received the card right away as well but this card only lasted for 37 days before I had to ship it out to evga RMA this card pooped the bed right away  wish it did before the amazon warranty was up but instead it passed the 30 day mark. Upset !!!
1,Mine was a lemon from day 1.  Would not get out of idle clock speed and the first 8 pin was pulling all the wattage.  QC was not used on this card.
5,Great card. It's an absolute beast and should last me years. However initially my entire system would shutdown whenever the card had power spikes. This could be resolved by running the card at only 50% power but who buys a card like this for only 50%? Thankfully EVGA was super helpful they knew exactly was wrong and shipped me a newer revision of my power supply. Haven't had any problems since.
5,Nvidia is pushing back the next series to milk this one longer. Typical anti-consumer BS but that's world we live in now.
5,Just some quick background on me.  I have been into PC hardware since the AGP days and have spent countless thousands of dollars on PC hardware.  When the last crypto crash happened I picked up an EVGA 1080ti SSC Hybrid for about $600.  I used that card for 3 years then I sold it on eBay when I was sure that crypto was going to crash again (when it was outlawed in China).  I sold that card used on eBay for $600 which essentially gave me a great gaming card for 3 years for free.Well crypto didn't crash.  I started investing in some coins and had done very minor mining with the 1080ti right before I sold it.  I wasn't really that impressed with the results but it was something I was curious about.  I have been getting into crypto a lot more lately and I decided to pick one of these up to mine with.  I know I hate me too.  Hear me out though as this is the reason that I am writing this review.This card is about $3430 after tax right now which is crazy... But it will pay itself off within 12 months at the rate that it is mining.  With the EVGA version you can extend your warranty to 10 YEARS upon registration.  It is an extra $60 to do so but an easy choice on something with this price tag.  So if I end up burning this thing up at any point in the next 10 years EVGA will replace it for me with a like card.  From my experience EVGA replaces like for like.  You buy a flagship GPU they replace it with the current flagship when it dies.Theoretically this means that I have just purchased all my next 10 years of upgrades for this high price which the mining will pay for within 12 months.  If mining stays where it is you can make about $3650/year on this.  As I am working about 60 hours a week currently I do not have time to game.  Surprisingly I have not loaded one game on this yet.  I would like to but it'll have to be on a long weekend after the honey-do list is caught up.  I saw this as an investment to make me some money pay for my next 10 years of upgrades and allow me to do some gaming when I have time again.  Well that's how I sold the wife on it anyway.No regerts.
5,Faster than stock 3090 Ti if overclocked. Runs 23c idle 52c under load 60c during benchmarks at 65% fan speed. Make sure you get revision 1.2 as it fixes several issues although 1.0 also fixes those same issues compared to 0.1Main reason I picked this card over 3090 Ti is significantly lower idle and load power consumption. 850w PSU is more than sufficient.This model is binned.
5,Just an amazing piece of hardware in the 20 years I've been interested in computers. 1440p/4k ultra gaming really is quite an experience that hump of saying "Yeah these graphics look great but I think we've still got a ways till it really is jawdropping" between 2016-2020 are over. Textures lighting and of course pixel density really show the pinnacle of what games can do.The FTW3 Ultra is a great choice for those who are more than enthusiasts but not part of the extreme overclocking demographic. It is faster cooler and has all the features you need when compared to other brands and to me the RGB bar is the best looking thing I've seen on a GPU especially since it is one of the few 3000 series cards that have the model number for you to show off.I've paired it with 3600 cl16 corsair d. pro RAM 5950x stock 980 pro 1tb x570e and this machine is a beast.I work in CAD which is what pushed me to buy a 3090 over a 3080. The VRAM is crucial for me and extremely noticeable.
1,Good luck selling these now at these prices. Ha Ha Ha
4,I finally got my hands on one of these by way of MicroCenter because I could not get one from Amazon after trying for months. I gave this 3 stars for value because it is NOT worth over $2000. This is jut the world we live in today with bots and scalpers. Did I pay that much? Yes. Is it worth that much? No. I still bought it so moving on.This is the single biggest card I have ever owned. I have a Lian Li PC-O11 Dynamic case (not the XL). You can see it here: https://lian-li.com/product/pc-o11-dynamic/ It is a great case for modding. There is one minor issue that this card has brought to light. Unless you are going to mount it vertically you CANNOT close this case after installing this card!I have ordered some 180degree adapters but the short story is that once it is installed and cabled the cables themselves stick too far out for the case to be closed. You *could* pinch them and bend them to make it fit but that would be a bad decision.So there you have it. Wonderful card that costs too much and is just fat enough to keep me from closing my case without a cable mod. Just an FYI is you have the same case.I ordered these and hopefully this will solve the problem for me: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P3JDQNC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1,BE VERY CAFEFUL purchasing these cards from third party sellers. These cards have been used for bitcoin mining and have been placed through loads of stress and high temps. Then when they can no longer preform well they sell them as a brand-new card but you will never get top performance out of these cards. They're already dead and worn out before you even make the purchase. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!
4,For those that complain about the price.  Chances are you didn't buy it directly from EVGA but a third party vendor that's selling it on Amazon for jacked up price.  IF you see it listed on Amazon for $3K+; when its 2x above msrp; and you still bought it; and complain that it's DOA.  That's on you and your poor judgement.  I have the card; and it works great.
5,Ignore the fanboys this card stays pretty cool though it does use a bit of power during computing spikes. I'd wait until pandemic pricing is over though hard to justify the prices as they are during the time of this review. The extra memory the 3090 has will not really help in gaming situations but it is really good for machine learning. Gaming this card can handle a lot. If your PSU is beefy and you want the best performance for a premium go with this card. It helps if you have another use besides gaming to justify it though. If it is purely for games I would go the 3080 if you can get your hands on it.
5,Works great speed is amazing and the graphics are literally insane.... hands down EVGA makes the best cards and their mail list on their site prevents bots.  Nothing better than them as a company or their cards.
5,this gpu is all that and more like ther guy said  120hz on this lg oled 65in 2019 model 4k is amazing and something to see nothing beats a oled. and i got my gpu from j&c for 2100.00$ all you have to do is call them and get put on the list and is is a very short one at that i was called 9 days after getting on it good luck. and this is the newer one from evga it has black lips.
1,Extremely overpriced! Don’t buy.
5,I just upgraded from a 1080 Founders Edition and I really like that card for the few years I've had it. This thing is on a whole other level though. I kept checking for availability everyday and randomly it was available at MSRP so if you are trying to get one too just be patient. After tax it was $2000 or so and holy crap is it a beast. It does draw a lot of power so make sure you have at least a 750W Gold or higher PSU to allow for headroom. Others have recommended  850W and that might be the better option. Still tinkering with it to get the best overclock although it's base and boost clock are substantially higher than most 3090s right out of the box. If you have the funds and want the best I'd say go for it but if you are more performance per dollar minded try to get the 3080TI when it comes out as it promises to deliver similar performance for hundreds less.
3,Be careful there are lots of reports of Amazon's new game New World bricking this particular card in addition to a few others. Menus run at max framerate and it kills the fan controller. A patch should be inbound soon to fix this; however this is an issue!
1,You should be ashamed of yourself charging so much for this card. No wonder you can’t find an affordable card all the scalpers have them. I would rather deal with the card I have thanPay this refocus price!
5,Got this through EVGA website. Stock clocks hitting 1950 MHz I thought it was 1800. It's a really good card runs at 60C stock. Putting a Bytski Waterblock on it in 2 weeks. The heatsink is pretty darn big.
5,Bought for at 1799.99. Absolute steal.
1,These price are ridiculous!!! Would never pay this for a gpu.
1,Total garbage
1,Do not buy at this price 😂
1,I had one of these cards fail on me which seems incredibly common with the new evga cards.  I was running a bitcoin mining farm with 13 cards using a mineral oil cooling system.  This system kept my cards way cooler than the stock cooling...  Essentially this card was babied.I sold the card and within a few days the guy who bought it messages me and tells me the card started flickering then died when he was gaming with it.  To me this was obviously a gpu issue as mining underclocls the GPU in favor of overclocking the dram.  The card couldn't handle a normal gaming load and died.  The person sent the card in for an RMA and EVGA refused to fix it because it had been in mineral oil.  Liquid immersion cooling is the most effective form of cooling.  To me this is bull.Out of my thirteen cards EVGA was the only non FE card I had to replace the thermal pads on it is not well designed. It is also the only card that failed.  They are not well designed and I'm not the only person to have the card fail from a relatively stressless situation.Zotac and PNY make similarly priced cards and they have real thermal handling and aren't having issues.  Go with one of those brands instead.
1,Headline says it all.
1,This might be the "most powerful" consumer graphics card in existence but that doesn't mean you should take out a second mortgage to buy it. Silicon can usually be expected to go down in value as time goes on. Moore's law means every few years the same dollar amount will get you tech that is twice as good as before. The graphic card market has artificially inflated prices because of crypto miners production shortages and now scalpers. Price scalping is not ok. Don't be a sucker. Don't waste your money.
1,Scalper
1,I replaced my 1080ti with this card. Paid 2k for this 3090 and I get half the performance of the 1080ti. I own an IT company and have done everything to troubleshoot this card. Technical support doesn't have a lot of answers. BE CAREFUL! I would wait until they iron out the bugs
1,Got my 3090 in hopes to have a real upgrade from my base 2080. After 5 hours trying everything I could the gpu just does not work and the sli slot looks to be in really rough condition. Buy at your own risk but i would stay far away
1,It will do fine for a bit. Then it will either overheat or crash. Thankfully none of mine have caught on fire yet. Just buy another brand. The customer support is great but wow… the actual product is terrible.
1,Don't buy anything from this scalping pos
1,Amazon is allowing people to mark these up excessively! STOP supporting it!!
1,I think but coin miners should be traced automatically at checkout if buying more than 3 cards that should be a dead give away that way gamers who really need and want the card don't have to sell a kidney to get one
1,Scalper do not buy.
1,Almost $3k for this!?!?!? WTF!?!?!?
1,Nobody is gonna buy that for that horrendous price. Better finish school and start earning money in a more respectable way manchild.Your a begginer mongolic scalper. Nobody will buy that lmao.
1,I feel so sorry for those who feel the need to spend 3500$ on a graphics card that is just a fraction of the price....you can buy a decent FULLY BUILT pc for the same price WITH the same GPU....people need to do their homework so these scalpers are put out of business.....
2,Avoid this like the plague unless you want 3080 performance.
1,I previously bought an EVGA 1080ti card and it died within one year. NEVER AGAIN. Be careful. The cards seems to be made cheaply. Can't trust this brand for quality GPU's.
1,It's been like 5 months.  Know anyone who got one near MSRP?  This is ridiculous.
1,Scalpers
1,Overpriced
1,For this price you might as well buy the top of the line laptop from Alienware.
1,You're better than this EVGA.
5,Current market makes these hard to get that's for sure. Thanks to stock-informer and a little aid of code and managed to get one for myself. Good work horse for heavy media encoding while doing great for gaming ( 2K Doom Eternal rarely drops below 300FPS ).  Thought I'd dislike the massive RGB banding on the side as the photos over emphasize it a lot. But honestly its fairly tame considering in normal configuration you can only see the name of the card. Very smooth no flickering/pwm annoyance which is great. Seems to idle around 27C. The GPU brace included is made for specific cases only...so don't expect to use it.  Just another beast of a card from EVGA Love it!
5,This thing is a freaking BEAST! Purchased primarily as for workstation use but I'm also using it for gaming and stepping up from a GTX 1070 this card is a complete performance monster in every way. Pair it up with an i9-10850K and 4K gaming on max settings is an absolute breeze! If you have the cash to splash there's no question that you should get this card! If all you're looking for is gaming performance and you don't need the extra productivity benefits it's smaller brother the RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra is another fantastic option to consider (although at the time they're much more difficult to come by).
4,This is a great top of the line GPU and I have not had any issues so far with it. 24 GB VRAM is great for many applications such as content creation and ML applications.  I feel that with performance being close to the 3090 FE though the $300 hile is not worth it and hence am docking a star.Thermals are acceptable the card does run hot but it is very quiet.
5,I ordered this product for $2100 from this seller and hoped it would be a great purchase. Not only did the product come over a week earlier than Amazon said it would but after getting this 3090 installed it works perfectly. The box and items were all sealed as new. Judging on how even some 2080 supers are going for over $2300 when I was looking at upgrades I would recommend this vendor if another 3090 comes up for sale if you were on the fence about going for a new video card.
5,Awesome card for gaming. The temps stay low even at higher settings and frame rates are awesome in first person shooters and graphics look great with ultra settings and ray tracing in RPGs. This seller gets it shipped fairly fast as well! Only con is it’s a huge and heavy card I recommend getting an anti sag bracket for this behemoth.
5,This graphic is perfect for playing 2k and 4k 144hz shooting games.
5,I took a chance on this card because Amazon had it listed as Used Like New. I still over payed by $600 but it is what it is. The card needed thermal pads bad that’s something I didn’t expect. Now the card is working great. I’m mining 124mh with it.

5,Card is a BEAST.If you dont at least have a Ryzen 9 (Correction* Ryzen 7 5800X3d is the best cpu for gaming) or i9-10900k  and a newer higher/end MOBO go with a  3060 2080 or 1080ti.  Your CPU/MOBO will bottleneck your performance.
5,Monster of a card and I love it.
5,One of the few 3090's that don't need memory cooling pads replaced out of the box.  It takes at least 3 months for them to fail and the memory to overheat like the rest of the 3090 lineup.
5,na
4,The card itself is impressive as expected. I bought it for 3D rendering using the software such as Blender. With this card the Cycles live view in Blender 3.0 is super fast I can see the final result on the viewport really quick about 2 seconds.The card is easy to get hot. To make the fan steady you need to use software such as MSI Afterburner. Otherwise the fans will run in a very annoying pattern.Overall I'm happy with my card. I paid the scalping price of $3100 so honestly the value for money for the card is not great. The heat dissipation system of the card could be improved a little more.
5,I was very fortunate to get one of these.
5,I waited for a long time before I bought this one. I look forward to getting it to me soon! Don't let me wait too long! Please!
5,Overly expensive but whatever.
5,Nothing needs to be said its the king period
5,The best GPU on EARTH! worthy always if u can buy it at the original retailer price.
5,La orden llegó a tiempo en una caja nueva y sellada gracias a dios pues la RTX 3090 es una targeta muy potente la he podido probar con algunos juegos pesados que requieren poder gráfico y se los pasa como si nada con todo al máximo textura resolución Ray t  es una buena targeta no pienso que de momento salga un juego que requiera todo ese poder al menos por ahora la recomiendo aunque esta con sobreprecio pues el costo real de ellas no llega a los dos mil dólares .
3,I have purchased 4 of this Card. the first 2 arrived sealed and other 2 their boxes where open some small scratches on them and a little dust on fans. although both cards work fine but I noticed the they get more hot than the other new sealed ones. Amazon sells used items as new.
5,hands down the best graphics card and a very friendly seller
5,Best card you can get right now honestly nothing else to say.
5,
5,Good Product!
5,Considering current Market Condition about GPU this dealer brought me the BETTER deal all around the market... been looking for weeks.GPU arrived A1 condition new and scealed work perfectly.Really fast Shipping. I would totally recommend this dealer.Just make sure to follow tracking.. had a little issue item stop for no reason at Mirabel Warehouse. (Ready for pick-up).Called them and got it delivered the next day to my house.
5,I bought this graphics unit as a replacement upgrade to my GTX1080ti that took heat damage to the VRAM chips during ETH mining. It turns out the cooling unit on the ROG STRIX 1080ti prioritizes the GPU with little consideration for the VRAM. With this in mind I ordered a water cooling system for my new RTX3090. Upon testing this card with the stock cooler I have observed that the VRAM chips on this one have been well coupled with the cooler and carry temperature sensors for you to monitor. While mining ETH with a power limit of 85% and the case side panel left open the GPU runs at 59C and the hottest VRAM at 65C. No need to install that liquid cooler.
5,Paid a bit too much but it is working.
4,The card is what it is.A overpowered piss poor Samsung chip with mediocre VRAM that can cook you a egg.Does it render framerate ?Yes it does your cpu will shit it self try to keep up.Are Nvidia driver complete garbage & worst than AMD : yes they are.Computing power far from impressive consideringThe price & heat involvedRadeon VII was a better card at that the end.Nvidia : pathetic just patheticFailed basic thermodynamic expensive piss poor board design choice should've gone with HBM2No let's put DDR6X oven element everywhere.-Nvidia right now is Intel right before Ryzen 3XXXSeries with A thumb up their ass keep pretending they are in their glory days.EVGA -I usually like their productsI still think they should make a square series box card without the stupid looking shape & RGB + Noctua fans no trim just cooling.As far as EVGA goes they did a decent job keeping this abortion under control.Performance is goodThe product itself is of good quality.The 2 bios are really niceWarranty A1 as per usual.Bios availability from decent to strait retarded.Not the elephant in the roomCooling is over all good 👍 for gaming...Cooling for actual grow up workload mehThe cooler does a good job but Nvidia being the halfwit they are put DDR6X on the back of the card.EVGA did their possible trying to vent this shitshow & it works well enough until the backplate can't take anymore heat.Option A you go & spend 600$ on water block for the front & back... Have fun with thatOption B you slam a 120mm AIO on the backplateOption C A fanless EVO 212 sandwich btw aNH-D15 & a 140mm NF-A14Yup the 30$ wonder did it..Otherwise a mediocre product saved by EVGA for quite the premium....
1,I was working on a 3D modeling contract project and my Quadro card decided to stop working... and there was no way to get any Quadro model on time. I had to buy something to quickly replace my card and I purchased this overpriced card without choice from the seller named "Canada Direct - Often Ships Same Day!".When I got the card there were two problems.1. One of the fan power connectors was not fully plugged (noticed after two other fans were operating at higher speed than expected for the workload)2. Two of the DP outputs malfunctioning. My monitor couldn't read signal time to time resulting in blinking. The third DP output was fine and it was not because of my cable or monitor as I used the same cable and monitor to find it out.I contacted the seller for these faults but they were not very helpful. They asked me to contact EVGA for warranty service which nobody can guarantee when it can be done. Getting an replacement was not an option for me either as it takes time to send and receive a new one. I asked for a return so I could buy another one from another seller. However they said they cannot guarantee to refund the return shipping fee or full value return.I did not have time to resolve conflict and now stuck with this overpriced faulty graphics card...
3,A scalper obviously. Overpriced. But I must admit it work exactly as expected. Be careful it's running hot but with the proper airflow and cooling it's alright. Would recommend but not at this price.
3,Got the card for my new build. Unfortunately the three 8-pin power cable is missing. Extremely frustrating to say the least. So make sure you purchase one up front...else be stuck waiting like me.
2,All in all it would be a great card if the hdmi and vgi ports would work card arrived to me defective.
1,Got a faulty gpu from them and had a hell of time to return it as they don’t respond and I had to go through A to Z many times until I could refund my money after two months. The worst of the worst deal I’ve ever had with the worst seller. Unfortunately can’t give them 0 star. Don’t waste your money on them.
1,Do not buy from Amazon as they state returnable but refuse to honor this even with an issue with the item. Description clearly states returnable!
5,Crazy fast overkill for csgo and fortnite but I love it
5,Expensive but absolutely delivers! Shane D. Bouzanne
5,Expensive but it works perfectly for my flight simulator needs (which is high with the new microsoft sim).
4,Vengo de una gtx 1080ti aorus extreme la cual mantenia niveles de ruido muy bajos incluso con los ventiladores arriba del 70% y temperaturas debajo de los 70 grados al utilizarla al 100%. Hice el cambio a esta debido a que utilizo Unreal Engine para hacer realidad virtual  y necesitaba lo mas potente del mercado. Quede con un sabor amargo cuando me di cuenta que es una tarjeta que sus acabados no son los de mejor calidad comparandolos contra una Strix o Aorus las temperaturas son altisimas dando 65 grados en IDLE y hasta 85 grados usandola al 100% de hecho no he podido usarla al 100% ya que mi no break es de 600w y esta tarjeta consume por si sola 500 watts y tuve que limitarla a 70% y hacer undervolt para que las temperaturas no se dispararan hasta los casi 90 grados. Asi que consideren tambien tener un no break de minimo 1350VA es una tarjeta que definitivamente no recomiendo por su costo tiene mejor relacion de costo/rendimiento una 3080 ademas que es molesto escuchar los ventiladores al 70% con solo unos 10 min de juego he visto que otras marcas como Asus TUF Strix o Aorus mantienen la grafica debajo de los 70 grados aun en uso maximo eso me hace dudar si este modelo en especifico tiene muy mal sistema de ventilacion o yo tuve mala suerte y me llegó una tarjeta defectuosa.
