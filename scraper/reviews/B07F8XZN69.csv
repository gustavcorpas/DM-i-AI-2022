5,The monitor works fine.  However what I disliked about it being a previously loved product was that it wasn't packaged well for delivery.  Since most delivery carriers don't really care about treating the products they deliver the product should have been packaged better.  When I got the monitor there was nothing to stop the contents (typical cardboard filler that typically comes in a Dell monitor box was missing)  from moving around during transit.  The items were loosely placed in a Dell monitor box which allowed the contents in the box to move freely around and contributed to scratching up the back of the monitor with the base of the stand. The power cord is not the original power cord and only came with a VGA cable (which is pretty much obsolete).  The USB 3.0 hub cable and display port cable was also missing. It would have been nice to know if these items were not going to be included in the description. Other than that the monitor works fine by testing with cables I have for my other monitor but i have to now go buy the needed cables to use the monitor.
5,This was easy to setup. I did purchase a DP cable.  Working from home with multiple monitors is a must!
3,Stand is different. Monitor DELL logo not in same place. No side USB ports.
4,I'm a computer science student in university currently and have been using this for about a year now. Haven't had any problems display is clear and has good color. Makes reading code so much easier. I know it did not come with speakers which I kind of miss. I don't know how to get audio through external speakers if I hook the Nintendo switch up to it but usually if I'm using my laptop audio isn't a problem.
3,Not too bad for a budget monitor. The colors are clear and accurate the menu is very easy to use assembly (if you can even call it that) is a breeze and the way they built the stand to move without too many complicated parts is genius.I will say though I was terrible disappointed to find minor damage to the monitor out of the box. The stand has scuffs and scrapes on it that do not appear to have happened during shipping it looks like they were shipped in an already scuffed state. I wouldn't mind too much if just the stand was scuffed but the monitor has damage as well. The monitor has a nick in it that is large enough to be annoying. There's also a round spot on the screen about the size of a nickel that's much darker than the rest of the screen has several pixel-sized nicks in it and leaves a faint dark shadow left of the dark spot (about 2.5 inches of screen.) While the screen damage may have happened during shipping I feel like more care could have been taken with the packing to prevent this.I may consider attempting to get a replacement if possible. Not a fan of the fact that I spent the money to buy a nice new monitor only for it to arrive with damage.
5,The good: it has a nice design including a thin bezel which is great for a duel-monitor setup.  The mechanical design of the stand is very good.  It goes together in seconds with no tools is sturdy and is highly adjustable including tilt in both directions.  The monitor seems to be pretty intelligent about selecting the correct input signal and it will automatically switch when I plug something new in.  Comes with DP and USB3 cable.  The integrated USB hub is great and adds some real value; it's handy for your mouse/keyboard memory sticks etc.The bad: I'm kind of picky about monitors so take this for what is it.  The viewing angle is good but not amazing.  Way better than the old TN panels but not as good as my wife's VA panel.  There is also strange inverted color ghosting that shows up in very specific situations; sometimes (maybe 1% of the time) when I scroll through a webpage I will see magenta or cyan ghosting on the edges of light gray areas.  I was able to mostly eliminate it with some minor tweaks to brightness and contrast but I feel like I shouldn't have to do that.In summary: The picture doesn't look as good as a $300 VA-panel gaming monitor but its a good choice for the office.
5,I order 4 of these to replace my aging HPL2045ws  One of them was starting to have issues over heating. I think they are almost 10 years old but were high end when I bought them. So 24" to replace 20" similar resolution. These new monitors are slightly better resolution. I almost don't notice it though.  What I do notice is the size difference. So that was a good change. I don't want anything bigger. I already have to turn my head too much to see things.The Quality of these dell are as expected from a well known company. The price was mid range for this size and resolution. Well worth the extra $20-$40 each to know that I was not going to get 2 bad monitors of the 4 I purchased.  For me these are equivalent to a matched set. I need all 4 to be in good condition for a long time to come. Replacing one with a different type/brand would for sure cause me to have to replace all.I am very happy with the purchase.  All 4 arrived same day (2 day prime delivery) and I was able to mount them on my 4 monitor Versa mount stand quick and easy. They are light weight and always cool to the touch. Another upgrade to the old HP LCDs I had. Office stays cooler now.  No issues with Nvidia cards and Windows 10 or 2018 Server.I would recommend these to anyone looking for good monitors for Cad Software development or general office use. Video seems really good on them too but that is not something I really know a lot about.
5,I don't know how relevant this review will be to others but...I am in Software/Operations.  I do a lot of e-mails and powerpoints but also do some coding.  I have a dual-monitor setup for my home office with I guess a VESA mount.  (little square) mounting point.One of my old monitors died and I decided to replace both.A few years ago i had run DVI cables and power cables from the monitors to my docking station about 10 feet away.  I wasn't really looking forward to rerunning everything for new cables etc...I had purchased two DVI to HDMI converters.Just for me the swap out of the monitors was like scary easy.  I always expect some bumps...but this went WAY easier than I had thought.The VESA mounting area was perfect on the monitor and it came with its own screws for them.  The power adapter took the same 3 prong adapter that my old monitors took (so no rerunning power).  The HDMI inputs are downward facing so the cords don't stick out from the back but point downwards so the cables look good.Anyway good monitors with a nice picture and very easy setup.
4,In general Dell monitors are reliable long-lasting and pleasing to work with. I have used a number of Dell monitors before and my experience has always been fantastic.This monitor however is surprisingly not up to Dell's standards. In terms of design is like other Dell monitors very elegant. In terms of quality of display however it is a bit off. I can see the pixels by eye if I look close! Being a H-series monitor (H=FHD Full High Definition) one would expect more of this piece of electronic equipment. It is true that now we are used to watch 4K everywhere even in the screen of a smartphone so this makes the experience with any non-4K FHD a bit less exciting and sharpens up defects in the screen. I don't feel fully confortable working with this monitor for long hours. For someone that does not plan to use a monitor full-time for work and does not use it for graphics-heavy duties like design gaming etc this might be okay for the price actually quite a good buy.Update: After some days of use I am happier with the monitor. Although I still think the quality of display could be a bit better.
3,My monitor was missing the HDMI cable the screen is okI was expecting more pixel density but probably I'd need to buy a WQHD the colors are okthe design is nice although I can't mount in my wall stand if you buy this in offer is ok...
5,I use two display monitors when I work.  My main monitor is in landscape mode and then next to it I put another monitor in portrait mode.  This is great as I can see an entire day's schedule on my calendar or an entire page of text including the footnotes at the bottom without having to scroll down.  Also it is so easy to cut text from one article and then drag it to the other screen and paste it into another document.  As a result the swivel feature of this monitor was a primary criterion.  My only very minor criticism would be the one page of drawings that amount the instructions as to how to put the thing together (the base the upright piece etc.).  One step was particularly cryptic.  However if you already have a Dell monitor you can look at it and guess how this is done.  It was very easy things did fit into place the screwhead turned easily and the base upright did snap easily into the the back of the screen itself.  Then one simply connects the screen to the computer (I used the Display Port dp connector).  The resolution is fine.
5,I was looking to upgrade my home office since I'm working remote more these days so I started researching a lot of different monitors. I originally went with two 25" Acer gaming monitors because I got them for a pretty good deal through BestBuy. Since they were TN panels the viewing angles for programming were terrible for my application.I then started researching again and came across these monitors. I returned my other two and bought two of these. These monitors are terrific for my programming. The viewing angles and color are superb on the IPS panels. I can't recommend these monitors enough for programming. They're connected through the provided DP cables to a Dell docking station. The text that is displayed is very crisp. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.On a side note I'm not sure the response time on these monitors would be suitable for gaming. However I'm not sure that IPS monitors are the best choice for gaming yet. Most IPS panels will have a higher response time than TN panels. For any other use these monitors are a great choice.I didn't use the provided stands that came with these monitors so I can't comment on the stands. I bought a dual monitor VESA mount stand off Amazon to mount these.Update 2019-09-13:Coming up on almost a year of having these monitors. I still thoroughly enjoy them. I still stand by the initial part of my review regarding these monitors. It's funny that I bought these for my home office because my employer actually start upgrading everyone to these monitors too. They seem to be well praised around the office for our use.
4,Was very upset did not include HDMI cable to connect to my Dell laptop!  The monitor is really nice though.
5,I bought this for work only to hook up to my laptop to see better and I don't reget it.  It's not a gaming monitor but it my Justice League wallpaper looks really good
3,I was disappointed when I received this monitor. It was dusty inside the box which makes me think it was either used or old. There was a small scratch on the screen about an inch long. I am using the monitor strictly for tool pallets in Final Cut Photoshop etc. so I can live with it. First monitor I ever bought that didn't come with a piece of paper or plastic or something covering the screen to avoid scratches during shipment. I assume all Dells come this way so I won't buy one again. It's too big a hassle for me to return it.The cables all attach to the monitor from the bottom. I know some people like that because it is clean but for me it is hard to get them plugged in. I had already read that the best cable to make this work with my newer iMac was a Thunderbolt to HDMI so I bought one and it did indeed instantly connect and the computer instantly recognized the monitor so that was pretty cool. No hassle setup for sure. The screen isn't very bright. For $200 I expected more. So to recap I think it is a good monitor but maybe worth $125. Just my two cents.
5,I tried several other monitors of various brands and sizes which I did not like. I ordered two of these for a dual monitor set up for my home office. We use the same monitors at my corporate office but in the 21.5” size. The price point seems to be reasonable. They came with the required DP cables and work great. The monitors have a lot of great features i.e. they are totally adjustable (swivel height tilt 90 degrees turn) and have plenty of USB connections etc.  They don't come with speakers though. One of the drawbacks is having a cable salad in the back of it once you set them up which is a mess that needs to be organized with some cable management straps. The picture quality is great for what I do (professional work I.e. e-mails internet MS Office applications etc.). I would highly recommend this monitor.
4,This is a good monitor. I bought it for use while I work at home. My laptop and the monitor I use at work have very good resolution. I knew this would have less resolution and didn't think I would really notice. For my purposes of writing code it is fine but I do notice it is much more pixelated than I was expecting. Still a good value if you don't want to spend the extra money on a higher resolution monitor. But the difference will be noticeable.
4,I've used what I think is this exact monitor at work for awhile so I got one for my home office.Its image seems good has a very small bevel around the left top and right edges and is a comfortable (but not HD) resolution which is suitable for most work and easy for my laptop (MacBook Pro 2013) to drive without affecting performance.I'm lucky I already had another Dell monitor (p2715Q) with the cable I needed as this one didn't come with either a Mini DisplayPort or HDMI cable to easily connect to my laptop. It does come with a DP to DP cable which I hoped would allow daisy-chaining with my previous monitor but I haven't yet been able to make that work. It also includes a USB cable which I bet enables the dual USB output slots on this monitor.
5,When buying a monitor for working at home - I first bought based on price thinking that it wouldn't make much difference and I was so wrong -- the other monitor didn't even HAVE all the colors -- washed out and distorted.  I decided to look for a Dell monitor like the one my IT department put on my desk at work for use with my Macbook Pro - and I am super happy with the results.  I haven't done any color calibration or changes - just plugged it into my new C-dock and away I went.  Happy as with the quality out of the box.  Thanks for prompt delivery!
4,I searched and reviewed monitors for months before deciding on two for my home office. I am so happy that I picked this Dell to go with. I wanted a monitor with display ports nice quality screen mountable and didn't take up a ton of desk space. I was hesitant to get the 24 inches but I have so much room left over on my desk (60 in by 24 in). I don't think I will need monitor arms now. You can also raise and tilt the screen which is helpful. These monitors are perfect for working with excel spreadsheets. I also watch videos on it and the quality seems good. If you want a crystal clear picture I'd recommend spending the money on a 4k monitor.
4,This monitor is a good choice. The picture is nice and clear not amazing but at this price you are not going to get amazing. The option I truly like is the way height adjustment is handled. It is designed well and easily allows yo to ride of lower the screen but also the option to rotate which is really nice. The once thing I would have liked to see improved is the brightnest it is not bad but could use a little more.
5,I've  had the monitor for a month or 6 weeks. Now that I can upgrade to a digitial connection from computer to monitor the picture fidelity is unbelievable. Size is great  more than enough room to display two full size pages of text side by side. This unit was a  "open box" monitor refurbed by DELL. It arrived is absolutely pristen condition not even the slightest cosmetic defectI have purchased several "refurbed" items from Amazon including the HP/Compaq 8300 Elite Small Form Computer I'm using right now and two Sangen desk top stereo units. So far I haven't been dissappointed. But just in case I bought a Square Trade policy.
5,Monitor has so far preformed as expected even if a tad below my ageing Ultra Sharp series.Very good images and crisp letters. CTL Cbx1 chrombox occasionally reports incompatibility but that's more of Chrome Os issues. Not a gamer and so can't comment on gaming performance. Good value overall.
4,Great for the price. Needed a good monitor for sons laptop. Easy to plug in camera fits right on top with no problems.
4,Overall great product! Love the thin bezel look. The display quality is great.The only drawbacks I had with this was that it didn’t come the VGA cable so I had to go purchase one and the HDMI cable provided was specific to Dell products (which my work laptop isn’t) so that didn’t fit.Otherwise installation was breeze. Switching to vertical is easy though I wish the screen display automatically changed orientation when doing so.Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it for purchase.
5,Bought this as a second monitor in my two-monitor set-up.  The size matches my first monitor so I'm able to position them together with almost seamless transition (they both have a very narrow edge).  This one can swivel to a vertical position which I guess is handy for some people.  It also has adjustable height which was helpful in positioning it right next to my other monitor.
5,I needed a monitor to have two screens for the home office. After several weeks of use this one is doing the job really well! It's super easy to set up the picture is crisp and the size is perfect. It does only have one HDMI input so if you're looking to do more than run your PC on it you may want to consider something else. For the price and purpose this one is worth looking at!
5,My old Dell monitor finally began fading into the sunset after many years of great service. I decided to stick with a Dell product based of past experience. Glad I did. I basically use the monitor for viewing TV/Movies and the picture is great for what I use it for. The ease of setup is as basic as humanly possible. Don't get me wrong. The monitor has many other functions but for what I want it to do you can't beat the price AND the quality. Another winner product Dell. Thanks!
4,This is a monitor for the average computer user and non-professional gamer. Yes there are better monitors out there for multi-$K ... this is an amazingly good monitor. The price makes it a no-brainer to purchase. Standard mounting bracket on back if you want to put it on an arm (such as the Amazon Monitor Arm another item that is great for the $$).
5,I am impressed with the quality of the video and versatility of this screen I have some reservations at the beginning but now that I've been working on it for a couple of days I am pretty satisfied image quality is good you can also work in different angles just have sort of hard time when I tried to connect it to my USB c Hub using DP Cable but it did work well when I switched to HDMI. I will be providing updates later if required but everything is working well so far. I know there are cheaper monitors out there but DELL is superior quality and it had never disappointed me.
5,We order these exclusively for our work. The height swivel and tilt adjustments are key. Other monitors simply don't measure up for the price. This has all the ports you'll need too. Docking stations have either HDMI or DisplayPort and this monitor has both those connections. The color is great and comfortable. Workers enjoy the built in Comfort View option too. This has thin bezels which make it look great when you have 2 monitors together. I have had hundreds of Dell monitors other the years at different work places and only seen 1 or 2 have issues. Very reliable.
5,Dell does monitors....This one is super crisp the most colorful I have seen and I have dozens of computers with big screens a few with dual screens.  The picture quality is super vivid and having the minimal edge surround makes it feel more immersive like a phone or high end LED TV.  Zero edge is not unique to Dell of course but for the price and color quality I strongly suggest this one..Can’t speak to gaming or using it for things needing a high refresh rate.  Movies and all other computer activities including graphic design in Adobe Illustrator/PS are stellar.
4,I ordered two of these monitors and they are nice but I’m struggling to find a setting that allows me to read clearly without wearing my reading glasses (+1.5 magnification for reference). Seems like the text is not as crisp or clear as I’d like but perhaps this is user error?
5,I needed more screen space than my laptop offered to effectively use some graphic programs.  This screen was just the answer.  I connect it to my laptop and via a simple HDMI cable.  The screen adjust easily up and down pivots left and right tilts up and down and easily rotates to provide a long skinny aspect ratio when I need to read long documents.
5,I bought two of these panels in November 2019.  I've been using these for about 7 months now.  Zero problems. They've have worked just as expected since day 1.  At the time I paid about $150 each and I thought that was a great deal.  Now that I've been working from home for the past 4+ months and these are on all the time I am so happy i got new screens before the quarantine.
4,It would have gotten 5 stars but there was a very small defect in the very top left corner.  About an 1/8 inch of dead pixels.  I did not even notice it for the first few hours.  Not bad enough to send back. It is so small it makes the cornerhave a small curve instead of a right angle.
5,I replaced a slightly smaller 9-year-old Dell monitor with this one and wish I had sooner.  The clarity is much better and the extra size helps. As there was nothing wrong with the old monitor I donated it to charity.  I hope this one lasts as long as the old one!  It is great for the price.
5,Crisp and sharp. The perfect "work from home" monitor. The design is simple and the menu options are logical.You can tilt it and slide the height up and down. More range in tilting and height adjustment would be nice but it fulfills it's purpose. I use it with my adjustable height desk and it's made my working from home so much better. The great price is just an added bonus.
4,Picture quality over HDMI is average DisplayPort somewhat better. I was looking for a monitor with a 3-axis adjustment. This one fit the bill. The picture quality isn't as good as I had hoped but for $150 I'm pretty happy as I'm comparing it next to monitors that are at least 2-3x as much. I would probably purchase it again as long as I intended to use it with a DisplayPort connection. Over HDMI it runs in 1080i.
3,The product is wonderful. So if you're looking into buying it I would recommend doing so just from a different seller. I just bought my second one; however when I bought my second one new. The package arrived in not new condition. It was not the original packaging and was missing some pieces. Specifically the usb 3.0 cable for the hub in the monitor and the DisplayPort cable it comes with. Not only that but the monitor had some scuff Mark's on the back. So what I got was clearly not new by any means. I know so because I've bought this new before and know what should be included and what the packaging looks like.
5,I got this to replace my last Dell monitor. Apparently they wear out after 10+ years of daily use. Oh well.Seriously this is a great product and was easy to connect to my computer.
5,I bought 2 of this model monitor for the wife's home office because it's the same model line as the pair I've been happily using for the past 6 years. There are better and there are worse but these fit happily in the middle giving you the most bang for your buck with a crisp 1080p picture.To make things even better I saved $100 on the pair compared to buying directly from the manufacturer.
5,The one killer feature of this monitor was the ability to assign shortcut actions to the buttons along the bottom of the monitor. Unlike my old monitor which required no less than 6 button presses to toggle between VGA and DP inputs I was able to assign each input to a button and now can toggle with one button press.
4,Easy to assemble and setup. Works perfectly with my MacBook pro. Perfect for user who like tilting and height adjustment. Sometime I like to stand between calls so tilting comes handy as I can tilt screen upwards. Adjusting height is easy and smooth. Overall quality is good for coding and other writing related work. I have not used it for videos or gaming so far so can't comment in that.
5,I'm using it for CAD drawings and because the resolution on my old monitor was just not enough. This one is up to 1920x1080. Which is great for me. It doesn't come with a camera though. If I had to buy a new monitor I'd again buy a Dell. And I use a Dell computer.
5,This product is a 24" Dell Monitor.  The quality is excellent and the size is perfect.  Monitor arrived in perfect condition and in the original packaging from Dell.  I love Dell Monitors because of the features like tilt up and down adjustment as well as the swivel feature.  Works well if you are trying to improve you posture.
3,The problem with this monitor is the one feature that recommends it is actually a flaw: there is a coating on the screen that supposedly protects it but it is super easy to scratch. It's like a pair of glasses: once you scratch the screen the scratch is there forever.Otherwise this monitor has a lot of cool features. The stand is especially nice. It rotates and raises and pivots. The picture is also good as is the brightness. If only the screen didn't have that coating on it this would be a good monitor. But I would not buy it again.
5,Great monitor and I’m very happy with it. Thank you to the seller - packaging was excellent.
5,The monitor has great screen quality. I really like the ability to tilt & rotate along 3 axis which makes it very convenient for various uses. The resolution is good for its size. I was initially apprehensive about getting a 24" FHD monitor but I don't think it matters (I'd probably recommend buying QHD for 27" or higher). I don't use it for gaming so I cannot say much about that. Probably the only negative would be that it doesn't ship with an HDMI cable (I think it ships with DisplayPort which is pretty much useless to me).
5,Have had since the lockdowns started.  Plug and play what you expect in modern gear.No issues nice picture.  I used for programming database admin server admin other work functions.Not really used for games.  :)
5,Great quality and worth paying more for this. Very clear screen easy to adjust (up and down plus tilt). I bought this because I used my friends and loved it.
5,Excellent monitor at a very good price. Very good quality from every aspect. The image is crystal clear and the resolution is better than expected. You can tilt it in many ways. Can be used landscape or portrait. It’s awesome. I bought two first and then bought a 3rd one.
4,The viewing angles are kinda trash for a IPS.. not.much IPS glow but in gaming mode it's lessnjnput delay but not over 60hz for the money I think it should have been at least 75hz.. the stand is the best part I like the stand
3,Dell P2419H 24 Inch LED-backlit Anti-Glare 3H Hard Coating IPS Monitor - (8 ms Response FHD 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz 1000:1 Contrast with ComfortView....first one then the other.  I bought 2 of these and both monitors do the same thing.  I've checked connections and based on internet search to troubleshoot see it is a know problem .  If not for that I would love them.  Kind of annoying when i'm working or presenting in a webinar.  Procrastinated now i can't return them so trying to troubleshoot myself which i'm bad at.  :(
5,Ordered 7 of these for an office.  All of them arrived without any problems.  The picture is good and the price is right.  Its a pretty thin lightweight screen.  I mounted all of them on a Vesa mount duel arm setup and they fit perfectly.  For home or office use these are great do not know if they would make good gaming monitors.  They do not have speakers.
5,I bought these so that I could have 2 vertical displays on my desk.  I put one on each side of the laptop.  I went with these because they came with the ability to turn vertically or horizontally out of the box without the need of a 3rd party mount.  These add so much more screen real estate when writing code they make every day work much easier.
5,I urgently needed a new monitor for the remote office however I made an error when placing the order. Reached out to the sales rep who was understanding responsive and able to accommodate me. Very happy with the customer experience. Monitor was delivered early and everything is great.
4,Works well and great price. It did not come with sn HDMI cable.
5,Excellent product horrible delivery service.  Clear as day sign on the door.  Business closed until Monday please hold packages until then.  FedEx UPS and USPS all followed directions.  The Amazon Delivery driver left the packages on the business door step because he was lazy and did not want to being them back down to his truck.  Sorry excuse for a delivery service.
5,I use it as a second display for my laptop and you can REALLY tell the diference the color accuracy is great for photoshop and other programs I also use it for gaming and it runs smoothly.
5,Great for spreadsheets reading articles emails. The side of the monitor does have two USB ports!!! I see some buyers have mentioned how difficult it is to reach the ports as they are in the back of the monitor - yes there are ports in the back - but I was pleasantly surprised to find there are also 2 ports on the left side of the monitor. Great for my uses.
5,I ordered 2 of theses 24" Dell computer monitors. Arrived on time and in really sturdy box. The feature I like the most is the adjustable stand. I highly recommend this product. Good job Dell!!
5,Love that the screen can spin like a plate to insert cords more easily into the bottom of the screen housing. The rotating base is also smartly designed.Hate that the cord insertion sites are black on black. Difficult to read labels even with a bright flashlight. Just a LITTLE contrast would be nice!
5,I use it for regular work stuff: email word excel PowerPoint. I had initially purchased a Sceptre but had to return it because letters had jagged edges. The Dell (a little bit more expensive than the Sceptre) is perfect and easy on my eyes.
5,I am a light gamer who uses these monitors mostly for homework and work purposes. Th picture quality is great with cdmi cables. Colors are vibrant and true. If there is any visible pixelation I am not seeing it.
5,I ordered the monitor to my home office. After solving the cable problems with help of Walmart my work days have felt like a dream... Well do they ever feel like a dream... easier to handle would be better to say and that is only because of the monitor. It is amazing that I can keep two excel files open side by side and they are normal sized. Love it.
2,This monitor worked great for the first 8-10 months I had it.  Then all of a sudden it started blinking on and off for no reason.  Just to be sure I tried different computers hdmi cords docks and the same thing would happen.  Then when I tried a different monitor that used all of the same cords etc. it worked.  So maybe I got a defective one but I thought it would be worth warning potential buyers about.
4,This monitor works pretty damn good for the price. It could be sharper image quality but for the price is really good.
5,I bought three of these Dell P2419H monitors and am very happy with them. I use them for work and gaming and they perform great for all occasions.  Well worth the hundred sixty bucks each.  Would definitely buy again.
5,I am very glad I made this purchase. This product makes my workflow much more convenient as the screen size is very large (24") and conducive to productivity. Right now I am only using a single screen with input from my laptop but I may invest in another identical monitor later.
5,My son had gifted me one of these monitors.  Then I started working at home and needed another one.  Loved the fast delivery.  Perfectly packaged and works great.  Great price too!
5,When my oldest monitor died I got another Dell - same model. The display is so much clearer. It’s helping my eye strain now that both monitors are such good quality.
3,This included a USB and DP cable. I couldnt use DP as I dont have that on my laptop. The USB cable is pointless as it is not a display option on the monitor. So basically you must have an HDMI or VGA cable to make it work. No idea why they didn't include those cables with the monitor. I had to buy separately.
5,I purchased 2 of these for working from home purposes in a dual screen setup. As expected Dell displays come through again with excellent image quality build quality and adjust-ability. Excellent product. Love my Dell monitors.
2,I already know I really like this monitor.  However I have purchased 2 in a row - both came with ruined (cracked broken) screens.I'm returning both and would love to purchase a 3rd one but now don't want to take the risk.  That and as I need the extra monitor to do my job I'm tired of laying out the money until the items are returned and processed.  Because of that I now have to wait for 2 to go through that "processing" before I order another one.Dell if you read these at all please ship me another one while I return these as I am struggling to get my work done w/o it.  If not I definitely will not be purchasing again.All if you do purchase and receive undamaged it really is a great monitor
3,I would have given this monitor a 5-star rating but it did not come with a VGA cord which I needed to have for my laptop. I had to purchase one separately for 7 bucks.
5,Well constructed adjustable stand including height almost borderless. Clear images and text. Onboard USB connectors. Comes with power USB and HDMI cables. Very well boxed with great assembly instructions. Very good value.
5,Easy to set up and very strong and sturostand. Definitely quality  not cheap plastic mount.
4,I wish I got the larger screen.  But at the higher price point a TV screen would have been cheaper.
5,Monitor is great - low glare and virtually no edge.  I really like the stand as well - moves up and down easily which I use a lot because I alternate between sitting and standing.
5,Bought 2 for remote schooling (2 students). Good picture quality. Makes a big difference in productivity when combined with the laptop screen (1 screen for the online meeting 1 for working).
5,My home office is bright wit natural light & there's no glare. I don't use it for games or graphics so the picture quality is perfect for me.
3,Screeb was great and working for about three months then it started glitching and going black for random periods of time. I thought it was my graphics card but I connected another monitor and it worked just fine so I'm pretty sure the monitor was the issue though I don't know how it did that
3,The HDMI port is so close to the raised edge making many regular HDMI cables incompatible. I had searched on Amazon very carefully made two returns and finally found one that worked. All the ports are so packed I doubt if I can have the HDMI and DP connected at the same time.
5,Good Product
5,Great monitor with DP and USB 3.0. When showing all black screen you see a little backlight leakage around the edges but that is expected in this price category. The overall make is excellent.
3,I bought this monitor used. The base is unstable so that is annoying. As long as you don't move it it is fine but if you ever want to adjust the screen or swivel it the screen it rocks. The screen is a bit dirty. Overall it works fine and picture quality is good but you can tell it is used and the unstable part is annoying.
5,Extremely  good quality for the price. No complaints out of me
5,Good relation Price and quality
5,This is an awesome monitor. I bought 2 and just got a dual HDMI dongel to go to my laptop. SUPER EASY set! They are amazing!
5,i brought this screen about a month agoi use it for designing graphicsits an fantastic great screen for a good price ($160)good real color viewperfect sizemodern lookup and down sliding and rotate optionsand more..i am very happy with it and planning to buy a second one in the next few..Enjoy!!
2,Bought as a second monitor to replace a 15 year old Apple Cinema Display.Not impressed. I have to turn it off and on several times for it to recognize a signal. I’m using it rotated and it seems to not like that either. Sometimes when it does work it forgets settings and has totally reset my monitor positions and preferences.Cheap I guess but I expected MUCH better from Dell.Also purchased an LG at the same time it is far superior. Very disappointing.
5,Very nice monitor for my purposes. I like it. I love the height adjustment and the rotation of the monitor besides the overall picture quality and look. I have used it in my office but this is for use at home and I am very happy using it.
5,Works perfectly what I need it for. Not sure how it would hold up for gamers etc. I’m mainly on spreadsheets etc all day long so it works for my needs. Thin bezel is nice sleek design element. Very bright screen with anti glare finish makes it comfortable to look At for long periods of time. The best part about this monitor is the flexibility in the screen orientation and height adjustment which I’m always changing.
2,After long research this monitor was highly recommended from few different sites as a great budget monitor for Picture editing. For all who are looking for the same thing stay away and go with the Viewsonic. Horrible Shadow and Highlight Details. After editing I moved the picture to my old Viewsonic and I was able to see all bright spots on the black background I wasn't able to see on the Dell Monitor. As a Photographer I need the monitor that will show the picture the way it is not the artificial look that makes picture look better. After about 10 different monitors it came down to a Viewsonic believe it or not it is a MVA not IPS Monitor. It has better detail contrast color and by far better view angle than any Highly Recommended IPS Monitor. I hope this helps.
5,Product was ordered on Sunday and received on Wednesday. Excellent tracking. Excellent performance/ no issues. This product comes with two cords inclusive of Displayport to Displayport.
2,I'm unable to return this now because I bought it in September but I was satisfied until recently when having my camera and this monitor run through my MacBook - the fans come on after about an hour of being connected and the temp rises quickly. This is a brand new MacBook with 16 Gigs and Intel UHG Graphics and nothing is wrong with it - it just doesn't work well with the monitor taking up so much energy. So Mac users beware. Other than that it is a good monitor with lots of movement in the screen for placement easy to set up.
5,These are perfect for what my office needed them for! One came cracked and my return was immediately accepted and a new one arrived in 2 business days thank you so much!
5,Excellent condition and product quality
3,Too small for my needs
5,I upgraded from an older model and like this monitor very much. It has the upgraded connections from older model and the stand has height adjustments that make for better viewing. Picture quality is very sharp.
5,LOVE! I have this same exact set up at work and loved it so much I re-created it at home. Picture quality is great and I don't know how we survived without dual monitors.
5,Very pleased with this model! I purchased two for working remotely and they have proven to be very reliable.  Easy set-up nice range of motion (up down and around) and great view.
5,Just got the monitor. Looks great!  Fast delivery.
5,Needed a monitor to WFH. This monitor is exactly what I was looking for! Screen is clear and sleek. May buy a second one.
5,It delivered to the right address!
5,Have been using this screen since lockdown... This works really well with very little glad and high resolution.
5,Using this product for trading. Didn't want too big a monitor. Great picture. Height adjustment which is awesome as well as swivel. Stand very sturdy unlike other monitors I had checked. All connection options available. Highly recommend.
5,Matches my primary monitor which is what was desired as I am now using dual monitors teaching live online classes at a local college.
5,I purchased two of these monitors and it was one of my best decisions.
5,I was looking to replace my secondary monitor and wanted to get an IPS monitor with decent color accuracy. This checks those boxes and you get Dells fantastic warranty. Whether it's personal use or business I always go with Dell because of their customer service.
5,This is exactly what I needed for my job !!
5,I absolutely love these monitors. I can’t say enough about them. I bought 2! Great product. They’re perfect for when I’m mixing music or multitasking for other purposes.
5,Nice and sharp display. Nice options on inputs with Display port and HDMI. The only downside is that it has no built in speakers OR audio out.
5,I bought two of these monitors at the same time I bought the computer. Wonderful set up.
5,This monitor gave a good relief for WFH. Good for my eyesight.
5,I use it to code.  I have never played games on it.  This monitor is very easy on my eyes and has the perfect resolution for things to be big enough yet clear at the same time.
5,I have been telecommuting due to COVID 19. This monitor has been a life saver. Great value!
5,Fast shipping. Came in a couple days. All necessary cables and a stand. If you're connecting via HDMI you'll have to purchase that cable.
4,HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND SCREEN QUALITY.
4,Fast shipping!
5,I love this monitor! Clear picture and the perfect size. Easy to put together and set up.
5,It has a great picture quality and I really like that the screen can be adjusted up and down as well as side to side
4,Good to use.
5,Love this monitor! It swivels all ways and moves up and down. Perfect for any type of work!
5,I am very happy with quality functionality and overal look. Definitely recommended.
5,I have always been a big fan of dell monitors and I have purchased about 30 of these for office use. Best picture for the dollar.
5,Perfect for work. I like the adjustable screen color settings and you can customize. Can make it Easy on the eyes when working late.Over all very happy will probably buy another few by the end of the year for my staff.
5,Works perfectly what I need it for. The picture quality is great but I'm not a gamer. I am very happy with the purchase and can recommend it.
5,Very good quality and also good price for a 24" monitor.
5,This is a really nice 1920x1080 monitor.  Picture quality is crisp when using HDMI.  The down stream USB 3 ports are nice.
5,The dell was easy to setup and gave an excellent image
5,We are really enjoying this monitorI highly recommend
3,But sometimes it has trouble recognizing the display port signal from my Mac Mini and I have to turn it off and on several times before it recognizes the signal again. Doesn't always happen after waking from sleep just every so often. Other than that color and clarity are nice and the minimalist design is groovy.
5,loved the monitor so much i had to buy another one. I have 2 setup in my home office.
5,As advertised.
5,Great monitor. I use it for programming. Has all the ports that I needed and a great picture. Excellent value for the money.
5,I would buy again.  Good color saturation and definition.
4,Good
5,I bought two for my home office and mounted on a dual monitor stand.  Works great easy setup clear picture and small bevel makes for a great screen flow when working with multiple monitors.
5,Super sleek and amazing quality picture.
5,Awesome monitor ... bright sharp ... as advertised.
5,Dell has great quality
5,I am pleased with these monitors. Simple and clean design nice screen quality and I like having the two USB ports on the side. Product shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. Overall very satisfied with the product price and speed of shipment.
5,Bright and crisp screen. Very small edge border if you need to have multiple monitors.
5,Just what I asked for. Loads of connectivity. The only drawback is that it doesn't have any I/O that allows me to plug in my headphones into.
5,Perfect for home office.
5,I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase a beautiful computer monitor. I purchased two of them and now am able to have multiple programs all open at the same time with great vision. It has really increased my production significantly.
2,The product summary mentioned USB connection to PC however upon receiving the package it appears that there is no way my laptop (Windows 10) can directly detect this monitor even with driver installed. I had to look up online and searched for reason behind it and it seems that you need HDMI cable connection before you can use that USB upstream port cable. What is the point to include it if you don't include the HDMI cable? It felt misleading.
5,personal computer
5,DPI cord was included in my box. Looks great!
2,I ordered two Dell Monitors along with a docking station keyboard etc to set up my home office for COVID.  Monitors are beautiful expect one of them is faulty.  As the day goes on the top two inches of the screen black out and I am unable to work in any documents.  I did ask to return it and my return was requested but because of COVID-19 I have no way to pack and ship this up so I am going to have to live with it.
5,Excelente producto
5,Great picture great resolution great colors. Plenty of USB ports. I use this monitor with 2 computers one connected via DP and one via HDMI. The picture from both computers is excellent!
4,Work well in a 3 screen set up.
5,great
5,the quality is so good
5,This screen has made working from home a breeze.
5,Like it.  Works well.  Would buy again
5,Perfect for office work games etc. No glare
5,Bought on sale. Very good monitor at this price vivid colo r and lots of ports
5,Not the beat price but very good product for office work. Have two monitors side by side and love them.
5,Bought 2 for a home office set up to plug in my laptop with a thunderbolt3 to dual display port adapter. Works wonderfully.
5,- Colors are fairly accurate.- Can turn vertical- USB pass through- Looks good!
3,I bought 2 and they are poor at displaying text. You can see the refresh rate in the screen. Have to turn the brightness up to max just to get semi clear text. The Monitor stand is great though. Hight adjustment tilt forward back left and right. IPS screens aren't for us i guess.
5,Product is as expected
5,My favorite screens.  I bought two for my home office and they have been great.
5,Pantalla rota ☹️
5,Works great and quick delivery.
5,Todo muy bien ya casi un mes de uso y ha funcionado perfectamente.
5,Replacement monitor for my wife's monitor. Great quality and picture. Wife happy me ecstatic.
5,The coolest thing about this monitor is that its has no monitor bezel. The picture quality is great.I recommend this monitor for anyone looking for a sleek yet robust monitor.
5,These are good monitors. I like the vertical adjustment feature!
5,2nd monitor for work. Had to buy the one that IT would support.
5,Great product
5,Great product. I use it for work every day.
5,Easy to set-up and connect. These work as expected.
5,Used as a second screen for HP laptop. Cheapest price here. Works great with USB as second screen.
5,The design
5,Not as narrow boundary as U series. But it's cheaper so it still a good product
4,Love this monitor.
5,Great monitor and easy to install
5,I like the very small border around the monitor.The price was great.
5,This Monitor has exceed my hopes! beautiful  design low weight and comes with cables (Display Port USB )
5,A+ Seller & Product!
1,Product came with a ton of cosmetic damage. It looks like this was used and basically an "open box" item but being sold as new
5,awesome
5,Cheap upgrade to a office monitor. Use with laptop.
5,The actual quality of the screen is great and the adjustability.
5,Excellent resolution.  Easy on the eyes.
5,Wonderful product
5,As advertised
3,Seriously? It's 2020 and you don't provide a HDMI cable?????lmfao...
1,Our company had purchased from this site before. The first monitor was great.  I ordered two more a couple of months later. I understood these were refurbished. However  I have never purchased anything refurnished that was in bad of shape as these. How can monitor stands get scratched that bad? And one of the stands was defective. It would not clip on to the monitor.
5,Like its low glare end-end screen size
5,Doesn't take up too much room on my desk as I have two monitors. Great product great price.
5,good product
1,So I was super excited to get this monitor. I now have two of them but they were purchased at different times. I thought they were awesome but once I had both monitors next to each other their quality/display brightness was off by a lot even when they were both set to the same brightness and color settings. It was very weird and awful for my eyes. Other than that issue I like the size and adjustability of the monitors. I just wish they had better quality control. I am wondering if I received a defective product?? The problem is I don’t know which one is defective and I don’t want to have to pay extra money if I ship the wrong one back.
5,No complaints. Works as described. Like the slim bezels on this Monitor.
5,Great clarity and perfect size!
5,Just works.  Not issues.  Have been using Dell monitors for years.
5,Clear as the seas!
5,Works perfectly!!!
2,I was able to get this monitor for a cheaper price since I subscribed to the Amazon credit card.  The problem is all the settings for my original monitor and this monitor of the same make and model are the same yet my monitor is more clear than this one that was sent.  I am not a happy camper.
5,Excellent product. No complaints.
1,The display screen came damaged.The physical buttons were finicky.The base is missing half of it's rubber feet.
5,No complaints.  Clear crisp display.
5,Good
5,recommended rotates however you it to
1,I ordered what I thought was the Dell Ultrasharp 24" monitor when I received the monitors they were these P series. They are inferior in every way to the Ultrasharps. I work in Government and buy for the IT. I've been using Ultrasharps for years and they have better picture quality than the P series. Also for those of you who attach sound bars to your monitors PLEASE NOTE: THESE MONITORS WILL NOT HAVE SLOTS FOR SOUND BARS. This is very important to my staff because we have smaller offices and desks and space is a premium. Conclusion: Inferior to Ultrasharps can't take speaker bars. NOT RECOMMENDED.
2,This monitor probably would of been great but the second I opened the package the top right corner was bent and cracked. I expect a full refund. I even plugged it in to see if there was any hope but the entire screen was ruined.
5,Great picture quality for working - email spreadsheets etc. No speakers.
5,No issues so far and works great
5,I love these monitors! They work great with my laptop.
5,Just what I needed
2,The monitor was good while it lasted for about the 36 days it did 6 days over the return policy while playing the screen turned black you can’t get a better monitor for the price too
1,I ordered two of the same monitor to use side-by-side.  One of these monitors is OFF.  I reset all the settings on both used different cables tired to match up the colors but not only are the colors off but windows are not matching up when they are on both screens and on top of that text is showing up blurry.  Very disappointed all i wanted was to exchange the monitor for one that wasn't messed up.
1,I was using this monitor about three weeks when  suddenly on the screen appeared dark spot on the top side over the inch in diameter and hundreds of line covered all screen.After talking with Dell and sending my photos of the screen I was told returned it right away.  It was defected.  The good thing is Amazon confirmed seller authorization very next day and monitor on the way back.  My replacement monitor will be ordered directly from manufacture.
5,Good Product
5,Good deal
5,Love this monitor. Great picture!
1,I purchased this monitor to work from home however after TWO dongle replacements I’ve found out the hard way it doesn’t read the HDMI signal. Over $150 wasted on a product that is sitting here collecting dust. To say I’m angry would be an understatement! I’m livid.
5,Exactly as described
1,I thought this was a good monitor for a great price -- until gray turned to pink. I can't seem to calibrate it / get the colors settings back to normal. I suggest spending a little more money and getting something that lasts longer than a year.
5,This is an excellent Monitor.
5,Fantastic monitors exceptionally well made
5,Best price/quality ratio
1,Too bad but as you can see from the pics there are lines both vertical and some strange curved line.  behind them is a blackout area where nothing is visible.  you can see part of it is the black spot on the screen.  This was out of the box.
1,After about six months of regular use the HDMI port stopped recognizing the HDMI cable.
1,I have ordered 2 monitors. One is working as expected. The other one stopped working. No display. Amazon wont replace
1,No HDMI cable in the box and my laptop doesn’t support DP. HDMI should be included with that price
1,I can't give a review because it's a Christmas gift for my grandson.
1,Monitor was great while it worked.. which for me was about 5 weeks. Then one day it just wouldn't turn on. Dead.
1,The computer came very screwed up a big crack in the screen and the monitor It looks in a good condition but it’s actually very bad
1,the screen arrived cracked and there was no HDMI cable included with the shipment.
1,This is a replacement screen from my first purchase. First screen was flicking and pulsing.
1,This product is poor pixel are blurry
1,It's a really bad experience. I am angry.
1,Received damaged piece.
1,Had to to return TWICE. Garbage.
5,I love this Dell monitor. The screen and great and the adjustable stand it a real plus.
4,Installed in about 3 min (between Zoom meetings) with MacBook Pro 15in laptop. I can finally use multiple windows and applications while working (teaching) from home with much more screen real estate to work with... and the rotational aspect will be very helpful for certain applications as well.
5,COVID has me spending more hours in front of computer screens so I decided to see if upgrading from  a side-by-side pair of Dell S2440L  monitors would be easier on my eyes.Answer is a BIG YES. Here's why...PROS1. MUCH thinner bezels on sides and top (3/16" vs 12/16") and thinner bezel on bottom too (10/16" vs. 12/16").2. VESA Mounting 100x100 holes vs. the S2440L which required buying special brackets.3. ZERO glare matte finish screen vs. annoyingly reflective high gloss screen.4. No "power brick" (transformer) on the cord of P2419H. Standard power cord plugs right into back of monitor.5. Colors are very accurate on both the new and old monitors.7. In Windows 10 the P2419H monitors offered me a choice of "FULL" or "LIMITED" color. Wasn't sure what that meant but turned on the FULL. I have 2 of these Dell plugged into an EVGA GT710 video card. WOW! I'm now seeing whiter whites and more background colors than I ever saw on prior S2440L monitors.7. Less expensive. I paid $199.99 each in June 2014 for the Dell S2440L monitors.CONS1. Despite the reflections on S2440L colors seem more vibrant/vivid/deep (choose your own adjective).2. Controls on S2440L are "touch buttons"on the front screen vs. actual buttons on the bottom edge of the P2419H. I dislike the bottom buttons because it tends to move my monitor from my preferred position.
5,Item Arrived In Excellent Condition Through Amazon Prime.Was Looking For A Simple Monitor With A Decent Display To Connect 13" Macbook (2017).After Some Searching On Amazon And Reading Reviews I Came Across This 24in Dell P Series Monitor And Decided To Purchase And Give It A Try.I Am Not A Computer/Tech Geek However My Review Is Based On Initial Quality.Assembly Was Simple Nothing That Required Reading A Manual.Monitor Has An Expensive Look And Feel Almost Frameless Heavy Adjustable And Very Sturdy Stand.HDMI Cables Supplied Not Compatible With Macbook No VGA Cables Either.Purchased A Separate Cable (ivanky Mini Displayport/Thunderbolt) for Macbook to HDMI.As Seen On The Pictures:  -First Picture: Standard Position (Can Adjust Up & Down)  -Second Picture: Vertical Adjustment  -Third Picture: Monitor Connections  -Fourth Picture: Left Side Of Monitor USB Connections  -Fifth Picture: Back Of Monitor With Elegant Cable Management Port (Hole)  -Sixth Picture: Monitor Powered On(Monitor Does Not Have Built-In Speakers)Monitor Has Simple And Easy To Use Settings However Still Unable To Figure Out Monitor Idle Before It Turns Off After Inactivity Not Sure If The Cable Has Anything To Do Anything With The Setting As Monitor Does Not Have Idle Setting.Tested Monitor Browsing The Web And Watching An Amazon Prime Movie And So Far Monitor Has Performed Well To My Viewing Pleasure. Reviewed Product While Using Monitor.Recommend.
5,I spent a month trying to find a monitor that would fit my requirements. After shopping for numerous brands and models I finally read the reviews for the Dell P2419H Monitor. One of my main requirements was clear readable text for Word and Excel documents. I also use the monitor for CAD graphics which has proven quite effective. I am unable to comment on gaming since I do not participate in this activity. Below I have listed the pros and so far have found no cons:1. Packaging was excellent. No possibility of damage.2. Sturdy and easy to assemble.3. Easy to adjust the color brightness and view mode.4. The stand adjusts and the monitor is able to swivel from landscape to portrait.I highly recommend this monitor! I plan on buying a second one since I am working from home most of the time and two clear monitors will be better than one.
5,Could not be happier with this purchase. I went from a tiny laptop screen to finally having this monitor and even its relatively "small" size is revolutionary for me. Wouldn't want anything bigger in a smaller workspace so recommend this 24-inch size for anyone with a small desk/smaller workspace. The picture quality probably isn't incredible but I'm not gaming on it or watching movies just viewing documents. The stand is adjustable in all the right ways and has a perfect cutout hole for your cords/wires to go through. Was incredibly easy to assemble and it comes with all the connectors you need. Probably took me 10 min total to go from unboxing to having it all up and running with my laptop connected.
5,I bought this monitor as part of working from home due to the quarantine. I researched and spent a little bit extra for the additional features.  I am very happy with this.  I also bought the Dell soundbar (AC511M) to go with this as it this monitor does not come with a speaker or web cam.I struggled just surviving on the work laptop for the first couple of months and it was worth buying this monitor to hook up to the laptop. It's great to have two screens again and be more productive with my work.  Great size!
4,The screen have a problem of light leakage.But it is a good choice for work.
5,The small frame around the screen makes these great for side-by-side dual monitors nice glare free finish and even color balance. Height adjustable and can even rotate 90 degrees. Set one up for a manager a while back with his right monitor at 90 degrees and that's where he runs his email so he can have a longer display of recent emails.Been using these monitors for a while and really like them.
5,It definitely worth saving 100 dollars to get this P series rather than getting an Ultra sharp.great enough picture quality and very responsive and almost cannot feel the difference from U series
5,Great picture quality. In case anyone is wondering you should be able to overclock this monitor to 75hz.
5,Fulfilled my expectations height and inclination can be adjusted almost effortlessly. Good quality overall.
3,I tried the settings and even made it to the sharpest level but still was not sharp enough for my eyes.
2,From the Dell forum: "The P2419H USB 3.0 Upstream port and USB 3.0 cable are designed to give the PC access to the P2419H four USB downstream ports. For any Dell monitor USB is not considered a video in/out source." Then WHY does the PC need access to the USB ports?  Then WHY NOT include an HDMI cable??
1,After I use it for several months the screen shows one green line. Don’t buy this screen.
4,I had these monitors at my previous job and fell in love with them. This is a known feature that the monitor does not have any built in speakers (only reason why I gave this product a four star rating). However this would have been a nice to have. Other than that it adjusts smoothly and it the colors are vibrant for what I needed. I was a graphic designer and these monitors are decent. If you plan on docking your laptop you might want to plan for a web cam and some speakers for sound.
4,This was an emergency monitor purchase for a dual monitor work at home set up.I wanted monitors with a small bezel that would allow me to adjust the height and pivot the screen that didn't cost a fortune.  This was one of the lowest price options I found and I use similar Dell monitors at work so I was hopeful I wouldn’t have any issues.I am happy with my purchase. I mostly use mainframe systems and Microsoft applications and have no issues with image quality or reading the text.
5,I was looking for a monitor to use for my office at home and was told to look into this particular model.  I'm so glad I purchased this.  The pixels are great and can see everything clearly and the font is large enough.  If you're seeking the best bang for your buck then this is a good monitor.
5,This one landed as a perfect purchase. It fits really well on my desk works great with my MAC. Height adjustable mount is a blessing. I'm sure this one will last a few good years. The contrast and brightness is controllable from my mac. The two charging ports on the side works like a decent charger and has enough usb ports to mount multiple drives to my main device.
5,Monitor arrived packed very well works great I used it to replace work monitor that I slightly cracked that was the same model great price overall I'm very very happy with it
5,Thumbs up
4,These are preowned monitors so I did not expect perfection.  I purchased two and one of them was definitely better than the other.  One looked brand new.  The other had 5-6 scratches on the screen.  They are not big scratches they just look like small dirty spots.  The stands had some scratches but overall looked nice.  For the price I consider them a good deal.
5,Quality of item was skillful! First-rate packaging. Very very quick dispatch. A+
5,I'm please with the two monitors used for teleworking.
5,I have used these Dell monitors at work. However I needed my own set of monitors at my home office. So I've ordered couple of these. Best monitors for the price. Perfect for professional CAD work. You can't go wrong with these.
5,Finally retired my 10 year old monitor and upgraded my home office! Excellent picture quality! Love the narrow edges my dual screen is almost seamless. Highly recommend!
4,I thought this was a new item.  I was not it had a long ugly noticeable scratch on the back of the monitor but most important the screen was perfect.  I'm happy with the monitor.
5,replaced a 21” monitor with this new 24” model. super nice! colors are crisp and clear. highly recommend this for anyone looking to upgrade
5,I have come to disagree with one of the reviewers about the screen text readability. In my opinion this monitor is by far the best for text reading general office work and even for video. You won't find a better quality monitor for this price range. Just go for it and you won't regret it.
5,good video quality.
5,Good item. It arrived earlier than expected. It came with a DP cable but my laptop doesn't have that connector so I had to buy a HDMI cable.The control buttons below the screen are somewhat difficult to manage and the menus are not so intuitive but they're ok.
5,Same price on dell website but just shipped quicker. Screen is nice and big
5,Great for personal and office use.  FYI I'm not a gamer.
5,La verdad quedé muy satisfecho con el monitor. En menos de 5 minutos ya lo tenía armado y funcionando y con el buen fin me salió a un súper precio. Ojalá hubiera alcanzado 2 pero el mío era el último :(Tan pronto vuelvan a tener en stock me compraré el segundo.Sí lo volvería a comprar (de hecho lo voy a hacer :P)
5,Estuve mirando algunas opiniones principalmente las malas pero hasta ahora puedo decir que no tengo nada malo que decir sobre este monitor. Yo personalmente lo compre como monitor vertical y puedo decir que cumple su cometido al 100%. Además de que se ve muy bien. Si estas buscando un monitor para darle el mismo uso que yo este esta recomendado al 100%.
5,Para ser mi primer monitor es excelente les recomiendo que descarguen la aplicación de Dell display manager para controlar los ajustes del monitor desde la computadora.
1,Me llegó dañado el producto y me pedían llevarlo a un centro de servicio y esperar a que lo repararan. No tenía tiempo y decidí pedir un reembolso y no quisieron pagarme la guía para regresar el producto dañado. Pésimo proveedor. No compren en Intercompras!!!
4,The monitor is good but although it says that it comes with an HDMI cable it did not include one.
5,Después de la primera semana de uso del monitor dell p2419h puedo decir que:- Ocupé calibrar el monitor para mejorar la imagen. Al encender y usar el monitor la primera vez no me gustó la calidad de las letras e incluso me parecían incomodas para la vista. Después de buscar reseñas y unos tutoriales encontré como calibrarlo mediante programas de  windows: 1ero. Calibrar color de pantalla y 2do. Ajustar texto Cleartype. Logrando conseguir algo agradable para mi vista.- El brillo mínimo del monitor me parece muy altoCreo yo que una de las cosas que me animó a escoger este monitor fue su ' base ' la cual la puedes configurar a tu gusto ya sea horizontal o vertical. Esta se lleva la corona.
5,Very happy with the size of this monitor  because I do not have a large desk to space out between myself and the screen  larger size would actually be way too big for whole day work at the computer.Also like the feature where it has an audio outlet (in HDMI mode).  So I can have my speakers plugged to it.  Note that the monitor does not have any built-in speakers.  A few USB at the back also comes handy as power supply for amy 4k chromecast.
5,I mainly got these two monitors for work (Video Editing) and thus far its been great.The quality of the picture are clean and the design is very sleek 👌
1,Update after 3 months of usage.This monitor though initially looks nice have tons of problems.1. It does not wake up when connected with more than one monitors. I tried with different cable laptop and monitor combo but no it refuses to work.2. It sometimes just freeze with horizontal bars showing at the screen. It only disappears if I turn if off and on again.I cannot believe this is Dell's commercial monitor line. How does it have so many reliability issues?? I would not choose Dell again. Garbage.
5,El monitor es bastante bueno la base que tiene para manipular la altura es excelente además te da la posibilidad de poner el monitor en forma vertical.Un super plus para mí son las entradas USB que tiene porque si en tu PC/Laptop ya no tienes puertos disponibles y quieres conectar cualquier otra cosa esos puertos te ayudan mucho.La calidad de la imagen es buena aunque de momento solo la he usado para trabajo.
5,Using a digital connection the image is crisp clean perfect!  I use it with a laptop.The first one I got was broken but it was exchanged quickly like you expect from Amazon (and the seller).The bezel around the screen is a couple mm very nice if you use many monitors (which I don't - yet).
5,LOOKS GOOD STANDARD
5,Me encanta el diseño delgado elegante y sobrio del monitor la calidad de imagen es correcta sin más si buscas sacarle el jugo a un equipo Apple mejor ve por la opción ultrasharp pero si no eres tan exigente este es mas que correcto incluye un cable Display Port en mi caso no fue un problema porque mi PC tiene salida y creo que es mejor que el HDMI pero si tu no tienes esa opción ten en cuenta que necesitarás un cable extra HDMI. Tiene buena respuesta pero no es un monitor gamer queda claro desde el inicio y no lo necesitaba para eso.Contras: no tiene salida de audio no pido que tuviera bocinas integradas (no las tiene por cierto) pero por lo menos que tuviera la salida para conectar las mías y hacer mejor gestión de cables pero igual no es algo como no vivir sin ello.Es genial para el trabajo da un toque de buen diseño a tu espacio de trabajo.
5,El monitor es estéticamente muy agradable tiene un bisel muy delgado y la calidad de imagen es excelente. La base que trae es otro punto a favor porque permite montar el monitor muy fácilmente (sin necesidad de herramientas) y deja subirlo bajarlo y rotarlo 90°.Lo único negativo es que no incluye el cable HDMI. Viene con un cable displayport y uno USB de subida para poder utilizar los puertos USB que tiene como si fueran los de tu computadora.En general es un muy buen producto y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.
5,Compré el monitor Dell P2419H y es muy funcional y la imagen se ve super bien y muy nítida. Tuve algunos problemas al instalarlo y conectarlo a mi equipo porque no viene con cable HDMI pero mandé a pedir uno y en cuanto lo conecté pude utilizarlo sin problema alguno.Super recomendable! Se puede girar sin problema alguno a modo vertical el giro horizontal sobre su mismo eje también es super sencillo y puedes ajustar altura e inclinación igual super fácil.Los dos puertos que trae son super útiles.Muy recomendable!
4,Me encanto la calidad de la pantalla no es nada del otro mundo pero por el precio vale la pena. Me encanta que la pantalla se puede mover en diferentes direcciones.Tomen en cuenta que no incluye cable HDMI por lo que tendrán que comprar uno.Sino fuera por la tardanza del envío daría 5 estrellas soy prime y tardó 9 días(lo normal son 2)
5,C'est la 2e fois que j'achète cet écran car j'ai un support Vivo pour 2 écrans.Très satisfaite.Le 1er écran est arrivé brisé. J'ai eu un excellent service et ils me l'ont remplacé.Je l'ai depuis déjà 1 an.Je viens d'en acheter un 2e. il est arrivé en excellent état.J'aime cet écran. Bonne dimension. Bonne visibilité même en angle.Excellente qualité.
5,Compre este monitor para mis clases en lineal. Me resulta útil la forma en la que puedes ajustar el nivel de la pantalla a si como también tienes la opción de girarlo verticalmente. Los materiales son de buena calidad a si como la resolución de la pantalla la cual  tiene una frecuencia de 60Hz  a si que si buscan un monitor para jugar tal vez este no sea para ustedes en cambio si lo que buscan un monitor con un buen diseño y buena representación de colores este es su monitor.
5,Gran diseño sin borde el soporte y las posiciones de ajuste son muy buenas ya que permite trabajar tanto en vertical como horizontal. Lo utilizó mayormente para programar y actividades cotidianas de trabajo y es excelente. Las posibilidades de conexión son las necesarias y el HUB USB es un gran plus. La definición es muy buena para un monitor FHD.
2,As expected Dell always exceeds expectations. I bought this new monitor but the one i received had warranty already initiated. So do check on Dell website. Amazon was kind to give me a discount for my loss of warranty as I didn’t want the hassle to repack and send back. Overall great monitor and great amazon service but shady seller 😂
4,En general es una excelente alternativa pero mi mayor consejo es tener en cuenta que es de tipo panel IPS y tendrá la posibilidad de tener algunos de sus defectos como Backlight Bleeding yo lo regrese por ese defecto de fabrica con el que contaba.
1,Dejo de funcionar a la semana.
5,Adquirí este producto porque tenia necesidad de una pantalla en posición vertical en ese aspecto cumple muy bien su cometido un punto a favor es que la base puede rotarse en el apartado visual la resolución que despliega es la adecuada (solo la he ocupado con PC) en un futuro probare con consolas de videojuegos en caso de que surgiera algún contratiempo actualizare la reseña de momento todo esta muy bien.
5,Good value for home office use. High quality. Easy setup. Professional and understated look. Lots of details thoughtfully considered. Very happy. Had an issue with one of the DP cables provided not working but fortunately had a spare on hand.
5,Es el mejor monitor de su segmento. Su USB hub es una bendición para conectar varios periféricos a la vez. Sus ángulos de visión son excelentes aunque padece un light bleed ligero en una de sus esquinas. Su base ergonomíca es un 10/10
5,Really like how these look next to each other either on or off. Bought them for my home office at the start of the pandemic and I haven't had a single issue with them. I also game on them once in a while and it gets the job done. Worth the price!
5,Excelente monitor. La calidad de la imagen es muy nítida. Con la base que incluye se puede rotar por si se necesita ocupar de forma vertical u horizontal. Llegó en excelente estado. Solo como nota incluye solo un cable de displayport. Pero en general es un buen monitor.
5,Je suis très satisfait du produit mais je suis beaucoup moins satisfait de la livraison Prime qui a livré mon colis à la mauvaise adresse.
5,Love the overall color and quality of this screen. Its pretty sleek and good for the price it was.

5,Great looking monitor for work. The slim bezels are great for dual monitor setup.
5,Buena resolución buen tamaño de pantalla para mi propósito.La entrega puntual y el producto llegó en buenas condiciones.
5,I bought the Dell P series monitor because it includes a very flexible (height tilt rotation) monitor stand. The monitor is decently priced for its quality. I've been working with it for a week now and have no issues.
5,Excellent service from Steve at PC Line! There was an issue with one of the screen not working correctly and he organised a return label and shipped another one next business day. Very much appreciated. Highly recommend this supplier.
5,Llegó antes de lo indicado aunque la caja estaba algo maltratada para un producto así de grande. El monitor está y ha funcionado perfectamente después de una semana de uso. Fue un boost a mí productividad
5,Great monitor for a reasonable cost.
5,Me agradó mucho el monitor para estos tiempos de HO sería bueno que incluyera un cable HDMI en lugar de los 2 que trae.
5,Para el precio y todas sus characteristicas esperariamos menos sin embargo esta muy bien es delgado  gira 360 grados excelente monitor
5,I am satisfied. Even with Covid-19 it delievered real quick and also working so neat! Easy to install easy to convert to vertical mode.

5,Although I found it cheaper right after still a very good deal
5,The monitor arrived before the stated date which was great!  The picture quality is crisp and bright.  It makes working from home so much easier.
5,El producto llegó en tiempo la calidad de la imagen y del producto es buena. De momento no se ha tenido inconvenientes e incluso pienso en adquirir otro.
5,Fue una compra acertada además de que ha cumplido con las expectativas da muy buena apariencia en el lugar de trabajo

5,Muy bueno y práctico solo me gustaría que incluyeran un cable HDMI
4,I am writing this review after almost 1 week of use and I would like to share the feedback based on my personal expectations and features based on price range.I was madly searching about a good monitor which was supposed to serve my purposes as below:1- Coding 50% ( As I an a developer I do spend a lot of time in coding )2- Video/Photo Editing 30% ( I do PHOTOGRAPHY sometimes and filmmaking too)3- Casual gaming and other activities  20% ( I play games sometimes like Sniper elite 4  far cry 3 and CS GO  which does not require massive GPU and refresh rates )With Above requirements I was looking something like below specs to cater the all above purposesIPS screen  60-75 ghz refresh rate  22-24 inch display AMD freeSync(for better sync with games) 1080p resolution(for better clarity of text while coding) Good color reproduction(srGB 90%+ / NTSC 70%+) Ports(hdmi)I did find few options like LG ASUS SAMSUNG but all of them had almost same specs. then I found DELL P2419H and when I compared it with all the options it stood out of all even though with slight more cost.What I liked about this?1- DELL being a robust LCD panel manufacturer and great after sales support.2- Dell monitors are heavily used over corporate offices for all sort of purposes hence it has got great feedbacks and improvements over the year  so it is quite stable product3- This model has massive positive reviews in both amazon and flipkart4- This model has unique features like Adjustable stand  tiltable and a stand that has cable management option5- It really has true color callibaration (not too much saturated like samsung or not less )6- It has 75 ghz refresh rate which is enough for my gaming purposes(not for high end games)7- It has got nice Monitor settings and easy customized buttons for quick functions8- Amazing brightness ( I use 20% as it has enough brightness as I work long time so I dont want to strain my eye with more brightness) But I switch to gamingmovies modes when I need to for perfect brightness setting9- One of the best selling point of it is ports. It has 1 HDMI 1 Display port(which nobody provides in 10-12k range) 2 usb 30 ports 2 usb 2.0 1 usb upstream port 1 VGA. The best part is display port can be a great help for faster data display and due to its USB options u can use external mouse and key board along with pendrives or harddrives without having to be dependent with computer as many laptops now a days have less usb ports   macs pc even do not have at all. SO it gives a great USB hub feature built in.NOTE: to make USB ports work please use USB upstream cable provided and insert it to one of the usb ports in computer else usb ports in monitor won't work ( commom issues by customers)CONS:1- It does not have freesync where all of the models provide in this range. ( but this does not matter as this monitor is not meant for heavy gamers for casual gamers as I mentioned names above  it does not require that sync as 75 is enough for that)So far I am really happy with performance and look is sexy the borders are almosr bezelless .HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR: PROGRAMMERS VIDEO EDITORS and CASUAL GAMERS!NO SCREEN BLEEDING ISSUE FOUND AND THESE NEW STOCKS ARE ALMOST COMING WITHOUT ISSUE OF SCREEN BLEEDING SO CHANCES ARE VERY VERY LESS.

5,In the photos there is the side-by-side comparison between Dell P2419H & HP 24F. I own both. Here is is my subjective review focusing on the two purpose which I will be using the monitors for: programming and consumption of multimedia content.In favor of Dell:1. Deeper blacks.2. Lower IPS glow.3. More natural looking colors.4. USB hub (1 upstream 4 downstream)5. DisplayPort 1.2 with DP cable included.6. Better functioning stand. (height tilt and angle adjustment)7. Vesa mount compatible.8. Better calibration out of the box.9. Lower response time at 6ms vs 14ms on HP.10. Cleaner cable management (included stand can be used).11. Lesser color/brightness/contrast shift at extreme angles. (really knit picking at this point)12. Better build (HP has slight gap between bezel and display as visible in a corner closeup picture)13. Ever so slightly thinner bezels on Dell.In favor of HP:1. Looks sexy as hell. (thinner panel and modern looking stand)2. Brighter display at 300nits vs 250nits on the Dell.3. More vibrant colors. (but also less natural so your choice)Also in favor of HP (but only if using for Gaming)4. Higher refresh rate at 75 Hz vs 60 Hz on the Dell (but remember HP also has worse response time at 14ms vs 6ms on the Dell)5. AMD FreeSync support.Conclusion: Things that matter most to me are present on the Dell and hence more love to Dell but no hate to HP either. You can't go wrong with either.Purchase: Costed me 14.5K before discounts and brilliant fast delivery by Amazon and ZRPL seller. Thank you!
5,Out of the box...Contents include:• The monitor & stand parts (easy to assemble screwdrivers weren't needed)• UK 3-pin power cable/plug (C13 IEC fitting in monitor side cable approx 120cm long)• 1 display-port to display-port cable (170cm long end to end)• 1 USB type A (PC end) to USB 3.0 type B cable (approx same length as display port cable)• Installation and help chart (one side of A4) and safety guidePolitical:• Made in ChinaPorts (same as description obviously):• Power cable connection IEC C14• 1 DisplayPort• 1 HDMI (although HDMI can carry sound this monitor does not have built in speakers or a headphones port)• 1 VGA• 1 USB 3.0 Type B (connects to PC for extending your USB ports only this is not a touch screen)• 4 USB type As (for connecting more peripherals. 2 at the back and 2 at the left side)Packaging:• Sometimes people do complain about monitors having dead pixels or backlight bleeding on arrival so in case you're wondering they don't use bubble wrap or polystyrene protection instead they use cardboard folded into protective shapes but the monitor does feel solid and good quality and as you'll see from my first impression below the monitor worked perfectly.First impressions...Very good monitor good crisp image and backlight looks even across entire screen. The good Lord has ensured I received a unit with no dead pixels so this is a very beautiful monitor. I've rotated my monitor portrait you can rotate it either clockwise or anticlockwise whichever is more suitable for where you want the cable and buttons to face (rotating it may make the side USB ports impractically positioned). You have to change orientation in your PC display settings it does not automatically match the rotation of the monitor (this is standard). The screen face has a flat design that is not inset behind a frame which makes it look a bit more modern and the screen is closer to the edge useful if you are connecting multiple displays.Although I'm not using the USB port extension (I positioned monitor too far away and have enough on my PC) I did test it able to connect my mouse and also charge/tether my phone through it so first impressions seems it's as good as the USB ports in the PC itself. Although the pictures don't show this the hole in the stand is for threading your cables through with minimal stretching when rotating the display. As well as rotating landscape/portrait (z-axis) you can also adjust the vertical height and rotate slightly up or down (around x-axis) and the stand arm rotates at the base (around the y axis).UPDATE (after a couple of months of usage I intend to buy another one)Still works fine after a few months of using the product no issues. I have the monitor next to my TV which is the main screen the colours are slightly more vibrant/bright on my TV (games and pictures look more colourful on my TV) although discerning shades of colour is better on the Dell monitor (because my TV doesn't always show distinctions between lighter/darker colours very well). I'm soon going to buy another one of this monitor to replace my TV which is now starting to show dead blotches on the screen and it's spreading some sort of LCD leprosy.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 There is a tint issue appears on all the corners of the monitor after 9 momths of usage. It is very sad to see it from Dell Monitor. I contacted their customer care as it was under warranty they registered case number but I didn't get any technical assistance or support afterward
5,This product is excellent for the price. It is inexpensive in comparison to most displays. I've used this monitor with both a Mac and a Windows computer and it works great with both. I've used this monitor for 6 months and haven't had a single problem. It has been extremely simple to use because it can be modified based on height and if you want a portrait screen you can do that as well. I even linked it to my phone and it was still able to deliver. It also has incredibly fast refresh rates. This is excellent for everything you are doing from gaming to working to watching a movie as it has specific settings for such situations that perform really well. It is extremely energy efficient. That is why I would suggest this monitor to everyone because it is inexpensive energy efficient and helpful and best of all it provides outstanding specifications like the adjustability and Anti-glare 3H Hard Coating as well as such a good resolution which is 1920 x 1080 for such a low price at ₹16997. Just remember this has been sold by StorazeBiz and not by Dell but is manufactured by them it also as all the ports needed.That is why I would recommend this monitor to everyone since it is affordable energy efficient and useful and best of all it delivers amazing characteristics such as adjustability and anti-glare 3H Hard Coating and such a good resolution of 1920 x 1080 for such a low price of 16997. Just keep in mind that this was sold by StorazeBiz rather than Dell but it was made by them and has all the person a person will need but.Note:For connecting a phone or MacBook you will need a dongle.
5,With the onset of lockdown since March/April 2020 I had to get monitor for mainly work from home purposes and for sure can be used for watching movies and videos. I did a lot of research initially wanted to go for Benq 27 inch monior or Samsung curved 27 inch monitor (trending at that time) but later came to conclusion that this product of Dell is best of all for 1080p standards.Pros:1. If it is 1080p and if you are looking something around 13k please avoid getting 27 inch monitor as it would NOT be good experience (trust me my friend got 27inch Benq at the same time with me); with increase in size of monitor your resolution defination should also increase. 1080p on 24 inch will be much better than on 27 inch as per my recent experiences. Also I would recommend to avoid getting curved monitor ( had initially ordered samsung curved monitor but later cancelled it after researching more)  curved monitor will only add to value if size is more (Like atleast 34 inch)  also curved monitor has their own cons.2. 24 inch monitor should be sufficient enough and good to go for working from home perspectives and also watching movies/videos unless you are looking something specific.3. Look and feel brightness - Awesome4. Picture quality Accuracy - Great5. Screen ia very good with thin bezels and matt finish It has adjustable stand and is strong one.6. I got it around 14.5k but definitely this is worth it than other monitors ( like benq 27 inch samsung curved 27 inch)7. There are different view modes inshort if you are reading something or watching movies you can tune the mode for best experiences. Though I only use standard mode  makes most of itCons:1. Didn't find any until now will update review if I find one. Though monitor lacks audio jack/speaker I believe that facility shouldn't be part of it or even if it is getting in other monitor they aren't of good qualities.2. Regarding assets I didn't get HDMI cable with this monitor but got other two types of cable. They should support it giving HDMI cables .
5,Fantastic monitor! Some highlights for me are:- Quick and easy to assemble- Excellent picture quality- No reflections from the nearby window- Stays stable on my desk- Ability to move it up and down - this allows me to place my laptop below my monitor and use both screens when the extra monitor is at the highest possible level- Ability to tilt it sideways (useful when I read something in Word)- Sleek and modern design- Doesn’t take up much space- Auto power off mode which turns it black like my laptopThe only downside I found is that there isn’t an HDMI cable included so I had to buy a separate one to connect it to my laptop. I know that it’s difficult to predict what ports users have on the other end but I think HDMI is pretty standard... Instead there were two other cables included which I don’t use...A cable is included to provide me with the option to use the 2 USB ports on the side of the screen. I tried using it in the first week but I found it impractical because sometimes I disconnect my laptop from the screen and in this case I can’t use the wireless mouse and keyboard I have. Also it’s one less cable to plug and unplug each time! I just don’t think it’s worth the hassle of using the screen ports (2) just so I have 1 extra port...Overall I would recommend this monitor!
5,I spent a lot of time researching 24" monitors for a home office and this was my choice.You are spoilt for choice in this size category of monitors some of which are significantly cheaper. After room research I decided I needed the height adjustment - I was then left with a handful. Further research and reviews lead me to purchasing this monitor.The monitor comes very well packaged and its the first time I've come across a monitor that has been engineered to simply click together - no screws/bolts etc required. Using the supplied power cable an existing HDMI cable and the supplied USB cable I was off. I recall reading a review on here that said the USB ports don't work - they do for me and have been extremely useful in using additional devices. They are high speed and work without any issues.The height swivel and angle adjustments all work very smoothly and allow you to adjust the screen perfectly it was just what I was expecting.I was quite amazed by the screen quality and consistency. I opted for a back lit LED monitor in the hopes that the lighting and colour would be even and I was pleasantly surprised this this - it does a great job of spreading even light colour and sharpness. My laptop has a 4K AMOLED screen so I am used to viewing the finest picture quality which often makes other laptops a bit of a pain to read but I was genuinely pleasantly surprised by this especially given the price point.Not only is the screen great quality and consistent the monitor itself looks great with its thin bezels and space saving footprint. I have been recommending to everybody wanting one!
5,I have one concern this box is not genuine packing and some of the guidelines book and warranty card was missing however it working fine i so much like this product and thanks to amazon to given this product i fetched all the Dell store and India Mart this p2419h model has stopped although thank you for giving this product for my request.
5,I am a developer and I was looking for an allrounder monitor which can be used on day to day basis.Baseless experience. Crisp displayOccasionally used for the OTT content & does the job pretty wellNot played games much but I have tested the monitor response with the games like Tekken & NFS Most wanted 2016 with average graphics & it did the job well there as wellPros:- You can change orientations to 180 degrees to ease your use- 4 USB ports with monitor which is useful to many- Wall / Table mount can be done- Adjustable monitor heightCons:- No in built speakers ( now a days all monitors comes with inbuilt speakers)- Heavy gaming might not work due to higher response time ãpprox 5 ms & 60 Refresh rateAmazon packaging was good and shipping speed was also good
5,Bought as an upgrade for an older HP 17".I use it for home computing  work on data systems office work spreadsheets and my music program modelling software.  I'm not a power user but more than average so need a good screen.Appearance- very pleased it looks well nice sleek sharp dark and durable.Size - perfect for me.  I was going to buy the 21" but went for the 24" instead.  Glad I did would recommend.Assembly - nothing could be easier.  No tools needed everything just clicks into place. Stand allows the monitor to manoeuvre any which way I want.Picture - with trepidation I connected and powered on.  Fingers crossed I didnt get a dead pixel.  Lucky me.  Perfect picture sharp & colourful.Features - not being a gamer or graphic designer I cant comment on how suitable it is for that.  It came with DV and a USB upstream cable.  I wont really use either and would have preferred an HDMI cable instead.  Luckily I had a spare one I found after rummaging around in storage.  Other buyers if your PC does not have a DV connection you will have to use your old style VGA or go and buy an HDMI.Would I recommend? Yes buy it.
4,Ok
4,Not a bad little monitor. It's not very bright and the colours aren't so accurate but really for the money it's pretty good. It's not a gaming monitor of course but is good for business use.  I suspect that a lot of the price here comes down to the Dell warranty which is superb.Comes extremely well protected in it's box and is reassuringly heavy. Includes a power cable and hdmi cable. Setup is of course easy although out of the box the colours were a little off and the contrast was too low. It's not the brightest of monitors but it is bright enough for me.The stand is particularly nice and I think definitely responsible for a good part of the price! Most other monitors in this price bracket have really bad stands. Having said that I still think it is a little overpriced.Overall it's a rather green monitor and particularly the reds are weak. At best they look orange. Even with calibration it is simply impossible to achieve a vibrant red. So while good quality it is really only good for general business use. Photographers should look elsewhere.
4,Initial impressions: Swivel is not working on the monitor.  Given that this is an advertised feature and the monitor is expensive this functionality is expected to work.Spent a lot of time online trying to find a solution.  Not too many posts on this issue.  Have decided to continue with the monitor and not go for return/ replacement due to hassles and time/ bandwidth required on the returns process.  But disappointed with this feature not working and hence lowered the rating.  I believe quality assurance on these need to be better.  Later determined that the swivel is very tight and unusable except to align it to required angle of view.  Cannot be easily changed.Other than this the monitor is fine and serves the purpose.  Apart from the challenge of no HDMI cable being provided rest of the features appear to be working.
4,I use it for programming mostly and it’s very useful because the anti glare is really good it can be rotated vertically. The bezel less design makes it look appealing. The problem is that the latest model doesn’t provide VGA nor HDMI cables with it and it has 16A plug instead of usual 6A because of which it won’t fit in any of the sockets at home. Heads up check if you have a 16A socket or buy a adapter before hand. Still wondering why the seller doesn’t provide HDMI/VGA and a 6A power plug. The display will be a bit yellowish when you start it I changed the preset to cool and it look fine but don’t know why it is yellowish. It feels like the night light mode is on in Windows.
3,Product rating: 3/5Dell service rating: 1/5The screen broke when it was hit gently by something. It stopped projecting things and I could see the break clearly on screen. It would have been nice if Dell offered paid service and replaced the panel. Instead they asked me to buy a new product. When asked if it's the policy of Dell to not offer any service at all if a damage that is not covered in warranty terms happens the agent said yes. Decided never to buy any product from Dell anymore :)
5,One of the best LED Monitor out there in the marketPros:1. Arrived in very good quality packing.2. Simple and ease of assembling the monitor and stand. Lightweight. You will get a page of detailed instructions on assembly inside.3. One power cable DV cable and USB upstream cable included.4. The monitor has high grade HD Picture quality. No flickering or any disruptions.5. The power cable can be directly attached to the back. No extra DC convertor pack required.6. Multiple input options such as HDMI DV and VGA7. 4 USB downstream ports which can be used by connecting the supplied USB Upstream cable from any USB port of your laptop/computer to the upstream port on the back of the monitor. Very convinient if you need to plug in extra USB devices.8. Nice viewing angle. Anti Glare.9. Can use Dell Display Manager software application to adjust the settings from Windows OS.10. Auto detection of source connected or you can select manually.Cons:1. No VGA cable included in the package.2. The adjustment switches are too small in the front you barely feel it when you go over them.3. No sound output since there is no speakers present in the monitor.4. No 3.5 mm sound output connector at the back. If you are connecting an HDMI cable there will be no option to play the sound carried by the HDMI cable. You have to connect a separate source from the sound source itself. I have selected a different  source for audio from my laptop through 3.5 mm slot.5. A bit higher on the cost side. While you can find competitor models at lower prices than this monitor.Overall judging by the performance and quality it is a nice addition to your workstation.
5,Ordered two of them within a span of 2 weeks first one was from a seller Aapni Dukaan and second one from UniqueClick. First one was good accurate color and all. Second one has defective panel. Yellowish tinge on all images through all inputs (hdmi/vga)  have requested for replacement from UniqueClick lets see how how the replacement monitor performs.Recently the Mrp has been increased. The monitor I bought from ApniDukan was 2019 import and had price tag of about 16k the monitor I bought from UniqueClick was 2020 import and had revised price tag of about 18k+.  Its not the seller that is increasing price its Dell who revised the Mrp. sellers are anyway selling below mrp.Pros:a. Wonderful Colourb. Usb 3.0 Hubc. Height adjustabled. I am an IT professional coding in this monitor is breeze. Connected with Dell Laptop as well as MacBook Pro. Dell instantly recognised and set the correct colour profile so did MacBook Pro. It will be a breeze coding on this monitor.e. Have connected amazon fire tv with it works fine. Only thing is have to route the audio through bluetooth speakerf. Colors ( I know I am saying it again :) ) oh my god they are beautiful. I have tested with 4k videos (though monitor can reproduce only full hd) they are wonderful. Wish my phone camera could capture the vivid colors it producesCons:a. An audio out Jack would be greatb. There are no hdmi or vga cable in the box. Dell doesn't provide it. They only provide one dp cablec. Made in China. I wish it was made in India :)PS:I am a hobby photographer  I plan to use my set up for photoshop and da Vinci resolve color grading. For an amature this monitor will do fine.
5,I have a setup of two screen and it is really good for coding purpose
5,I bought this monitor back in February and have been using it for the past five months now. I use it as a second screen for my mac and i also play games on it via my ps4.Let’s get the only problem that i have with this monitor out of the way. IT DOES NOT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK!!! I don’t know why but that’s a bummer.Okay now let’s talk about the pros. First of all it has a great display. It outputs in 1080p at 60Hz which is more than you can ask for. One small tip  if you are a mac user do make sure to connect it via the display port to get 1080p at 60HZ output. Playing games on it has a been a joy. The colors are bright enough and the screen is pretty sharp. Although avoid sitting too close to the screen while playing.And yeah all in all it’s a great get for the price and you will be happy with the purchase :))
4,I bought this recently as a convenience display for my laptop for work from home. It has what I was looking for.Pros:1. Slim full HD display2. Anti-glare matte display (especially useful since in my work position the monitor faces the window)3. 4 USB out ports (2 on the behind and 2 on the side): great for connecting a wired mouse keyboard and any other devices. Contrary to other reviews I had no issues in using the side USB out ports. This does away with the need for an USB hub.4. Thin bezel around the display5. Comes with a stand that is easy to setup and has an adjustable height. Also the monitor can be swiveled to an angle of about 10 degrees upwards.Cons:1. Does not come with an HDMI cable that can connect to a standard laptop. So if buying this order one if you don't have a spare one around.2. Expect plenty of more messiness with wires all around. I had to spend some time rearranging all the cables and wires to get them out of my work space.3. The back side connections are a bit difficult to access. A piece of advice is that you fix the cables on the monitor back before mounting it on the stand.
5,Pros:This is is very nice and handy monitor. It's height and view angle (tilt up and down) is adjustable. You can also tilt it left and right.Picture quality is good although I have to say picture quality could be different between different monitors of this same model. I have purchased 2 of these monitors and the pictures off these two monitors have slightly different colors. One is a little darker than the other (please the photo I attached).I have installed the driver and software from Dell website which allows you to divide your screen into different patterns. This makes it easy to open several windows on one screen and automatically put the them in different places and sizes on your screen. This software is quite handy.Cons:You can rotate this monitor and make it vertical. I initially thought when you do this the display also rotates (like your phone) but that's not the case. So rotating the monitor to be vertical it's almost useless since the picture won't rotate and become horizontal!All in all I recommend this monitor for its picture quality and handyness.
5,Good monitor still working good  no issues
2,2020/7/28に購入後、2022/9/6死亡耐久性がない
5,Good product and a brand that gives some peace of mind.  Cable tidy is effective and allows for rotation of the screen.  Plenty of connection options for devices.  Mouse works when plugged directly into monitor.  Screen quality looks good to me.  Only issue is that I found is that I needed to set the screen to the second highest resolution (something x 1080) in order for the chromebook screen I was connecting to fit the monitor screen exactly.  The highest resolution setting slightly cuts the edges off the screen.
5,I was looking for a monitor with adjustable height portrait mode and screen size enough for programming and casual gaming. I have used Dell monitors at work and found them of good build quality. This one fit the bill very good build with a sturdy and height adjustable stand. Very few monitors in this range with this thin bezels. Monitor can be rotated in portrait mode useful during long programming / debugging sessions. Comes with 3 years Dell Advanced Exchange warranty where they will replace the panel incase of any defect which is awesome!Another plus is the built in USB hub that is immensely helpful in avoiding cable clutter. This is especially true with the Macbook with the USB-C ports. I had to just buy a USB C to A adaptor connect it to the monitor and have all the peripherals connected to the monitor.I bought this from the seller KIDA Retail. The warranty has already started from Aug 2018 which the Dell support said they can change. However the invoice Amazon provides doesn't mention the serial number and product tag. I'm working with them to get this rectified. The only other con is there is no HDMI cable included.
5,I purchased this monitor for home office and home entertainment purposes. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Dell is a brand that I trust so I must admit bias.Having read some of the reviews below I have to say that my experience with setting up the monitor was altogether positive. Since unboxing I have connected it to multiple devices - Windows SurfacePro for work Lenovo Ideapad for personal - with the setups between each configuration being different as well (currently connecting one via VGA and the other via HDMI).Additionally I'm swapping accessories at least twice daily and making full use of the 4x USB ports built into the monitor. I can confirm that all 4 ports are 100% functional provided you've connected the upstream USB cable to a USB port on the respective device. A practical example I can offer here being that of the SurfacePro device I use for work; this device features one USB port. For my workstation to operate at ideal efficiency while in 'office mode' requires at least 3 ports.I think that's about all I can write really. Outstanding monitor. Happy to answer any questions as well.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Got this to use it as a display for my laptop because that one is too small.So this monitor is 24inch nice design easy to operate the menu. To adjust the high is very easy you can do it with even one hand just press up and down you can use it in portrait mode as well just have to rotate it.The response rate is ok I do video editing and photo editing so I dont know about the games(i dont play).The only small thingh that I dont like about it is that I would like to add more blue color from the menu which is not possible for what I need but this doesnt affect the performance at all.Good product.Satisfied with it.If this helped you in any way please click on the helpful button below.Thank you
5,In favor of Dell:1. Deeper blacks.2. Lower IPS glow.3. More natural looking colors.4. USB hub (1 upstream 4 downstream)5. DisplayPort 1.2 with DP cable included.6. Better functioning stand. (height tilt and angle adjustment)7. Stand/Wall mount compatible.8. Better calibration out of the box.9. Lower response time at 6ms vs 14ms on HP.10. Cleaner cable management (included stand can be used).11. Lesser color/brightness/contrast shift at extreme angles. (really knit picking at this point)12. Better build (HP has slight gap between bezel and display as visible in a corner closeup picture)13. Ever so slightly thinner bezels on Dell.In favor of HP:1. Looks super as hell. (thinner panel and modern looking stand)2. Brighter display at 300 nits vs 250 nits on the Dell.3. More vibrant colors. (but also less natural so your choice)
4,Monitor is good so far. Its from Dell so no ckmplaint in quality deliveryI have only one suggestion to Dell. The power cable provided with this monitor comes with 16amp plug. Why is that required. For such plug we need a high load socket usually not available in quick vicinity of computer.I purchased a local monitor cable worth Rs 100 with general 5amp plug and it is working fine.Dell giving 16amp plug is an overkill please replace it with normal power cableI have reduced 1 star for the inconvenience caused by the 16amp cable
4,Liked the monitor. It has height adjustment and tilt.Monitor is as expected.Negatives:However the power cord given does not fit into regular socket.Also I did not receive hdmi to hdmi cable. Did not get any response from seller.We have to get these after market cables additionally outside.It would have been great if these things were provided in the box.
5,This is the best! I was pretty skeptical before buying this at the price of rs.13900 but it is a bang for the buck!Read till the end for a helpful & important tip if you are gonna use HDMI cable for connecting this monitorPros:The picture quality is truly awesome!The monitor stand is very sturdy and premiumTheir is almost all possible adjustments for the stand - tilt height swivel pivotThere is almost no backlight bleedMore than enough brightness for clear visibilityMinimum ghostingGood response time24inch panel is more than enough for me!Budget friendlyHigh Quality premium feel!! Truly this monitor looks and feels premiumCons:Only 60Hz refresh rate (though I am not a gamer!)GREAT TIP:  If  u are gonna use HDMI to connect this monitor to PC having NVIDIA GPUGo to Nvidia Control Panel softwareNavigate to Display>Change ResolutionThen scroll down and select "Use Nvidia color settings"SET  "Output color format"= RGB   "Output Dynamic Range"=Full then APPLYand you will notice a hell and heaven difference! Thank me later friend!!I'm really very very impressed with the monitor!!!
5,I love it. It produces excellent picture quality and provides flawless connection with my MacBook Air M1 just via one cable: USB C(Thunderbolt 3) to DisplayPort 4K@60Hz 1.8M/6 ft Cable BENFEI USB 3.1 (USB-C) to DP Display Port Adapter Male to Male Gold-Plated Cord (bought on Amazon as well).I don't need dongle with many ports I use wireless keyboard and mouse together with my Mac so no dongle behind the monitor or next to my laptop is really nice.Connection via the cable is perfect and the monitor wakes immediately once I move either a mouse or click any key on my wireless keyboard.The fact that its hight and angle are so easy adjustable makes using it really comfortable and super convenient:)
4,Writing review after 15 days of use.Found it as a good monitor for professional work.Prons:Thin bezels give it a nice look.Picture quality is perfect.Anti-Glare is also acceptable.Screen adjustment in every direction and movement is useful.Cons:It is producing current on the other corner of the cables like USB and HDMI when connecting to port. Usually monitors do not produce. Not sure if it is normal.I can see screen light on the top of the monitor.
4,It is a very good monitor  but here are some issues which may bother some :1. Power plug is of 15 amps  i.e. largest size. So it won't fit into normal power extensions.2.  For M1 mac users there is no software to adjust brightness . It can be done only through the monitor buttons.3. A 3.5 mm jack would have been useful.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After 3 weeks of extensive effort I found this one to be the most appropriate Monitor for work. I am a full time developer and I use this Monitor with my laptop.Good Things:1. Amazing Display2. Perfect Size3. Minimal Bezels4. 2 x USB 3.05. 2 x USB 2.06. 1 x Display Port7. 1 x HDMI8. 1 x VGA9. 1 x USB upstreamOutstanding Things:1.Rotating Display: The display rotates on the stand you can use it in Portrait Mode while coding or viewing logs2. USB Hub: You can use all the USB ports on your screen as hub you just need to plug the upstream cable from Monitor to your PC after that all the USB ports on the monitor will work as if they were on your computer just awesome3. Adjustable heights: You can adjust the height by sliding the display up/down on the stand4. Adjustable angles: You can tilt the screen forward or backward5. You get this at around 12k6. 5-8 ms response timeBad Things:Couldn't think of any so far I mean the features you are getting at 12k INR for a 24Inch Full HD monitor you won't even find one product with such amazing offerings.Gaming?Games work perfectly for Beginner to Medium level players as it is not a gaming monitor it will be unfair to expect g-sync/free-sync and high refresh rates!Conclusion: Just go for it....Warning: If you are planning to buy LG Ultra gear or similar gaming monitor please beware that those are not good for purposes other than gaming. If you are hardcore gamer LG Ultragear is THE BUDGET MONITOR but only for gaming.
5,3 Months into lock down and working from home meant it was high time I needed an extra monitor with my laptop. Needed something basic for work; but realized that for little extra one can get some important features that go long way for future use of the monitor. Surveyed top monitors and zeroed in on this one -Pros:- Thin bezel look- Tilt swivel and height adjustable easily - with real sturdy base- Dell warranty and after sales service presence- Nice connectivity built-in - with extra Downstream USB ports built in- low power consumption (18 W)  - hardly noticed any heat !- ships with USB cable for upstream USB connection to MonitorCons:- Does not ship with either HDMI/VGA/Thunderbolt 3/mini Displayport cables only standard Display port cable is included.- Response times are 8 ms / 5 ms - on the slower side; some ghosting observed when watching fast moving action; but this is expected- no built in speakers - again you can always connect better speakers yourself.I ordered mine from StorazeBiz seller; delivery was before time even with rains/Covid 19 lock down. Packaging was good. My query reg. warranty/registration was promptly answered. So overall nice experience so far. Hope to use for years to come.
4,Base product is good and working properly. The part I disliked is power cable that was sent. It is having a plug for 15 amp socket. Why would a monitor need 15 amps power? I have to purchase another power cable for 5 amps socket for additional 300 rs and that cable is not fitting well. Is Amazon or the supplier going to send me a power cable for 5 amps supply that fits nicely in the monitor.
4,The best monitor for professionals and gamers. I am a CAD engineer and graphic artist both and this monitor is best for me.Dell's software Dell Display Manager makes it quite convenient to arrange different windows on the screen with various arrangement patterns available.The USB ports driven by a USB upstream cable makes this monitor a USB docking station as well. You can attach 4 USB devices to it. it makes it very convenient you don't have to plugin/out 4devices everytime but just one upstream cable.The adjustable VESA mounting stand with proper gromet hole for all cables is just perfect!The only thing I miss here is- this monitor must have had a 3.5mm audio output port.Built quality is really premium heavy and sturdy. Makes it a really premium professional equipment.Overall It is a complete monitor with built in docking device 4 star because if doesn't have a audio output else its a 5 star device.
4,I have been using this monitor for 1.5 months now. The monitor's build is a little fragile. The panel behind the screen bends and make a sound when you try to turn the monitor. The monitor has adjustable height (can go down all the way down and can go up by about 20cm). The monitor can tilt pivot (and go into potrait orientation) and rotate about the vertical axis about the base too (it can yaw pitch and roll). It has a thin bezel if that matters. I got it for Rs 14500 without any discounts.pros:1. Can adjust in every which way (which is why I bought it)2. Comes with USB out ports on the sides and back3. Good brightnessCons:1. It does not include a HDMI cable (had to buy that seperately) comes with a display port cable2. The quality of the plastic behind the screen is a bit on the lower side
4,This monitor was good for my purposes but unfortunately it got some issues and stopped working. I went to dell service centre and now they were asking the invoice with monitor serial/g-tag number. I’m still struggling to get a new invoice with these details from amazon customer care. So attention all the purchasers u need to have these details in the invoice otherwise they will not  service this monitor with in warranty period.
5,Monitor is perfect choice for workstation and text is very sharp and clear.24 inch monitor is ideal choice incase your desk setup is of medium size.bezels are very thin and looks sleek and minimalistic.HDMI cable is not included we need to buy separate one .It is okay to play games but this monitor is not gaming monitor with high refresh rate. I played with my ps4 experience is good.Monitor stand can be tilted and adjustable for height which makes setup easier and convenient to use.Only one hdmi port is there and 4 usb ports and and a VGA port .ports should have been placed in reachable position as it is harder reach and connect cables.there are two usb ports on left side which are easier to reach.Monitor stand Base is sturdy and firm.I would recommend this for professionals only with occasional gaming.
5,This is best desktop for professional work and coding. Since it's adjustability in height and rotation you can adjust it for various usecase like you can make it vertical for coding without need to buy new stand.Since it has IPS panel it is good to view from any side.For GamersWell these thing depend on your gpu no matter how much high end you desktop specs if you don't have gpu then it's wasteSo if you have gpu like lower than 1050 then buy these if you have higher then go for higher price range desktop in lg and acerif you are Gamer and coder then buy theseBecause believe me able to adjust these desktop without buying clamp stand is best and very convenient and it's not that bad for gaming
4,I am recommending this to anyone buying monitor for the first time. A monitor is a combination of a screen and other little things which are often frowned upon.1. A more than decent PPI monitor2. Full HD and non flickering3. Glare free4. Comes with 360 degree rotation stand combo which is vital.5. Sturdy cables in the box6. Lower power consumption
5,This monitor has really helped me during WFH. Using it since September 2020 and its working really well. 24" is a decent size for anyone who is looking for extended monitor to help in daily use. Its matt finish glass does not bring any reflection of lights on screen. Good on eyes so far. Adjustable height and really sleek model. Easy to keep it clean as well. I have not used it for gaming so can't comment on it. But I watch movies on it and its a decent experience. Thumbs up from me.
5,This is a fabulous monitor!If you are a digital marketer or data analyst this is 'the' monitor for you.The display is crystal clear and the wide monitor makes data analysis so easy.Now creating dashboards in Google Analytics or Data Studio is fun (It was difficult to do these tasks (for long hours) using a small laptop display)The display is crisp and the colours are vibrant. So if you do graphic designing this monitor will be an asset to you.The monitor stand is just incredible. All the adjustments it provides (height swivel pivot and angle) adds much more flexibility in to the work flow.This is a great piece of tech that will increase your productivity and make your work more fun.Highly recommended. Buy it.
5,Excellent monitor for professional use. I have connected it to my HP elitebook which has a tiny screen and man! What a difference. I literally asked myself why I didn’t purchase this monitor earlier. Colours are nice and sharp text is sharp and viewing angles are really good. It also has tons of direction changing options. Without a second thought  anyone who wants a solid built to last and sleek looking monitor can purchase this. It came really well packed too. The box comes with all the major cables except the hdmi one. You can use the existing DP cable if you have an older port on your computer. Overall great monitor for my work from home use. I use it for my kid’s school too and he is more engaged now.
5,– Parfaitement compatible avec macOS on peut le pivoter à 90° et donc travailler à la verticale après avoir changé l'orientation dans les Préférences Système > Moniteurs.– J'ai réussi à augmenter sa résolution avec QuickRes petit utilitaire payant.– L'écran affiche un espace colorimétrique sRGB quasi parfait et va donc pouvoir servir pour la plupart des travaux. L'espace colorimétrique est donc insuffisant pour l'impression ou pour les travaux digitaux/vidéo qui vont au-delà du sRGB comme le P3 Display qui est actuellement la norme ou l'Adobe RGB pour préparer à la conversion en quadrichromie.– Design parfait et une couleur sombre très moderne.– Plein de connecteurs pour rencontrer différentes configurations. Les deux prises USB latérales sont les bienvenues pour ne pas devoir aller derrière son iMac ou sous la table.– Montage clic-clac d'une facilité et d'une rapidité enfantines.– Prêt à l'usage en quelques secondes.
4,Pros1. Awesome picture quality2. Adjust height as per required3. Support HDMI and VGA cableCons1. Too much heavy if you are planning to wall mount check the manual for details2. It has sounds on monitor but it's very low. Good for nothing3. Same model without height adjustment not available.
4,Bought it as my second monitor for my WFH office set-up post COVID.Though I am registered on DELL as a purchaser selecting this monitor from the seller on Amazon was a no-brainer considering that DELL is fleecing customers by pricing the same monitor at more than double of what it is available for here on Amazon. Kudos to the seller! (you might need to make an effort to register the product separately on DELL.com for warranty purposes.Easy to mount install  and works like a charm.Definitely worth a "CONSIDER' if not a sure 'BUY' in this category.would definitely opt to buy one more should there be a requirement!PS: Monitor is primarily used for work hence gaming capabilities are unknown to me.
5,Unless you’re a graphics professional of any kind this should suffice for your uses. It’s filled with USB ports the height adjustable stand is fantastic and it’s build and picture quality is great for the price.I really think the height adjustment feature is super worth it over other monitors. I’m in my late 20s and have developed back and neck muscle pains due to using fixed stand monitors for my last job. Do yourself a favour and make sure you get height adjusted for the best ergonomics. It will work out a lot cheaper in the long run and could avoid some doctor visits. This is doubly important if you spend most of your time on a computer for work like I do.
4,This monitor had everything I wanted but I had to return it due to a problem with uneven brightness. There was fading towards the edges and this resulted in eye strain. I don't know whether this was limited to the product I received or if it is the case with the model itself. Given that no one else has complained about it I assume it is the former. Hence keeping 4 stars.Pros:1. Has all sorts of ports (HDMI DP VGA) and multiple USB slots.2. Screen can be rotated 90 degrees has vertical and horizontal swivel and has height adjustment3. Great colour reproduction.Cons:1. Any white background led to excessive brightness and the fading towards the edges resulted in eye strain. Unfortunately most of office work involves white screens making text feel blurry.
5,I bought this monitor in August of 2019 and have used it every day since. The first one that I had delivered worked well with no issues for the first two days and then presented me with a line of dead pixels from top to bottom on a portion of the screen. I requested for a replacement which came in 2 days and that one has not given me problems.I use it as an extension to a 2018 Macbook Pro. The screen causes minimal stress on the eyes even over long periods of use. It has all the adjustments that one would need.As for inputs it has HDMI and DisplayPort. A DisplayPort cable is included in the box with the monitor although I'd have preferred an HDMI one.Picture quality is excellent and is a pleasure to look at from short distances.All in all a great monitor and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get one.
4,I bought it for a month ago I'm using it for my office work only and there is no complain so far. Picture quality is also good.The only thing missing is speakers Built in speakers would have added cherry on cake.But over-all I can recommend this to anyone.
5,Monitor Work Fine as expected and Dell Monitor always deliver excellent service .But I want to say that  the product is incomplete.  The HDMI to HDMI cable is missing.  They have sent Display port  to Display port cable which has no issue at all.I have purchased this product for my laptop and Lenovo laptop doesn't have display port in it. Seller should send all thee types of cable.If you are buying such expensive product and then again you have to buy HDMI to HDMI cable is not expected. Very Very poor customer service and good for nothing
4,After using it for 10 days found that picture quality is kind of Ok specially when you work with lot of text files I'm using it for coding.Other wise picture quality is good when you see the video on this.Dell has to include the HDMI cabel with it.Amazon has to work on delivery it took 7 days to reach me.
5,I like the monitor it exceeded my expectations the color constrast wide screen easy installation setups height adjustment horizontal and vertical rotation.Note: New 2021 model coming it with 16A plug in India we need 10A plug (small). In any case if you received 16A plug you Dont have to panic please reach out your vendor on the same.In my case I have contacted my vendor and I told about my issue. He quickly addressed issue and told him he is going to send new cable.I like the way the vendor addressed my issue I am going to give thumbs up. Thanks
4,I liked the quality and ease of setup and the stand is very great and useful. the way the monitor can easily rotate on the stand is great so u can use portrait mode too  no issues. but no audio i wish it had some speakers built in. and also there is only one hdmi port not two. the other one seems a display port. no cables either neither vga nor hdmi.
4,I am using this monitor with macbook pro 13' 2020 and dell 7560 as an extended screen for programming.  The monitor is working as expected. The resolution compared to macbook is low So might see pixelated font but won't be an issue.Along with the monitor  I bought HDMI to HDMI cable and Apple USB C to Digital AV multiport adapter.
5,Very happy with it so far perfect for home office.
4,Monitor is great good picture quality range of motion is awesome you can swivel left/right pivot to vertical and pan the screen up/down. No glare issues. Giving 4 star because 16AMP plug was given so had to buy a converter plug also would appreciate 1 HDMI cable than the display port one other cabel provided.
4,Value for money the only disadvantage is tat DELL should have provided HDMI Cable and they should have given option for Audio support (USB or Aux cable etc same way how they have given for U2715H)The seller was very helpful in finalizing the product
5,Perfect monitor to make work from home simpler than ever before. Bought this monitor after a lot research based on my requirement. It helped ease pain on my neck which was becoming a menace due to long working hours on the laptop screen. Perfectly lit and easily adjustable with a comfortable viewing mode to reduce blue light and stress on eyes. Also those thin bezels grants it that ultra modern look with a premium finish on the base and support column at that back.
5,Dell P2419H is an upgrade from P2417H. This monitor has decent Onscreen Display menu where you can control the inputs brightness contrast etc. I bought this monitor to use for programming primarily. After adjusting some of the brightness settings it's perfect. I also played a couple of youtube videos and they looked great. So this could also be used occasionally to watch movies if you're interested.As other reviews mention monitor comes with a Display cable USB hub connector and a power cord. My laptop has a display port so didn't have to buy vga/hdmi cables for connecting purposes.Product was delivered without any damage and arrived on time. Assembling the monitor was rather simple. It does come with a manual. But if you're a first time monitor buyer you could look up an unboxing video on youtube and get a hang of it. The product I got was manufactured in April 2019. So I went to Dell website and initiated a warranty ownership transfer from the retailer to myself. You can verify whether it's registered on dell website with the "service tag" you receive with the product (it's stuck onto the package box).Considering other models and prices if you're looking for a monitor to work on and occasionally use it for entertainment this is the perfect choice. The product I received didn't have any backlight bleeding issue. The flexibility of the monitor is a great plus and makes it completely worth the price.
5,I've just purchased the P2419H and used it with my office laptop.  This was a replacement  for my old 24 inch screen that I bought with my gaming PC.  With no changes to the screen it works amazingly well.  I viewed a 4k video from YouTube and I was very impressed with the results.  It very clear and sharp and comfortable viewing.  I have marked for gaming as I haven't tried that part yet but ai am expecting it to be also very impressive.  If you and looking for a reasonably priced replacement or additional monitor I cannot recommend it highly enough.
4,1) Got it for 10800/- with Sbi card2) Nice adjustable rotatable display in this budget.3) No separate mounting option for monitor this is the only concern.4) Quality of the picture is really good. Good for office work.
3,Used for 1 year and 3 months. Design of the support stand not good. Monitor got damaged within the first time it fell from table
4,Very good monitor. Got this as second monitor. Have a benq which is not flexible in terms of height adjustment and rotation. Using this in portrait mode with mac Pro as dual monitor setup. Nice so far.Update:Have been using the first one for about an year now without issues in vertical mode. I got one more of this as my second monitor conked. The color setting is different I cannot get same color on both monitors with adjustments. Also the power chord that came with second one is 16A vs 5A which I got with first one. This was frustrating as my desk has only 5A sockets.. So watch out for that.
5,I purchased this monitor to add a secondary screen to my Macbook Air as its screen size is only 13 inch.But I was very lucky as I choose this as trust me this is the best monitor you could have in this price range.Picture quality is beyond my expectations. I strongly recommend this to those who want to use monitor in the portrait mode by rotating it 90 degree.Other good feature is its anti glare screen which wil really help you while using it for long hours.Overall I should say buy it without any hesitation. This is going to be your best companion.
4,Extremely happy with the purchase. Main feature that I am impressed is it's super adjustable. we can even flip it into portrait mode which most of the monitors do not offer in this price range. Picture quality is great with antiglare protection. One of the best Monitor for WFH and for people looking for a monitor with macbook's. I am using it as an extended monitor for my Macbook pro and the screen feels so sleek.Giving a star less as the packaging was little damaged from the outside and the monitor doesn't have an audio out and they doesn't provide a hdmi cable. My seller was ZRPL. I got it for 12.2k on amazon prime day sale
5,Got this delivered last week  Thursday . Will categorise my experience on delivery and actual product review Delivery experience :My scheduled delivery date got changed without any prior notice . However I don't not have much complaint with that given the lockdown situation  I understand that shipping and delivery can take time . The product came in a nice double packaging . One the monitor came in and other Amazon box . It was so well packed that there was no way of any damages.Product quality :The monitor is bright enough . Best thing is the display is very soothing to look at . I generally have to sit infront of my laptop screen almose the entire day due to my work the monitor actually reduce the pressure on my eye . Hdmi cable was not included so had to order one separately .best buy.
5,The monitor is a total value for money yhe hieght and orientation adjustment has been a boon for me. The picture quality and colour is very good. The backlight bleeding through the sides when screen is showing dark content is a sore sight but that's to be expected from a IPS Led panel in this price point itherthan that it's just wonderful.
5,If you're looking for a monitor for office or for general purpose work I highly recommend this one. The colours are very rich the stand it comes with is very high quality and it has a very thin top bezel - so gorgeous to look at. This is my first time buying a Dell monitor and i'm actually surprised it is of this quality. I'm glad I skipped the rest.There are no inbuilt stereo speakers with this model. HDMI cable does not come with this monitor. There is a bit of backlight bleed but I'm not bothered by it. If you are that guy with that perfect standard / paranoid you made a bad purchase you can go replace it. It's a general problem with most IPS panels. Monitor does need a bit of calibration for optimal colour accuracy. This is not the model which comes with a USB-C port. Also the model number in title and the description in this page differs - Answered in FAQ. So hopefully you know all that before buying.My options were originally Dell P2418 (Rs. 24800 for 1440p on a 24'') - worried about scaling issues and Dell Ultra Sharp U2718Q (Rs. 56000) - Very expensive. So I decided I'd just settle for Full HD as I'd be mostly using it for programming. For the price this is a very good monitor.
4,HDMI cable was not supplied with it. Only display port cable USB3 connector cable and power cable were there. Not all laptops have display port so HDMI cable should be supplied with the monitor. Other than that I have no complaints. Video is sharp. Lag is not noticeable. Colors are fine. No reflections in the screen. The main reason for using this monitor is the Stand. It can be raised or lowered and the monitor can be rotated both horizontally in either direction as well as vertically for scrolling through large documents. Using the USB3 power cable other USB devices (4) can be connected directly to the monitor. I am happy with the purchase.
5,I bought this for work as a second screen for my laptop. The picture is clear and I have no complaints so far! I love the feature to turn it to portrait mode. Really easy to use and smooth glide. Set up also simple. Thanks.
5,Best monitor for professional use. Best screen quality  anti-glare and IPS panel which describes it all Not for gaming as response is not 1ms. But it doesn't mean that you can't play games at all. If you play light games then it's also a good choice but the best use is for professional work. Hight and angle adjustment is good and build quality is superb as yoi can expect it from DELL. Also the reason I bought this is USB plugs which you don't see usually in other monitors at this price point. If you use mac then you need to have USB ports for external keyboard and mouse and this monitor satisfies that.
4,Updated product now stoped workingOver all Good product product built quality can be improved looks delicate over the edges as it as narro edges. So one has to be carefull moving the monitor and adjsting the angle. AND PLEASE STOP SENDING dp port hdmi CABLE it is such a e-waste go green either don't send cable or send cable with regular hdmi port. Or give option to user to select what kind of cable to select. 90% of the time cable you send is not usefull so Reduce carbon footprint. SAVE THIS WORLD
5,Picture quality very nice. Matt finish screen. Very premium look with combination of black and silver.Package comes with power cable display port cable usb upstream cable (using this u can use monitor USB ports). U need buy HDMI cable separatly ( i will recommend belkin it cost around 500/- don't compromize on hdmi cable because this is the only medium of your monitor and laptop).I will recommend buy it from ZRPL seller. Brand new monitors from zrpl i did lot of reasearch so suggesting them. I know there r lot of sellers for this monitors and people get confuse from where to buy. I got this in 12999/- from zrpl.Rest monitor review u can see on youtube 24" is  perfect for work from home.
4,The monitors themselves are great. However the monitor power cables come with 16A plugs which are huge and don't fit into regular sockets... I had to buy third-party power cords.
5,My existing 21" monitor of Dell which I was using for almost 4 years went out of order hence I was looking for a new monitor. I normally use it for office purpose. I selected this particular model but I was apprehensive about the quality and since there were few negative reviews.  However I still ordered for the DELL P2419H Monitor. I received the same in time and I am very happy about the product. The best thing is the extra USB Ports even though you have to connected the monitor to the CPU with extra cable. The cable was provided in the packing. Overall a very nice product and received the product in good condition without any damage.
5,I am using this while working from home. The display size is perfect - not too big not too small. The height adjustment has enabled me to raise the display so that I can place it right behind my laptop and so am able to see both displays without turning my head. The best feature is the USB hub that has extended the 2 USB ports of my laptop to five apart from reducing the number of cables that connect to my laptop. All in all it is a great buy.
5,Hello GuysI was looking for a 24" monitor for programming and browsing. This monitor is just perfect for this task.Few quality of this monitor are :1. Best monitor stand : If you are looking for development for stand is must so that you can adjust it in any direction {vertical & horizontal ] as per the need.2. Anti-glare screen : Screen quality is super  it is just best of coding and browsing . I have not tried watching full hd movies but checked few videos on YouTube and they were fine.Monitor is just awesome . I am complete happy with the product.If you are looking for coding and work purpose. This monitor is just the best. Don't think too much just order its really good.Thanks to amazon too for great customer service.
4,Perfect and cheap setup for macbook pro. It comes with 4 USB ports and you can use the monitor as usb hub. I have keyboard and mouse and headphone everything is connected to monitor and I just need to buy one simple hub to connect everything. Downside is it doesn't come with hdmi cable.
5,My plan was to buy a 27 inch monitor but I did not have enough budget and at the same time I was not ready to compromise on quality also.  So I decided to buy this monitor even though it is a little bit smaller in size. Believe me it will worth every penny you spend because the screen quality is really good and I am using this monitor as the secondary display for my MacBook Pro and by doing so my productivity has increased really really well. So if your budget allow you to purchase a 27 inch go for it otherwise you just order it right now and you will never have to regret about it.
5,I have bought hundreds of these screens for my company over the last year as this is the Dell professional version rather than consumer. Due to the current working from home situation I needed a screen for my house and this was the one for me. It is a great size with great colour contrast. The USB ports on the back and side work exactly like a USB hub meaning I can have multiple things plugged in and then use the cable provided to plug directly in to my PC. This makes my desk look a lot neater and works really well for me. The options of HDMI DP and VGA also mean most machines can plug directly in without the need for an adapter. This screen is a must have.
4,Difficult to manage cables. They advertise as good for same but not.I wanted to buy earlier version as also using same at office desk but thought to go for this USB3 and newer model.Olde model still much better!!USB uplink powers itself down on its own.For some reasons when other light switches are flipped or electric door bell rings this monitor shuts down for 3 seconds (even on power-strip/ups).Color reproduction is okay quality. Not professional quality. The only reason it seems to call itself Professional monitor is due to [1] Stand has height adjust [2] perhaps better after sales service optionsI bought with GST transfer... however Dell refused warrantee transfer as seller did not honor the transfer (as per Dell's email reply to deny transfer).
4,if you don't have much time to explore & don't have much capacity to take risk go for it overall good monitor viewing experience is good many options to adjust the view.
4,Overall its a perfect monitor with very good picture quality and vibrant colors. The unique features about this monitor are the flexible stand and the extra usb ports provided for connectivity which comes to handyy when connected with Macbook or a laptop. The only downside I have noticed is the missing port for Audio connectivity.
4,Build quality of this display is very good.To me display looks very average. I am using it with a 2017 MacBook Pro. While using some apps  i can see pixels in the text.
5,I was really looking forward to using this monitor.  Before the earthquake it looked great.  At first I thought the color was off.  It had a hint of green tinge.  However after I upgraded software on either my computer or my graphics card the color looked much better.  I had this for a month before it tipped over  during a recent earthquake in Miyagi.  The glass on the screen looked fine but the LCD panel underneath was cracked.  If you live in an earthquake zone I suggest you find some way to hold the monitor down.
5,Bought this unit for work from Home. Product is sturdy and lic quality is very good. I also have an LG monitor. I feel the quality of pic and Abu glare are better in Dell.Screen size is smaller compared to many rivals.
4,I did so many research on the display size display quality display resolution and etc.. as a software developer we design and develop applications where we need color accuracy and text clarity for coding and stuffs which is not great but feel strange blurry feeling while reading/writing the code(might be i am used to much higher quality display of laptops) most suitable for professional office work like excel and writing documents watching videos and surfing is exceptional as mentioned for this price range. and adjustable and rotatable display makes things much easier for users.
4,I have no complaints about the monitor everything works has it should be however the custom fee of €48.00 was a bad surprise as nothing has been mentioned in the description nor at the checkout.
5,Pros:1. Good display range2. Landscape and Potrait modes available3. Height and Angle adjustabale4. Sturdy despite the dimensions5. Gaming experience was good.Cons:1. No HDMI cable was in the box2. No speakers3. [Personal Opinion] Didn't like the too much anti glare coating.FinallyThis is the best available in its price range. Go for it.
5,Stavo cercando un monitor per lavorare in ufficio. Cercavo una soluzione universale dato che ogni tanto devo lavorare con Photoshop Premier Pro e Illustrator. Prima ho preso un Samsung però sono rimasto molto deluso alla fine dopo aver letto moltissime recensioni ho scelto DELL e non ho sbagliato!In poche parole - ECCEZIONALE!Molto solido e robusto. In confronto con Samsung questo sembra un pezzo di ferro contro un giocatolo in plastica per bambini. Qualità d'immagine stupenda illuminazione perfetta comodità massima grazie alla regolazione in altezza inclinazione avanti-indietro e in diagonale.Il mio voto 110 su 100!
5,Having used this monitor for about a week I've yet to have a single issue with it. The pricing is competitive with the rest of the market the picture quality is crisp bright and very customizable. The swiveling works as advertised. Satisfied with the product satisfied with the price and satisfied overall. Would definitely recommend.Do bear in mind this monitor doesn't come with an HDMI cable.
5,Excellent for office purpose. I must say this helps a lot if your work involves data and visualisation tools. I have been using now for 2 months and all going good. Also my kid uses this for his online classes this is really an ease and takes you to a different experience both official and online classes.
4,Great quality of display. Just be aware that it requires 15A connection so finding the right place without extension might be difficult
4,Overall it is the best monitor in market for this price but there are issues with packaging and handling. There is a minute scratch on screen. Picture is attached.
5,Purchased this monitor for wfh and coding.But face no issues while playing GOW on PS4.Only down side is that it does not have a speaker.Also there is not 3.5mm jack to attach external speaker.The brightness has a good range and works well for a person with dry eyes syndrome.If you don't need to attach a speaker to it.. then go for it.
3,I am happy with this product but they should send the hdmi cable as well. The only problem I am facing with this is that it keeps on blinking for no reasons as and when I am not sure what is the reason but that annoying when you are working on something important or you are sharing the screen in call.
4,After lots of reviews finally decided to go with P series Dell 2419H.My other choices - Samsung and LG 24".But I'm not too inclined as I'm not a big gamer.Its for regular WFH purpose with very minimal multimedia purpose.And so decided to go with Dell as it has swivel option and relatively reliable for WFH.Due to lockdown the prices had been inflated off late.But since for WFH needed this so bought this for 14k.
5,The best quality you can in this price range. Very low power consumption multiple connection options and excellent screen quality. I am using it for work and occasional movies watching.Cons:1) Doesn't comes with HDMI cable2) USB hub will not directly work you have to connect provided cable with the USB port of your laptop (along with HDMI; total two cables).
4,Don't buy at this rate costing almost 17k+ coz  few months back i bought it for 13k
5,Nice monitor. Easy to setup and very flexible.Comes with usb data cable and dp cable. You need to order a HDMI cable separately.*Some cons I noticed for my usecase:*- I find the max brightness to be a bit low.- Also no shortcut for quick brightness adjustments. You need to go into the menu and then to screen and then brightness to adjust it.
4,For all the programmers out there this is the perfect one. Two things I don’t like about this is it doesn’t come with hdmi cable and one dead pixel it’s so tiny but we can manage with that. Value for money 100% recommended. Screen quality is excellent considering the price. Over all good monitor for programmers and not recommended for gamers. There are other computer that you can get.
5,writing this review after an year of usage. I used it for my professional work. I never felt strain in my eyes or headache and this is for what I ordered it  a successful buy. Got for it if u sit on system for a ling time  it will give you much relax.
5,Excellent as expected. I'm very old computer user and I'm really happy after seeing this product.No damages or scratches while shipping. Good packing.No backlight bleeding. ( 1080p ips display)Highly height angle and rotation adjustable.4 usb ports ( 2 usb 3.0 on left side )Chosen this monitor after lot of comparisons reviews and the risksBought for Rs 13990. Compared to other 24 inch monitor this is little expensive because of the quality and brand value.I'm sure this monitor will run for 10 years :)I promise you love this if you have budget of 14000 .
4,Pros: Very good quality. Soft on eyes flexible rotating options.. . and finally very easy installation...Cons: connectors provided cannot be used for most of the users.Most computers dont have display port but have hdmi ports... So adding hdmi cable would help most consumers avoid buying it additionally.usb video cable is provided but usb data cable is not provided... Have to buy data cable to really get it working.
4,Monitor looks good. Stand is height adjustable and easy setup. Picture quality is same as basic monitors no noticeable difference.County of origin was mentioned as Singapore but product I received says made in China.First I had received a faulty monitor brightness was not uniform and text had shadow. Had to make multiple calls to Amazon and Dell. Finally Amazon arranged for a replacement.
5,1. Good Picture quality2. 4 USB ports really useful3. All adjustments including height really comfortable.4.meets all my requirement5. Dvi and Usb cable in the boxOnly one concern I hadpower cord provided in the box is 16A .. usually socket at home usually is 10A so doesn't fit. Only few sockets in houses will be for 16A. I used different power cord.
5,Delivery was prompt and packing was intact. Display monitor has power  USB(upstream) and DisplayPort (PS: NOT HDMI)  cables included.If you are using monitor with Mac having USB-C port then USB Type C Male to DisplayPort Female adapter is necessary. I realised it after receiving monitor and ordered separately.  (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07F34HBST/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).Monitor has support for HDMI DisplayPort VGA inputs and if you have compatible cable for any one of these inputs then adapter is not necessary.Overall very happy with monitor and it serves my purpose of office and programming use. Dell P2419H is just right size for browsing and coding usage.
4,The monitor has multiple features which make it an outstanding one:- Adjustable height and option to adjust inside out- Fullscreen monitor- Multiple options to connect (HDMI DP VGA etc)- Additional option to add USB- Dell does not provide HDMI cable inside the box!Negatives- Price is slightly high it should have been in the range of 10K to 11K. I got it for 13K !
5,The color quality is good you get HDMI cable Had to use connector for MacBook  Height adjustable and angle adjustable also you can use it with external arm.Overall a good product Have two as of now. Purchased another during start of CoVID.I used to get same screen when I used to Work for Amazon BLR So WFH setup is similar
4,Stand is awesome.Contrast is natural.Colors are pure except for the yellow tint allover which is expected these days due to eye care certification( R 92 G 93 B 100 in custom color removed that tint for me).Do install ' DEll display manger ' software for easier switching of modes.
5,Great just the right size. ANot to big nor too small. Very flexible in changing degree of view and rotation of screen. Been using it for almost 3 minths now. Just the right colour brightness and also with the driver installed on your pc  picture quality scale can be customised.Have been gaming on this also  good for normal gamers of valo and csgo until you are not thinking of competitive esports.So finally advice go for it.
5,If you are looking for an all round performance this is something you should definitely consider there are not a lot of products specially at this price point which offer you the kind of versatility like this onePros:1. Great looks with minimal bezels.2. options to move the screen around until you find the best possible set up for yourself Up Down Landscape Potrait Tilt stem movement without moving the base.3. Very easy to set it up4. Perfect Size for both office and personal useCons:1. Did not come with a HDMI Cable really couldn't believe
5,I needed an extra screen to make working from home easier so I spent a long time deciding between various brands. Although it was slightly over my initial budget of £100 in the end I opted for this Dell monitor. The screen resolution did not need to be adjusted after I had connected it to my laptop which was good. I've been using it for almost a month and no problems experienced so far. I cannot judge how suitable it is for gaming because I don't use it for that purpose.
4,The monitor is really good currently hooked up to my Dell Inspiron and I am waiting to hook up this monitor with my Mac mini M1. Might need a better HDMI cable to use the full potential of 60 hertz. Will share a detailed review about this product sooner.
5,Brilliant 24 inch monitor have owned 5 Dell Monitors before this and this one is perfect and as usual Dell doesn't disappoint my purpose is to use it as a vertical monitor in addition to my primary and secondary 24 and 20 inch Dells so I use it mostly to read books browse and for stock market usage and my GTX 1070 is fully capable to run all three so I am taking maximum leverage out of my setup.Vertical monitors are a god send for browsing as you can see an entire page without much scrolling so a Landscape and Portrait monitor should be standard for everyone who is doing serious business with their PC it's 2020 people wake up.
5,Dell Monitors are best in the market. I had been using 1. Dell 2208WFP (almost 9 years old) and 2. Dell U2717D (few months old). I wanted to replace 2208WFP and came across this amazing monitor and awesome deal. You can't get this monitor in any stores at this price and of course I can bet on that! Apart from the price quality is amazing. I am happy with the product. This monitor comes with 3 years of warranty from Dell.It came with the following cables:1. USB 3.1 upstream cable.2. Display Cable and3. Power Cable.One thing everyone needs to understand is - we all buy things keeping future in mind and also thinking that the things I can do with it. For. example I would order a monitor thinking that I would play  games on it but the real question is am I seriously going to play games or that's just one of the assumptions? Thought this monitor should work flawlessly on games too. It has beaten many monitors in 24 inch category heads down. The build quality is awesome too! I strongly recommend this monitor.
4,This monitor is for ones who is into editing and content creation stuff. It is a great panel with ips technology. 3 stars for gaming because of its 60hz refresh rate. But you can play all high end games with stupendous picture quality. Optimising with nvidia geforce experience it enhances the video quality of gameplay more.. Overall a great stuff and value for money product.
5,Overall a good product in this price range.I earlier thought that this monitor comes with USB 3.1 slot and a cable which can be used with my mac. But thats not true - USB cable support is to enable USB ports available in monitor only. - It cant be used to transmit display.My mac does not has display port so the display cable provided with this was of no use. I had to order a HDMI cable and a connector to be able to use this monitor.I wish monitor comes with HDMI cable in place of Display cable.
5,This is a great monitor if you’re working from home. I initially ordered the 21” of this male but it was too small. The 24” is the perfect size. It’s a slim monitor. It has multiple USB ports HDMI port (cable not included). I’ve had non problems so far - been using it a week. I use it for 8 hours a day and it’s working well. No glare on screen. Different modes to change screen (standard comfort view etc) No complaints. I brought an additional keyboard and mouse.
5,This is the best monitor I have worked on. The screen is really good and of perfect size for work purposes and also for gaming purposes.I only use for work purpose but I am sure it can also play games at good graphics.After using it for 1 month This is the best monitor screen to work. Planning to get one more.
4,Should provide Hdmi cable. It comes with different cables which all people will not be using
4,good monitor..:) dell is the best
3,Best part about this Monitor is its stand you can tilt it and rotate at any angle you want.Picture quality is not good. It says its IPS but looks like VGA panel. Text and colours are not sharp as expected. Feels blurry and after working for long hour it really takes it toll.I will give it 3 star as it really lacks behind in picture quality.
5,Good for watching videos and movies but text tends to get blurry because of the size in email Apps. I noticed this coming from a 2K Dell monitor only. But not a deal breaker.Button placement is below the screen which gives it a seamless look from the front.Has got enough connectivity options.
5,I searched and reviewed monitors for months before deciding for my home office. I am so happy that I picked this Dell to go with. I wanted a monitor with display ports nice quality screen mountable and didn't take up a ton of desk space. I was hesitant to get the 24 inches but Its more than enough!These monitors are perfect for working with excel spreadsheets. I also watch videos on it and the quality seems good.Highly recommend getting this!
4,P2419H is best in price range of 14K. It's look is super cool and picture quality is beyond I expected.  Overall I find it good. Soetime when I see flashing like stars but not sure why that would happen but it goes away in a minute or so. I prefer DP cable connection a d so far I am finding it good.
4,I am using this monitor from couple of days. I am a happy customer. Thanks to Dell and Amazon.I am giving 4 start rating but not 5 because I haven't got hdmi cable to connect with my mac laptop. Instead i got Display port cable which is of no use for me.So I was supposed to pay little more to purchase hdmi cable.
4,Really nice monitor.. Pivot stand also works well. Missing headphone.
4,Excellent picture quality and good product from Dell. Worth the money !!
3,The Monitor is good and only the monitor is good in every wayAll the wires/cables included in the box are useless they ship 16A power cable with huge 3 pin that doesn't fit the normal socket also HDMI cable is not includedI bought a 14k Monitor at home in the covid situation and still had to get out to buy further 500 rs cables just to make things work.All and all worthless customer experience but yes the monitor is good.
4,After a lot of research I bought this. But one thing I did not like is th calibration done. I connected to my Lenovo P52 and colors were dull intially. After exploring I found that we have to adjust nvidea the graphics card settings. Put RGB output to full. You will get correct colors. I'm satisfied with this. Only missing headphone jack bothers me.
5,Hey this monitor remind me of my office life believe me it's amazing slim and having antiglare screen you can code in it for long as your wish for debugging there is a plus point you can rotate the screen that's amazing. I highly recommend this product for you go for it 😉
5,Was hesitant before ordering because of price. But the features justifies the cost. Good quality display multiple ports including HDMI and Display port. It can connect to the usbs in the CPU. Received the monitor with 16A power cable. Seller promptly sent 10A power cable within 2 days.
4,Working fine. But unable to get full hd resolution when connected to my MacBook pro. When I switch to full hd resolution I get a black band to the left of the monitor. I am using apple's usb-c to vga adaptor. But when I connect the same usb-c adaptor to a windows laptop the monitor displays it in full resolution.
4,What can I say I love it!Its full HD - CheckThin Bezel - CheckExtra USB - CheckVesa Mount - CheckDisplay Port - CheckHeight adjustment - CheckAngle Adjustment - CheckFrecking 180 degrees rotation (heaven for coders)Ideal for daily tasks productivity multimedia and yes coding  and some light gaming (don't expect much as it 5ms response time
4,Good quality monitor. Been looking for a monitor for work related to graphics. Nice colours. Overall it's a good monitor and if you are looking for a monitor for graphics design and such just go for it(under Rs. 15k). I've paired it with Samsung SyncMaster B1930(the monitor on the left in the pics)
4,Product delivered  seems to be used one as there were no protective plastic cover on screen and it was not packed neatly. Also one of the four USB drive is not working. Everything else works fine. I am not returning it as I am in dire need of it and can’t wait for another week to get replacement.
5,I purchased it for my office work and it's optimum for the purpose it's for. Everything be it build and picture quality Dell Brand satisfaction or features all are upto the mark. The best part I like is USB upsteam with which I just need to switch 1 single cable from1 laptop to other for my wireless Mouse & keyboard to work on another laptop. Great thing and recommended Buy!!!
5,I really like this monitor... Previous I was using a 20inch Samsung monitor (1600x900 resolution) which had 92dpi. That's why I bought this monitor (It also has same dpi) instead of 22inch dell monitor. Pictures quality is very nice. Also the usb ports are very useful. Only drawback is it doesn't have any audio output... Other than that  👍️
5,If i could I would buy 3Compared to my old Samsung Monitor around same price Dell has really delivered a good product.Pros:+ Resolution and Picture Quality+ Brightness+ Color Vibrance+ Additional ports for better cable optimization+ Height and Angle adjustable stand (Much required feature that i never realised was that important)+ It looks awesomeCons:- None that i could think ofValue for money purchase
4,It's good. But It's not good vision readability in small text display is connected from Macbook pro.
5,Original product. Good packaging. Easy installation. Provided with DP cable only. Cable lengths appropriate. Height adjustable makes it flexible to use. Satisfied after using this product for 3 months. Only issue observed not related to product but with virtual desktop access during office work. If you invoke virtual machine on the montior screen and then shift back to laptop doesn't fit correct. We will have to re- lauch the application with resolution to fit correct on laptop screen. But I feel it's totally the application issue. But just a heads up for users.
5,This is by far the best monitor for the price. Other monitors might have all the jazzy features such as speaker output etc but this one is what exactly a monitor should be. Height and angle adjustments are superb. Base is heavy which is a good thing as it keeps the monitor stable. Price is slightly on the higher side but if you are looking for a good monitor for long term use then the extra bucks justify the price.
4,Good monitor to work from home. Has a autosleep mode and a few connectivity options. Looks good. Has height adjustment. Can be tilted sidewise. Matte finish.
5,Monitor is good. I didnt see any issue with the laptop. I have been using this monitor for last 1 month.I have good experience with this monitor so far.I use it for my office work (coding and documenting)sometimes I watch movies alsoSo far so good
4,I am disappointed with one thing that i can not mount on wall using vesa mount. I ordered vesa mount bracket but this monitor do not have slot for screw to fit.
5,Nice LED display. It has some features that really captivated me such as adjustable height rotation landscape or portrait. It comes with 3 years warranty that makes you feel safe for any future issues. Nice build quality. Make sure after purchasing you register at the dell website for the warranty. I don't use it for gaming that why I didn't rate it for gaming. I use it for programming and watch videos and it works awesome for that.
5,Purchased the monitor for general use and for coding....superb panel...the picture quality is amazing and so is the build by dell....the blacks are really good in this panel....overall it's a pretty good display.I got this one for 13999 which is the lowest I have seen it go and let me tell you that neither hp nor benq in this price range give such good color and well as such a sturdy build so I would suggest go for it
5,Amazing product for the price rangeGood :1. Has USB ports which can be used as extra ports. Note you will have to connect one USB cable for that which is provided in the box2. Perfect size3. Base is slim4. Perfect if you want to rotate it. Horizontal and vertical possible. Also up down motion possibleBad (can be neglected if you are not too picky)1. Plastic not metal2. Normal hdmi cable not provided in the box
5,This is first time that I've got an external monitor for work. Could've provided cables but not a big deal. Has 3 types of inputs. It also has 4 USB ports which comes really handy. Picture quality is great too. Plus the screen angle can be adjusted and rotated to any angle of convince. Product feels very sturdy.
4,Pros: Overall a good monitor.  Looks stylish.Cons: Little expensive.
5,I use this for my online classes and was looking for one which had least effect on my eyes was versatile with a adjustable stand and swivel function. This monitor checks all the boxes. Its quality us much better than any similar priced product.
5,Good screen stable stand - and the height is adjustable and can be rotated. Uses a large plug point in case that is of concern. Does not come with a HDMI cable -- which you will have to purchase separately.
4,I bought this Dell Monitor after my recently bought LG 24MP88HV 24 inch Monitor was accidentally broke. What I like about this Dell Model is you can freely adjust to any position you want 5 stars for that. but what i don't like is the quality of screen as compare to the previous LG monitor I had own. it doesn't mean this Dell monitor doesn't have good screen it's fabulous but my personal choice LG was a little better in terms of picture quality. Overall I am satisfied with this product.
4,Works as expected. A good monitor... is and does what it says on the website. I use it for working (so not able to give feedback on gaming.
5,Best of the best monitor under 15k price segment. Picture quality is top notch. Very thin bezels as mentioned.Very good monitor for professionals and also for photoshop and premiere pro.Coming to the stand of the monitor very ergonomic. If you buy a monitor make sure it has a stand like this one has. (Can rotate the screen upto 180° both clock and counter clockwise plus tilt and pivot)Overall completely satisfied with Dell P2419H.
4,Hdmi cable not givenInstead dp port connector given which is useless.Best part is vertical monitorOnce u use it then u will know how much it helps in reading browsing
5,I already had two Dell monitors but I soon realized the adjustable stand for height and rotation was something I needed. This is the most under rated feature helps in analyzing code and logs. Bought two these bad boys for INR 14k each. I'm OK with the 1080p resolution and the brightness is very workable for my work - although I always use the Night Light settings of Windows 10 given my long working hours in-front of the screen.
4,Very nice Matt finish display ..easy to adjust height and even rotation to vertical for reading document in portrait mode.Comes with usb and display port cable....my laptop does not had display port so need to buy hdmi..All in all perfect 24 inch monitor
5,Excellent monitor. I am buying one more. I can’t imagine there is a better one than this. The fact that you can change the angle of the monitor snd the fact that you can use this as a USB extension are huge advantages. Go get it! This is perhaps one of my best purchases from Amazon!!!
5,Got this monitor to allow my wife a radiologist to do medical reporting from home on her laptop. For complex CT and MRI scan images one needs a large anti-glare monitor with high resolution. This one has all of it. In addition the monitor comes with choice of display ports (HDMI DP..). It has 2 USB ports on side conveniently placed to allow and power any external devices. Picture quality is great and she is happy with the product.
5,Very pleased with this monitor. The size is a big improvement over my old 20inch Samsung monitor.It comes well packaged. Setup was very easy and plugged straight in. Settings on the monitor are easy to navigate and do make a difference to the overall effect.I love the tilt and height adjustment and the USB ports! Picture quality is noticeably sharp and a vast improvement for me. And the thin bezel looks fantastic.Great price as well.
5,I ordered it for WFH purpose using it for programming. I use it for long time like 10 hrs a day. And its really good "Comfort view" is very useful and eye friendly. Eye does not pain at all.Ergonomically good Able to adjust it upward-downward and can rotate clock wise also. Also can be converted vertically as well.Have purchased it in 13k seems to be good deal.Size is perfect for programming type of task.
5,Nice Product P2419H.I bought another one from dell only as i was impressed with picture quality.Customers do not go any where if product is good. No re-defining wheel
4,The picture quality of the monitor is really good and design is sleek elegant and just WoW !!!Must buy for people looking to extend work monitor into something bigger and beautiful. I have connected my Laptop with Alexa and this Monitor - which has enhanced the movie experience on the Monitor by 1000 times.
4,Too good as usual no comment from on fell.. but me bit unhappy as it’s mfg. at China
1,This display is the worst HD IPS monitor I have ever seen. when configured correctly (1080P @60hz) and the color profiles set correctly (output levels corrected & 2.2 gamma) the simply is blurry and dim and the image is full of random colored hot pixels to mimic gradients. it can't properly display color gradients and hot bright pixels are scattered around in a dark soup to mimic a proper color gradient. Switching to a HD tv an old VGA LCD monitor or a 9 year old iMac monitor looks great. This look like blurry mushy garbage.It's convex! CONVEX! the screen slightly bulges out in the middle about 3mm so the display never looks square. this is made worse by the slim bezel. They did this to increase this horrid panel's viewing angle on paper to trick you into think it is a good display when looking at the specs.This display is worse than any other IPS display I have ever used - it looks like a display panel from my 24 year old powerbook 1400c - yet blurrier.Save your eyes and avoid this garbage display. Even text in a word document looks horrible. This is a better boat anchor than display.
5,Great item.
5,Brought this for working from home. The display design are good. The portrait tilt feature is awesome.One difficulty I face and still face is that I need to change the brightness in morning and lower it during night use. There is no shortcut to store our custom brightness which is kind of pain to do it everyday.Apart from this there isn't any other issues which I faced.
5,Awesome product and delivery by Amazon .thanks a lot for tension free delivery and can't find any issues in this.For other buyers - service tag detail is in the back of the monitor and u cn use this to check dell warrenty period. I have checked it for my display and confirmed 3 years 2023 from dell site.i was worried abt this so sharing the info
5,I brought this monitor during sale it is a professional quality monitor for any one who spend a lot of time working on computer this is a good option best part is the stand can adjust as needed for an ergonomic posture. Picture is FHD so individual pixels can be seen at this screen size if you look closely but it is not a concern. Go for it
5,Everything is great about this Monitor for the price. Of course there is a higher model of it with USB-C connectivity which is brilliant but is lot to pay for that feature. I’m not sure about gaming as I don’t use it for that but overall WFH and split screen utility works fantastic!
4,Picture quality is good at this monitor. The height adjustable useful for useful for the users.This monitor is not suitable for the gaming.This monitor is used for programming
5,Loved the monitor.It's a Mat 1080P Full HD monitor. The picture quality is excellent. No light bleed at all. 250 nits peak brightness.The price is justified.The display panel is vivid. Wonderful experience for watching videos and movies.The major reason for me picking this monitor was the "stand". I am really impressed by the stand alone. Very few monitors have a stand that provides hight adjustment along with all directional movement.I usually prefer the monitor to be as low to tbe table as possible.I am extremely happy with the build quality of tbe monitor as well. The stand is all metal and feels sturdy.Happy with my purchase. I would surely recommend this.
3,The monitor is good. But the cables given with the monitor  are petty  useless.  The power  cable is with a 16A plug. It doesn't  fit into a standard power  outlet.  The requirement is only 1.5A. No idea why a standard 10 A cable wasn't  just given. Also no HDMI cable provided.In the end I had to use cable I already had for power and hdmi connection. If you don't  be prepared to buy them separately!
5,Antiglare is awesome picture clarity - I am able to see pixels and doesn't feel like IPS panel- may be due to big screen size.Height adjustment and tiltabilitty is a win.Mrp on box is :11671  mrp listed on website is 20k.I got this monitor at a great discount price of 12.8k.What a cheating
5,Previously i used dell s2415h then i sold that after 3 yr use and i was missing that too much. Now i bought P2419H model and its perfect for work from home Purpose. I read some reviews that some of people didnot received service tag. But i got a product with service tag and i verified it on dell website its genuine. Bought it in 11.5k including card discount.
3,I bought this monitor last month..I am facing very strange issue. Once I connect this monitor to my MacBook through HDMI cable electric current is flowing which causing electric shock/tingling in my laptop. Initially I thought it is a MAcBook issue but when I checked HDMI cable I found electric current is flowing though HDMI cable which is connected to monitor...I made a replacement request thinking the issue is with the product that I have ordered. But the product that I got after replacement has the same issue.  And Amazon Customer care is not helping to answer "The above explained issue persist with the product that I got or it persists with all the product of this model? " If later is true they should mentioned somewhere in product description.
4,Using this monitor for last two months. This is one of the best monitor for working from home and gaming.
4,Good for WFH purpose.. but no audio output means its use is very limited 😐😐
5,I am using this for a month as a secondary monitor. Good build and looks came packaged very well easy to install. Good picture quality. Height adjustable and can use in horizontal or vertical mode. The display can also swivel with the stand base remaining at the same position. I use it for about 10 hrs/day and great to watch 4K videos
4,Monitor looks superb as expected but antiglare 3h hard coating not working
5,i would say it's a best choice for those who want's vertical/portrait monitor under 15k or 200$ packaging :i was worried about it there was one cardboard and bubble wrap on dell package  so i would say should can use more bubble wrap but still i got my product working so no complaints
4,At this price range Dell should provide HDMI Cable.
3,I have purchased this in June-2019 for INR 13398/- so far it's going well. The only inconvenience I have faced is with plugging & unplugging the cables as the port are a bit hidden behind. Now I would suggest going for 4K if the budget permits. The seller is KIDA Retail Private Ltd.
5,Very clear picture quality and build quality. Best feature is height adjustment and 90 degree rotation to either side. Has display port hdmi and vga inputs. Also comes with a usb cable so that two usb ports on the side can be used for pen drive etc.DELL quality and performance are unmached.
4,I brought Samsung Monitor with 50% of more cost compare to Dell monitor. Samsung stopped working exactly 12 days after delivery. Finally  returned and brought Dell which is best in every aspect. have 6 USB ports DP HDMI DVI options. Product built quality also good.
5,Saviour of work from home.  Go for it.  I have been using it for six months it's really cool. I am not a gamer so I cannot comment on how it's working in gaming mode. But for sure one of the best monitor for work. I am seeing for more than 12 hours without much strain
5,Watching HD quality videos on youtube made me realize what I was missing the monitor is borderless and gives the impression of immersiveness.Worth buying this. I don't do much gaming but they worked fine. I sit in front of this monitor 14 hours a day so it is not glaring and have made some customization to the color settings of the screen.
4,Got the product well before the promised date . Love the monitor. Great for my office work . Helps greatly if you code . Not a PC Gamer so can't comment on that. Otherwise its great .  Love that you can turn and twist as you wish .
3,Happy with the monitor quality but having concern related to price (overpriced) and packaging.Not sure whose fault is this but got the damaged box and that too by the side of the display. Luckily just found a minor scratch on the display and it wasn't broken.
4,I was not expecting so much from this monitor but got surprised by value for money.I got this at 11K approx in sale. I used it with macbook pro 15 inch. Downside is hdmi cable is not included.
5,The display is good and it makes it easy for doing work form home. It is a value for money product. The viewing angle is also good. Display is clear when viewing from sides also.
3,If this would have the opiton of returning I would have bought 22 inch.Lesser starts for Amzaon policy of non returning a 16 thousand product. Not a good service from AMAZON.
4,It is as described and does the job fine
5,Amazing colour accuracy out of the box. Kept up with my MacBook Pro retina  yes the resolution is just 1080p but its more than enough for 24 inches . Great purchase for my programming and content viewing needs. The height tilt and pivot adjustments are really the icing on the cake . Just Buy this you will love it .Easy Installation and design is flawless and elegant.
5,I love this monitor! I loved it so much I bought two they're borderlands so you see everything! So clean and sleek and the bevel to turn the monitor to have it landscape or portrait is a great feature. Haven't noticed any frame drop when running even triple A games.
4,Value for money . The only thing missing in this Monitor is the inbuilt speaker . The colours are crisp . Viewing angles at its best . Easily the best monitor available at this price range . I had a look at other competitive brands before zeroing in this one . Go for it with your eyes closed . Easy to assemble  comes with instructions and we get warranty for this . Worth every penny
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Amazing experiance.. No bezzels on top and sides. Very good for professional use. 2 USB type A v3.1 ports on sides 2 USB type A v2.x ports on back 1 HDMI 1 Display Port 1 VGA port 1 USB type B v3.1. What else you need?Only drawback is no 3.5mm audio jack neither input nor output Bcoz monitor doesn't have speaker.
4,works like a charmOnly thing was no HDMI cables shipped that was a big bummer. It costs hardly 3-4USD it could have made customer's life so easy to hook it to a mac or Dell latitude with hdml interface.
5,+ Display is good. I connected to MacBook Air and did RDC to Windows machine too.+ The screen can be adjusted to view it vertical- thats a great plus.+ The ComfortView preset mode really makes it gentle on eye when working for long durations though obviously because it filters out blue colors you'll miss bright colors in this setting.- HDMI cable and Built-in audio would have made it a great package overall.
3,Monitor came with 16amp plug but the standard socket in India is of 6amp. There is no need of 16amp plug because all the other similar monitors work perfectly fine with 6amp plug. So I have to buy 6amp plug separately? Please mention in the product description and HIGHLIGHT that part.
4,I am using it from last 1 week. Your eyes won't get strain and also u need to adjust the display enjoy it :) This is best product from dell. I highly recommend buy this product from trusted seller
4,Completely Satisfied but would be more happy if they could provide hdmi cable instead of Dp cable.Also suggestion from myside since this monitor doesn't contain speaker provide some suggestion on how to connect speaker
5,Power cable is not working properly. Need to adjust multiple times due to loose connection. I had to replace the Power cable. Monitor is very good and with good resolution. 5 ⭐
5,This monitar is very good at this price for working or gaming..disply color is really good...
3,Good display for the priceLove the flexibility to move screen anywhere.No HDR Support (Not great for Media Consumption)Dell Display Manager Software is not available for Mac (Brightness or Mode Settings needs to be set by pressing buttons in the display)
5,The monitor is really awesome. But important thing. Download dell display manager . It's also support other important features as well. Like dividing the monitor  into multiple screen it's self. For using the vertical feature please 1st select the display selecting > display> display orientation. Overall this dell product is really nice and value of money
3,Monitor doesnt start when there is a power fluctuation we need to manually unplug the cable and then plug again to get the monitor working....this is really a big mess considering we are busy in webex calls and screen sharing etc...DELL disappoints...
5,I have been using it for a month now. The monitor serves its purpose well and looks premium. 3-yr warranty is a good feature. Only thing i disliked is that they don’t give hdmi cable along which should be standard in these times. They give 2 another cables which i am not sure where to use.
5,Dell Makes really good monitor at all price points. The build quality is good. Bought it for work from home set up because of prolonged work from home due to coronavirus. It has adjustable height option to others at home can adjust based on the their height. Overall good monitor. It has 2 usb ports one HDMI  one vga and one display port. No audio out though.
4,It's really an awesome product
3,Good monitor but required cables like hdmi is missing. Also the power cable is very big and it  initiates another additional purchase.If it can work with 6A or 10A adapter then what is point in giving 15A.
4,Good one
4,An option to choose HDMI to HDMI or Display port cable would be a better option. My laptop connects with HDMI cable but I got a Display port cable which is not useful for me.
5,It is a must-have monitor for office work. The display is tuned for text-heavy work and the additionAL USB PORTs are a major plus. You can connect multiple devices to the monitor instead of connecting to a laptop or desktop.
4,Good for office wfh use.
5,Love this monitor I am a developer and this monitor is good for development. I am using this as an external display Works good.---- Issues but not a problem.- We have to rotate UI from OS for adjust in vertical display- Found issue with dell wireless keyboard & mouse. Usb dongle not working properly with back 2 USBs. But works fine with Wired mouse. For that I have to return my Wireless dell Keyboard & mouse. And bought Amazonbasics keyboard mouse which are also good for speed typing.
5,It's expensive compared to other monitors in this price range also its just FullHD but that's how much I am ever going to use for Reading and Writing in 24inch screen.I love the height angle and rotation adjustments it offers. also the edges are bezel less. Impressive.For the the price its the best Dell professional monitor I could find for Development. Love It!!
5,This is a perfect sized monitor specially if you have a Mac. There are extra USB ports within the monitor which you can use to plugin other devices. Picture quality is great & has good amount of brightness.PS: Does not come with an HDMI buy one separately. Use USB-C to USB A convertor for using the USB ports on the monitor
4,使用スペースに対して画面は大きく、使いやすかったです。1月なのでまだ不具合も起きてないです。画質もコスパも良く、仕事用に重宝しています。取り立てて感動はしなかったので☆4にしました。
5,It is very good monitor for general daily work for watching videos coding office work movies. I have not faced any issues. Note that you need to purchase separate HDMI cable for this. Colours and quality is clear.I have not tried it for gaming so I can't provide feedback on that but it should work well for gaming as well.
4,Best Monitor for office work and normal work but for gaming go for 120 Hz panel not for this.This monitor also have dedicated Speakers.
4,Best budget choice for wfh.
5,Perfect For Professional Work. Looks wise it wins heart at first sight. Performance is extraordinary. Bezz are thin. Tried playing a full HD /4K video result? Perfect! If you are looking under 15k Monitor go cart it. This will cover your professional work as well as entertain you on your weekends. FINALLY ITS DELL AND YOU KNOW IT BETTER.
4,A bit upset as the main seal on the box was already cut and VGA cable was missing. Other wise the rest of the product looks untouched. Video quality is also nice
5,Great performance Nice Picture quality
5,Will instantly double your productivity. The stand it comes with will allow you to set it up at any angle and height (even vertical!). For gaming look for other options but for productivity don't give it a second thought!
4,Monitor does what it is intended to. Picture quality is average and if you have a glaring background then it is difficult. Screen modes are amazing. Flickr is there sometimes and adjustment levels are top notch.Definitely recommend
5,Excellent full HD monitor. The height is adjustable to a great extent and can be tilted backward and forward. The monitor makes possible cable management easy. It comes with two USB 2 ports and two USB 3 ports. Even the power hungry external hard disks run smoothly with all the ports. It also comes with a display port cable and USB cable. HDMI cable is not available. I used Amazon Basics HDMI cable to connect my PC to the monitor. The packing was good and all the items in the package came intact.
5,Preis / Leistung stimmt.Aufbau war sehr einfach sowie danach die Bedienung.Die Bildqualität ist klar und scharf.Lieferung per DHL wie immer top.
3,While watching YouTube video lags sometimes because of low frame rate and colors are not bright enough...it is good for general purpose only like surfing web page and also for static content.
4,2台を同時購入したが、色調が違いすぎ。もう少し近いと嬉しい。
5,Great product perfect for use as a monitor in a home office. Height is full adjustable which is great and not standard on a lot of screens. Delivery was quick and easy and product was as described with all pieces and cables etc. Install was also super quick. Would definitely recommend this product and supplier.
3,I bought this monitor 3 months ago and was absolutely happy with quality etc. One day I open my laptop and the monitors doesn't see it. It stopped seeing and signal from any computer in my house - macbooks windows desktop etc. Checked the cables and the ports with another monitor - all works 100%. The monitor just died. Before you buy it - just google "DELL P2419H no signal" - it's a major problem very often case. Not it goes to the bin and I'm ordering something not from DELL....
5,Superb quality!
4,While checking 4k or high res images in full screen shows some pixelation for standard medium res work this is fantastic.got this since wanted to do a wall mount.
3,Not so sturdyClarity and Brighteness is good.No good for reading documents.Always does not connect in one go.
5,I bought this for coding mainly and when I connected the script was all blurry and hard to read. I had to update my laptop's display driver coz of windows' bad dpi adjustment. Now my display looks crisp and you may have you tweak the colors of the monitor a little as the factory settings were too warm for me
5,I use this for my daily job for programming. It has enough width to see my full lines of code in my IDE. Not sure about gaming though. Its easy on the eyes. Sturdy stand with enough height adjustable and tilt. Can also make it vertical which is excellent for debugging logs. Highly recommended for programmers.
5,1. Stand - for adjusting and tilt2. Monitor clarity3. Download the software from dell website so that you can operate the monitor from the PC.4. HDMI cable needs to be bought separately5. Go to Dell website and check warranty - it comes with 3 year warranty
4,works well for WFH landscape and portrait.
4,I bought it for PS4 gaming and it's absolutely fine what I can say is a mid range monitor that satisfies your needs. Value for money. It doesn't has a backlight bleed issue.
5,I bought is in 12200 Rs...Excellent Monitor for Photo EditingPerfect in SizeNice Colors Britness and Contrast is goodUser friendly Menu Options in frontAngle of Veiw is goodAnti Glair is also very fineOnly one thing is missing that is VGA Cable
4,Nice and productive monitor fir reading article in vertical position not good very thin probably its great for us8in normal position.
5,The product is good and sleek. Display is sharp brightness can be adjusted. Dell has always been good. The monitor is height adjustable tilt adjust and left right adjustable. You also get a DisplayPort and USB 3.0 upstream cable along with the monitor. Assembling is very simple. Liked the product.
5,Alles ok
4,Good as per price clarity could be better for coding
5,Overall good productThe pixel density is not great. So image quality will not be to the fullest.Very easy in adjusting the height and tilt with one hand. But it's a must to use both hands for swivel (rotating the screen on its base). Felt it was a bit heavier than expected though it didn't pose any problem. USB hub works just fine.I'm greatly satisfied with the product. I've been using it for programming browsing and occasional movies.
4,在宅勤務
3,Colors on this monitor are Ok but looks little washed out. It's only suited for work like coding and web browsing(weird blurry effect if scrolled quickly through web page). Peak brightness is also on the weaker side. Not good in brightly lit room.For movies and casual gaming it's not good. No speakers no audio out port.Even though it's a 60Hz monitor 60fps gaming is not possible even with the not so graphics intensive games.The only good thing which I think is the adjustment options. Height tilt pivot swivel.I'm returning it as it does not fulfill my requirements and I'm kind of disappointed. Will look for other options on Amazon.
5,Best in range
4,No hdmi cable included.. otherwise I will rate 5
4,good monitor in this price range. HDMI cable is not provided with this monitor you need to buy separately.
5,I bought this monitor a few days ago. Setup is really easy. It took 2min and you don’t need any tool. Adjustable height feature is amazing. Only one think if you want to use with hdmi you need to buy hdmi cable or use  if you have one. Hdmi cable not included pack.
5,Iam using it with Mac this solves the purpose of a good monitor with USB hub. The quality is good for work movies. Not so good for gaming. Ergonomics is good. For the price point it is very good.
4,guys the cable is a new type of hdmi which won't connect you'll have to purchase a hdmi cable separately or a VGA cable for ur use
5,As Apple stopped Anti-aliasing for HDMI output of ** macbook pro 16 inch ** this monitor is not recommended.I tried with Manjaro KDE it was awsome.Build quality is awsome. You can move screen in all three axis.You can assemble/disassemble monitor in less than a minute.
5,Value for money. Can buy this product without thinking twice. Using this product everyday with out any issues for the last 1 month. Rcvd in very good packing from Amazon.
4,Quality
4,Best for work from home and I got it at best price. Packing and delivery was neatly and I could assemble it myself with minimum efforts.
5,The display is absolutely magnificent. It has a sleek design with thin bezels and a matte black stealth look. The feature which I found most useful was it's portrait mode and height adjustability. Now I can even read books and view other content on my computer. This feature is present almost exclusively in Dell Monitors of this range.
5,Screen came perfectly intact!
4,コロナ禍が当初より長引いたため仕事用に購入。使用して1年経過しましたが、特に問題なく使用できています。画面も大きくて見やすいです。
5,Great relief for my eyes after straining for months using a laptop. The screen is just the right size for a desk top and has a sleek design besides having everything you could ask for in a work monitor.
4,Best monitor. Using it from 3 months now. No issues.
5,Works as described.Thin edges allow for multiple screens to be used without large breaks in between them.TheThe multiple connections allow for USB devices to be used with the need to run multiple cables back to your device.The multiple video inputs also allow for switch between multiple devices easily
4,I don't want that anti glare. Thats the only issue for me..
5,Excellent screen for the money.  Used for extension from laptop and exactly what is needed for home office.
4,only got it today but so far so good one point which is annoying is it does not full lock vertically it slight leans to one side which kicks in the ocd abit
5,Stunning infinity display at a reasonable price. The monitor works perfectly well with my Dell XPS. The USB ports are an added bonus. It compliments perfectly with the Amazon basic vesa monitor mount. It has a comfortable view option making it ideal for the eyes. Higly recommended for those wanting to upgrade their working desk at a budget price.
5,Excellent for work from home. Accurate colour reproduction and anti glare.For making this as usb hub connect laptop with usb A to usb 3.0 B on monitor(cable provided in box) and you are done. After this all 4 usb ports on monitor can be used for laptop.
4,Everything looks good except the 16A plug that it comes with.
5,Its an awesome display. If you pay for diamond you get diamond. If you pay for peanuts you get monkeys. Its an investment though its costly. It encourages you to be productive since you spent 15k on monitor. :)Picture quality is just fabulous display is sleek!! Loved the purchase.
5,Bought two of these for working from home. Have been using for 2 months so far no complaints. For the price they are very good monitors especially if you want to have dual screen setup with 2 of these.I use them for gaming and office work
4,The unboxing was a good experience and from the looks and feel it does look premium. I am hoping to have a good experience with my photos and video editing projects. Maybe i can review them on that regard later.
5,Like
5,Been using it as a 2nd monitor connected to my laptop that runs Linux (Ubuntu). Works flawlessly -- plug and play.I've tried using both VGA and HDMI cables and both of them work fine in Linux. (Note that the cables weren't included and I had to purchase them separately).
3,The two cables provided are useless for someone with only HDMI connectivity. Product is ok but i had to purchase another cable for connectivity. All previous customers are complaining this but it seems manufacturer is not interested. Adding INR 150 cable would have saved a lot of hassle specially when you are paying 13k.
4,Picture and over build quality are awesome. It is the best monitor for who do coding a lot. Only drawback is Audio output which is missing. So you can’t use Chromecast in this monitor.
5,Awesome as expectedPros1 Thin bezel2 multiple ports hdmi dp3 Four usb sockets 3.04 Height adjustment5 rotating base6 360 display7 usb 3.0 cable included in box8 Three year warranty
5,I bought the P2419H 24 inch Dell monitor for my home office. I do programming for long hours and this monitor is perfect for the job. Amazon gave excellent value for money.Note: You need to buy HDMI cable separately since the monitor does not come with it in case you are planning to connect to your laptop via HDMI.
4,Good for coding in a medium font but not good for reading text as there is no sharpness in text you can easily pick the pixcel from text. Special at corners and round text
4,長年使用している割と高級なモニターと同様に良いモニターです。
5,Amazing monitor. Has made my work so much more efficient and convenient.
5,Bought the monitor as I would be WFH. Monitor brightness and picture quality is good. I am using MAC book pro and have to buy an DP Mini cable to connect my MAC laptop to monitor.It woud be helpful if you list and show the accesseries image that would be delivered with the monitor.
4,Good quality monitor.
4,It is ok for daily office use
4,Doesn't comes with HDMI cables.
5,The monitor is just awesome.Delivery packaging was great!Delivered before time!The monitor was working perfectly fine! No issues with pixels and all.Just increase the sharpness if you're gonna use it from near you.Just go for it!
5,A brilliant product from Dell.Clarity build style - everything is top notch.Special mention for the monitor stand. It lets you move the monitor in a wide range of angles.It is priced above its peers from Samsung & LG.But it is well worth the price you pay for.
5,Value for money.The best monitor for programming and photo editing and video editing.All professional use of office work.
4,I am using this monitor for WFH overall result is ok. Disappointed because there was no HDMI cable supplied with monitor. Two cables delivered along are of no use.
3,The screen and everything else is very good.But there is a flaw in the buttons (in the picture). The pressing feels a lot different between the buttons.Maybe it is not perfectly assembled.
5,Ordered 2 monitors for my home setup.  Both work excellent. Clarity and Pivot option are excellent
4,Good one. Only problem that I am facing refresh is slow  lines appear in screen while moving applications across screens.
5,Excellent picture quality. Good for work and watching videosUSB 3.0 port on the side is very fast and usefulLooks very nice and Easy setup.Only problem I'm finding is the Dell's software (Dell Display Manager) to calibrate the monitor is very lean on features - Cannot tweak many parameters like saturation Blue reduction response time etc instead we have to use the hardware buttons to set these parameters.
5,Awesome monitor for work and consuming media. Perfect screen size. Excellent build quality. Has height adjust tilt adjust and swivel adjust. Sharp image (24 inch perfect for 1080p monitor).Comes with display port cable (no hdmi cable)Also comes with type B usb pass-through cable for connecting keyboard and mouse to monitor.
4,Very happy with this purchase the only negative being there is no VGA cable in the box. Only a HDMI but overall a very nice monitor.
4,It's a great monitor with a good quality and nicely adjustable. Only small problem is that it does not come with a hdmi cable.
4,Very nice
5,I purchased it a couple of months ago and I waited before writing this review. It's really really good for the price. I'm a software developer and for people like myself it's a boon since it can swivel 90 degrees and go to portrait mode which is the best for coding.
4,Good oneusing from 15days ..no issues...got it for 11.75k in a sale
5,This Dell monitor has high build quality and useful features such as USB ports and portrait mode.Pixel density is not very high and refresh rate is acceptable. Not well suited for high response gaming use-cases.HDMI/VGA connectors not included in the box so watch out for that.
5,Amazing product super High quality. I've bought it 1 month ago and it's fantastic.
4,Nice product
3,While the monitor is good but the power cable is loose and does not fit fast to the monitor. Because of that with little shake of the cable the power goes off. Please consider replacing the power cable of good brand. This cable is made in China.
5,After using one month i am writing the review. it is nice product. Monitor display is good. I purchased this product for work from home purpose.  It serves both gaming and office work. It comes with power cable and HDMI cable
5,I bought this one as extended desktop. I am very glad that I bought this monitor. Have been connecting to my Mac it has been good so far. The best part is easy installation adjustable height as well as tilt.
5,Excellent product in this price range.
3,I have ordered Dell P2419H monitor and received it on time but it has one dead(dark) pixel on top right corner. So I have placed replacement order however the replacement order is also having one dead pixel on left middle corner. I am worried with this monitor too. I am planning to return it instead of facing any issue in future.Other than a dead pixel issue picture quality is good. I have played 4K videos also and looks great in video clarity. There is no lag while playing video.
5,I used the monitor for like 3-4 month's now  it's awesome I loved the picture quality and colours  if ur unsure to buy or not do buy it dell never let's u down
5,Writing this after using for a month! Good picture quality!
5,Good size delivered in good package and yet to use to write a review
4,It is very good for the priceI am also using U series Dell 24 inch.The pi icterus sharpness is better
5,Really great quality and my son is delighted with the gaming level graphics.
5,repons parfaitement a une utilisation quotidienbon rapport qualité / prixpermet de connecter plusieur produits via l'ecran
3,Bought it 3 three times from amazon...2 times it wasn't even powering ON. Last one i got has screen damage (image).Crappy product & crappy delivery
5,I'm very happy with the picture quality and 1080p resolution in this 24inch monitor.I got this for 11.2k in a festive offer and it's worth every penny. Sharpness is very good. I see no downside for this monitor at this price.
5,If you are someone who is working from home during these Covid times and value productivity then this monitor is for you.Absolutely love the monitor and it has enabled me to be more productive at work and was within a budget of 14K.
5,I liked the picture quality and added USB and VGI ports. Its an awesome purchase. Happy with the product.
5,Have used these before and are great only just received and set up so far great. Fast delivery well packaged and easy to set up.  Communication great.  Delivery left at office entrance not to myself is the only issue but definitely recommend the item. thank you
5,After 1 day of use..... I think this monitor is one of the best monitor....... With Good pictures Quality and Color output. And I hope that same performance I will expect in future also.....
5,The picture quality and refresh rate are great for general purpose use and more specific uses like gaming or video editing. It doesn't take up too much space and additional storage drives can be connected directly to the monitor. Best value dell monitor by far on the market
5,Excellent quality of picture with rotation tilting & height adjustment facility. It has two USB ports left side of the monitor. The cable to activate the monitor USB ports are provided.It came with power cable & two other connecting cables.I purchased it for Rs. 14700/- Amazon. Very fast delivery.
5,Monitor is delivered on time with great packaging thanks to seller monitor display clarity is awesome just buy itease of navigation height adjustment is super and best class of monitor in this price range dell is dell best fit for office and home use.!Without any doubt go fo it!
5,In short.. Amazing service and amazing quality..
5,This product has high resolution and very good clearity I am using it for 12hr per day and have not faced any issue with this monitor.
5,Great monitor perfect for gaming nice size great picture only flaw no speakers but otherwise nice feature of being able to turn the monitor so its portrait and hight adjustment very pleased with it ideal for smaller spaces.
5,Very good product. This prize for these many features with respect to screen adjustments is really good.If you are considering buying monitor this is a good value for money product.
5,The improvement in screen sharpness and clarity compared to my previous Dell screen it replaced was bordering on epic. I haven't used it for high end gaming so can't rate that.
5,Nice picture quality and anti-glare screen. I like the adjustment and orientation flexibility. You can use it in any orientation like landscape or portrait.
4,It should come with HDMI cable. Two cables are provided which are useless.The product is good.
5,If you are working from home and don't have a monitor I strongly suggest you to opt for this. It is very good display is very good connectivity is fine.But there are no in built speakers and height adjustment is absent as well.
5,From 2 weeks i am using and I would like to say that Dell has a great quality monitor really its just awesome monitor have seen ever and also for working or playing games or watching movies really hatsoff to the dell superb quality. Blindly you can buy the product. Thanks alot amazon and dell.
4,optiflex390+E2011Hを譲ってもらったので、HDDをSSDに入れ替え、メモリーを８MBに増設したら、web閲覧や文書作成など問題なく快適に使えました。私の使い方ならこのパソコンはまだまだ使えそうだったので、モニターを買い変えることにしました。これまでiMac2011（２７インチ）を使用してたのですが、画面が大きすぎたので、手ごろなサイズのモニターを探しているときにこのモニターを行きつきました。製品そのものには大変満足しています。ただリサイクル対象製品ではないので、廃棄時にリサイクル料がかかるところが★を一つに減らした要因です。
5,Great monitor. Using it to work from home at the moment. Colours are a great and adjustable the height can be adjusted and it can be tilted as well. Enough ports for access I have mainly used the HDMI and I have had no issues.
5,I bought this for my home office. I'll use it for work but also to watch movies on weekends. It's sturdy hight adjustable (important!) and large enough for me. It does everything I want it to do. I wish they did another colours like white.
5,It is a really good and big screen you can easily split it into two and multitask. Plastic quality is though not that good I feel but still this Monitor is good. And love all its tilts and other movements. I feel its really worth the money.
4,Great but no wifi and other important features are Missing and china made
5,This product is worth paying the money only because of its stand.Rest all features are good for the price. Value for money
5,Portrait mode requires firmware upgrade doesn't work with a Mac.Colours are not accurate but not over saturated and are original. Adequate.
5,Excellent product so far. Bought it a few days ago. Perfectly does the job for a home office. Will have to wait for the long term durability to comment further. But for now it's an awesome product
2,This is the second time I'm ordering this piece. I returned the first one when the left side (1/4th  of the screen) has different tint than the right side and looks like the 2nd also suffers from the same problem.Seems like the anti glare coating is not uniform.Has backlight bleeding for the bottom right corner which can be noticed even with good lighting.If you ask that why I went with the same model again then I would say that only alternative in this segment was Benq GW2480 and I was skeptical about Benq's post sales service so I didn't go for it.I am not able post pictures as camera automatically focuses more on the center so I can't capture the brightness difference properly.I am going to keep it as I am tired of return/replacement.If people have better budget then I request them to go with WXGA or 2K resolution monitors...
5,Great screen. Bought a second to replace an older screen. The ability to shift to vertical is great with dual screens keeping one as a work screen and the other as the email messaging screen. Excellent value and crisp imaging.
5,Beautiful display small bezels and perfect for everything even at gaming at 60hz 1080p.Highly recommend for a desktop or as an external laptop monitor (which i used it so).
4,The product is best for office  convertible and good for office. Not for gaming
5,Das Gerät kam pünktlich war gut verpackt und enthielt alles Zubehör wie beschrieben. Der Aufbau war einfach. Der Monitor arbeitete sofort mit meinem Computer zusammen. Ich bin sehr zufrieden.
5,So good I bought two easy to put together no tools needed ! Takes 5 mins comes with a display port cable which is useful!! Height adjustment as much as you could want ! Very clear and crisp picture
5,Good Picture Quality Most of Ports are covered (VGA Display USB-3). Easy fitting Easily Height change. Screen content clearly visible High Light room and Under the direct Sun.
5,Amazing product by Dell best picture quality with and anti-glare to protect over flashing..
5,Perfect monitor for working from home great size excellent readability plug n play. The only downside is that the blacks are more grey than black. Apart from that it has a sturdy base and it looks elegant. Lots of adjustments too.
3,There are a few dead pixels here and there. The service center is acknowledging their existence but say they are too small and I should just ignore them.
3,Great size and clear screen! Wire connection can lose connection and have to take time fiddling to re gain connection
3,The power cord to the monitor is too big to fit into a regular power point
5,Awesome monitor for designers and media working persons not suitable for gamers
5,Great monitor with matt finish 360 adjustment. I have picked this over benq 29”. I made a best decision
3,This product doesn't perform as premium as it looks. You can find better monitor for the price. Picture quality is really dull to a point where you can see the pixels on the screen. Design wise it's the best in the market for the price range but the picture quality is bad. I've used other dell monitors which were really good but this one disappointed me.
4,Good product in this price range. Bought it for office use and some entertainment stuff. It works well.
5,Fully satisfied.3 way adjustable - Height  Tilt and Turn.Nice professional look.  Thin bezel.Good picture and easy settings. Easily accessible physical buttons.2 Cables included (Not HDMI but newer versions)
5,Completely satisfied with the monitor after using it for some months now. Overall recommend this for anyone looking to get a good monitor for home office setup.
5,Reviewing after exactly one year of everyday usage. No complains whatsoever. Easily adjustable both vertically and horizontally. No connectivity issues. Display good as new even today. Adequate display settings available to adjust the colors contrast and brightness.
1,I bought a pair of these as the description mentions VESA support. On opening one of the boxes however there is nothing obvious for a VESA mount. So I tried Dell's customer services. After going through the computerised system I got through to the wrong department; apparently this is in an Indian call centre where they still use tin cans connected by string. I was then put through to another tin can where the woman I spoke to said she understood the problem. Then she wanted a photo of the monitor to see if it was OK and to check what the problem was. At which point I thanked her and said that as I had bought it from Amazon I would return the two monitors and buy a pair from one of Dell's competitors. I also posted a question on Dell's website. I got a reply this morning: "Our staff has read your question and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines. Thanks for sharing and we hope to publish next time!" Gee thanks Dell. I shan't be buying from you again.
5,product quality is great. may sound costly but suitable for wfh office setup. hight and rotation adjustable. these flexibilty adds lots of value
5,Nice Screen.. Worked ion this around 8 years ago and always wanted to buy one. now gonna buy one more. movies are clear and almost all games are good on the screen.Light Weight but strong built. Only backdrop is that it does not come with a HDMI or VGA cable.Display Cable and Power cable are included along with USB Hub cable.Over all Good Value for money.
4,I am using this for programming purpose. main thing is this display doesnot having any VGA and HDMI cable i have to bought it from shop. so please provide cable with this.
3,What would otherwise be a perfectly good not too expensive monitor is ruined by a single dead pixel right in the middle of the screen. Its only one but it's painfully noticeable when the screen is dark.Such a shame
5,Picture quality is really good really good monitor in this range.
5,Product is excellent quality.
4,Great monitor for the price. Definitely recommend
4,Using it for my MacBook Pro 13’’ retina 2014 model works great and value for money product..highly recommended for its vertical rotation.
4,Another 2-4 cm of further height adjustment would be good to improve eyeline to screen.
4,Haven't got hdmi in the box. Quality is good and picture is clear. A bit lag with usb upstream but overall a good purchase
5,I was hesitating to purchase the monitor online but went after it. And I am happy to say that it is a very good monitor which will serve your purpose. Go for it.
4,Excellent monitor but do have done bleeding issue on corner...Replaced one time but same issue... It's what you will get in this price...If you want more better quality you need to go for premium range...
4,Seems a good quality - able to set 2 documents side by side
5,Super clear display easy to set up sturdy and flexible monitor mount.
4,Monitor is good you need to buy HDMI cable.
4,Nice monitor but it doesn't come with an HDMI cable. Luckily we had some spares.
5,Wonderful product. Best picture quality.
5,Bought two of these for my home office setup.  Really good screens with a great bright image.  Good price point for these quality monitors too.
4,多くの機種を実物で比較していないので、とくに画質について詳細にこだわったコメントはできません。テレワークが増え、会社から持ち帰ったノートPCでは特にオンライン会議中の資料が小さくなりすぎで見づらいので仕事の効率アップのため、大画面であまり部屋を圧迫しないデザインで、でも個人で買うなら少しはギミックが効いてて（今回は縦型使用が可能なところ）、かつ値段が手頃で悪い評判が少ないものという条件で選びました。まず一般的なビジネス用途においてはなんら不満はありません。デザインは好き好きですが台座に至るまでスクエアでスッキリとしたデザインだと思います。また、画面角度、高さの調整のしやすさについては動きに質感もありいいと思います。実際の設置においてはカタログ写真の支柱にある丸穴にケーブル類を通して設置にすることが勧められています。その方がケーブルの纏まりという点や、画面の角度を変えた時にもスムーズにケーブルが追ってきます。ただし縦型にした時にはかなりケーブルが引っ張られるのでその余裕を見ておく方がいいです。ほぼ横向きで使う前提で設置していますが、プログラミングや資料を読む時には縦型になると便利だな思って購入しました。ただ、縦型にするときには大きくケーブルが動くので、このケーブルと取り回しがやや面倒であまり、頻繁に縦横切り替えて使用するということはありません。USBの分配が裏面に二口、左側面に二口ありこれがなかなか便利です。ただし、ディスプレイの電源を入れていないと動作しませんのでノートPCを接続していたり、画面は消しながらUSBを使いたいと思っている方は注意が必要です（ひょっとしたら内部設定で変えられるのかもしれませんが未確認です）。不満な点はスピーカーが付いていないところでしょうか。やや、値段が高いというのもありますが、ある程度長く使うものですし、コメント欄で悪い評判が少なく、デザインはや機能性からもコストパフォーマンスは許容できる範囲だと思います。あえていえば、白色の選択肢が有ればよかったかなと思います。ただ、電源を落とせば画面は黒いですし、台座は黒調とはいえスリムで艶消しの金属質で目立たないため、これもまあ許容範囲です。あとは寿命次第ですが、現時点では、総じて買ってよかったと思っています。
5,This is amazing products using this for more than 2 months it's brilliant
3,5/5 on ergonomics3/5 on picture quality2/5 on USB port longitivity5/5 availibiliy of connections2/5 for gaming and Movies watching experienceNo blackbleeding on screenReading is also SO SO.May be okay for Business usage only.
5,Good product it comes with 2 spare cable which probably you won't need it I would request DELL to add HDMI cable instead of other two.
4,Good one
4,Good monitor. No audio output is a major drawback for this monitor otherwise good one.
5,Simplistic model with right kind of features for a monitor. Picture quality is good. But the packaging can I have an explanation why the original dell packaging seal is cut open? Is it a returned piece?
5,Excellent 👌
3,Hi Team I have a different issue. My laptop was working fine this days i got it on 24th may and opened on 29th may. Now my ond moving this neck of the desktop the screen goes off ...because the wire attached to socket and desktop is loose. Is there any chance to get the wire replaced
5,I like the product and it works perfectly. Just go for it.
5,I am very happy with the purchase. Works as expected no issues.I would recommend people to buy this monitor.
5,Purchased two to extend my screen real estate. Fabulous monitors picture is sharp and consistent across both screens and the thin bezel looks really smart. The quality is superb for the price.
5,Totally satisfied with the product and worth the money .
4,Product is perfect as given details. And also display working well in sun light.
4,Good display worth for money. Could have additional HDMI port and bit difficult to plug in and out.
5,I bought this monitor 3 days ago and it has been delivered today almost used this display for 12 hours and the colour reproduction is top notch. Really Happy with this purchase.
5,Good product! Satisfied!
5,I purchased a couple of them to use with a Dell hub. It was easy to set them up and plug them to the Dell hub. The quality of the screens is great!
5,Good product. It took time while connecting first time. However later it worked flawlessly. I mostly used it for reading and satisfaction with performance yet.
5,Have been using it for over a month now . It's user-friendly and it's workability too good.
4,It's good in quality and the delivery was done with no damage to the packaging or the product itself.Thanks
3,The Product comes with 16A power cable and this info is not present in product description same monitor i bought 1 year ago and it had 10A power cable.why would a monitor require 16A power cable! and why is that info missing?
5,The monitor is great. Bezels are minimal. Looks sleek. Extends USB3.0 that's great too. Keep in mind that it ships with a dvi cable. If you need hdmi get your own. Anti glare is good too.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Iam in love with this monitor.. Awesome clarity without any dealy.. Guys go for it without any hesitation.. Almost 2months over..I didn't face any issue with this dell monitor..🔥Best for all type of use.
4,DELLのモニター気に入っており3台目ですが通常視聴ならなんの問題も無いです。
5,The screen is of good in size and very clear pixel.
5,Been using it for 2 months now and secondary display for laptop. Works perfect. Good picture quality and less strain to eyes and also avoids the neck pain caused by looking down at the laptop monitor full day.
4,the product is good but NO HDMI even after paying 13k.
5,Looks elegantGood picture qualityThe additional USB ports come in handy
5,Beautiful monitor. Does what's advertised. Easy to install. Looks very elegant. Colours are very accurate.I purchased it for trading. Now it sits on my desk beautifully and displays those charts in details!Highly recommend this to everyone. Worth the money! 👌
3,There are no inbuilt speakers.
5,After using the monitor I dont have any cons for this monitor. I like the Dell monitor quality and the color contrast for office work.
5,-Screen quality is amazing at various viewing angles.-very thin bazels-Has multiple connectivity options of HDMI as well as VGA
4,Had to buy additional accessory to use it in Macbook
5,Picture quality is really good. It is very suitable to do your daily office work.
3,No matter what ever I did USB ports are not working. I would request for a help from the respective team to address the issue.

4,Perfect monitor with dell service assurance under price range
5,Awesome picture quality. Excellent product. Loved it.
5,Best product as per my requirements this product giving me more options and best tools.As usual product delivery from Amazon is very safe and fast.
5,Good features
5,Using it for day to day compute.No game play.Good so far.Package contains a D Port cable and Not HDMI.HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT is the key feature it comes with a good stand.
5,This is the best monitor under 15K in my opinion.- Connectivity options- Fit and finish- Height and rotation adjustable- Thin bezels- Optimal brightness for longer duration
5,Picture quality is good and display is bright. This is a great buy for work from purpose. This monitor has height and tilt adjustment which is very useful. This not for gaming though casual gaming is okay.
5,Bought this to work with my laptop. Excellent picture quality build quality adjustable to wide angles. Also supports brightness control through laptop software (ClickMonitorDDC). Highly recommended
4,It’s really good. Just that it looks delicate and needs to be handled with care.
5,Good monitor to buy.
5,Best monitor go for it guys
5,Thin bezzels and sturdy frame
2,Worst product and service by Dell and sellerDisplay port stopped working in 3 months.Complained dell supportthey said my monitor will be replaced.they asked for all documents and invoice I mailed them. Now they are denying any replacement without any explaination.They closed the case without any proper justificationneither they are replying to any mails. PATHETIC AND  WORST SERVICE BY DELL AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT DELIVERY BY SELLER.
3,特に問題なく使えてます。ただ、あえて伸縮機能のあるものを選んだのに、Max伸ばしても私にとっては低いです。もう少し伸ばして（高くして）ほしい。
3,The product should include an HDMI cable. I mean why are you not including HDMI with this??
4,Good buy included USB cable and DP cable. Seller ecomputerstore.
5,Good Quality Picture quality is good you can tilt it all angle. i enjoy using it.
3,When I received it I felt like the screen looked smaller than a 24 inch. And so I measured it  and  turns out  it is a 21 inch  screen.
5,Using it for last 8 months and is good. Can keep the monitor at eye level with the stand.
4,Don't buy this as it cannot be daisychined with another P2419H model. Otherwise the monitor is good.
5,Have been using this for a while Absolutely love it! Totally recommend it.
5,PROS: No backlight bleeding Height adjustable rotateable No Glare Nice cable management USB Ports Good build and qualityCONS: No SpeakersBrought it at 12.5k during the prime day. That's the cheapest it gets.
5,Excellent quality and anti glare. No camera or mic or speakers.  The USB did not connect to he mac mini.
3,Some Resolution not supported like 1900*1080 etc
5,Not sure about it's anti-glare as it impacts your eyes too much even if you have blue light filter glasses.As for other quality of the product i think it's perfect.
5,Sleek design great picture quality energy saving height adjustment pivot rotation are some of the features I like about this monitor. My primary use of the monitor is work related.
5,Monitor is good when compared with the Laptop screen.  Functions well and mechanically very good design.
4,Good
5,Best monitor in 24 inch screen
5,Picture quality is very good with IPS display. it is almost 1920*1080 display resolution. Very soothing for eye.
5,Ottimo equilibrio qualità/prezzo
5,The power plug need to be proper its lose. Otherwise it's best product.
5,I'm a marketer and I'm looking for a 1920*1080 resolution monitor landed up in two models HP E243 and Dell 2419. Though HP is sleek and sexy I had to buy this one as it has a USB Hub. HP has only HDMI output.Overall picture quality and website and templates are rightly viewed.
2,Disappointed with the color accuracy and reproduction. Had bought two monitors for my office. While one was woefully subpar it atleast wasn't defective ( edit ; I was able to get good results after setting up a color profile that my Samsung S24R35x came with and after fiddling with the monitor settings ). The other one is just plain crappy! The deepest red you can manage is a deep neon orange ! Tried tons of calibrations and adjustments different color profiles but the panel seems to be old and defective. Too brown from side angles and unappealing inconsistent brightness and color quality even at 0deg viewing angle. I'm returning the defective one ! And making a new order from a different seller. It's unfortunate that QC is a lost concept among manufacturers these days because then I wouldn't have to give such a bad review for a great monitor that I 've come to love over the last few years.
3,Very delicate. Screen cracks in the slightest impact. Need to take care like a baby. But picture quality is good.
5,Nice product adjustable colour correction contrast
5,I had recently commented on missing HDMI cable with this product. But soon as they received my feedback on the product the seller immediately dispatched the cord to my doorstep. Thank you seller "Sold by: StorazeBiz"
5,Very good product
5,pretty good I have one of the best monitor. I have a similar monitor with a touch too. both are good.p2119 I guess and this one
5,Have bought this with table mount and love it  best quality value for money.
4,HDMI Cable should have been provided to connect to laptop
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Color reproduction issues
5,Undoubtedly the best!
4,Best Monitor for Programmers with Matte Anti-glare display.Would have given 5 star for Glossy Classic display along with Speakers.
4,Completely satisfied. Reduced a star as HDMI cable was not added.
5,For all the long hours of work at home needed a monitor which won't hurt my eyes and adjustable to my sitting position. This full fills all my expectations.
4,Good display quality. Very good second monitor for software engineers who are looking to multitask.
4,Simply Great Perfect Price..!
5,improved my working routine
5,The Dell monitor is a great looking piece of hardware with minimal bezels and fantastic performance. Would definitely recommend buying it if you're replacing an older monitor like I did. It doesn't have the deepest blacks but the color is vibrant and good contrast numbers which make it great for gaming.
5,Very good quality display.  Easy to setup. The stand is excellent  it allows display to set virtually in any direction.  Tilt rotate  pivot rotate and height adjustment is great flexibility
4,Good buy
5,One of the best monitor with so many specifications and such a good quality. And the best part is its DELL.
5,Very good product...
5,No HDMI cable which is bad at this price range.
5,I have been using this product for more than a month. I find this really useful while working from home. Also I bought another one and gifted to my friend. Increases your productivity while wfh.
5,Best monitor you can buy for the money. Refresh rate is capped at 60hz but overall picture quality and viewing angles are best in segment. Stand is also very strong and sturdy does not wobble like other budget monitors and allows movement in all directions also allows height adjustment.
5,It's an awesome product go for it if you are looking for a business/office monitor.
5,Nice product and great delivery. One thing HDMI cable not included in this box
4,I am using this monitor almost a week. Loving its performance and picture quality.
5,Best picture qualityAdjustableStylelist looks Best For Video editing and music production
4,Right size for offlce work.
5,The screen size is perfect and the flexible options in height/tilt adjustments are helpful. Recommended.
1,I received the product on the 3rd of April 2021. My initial impressions about it were quite good. It's commendable for office work the display is clear the anti-glare feature is an added advantage: had no hiccups setting it up. However it has been just 47 days using it and it's gone KAPUT. It does not power up anymore. All the precautions taken w.r.t. the electrical connection and power surges and babying the monitor and what not the damn thing just failed within 2 months of usage. The cherry on top is that even though it is under DELL replacement warranty as per DELL policies my BRAND NEW MONITOR will be replaced by a "REFURBISHED MONITOR" only.  Imagine the nightmare of receiving a refurbished replacement that may or may not be cosmetically pristine against a BRAND NEW Product . My cheap as hell GATEWAY monitor of 12 years is still working perfectly and this piece of tech dies within months. My advice : STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM DELL.
5,I have been using it for more than a month now. It is really good for web development. Picture quality is good anti glare is good.
5,Nice
5,My monitor has pretty even backlighting. There is no apparent bleed from the corners. My review picture is slightly overexposed by my phone camera.
2,This product is good in general but if you are a user who is accustomed to high pixel density display then you will not like the display you get here.I have raised a return request. The pickup person arrived on the pickup day and told me he is carrying 2 pickup receipts and will not be able to accept the item unless he scans two barcodes for the two items to be picked. I was surprised as I was returning only one item. He suggested to cancel the return request and raise another one. Following this I spoke with a customer care agent who said he has raise another return request and the previous problem could be a technical issue. Such glitches are not expected from a technically strong company like Amazon.
5,Does it work for what it meant to be. I bought this product at 12.5k n again want to set-up Duel monitor but this time it's price got increased to 15k plus. Sure to COVID-19
5,Ottimo monitor e consegna veloce
5,Bildschirm für PC Lieferung wie versprochen Verpackung ok.Bildschirm funktioniert super kann also weiterempfohlen werden.
3,Il monitor è ottimo metto 3 stelle poiché nella descrizione si parlava di telecamera che non c’è e perché il monitor viene fornito con dei cavi che non sono compatibili con i più comuni laptop. Bisogna acquistare a parte un cavo con uscita Port ed entrata HDMI.
5,Bought two for home office setup. Extra USB ports are very handy and all wires come in the box. Good picture quality for everyday work haven't used it for gaming.
5,Habe diesen Monitor als Zweitbildschirm gekauft und bin TOP zufrieden!! Mit DELL sowieso!
5,The monitor has amazing clarity and it's well built.
5,Very nice monitor no bleeding lights. Best monitor for long work hours.Special thanks to seller @ZRPL received completed sealed and untampered.Although amazon packaging could improve still its good.
3,I was expecting better picture quality (blacks are not at all perfect. ) screen is brighter than expected in dark scenes...which kills the enjoyment. Tried various settings in brightness and contrast but not satisfied. Even I noticed high differences in picture quality with slight change of viewing angles... not sure all IPS is like this!
4,モニター後ろのケーブルを通す穴位置が高すぎて、モニターの高さを低くした場合にケーブルに折れ曲がりの負荷がかかってしまう。負荷をかけないようにすると、ケーブルが丸見えで不恰好に。。。同メーカーのスクエアタイプとデュアルで使用してますが、こちらは穴位置が低いのでケーブルの取り回しはスマートです。
5,Great picture quality 👍and comfort view for long time work.
5,This anti-glare monitor is versatile for all tasks. The picture quality is wonderful.
5,Approximate package.Good quality product delivered.
5,Bezel-less swivels back & forth rotates 170° height adjustment awesome refresh rate and awesome color accuracy from all angles!
5,I used this display by connecting it to my Macbook.The height and brightness of the screen can be adjusted very easily.Also anyone can assemble. Can be used stably.I'm glad I bought it.
5,I would have uploaded the images but my phone camera is not good. The monitor is really good the picture quality is awesome.
5,Good product. Works for office work during WFH on my Macbook Pro M1
4,USB 2.0 is not working
4,Pros:Cheapminimal bezelDecent color accuracy(not pro grade)sufficient adjustmentscons:no usb c option.usb A port can only deliver power.IO shield obstructed by the frame
5,Easy to install. Ideal for coding and light use. Though it is 60Hz sometimes 60fps come at a fraction of lag everynow and then. Besides that it's good.
5,best
5,It works really well and we haven't had any issues with it so far!
5,-
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Likes: screen when it works looks fine. 24 inch screen with slim bezel good colours and easy on eyes. Ergonomics of this monitor is greatDislikes: frustrating issue with flickering see the video. I have ordered replacement I will update this review once the I get to see the replacement.I didn't like the plastic body and the USB hub sometimes don't work I had to change the port of my attached device.  The ports are at awkward position and it is hard to reach unless you rotate the screen. Their quality is not so great.
5,Great screen
5,Very nice monitor
4,Good picture quality. Easy setup.
5,The picture quality is amazing and you can clearly see the difference between 720P and 1080P. It's quite convenient for office purpose and also for gaming.
5,I bought this as a work computer. It is fit for purpose.
5,Great product works in portrait and landscapeCan be height adjusted as well
5,Really good for working from home. Worth the money.
5,Excellent Product HDMI/VGA Cable will not come along with the Product Need to buy Additionally
5,Best professional monitor for programming and best value for price.
2,We should be aware that we get the product for the price that we give.Here if you have a MacbookPro laptop which has best display and add this monitor to it you will understand the difference in quality.I got this monitor for 13.5K spent another 1.5K for Usb C to HDMI adapter and HDMI cable.You wont get HDMI or VGA cable with this monitor.Poor picture quality I'm thinking why did I even buy this product. I should have to spent 5K more and should have purchased U2419H model.Now there is no return policy in Amazon.
5,this is best ever screen
5,Excellent monitor.  Has reduced the eye strain.
4,Nice monitor for WFH users
2,The monitor by itself seems to be a good and fine quality.But I had these following issues:1. The internal packaging was damaged when I had received. Bought it through the seller - ecomputerstore.2. While moving the monitor around I could hear the sound of loose screws moving inside.3. Contrary to what many suggested the monitor is a big NO as an external display for MacBook Pro (I checked with 2019 16-inch). The fonts look pixelated. I understand that one cannot expect retina level display but the same monitor while connecting to a Windows laptop does a better job of rendering the fonts.
5,The built quality is really sturdy. The monitor stand is made of metal and is very heavy so the display doesnt shake. The screen brightness and crispness is very good. Great purchase.
5,An excellent choice for coders
5,Great picture quality.
5,Great screen stand can turn the monitor any way you want 4 USB ports on the side are handy.
4,It's good.  Only wish it had speakers
4,Good product meet the expectations
5,Not any problem faced till now (3 months from purchase).
4,ラップトップの小さい画面から考えると、圧倒的に使いやすくなりました。フレームは細くてかなり良いと思います。画質については普通です。スピーカー、AUX端子(3.5mmオーディオ端子)は付いてませんが、必要な時は出力の取り方は色々あるので、まぁ良しとするかな。USBポートは便利です。キーボードやマウスの無線レシーバーとかを付けっぱなしにできるので。スタンドの作りが凄く良いです。まぁ一旦位置を決めてしまえば、頻繁に動かさないでしょうが、上下左右は無論、色々な角度に動かせます。(縦にも出来る）（当初購入しようとしていた別のモニターはスタンドの調整範囲がほとんどなかったので、別にスタンドを購入しようと思ってましたが、こいつは必要ないです）
5,The display quality is pretty good. The pedestal is adjustable for height and can be rotated. The prebuilt screen modes are good for read movies and extended screen time.
4,FEATURES ARE GOOD SEEMS LITTLE PRICEY.!
5,Works very well. Good pan tilt swivel movement. I like the usb 3.0 ports.Good quality screen with slim bezels.Vendors are increasing prices due to demand.
4,使いやすかったです。画面がきれいでした！
5,Such an improvement from a small screen. Life saver for the neck.
1,HiI purchased Dell 24P19H black monitor in November 2020. After working good for around 6 months - suddenly I started to see vertical and horizontal lines and a black spot on top of screen when I powered it ON on a morning. Now when I contacted Dell Support team then they asked me to click pictures of screen in diagnostic mode and send so that they proceed with product replacement. But to my shock after sending pictures they refused to replace quoting reason that your screen is damaged and Dell won't replace it. I attached picture with review of same monitor. Do you notice any physical damage on it ? Yes offcourse when we power it on - we will notice a blackish spot on top but if a black spot means physical damage then I must say that they are making very delicate products and of very bad quality.NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF VERY VERY BAD AFTER SALE SUPPORT !!!
4,Really good monitor with this price.
5,24 inchPerfect for coding and multitask with laptop.Smooth height adjustment and orientation setting.
2,After using 20 days the monitor did not power up. I could see the power indicator is blinking very rarely. Sometimes the display is ON for few seconds and again going to power off state.It is very irritating to me since we all work from home and do not get a proper solution.
5,Good display for professionals. Good color accuracy and pixels are not visible at 3 foot distance.
5,Good product
5,Resolution and quality is great within the given price.
5,Product so far working very fine
5,Great Prdt
3,USB ports at the back of the monitor do not work. I have tried them with different devices. Do not count on the USB hub.
5,PRODUCT'S IMPRESSION IS VERY GOOD.
5,inbuilt speakers would have been a really good addition
3,The black display is not that deep.  The difference is quite noticeable. Price is also very high with no great features.
4,Quality is  less
5,Good
2,Received this monitor 4 days early.But when I plugged in this monitor found many vertical lines inside the screen. Looks like something heavy was kept on this. Got refund for this though.
5,Has an inbuilt usb hub and has better IPS panel than other 24 inch at this price stand is breeze as it supports height tilt and 360* rotation.
5,Adjustability is great. Good monitor to work on MS office files and to read various text reports. Colours are natural too. Auto dimming function not present.
5,I got this few days back it’s what I was searching for.  It’s perfect size monitor with great picture quality and best one for WFH.  Worth buying.
5,Dell makes really good products. Very nice quality. Perfect monitor for programming and reading documents. It will glare if you have a window behind you. Nice color reproduction. Worth it!
5,Fantabulous
5,Nice Monitor from Dell . Very happy
5,Hi ReadersI would like to inform you that this not fake or paid review. This is an amazing product from dell. As a developer I will suggest buying this if you are looking for a good Monitor.
5,Must buy if you are looking for a display in this range.

5,Great monitor in this price range
5,Very good quality and size is perfect
5,Great product. Works very well for work from home users - adjustable height tilt orientation are so great features

5,no comments
5,My work from home was never been so comfortable before...! I really like the monitor. I will suggest this monitor whosoever looking to buy it..!

5,Great montior for professionals and gamingPlease go ahead
5,Good for coding and office use
5,Bezel less Monitor with sturdy stand.
3,product MRP on box prize is less then what i pay which not good other wise product is good
5,Good product i loved it and delivered one day before the date.
5,Works as advertised. I use it 14 hours a day and it works absolutely fine.
5,Good for professional use
5,overall a good purchase and experience
3,It arrived and was easy to assemble but I haven't been able to test it because it doesn't come with an hdmi cable.
3,I already had another piece of same model. This one lags the quality of the other one.
5,Good screen size and thin borders.  Excellent image quality and no flickering.Only if Dell can add some speakers then would be the best!
5,awesome monitor.
5,Very good product..
5,Display is good. Crisp. Bezels are quite thin. 3 Dimensional adjustment - Up/Down Tilt and Rotate.
3,商品到着後開封したところ、左右上部に点らしきものが……ドット抜けチェッカーを試したところ発色部分に異常なし。ただこの発色してる点が気になり、販売店に連絡したところ「売るだけなのでデルのカスタマーに電話してくれ。法人と名乗ればスムーズにいくから…」と丸投げ。仕方なく教えてもらった電話番号に連絡したのですが、片言の日本語で「ココ案内だけ、ここに電話」とたらい回し。ようやく繋がり用件(本来発色しないところから光が出てる)を伝え、メールにて当該箇所の写真を送付。結果は「業界標準範囲内」…明確な回答が得られなかった。安い買い物ではないので販売店を選ぶ時は慎重になったほうが良いかもしれない。
5,Good
5,Great monitor at this price. Good for working professionals artists and content creators
5,Absolutely fantastic.
5,Works well with my Dell all-in-one.
5,p2419hcのほうも持っているが、画質は変わらないこっちのが安い接続端子がhcの方が多いだけだから、素人はこっちで十分でした。
5,Looks good and function well.
5,This Dell P series has met my expectations almost bezel-less and good looking on my desk.
5,Good experience with Dell series.Value for money.
5,Awesome! first day i felt its big but now i am thinking whey i didnt go for 27". bezel less monitor you will enjoy!!
4,Picture clarity could have been better. But overall monitor is good.
1,My Macbook starts to heat up to extreme temperature when I connect this monitor to it even though I don't render heavy softwares on the monitor. Also when I tried to trade this with something else both Amazon and Dell said that nothing can be done with this. Now I am stuck with this stupid model which I can't even use.Never trusting Dell again.
5,Rotation is the key element
5,I like the picture quality and size works best for my office use.
5,Nice
5,Worth for money nothing to complain
5,Good product for office use.
5,Awesome product
5,super Preis-Leistung
4,普段使用している１５インチのノートPCでは、観づらさ感じていたので、在宅ワークとなった契機で購入。　約２週間ほど使用した感想ですが、とても観やすいくなり、高さなど各調整機能があるため使い易いです。概ね満足しています。　同じメーカーの高さ調整機能が無いタイプと比較して、価格が少々高いかなぁと感じました。
5,Good
5,It is an amazing screen for this price range. Go for it!
5,Awsome! Very crisp and clear screen!Very comfortable for continuous 8-9 hours of work.Size is so perfect! Worth investing!!
5,Bought this as a secondary monitor for WFH and watching movies. It does the job very well.
5,good  but little costly
2,I have bought this after so much research I have finally settled on DELL because of the brand. But after buying I regret it now.The picture quality is blurry not crisp. I have been using the Samsung monitor for 10 years with no issues in picture quality. Bought an Acer monitor yesterday no issues.I think the monitors should be checked for quality in-person before buying
5,Excellent picture. True colours. A great buy
5,Best Professional monitor. Worth of money
5,新品の状態のものを購入したので、中古の状態のものはわかりません。普通にYoutubeを見たり、ネットショッピングなどの画面表示くらいにしか使っていませんが、キレイに表示されていると思います。電源を消すと、映り込みは無いのでアンチグレアのモニターです。モニターのふちの部分も細いので、モニターの見える範囲も広いです。オンラインゲームなどのPCゲームはしないので、120Hz動作？とかでの見え方はわかりません。入力端子はD-subとHDMI（ver1.4）とDispleyPortをそれぞれ１つありますので今のPCだったらどれでもつなげれると思います。USB端子も色々付いてますが、まだそのモニターに付いてるところにつなげて使っていませんので、わかりません。
5,ノートパソコンに繋いで使ってます小さいノーパソ画面に比べると作業効率は格段に上がります画質は長時間仕事で使用しますが、ちらつきもなく目にも優しく疲れにくいですそしてこの製品の一番のセールスポイントはアーム部分でしょう高さ、上下角度、左右向き、回転など細かく調整可能で付属のアームとしてはほぼ完璧です別売アームなら1万円近くしますがこのアームならまず不満な人はいないでしょうそう考えると1万円代で買えるモニターとしてはコスパかなりいいと思います
5,Good purchase
5,One of the best affordable monitors you could buy for professional use.
5,Good Product.Made is China.HDMI cable is not available with package. You need to buy it separately.
5,Good looking monitor with exactly what you need at a good price

5,Must buy. Worth every penny. Can rotate and adjust the monitor height. Also it can be tilted vertically.
5,Excellent build quality fully adjustable rotatable monitor stand.USB ports are a plus
4,It's not accurate to 0-255
5,The seller was ecomputerstore the monitor is great but the seller did not provide HDMI cable have ti by it seperately
5,Clear and enlarged view. Gives less stress to eyes compared to small laptop screen
3,Good monitor below 14k. Screen bleed issue is there which seems normal for ips panels.The product I received from seller ecomputerstore is already registered and I am not sure how to avail warranty. So not sure whether its a cheat or a deal. Price mentioned on Dell box is 13k.
5,Awesome product in this range Just go for it

5,4 weeks of usage no issues so far. pretty good for programming. videos and youtube can be better. did not try games
5,実に良いです。左右の角度調整も出来ますし、上下の角度調整も出来ます。また、回転も出来るので、実に使い具合の良いモニターだと思います。値段も、手頃ですし、言うこと無しですね。
5,テレワーク用に購入しました。IPS液晶、モニターアームを取り付け可能、値段が2万円以下、レビュー点数も良い(サクラチェッカーで確認してもサクラ無し)といった私の条件に全て合う製品です。画質も良く満足しています。
5,Good
5,Best monitor of all time. Very good picture quality. Best best best
5,予想以上に大きくてよかったですが。
5,Excellent piece from Dell. Picture quality is perfect.Height adjustable plus 360* rotation.No VGA cables provided
1,None of the accessories provided are usable. 16 Amps plug point instead of 5 Amps which is normally for all monitors. There is not even an HDMI cable given to connect the laptop. I tried to return bit as per AMAZON there is return allowed for this product....you need to invest in your own accessories if you need this monitor to  work even with Dell laptop....there is no option anyhow if no return allowed. I called product manufacturer and the response was ridiculous "We have not charged you for accessories"..these are basic cables n power adapter I am talking without which you can't even  test the product
5,Good picture quality. Low stress on eyes. Good for WFH.
5,Nice monitor with height adjustment and good picture clarity. Packaging was really good. It does not include HDMI cable.
5,Excellent product
5,It is very good quality and enjoying most of it daily.
5,Good monitor for professionals
4,ベーゼルも狭く快適に使用しています。
5,perfekt für's homeoffice für die Pausen auch für's gamen. Sind vollkommen zufrieden! Super Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.
5,Nice monitor quality is good good for coding and office work. but they should have provided hdmi cable and monitor doesn’t contain inbuilt speakers or haradphone jack.
5,best monitor for Work from Home
5,It is a good monitor in thegiven price range. Would recommend it for code developers
5,It’s perfect fit for Work From Home setup. Highly recommended
5,Looks fine for now. Let's see how it goes.
5,alles wie beschrieben
5,The product is excellent with good picture quality and display
3,Spend more around 14k but the quality of picture and brightness and screen quality was not good
5,must buy
5,Nice product value for money...
5,Great picture little>no bevel. Would recommend.
5,worth it
5,Good product in this range compared to Samsung LG or Benq
5,Very nice monitor at this price range. I like it. There is no HDMI cable provided. Need to buy  separately
5,Product is worthy. .wow
5,Clear image and soothing colours. I simply adore it.
2,I got this to replace my second screen which failed recently and I was stunned at how bad the picture quality was when I set it up next to my main monitor. It was grainy and dull. No amount of fiddling with the settings could fix it. It was so poor I couldn’t even work with it just disconnected it and stuck it back in the box to be returned.
5,Very nice monitor its build is very stable and comfortable can pull up down easily. The LCD looks great I like IPS panel
5,This is the best monitor if you are looking for a monitor with height adjustment. Best for usual work programming.
5,Superb Dell quality. Fully adjustable smooth functioning. Easy on eyesore! No regrets
5,This thing doesn't have speakers. I guess that's because it's meant for office use. So no harm done. It's a beautiful display to get your work done.
5,16600円で、このクオリティーで、あれば大変満足です。何も設定せずデフォルトですと、色味が濁った様な見え方でしたが、設定次第で何とかなります。参考までに「　ディスプレイ明るさ93　コントラスト88　　　　　　　　赤88 緑86 青93　」　とくに、明るさ・コントラストは、デフォルトでは、暗いので、変更した方が良いかと思います。
5,Nice product
2,2019Excellent product. Highly recommend it.25/05/2021The power cable provided is15amp is not compatible with households. I had purchased the exact same monitor (from a different seller) it had a power cable compatible with households. Also the color calibration of this new panel is washed out with a bluish tinge.  I requested for replacement of the product promptly it was given but replaced monitor also has same issues and problems as previous.
5,Good
5,Awesome Monitor for office work.Pros:Nice displayVertical rotationslim and stylish look
1,Arrivato rotto
2,Power cord plug size is very big and unable to plug in the power outlet.HDMI cable is very important one but that is not provided with the product.
5,(5/5) score for all:Great picture quality.Height adjustment.Anti-glare.
5,Very neatly packed and delivered.
5,この値段でしたので２台購入しました。思っていたよりも左右の淵の黒い部分が狭く5mmしかなかったので２画面を横に並べてもとても見やすいです。２画面って一度使ってしまったら１画面のPCでは物足りなくなってしまいました。スタンドもがたつきなくしっかりしているので満足しています。画質や色味などは、正直よくわからないので気にしていません。私としては十分満足の買い物でした。
5,Good Monitor Daily Development Use With Anti Glare Feature
4,good monitor.  happy with the buy.

5,Excellent Product & Seller.
5,Thin bezel and option to adjust heightswivel and tilt are very convenient.
5,The screen size is just perfect to increase my work productivity. Quality of the product is amazing.
5,10000円代で高さ調整が可能な24インチのFHD液晶を探していましたが10000円前半では絶望的にありません、この機能がついてるのは20000円代が相場なんですがこの商品は18000円以内で送料込みという物件です　更にDELL製ということもあり作りもしっかりしています　画質も問題ありません　梱包は質素なパッケージですが法人向けではないかと推測されます　全く問題ありません
5,decent quality. not heavy adjustable height.
5,Using this as a secondary screen for programming.Totally worth it.
5,Excellent picture quality
5,Such a great product! Dell always meets the expectations!Package was delivered in very good condition.
5,GoodRotatableBuy mostly for coding
4,Good choice
5,Screen is great. They don't ship HDMI cable with the monitor .
5,Awesome !
5,Perfect Monitor in all sense
1,I checked with Dell support... they made me do some diagnostics by instructing on phone made me took pictures and then send them. After analyzing the pictures they told me that this is due to internal damage and that it is not covered under warranty. All I can say is it worked fine the previous day - that morning when we turned it on we saw that it had issues. There is no external damage and there was no cause for any damage as it was not even moved - it was sitting exactly where it was the previous day. I do feel cheated by Dell as they sold a low quality product.
4,Accuracy
1,I bought this display as a secondary display connected to my Laptop. Build quality packaging delivery is good. but the color reproduction is Disappointing! you can see pics attached. blue comes out Green. Light blue comes out as light pink. white is yellowish white. color chart shows all colors displayed differently. Black comes out dark Gray....contrast is very poor...Rs12200 gone really waste......DELL is very disappointing. how can this be called professional series? this is not even good to see your family pics as it surprises you with different color of clothings you never wore.... Replace window is up to 29nov 2020.Request Amazon to replace this Monitor as all return/replace options have been removed for this product and unable to call customer care
5,Superb screen.. thankyou amazon!!!
1,cause severe eye strain and headachesi tried for 10 days than passed on to an employee in office she even experienced the same eye strainthe monitor quality / look and feel is very goodbut the GALRE makes the experience a nightmaremay be there might be some issue with the monitor i received.tried calling helplines but it doesnt accept my product code and the call is not forwarded to any human to talk withonly a pre-recorded software the CLIENT IS LEFT TO INTERACT withPATHETIC responce by DELL on email too. ask me to call on toll free number already mentioned on websitesDONT BUT PRODUCT from such companies who cannot heir customer care representatives too... spent 15000 for the monitor and got such experience
4,Good monitor for this price range could have factory calibration bit better
4,Good quality monitor

5,Happy with the purchase :)
5,Meets expectation. Great product!!!
5,Nice product
1,Delivered today(12 Oct) and I was happy as delivered in 48 hours. When I unpacked it found there is no label and sticker available in the product also dust on the screen it show that it is an used screen. Further I have connected the screen and found there is a vertical red line is appearing on right side. I have purchased a new and fresh product not an used one. I have raised an request for replacement of the product. I never expect this type of delivery from Amazon. Not happy!13 Oct: got an replacement of the product but it is received in very bad condition the broken screen. Hence returning the product and claimed my money back.It is very disappointing! :(
5,Nice product... working fine
5,Good Product.
5,Great
5,Recieved on time but the the packaging is not good. A line on the top of the screen. damaged monitor.
1,I dislike all the things about this monitor. The picture quality is very bad.. As seen in images  most of the times even after connecting it to the hdmi source the display is full of nasty and annoying dirtly lines.. May be the hot plus detection is very poor.. Sometimes the screen is blurry even when monitor is poweres off and on.. Very poor quality.. Not at all worth for the price I am paying..  Screen also flickers and it so irritating to work on this as eyes are strained too much. Also sometimes the edges are also fading and not sharp. Also when I poweron the monitor without any video input whole screen is white and solwely entire screen gets corrupted as in the attached images..
5,2 of a kind. Good for office work ...
5,Good product. Easy to adjust angles and height. Heavy and strong build quality. Screen comes with mat finish so it protects eyes also.

3,Best quality monitor. Buy Why power cable is not there??
5,Happy with the quality and utility of the product.
5,Loved it. Nice stand allows proper rotation and fine adjustments
3,Kindly provide a hdmi cable along with monitor.
1,This monitor looks great but came with a tatty polythene bag with a European power cable inside so i am unable to use it!  I rang Amazon who can only suggest sending it back and re-ordering. Bearing in mind this is my second one (the first may have been a different seller i don't know) and the first came with no leads at all so I really don't want the hassle of returning another and sorting out a refund.  I am getting my own power lead but seriously!!! What is wrong with their quality control.
5,Nice product it’s classy and will fill up your room nice.
1,The product came with Power Plug i.e. 15A socket and Dell says that there were issues with power fluctuations and that's why they have put 15A socket. It was not mentioned on Amazon Site or Dell Site that 15A socket is needed. Amazon declines to return as I want refund as I do not have that socket in my home (except bathrooms and kitchen).Very bad behaviour from amazon as well as the specification was not listed and they decline to refund. Very Bad experience.

5,Sturdy
5,Good one for coding
3,レビューが非常によかったので、それに基づいて購入することにしましたが、電源を入れて３０分くらい経ったところ、画面の下の半分か1/3が黒になり、上の半分しか表示されません。PCの画面で必要な情報が見えるし、返品するのは大変ですので、我慢していますが、がっかりです。Dellならもう少し高い品質を期待していました。
4,Good
3,Got at high price
5,フォトレタッチ、動画編集用のサブモニタとして購入。スタンド、本体の作りが良く満足。モニタの縁はほとんど無くかっこいい。デザイン、質感は非常に良い。液晶パネルは四隅のムラが少なく、中級クラスの物が使用されており安心感がある。事務作業や動画視聴などには十分すぎるぐらいの画質の良さ。下記はフォトレタッチをする際に気になった点。私の購入したものはパッと見イエローに色が転んでいて、かつオレンジ系の暖色が出にくい感じがした。キャリブレーターで確認したところ感覚どおりで、レッドの色域が狭くsRGBはカバー率は92％と若干狭い。肌色の出が悪い傾向があり、シャドウが若干浮き、黒色が白っぽくなる。ただし、上記はEIZOのcolor edgeと比べた時の不満点であり、この価格帯としては満足な表示品質。少なくとも1万円前半で売られているIPSモニタとは雲泥の差がある。赤系統の色がもっと出ればと思うが、一般利用の場合は画質的に文句無いのでは？全体的に良くできたモニタなので総合評価は星5で、とてもおすすめのモニタ。
5,Worth for money
4,Looks good.
2,Looks amazing BUT this monitor is not suitable for Mac users. It does not allow you to connect directly to a MacBook (tested on both air and pro). The picture quality is not so good either. Very disappointed.
5,Great if you'r looking for coding purpose. Hieght adjustable stand helps a lot.
3,Slightly edge bleeding
2,Every thing was good accept after 3-4 days of use later the monitor screen started to light bleed and I there was also a dead pixel I have filled for a refund let's see what happens for some reason there wasn't an option for replacement. I will try  to update this review after the refund or replacement
5,Superb product. I already had one of it. Ordered one for dusl screen.
3,MRP on the box is 10K beware !!
5,IODATAのモニター買おうとしたところ、在庫有りで一週間以内に配送というステータスだったのに、注文後に発送未定になったのでキャンセルして、このモニターを買いました。ちゃんとすぐ届いたし、初期不良もなく、ゲームするにもヌルヌル動くので問題なし。スピーカーは付いていないので、必要であれば別で購入する事をお勧めします。
5,No complaintsas I have expected.
5,ワードやエクセル用途ですが全く問題無いです。
5,Picture quality is superb..
5,Best value of money.
5,Excellent product. Quick delivery. Product as described. But discrepancy in MRP as mentioned on the product and what is mentioned in the Amazon site. Hence discount is much less than what is stated. Beware!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good product
5,ウェブ制作やプログラミングを行うため、縦置きをメインウィンドウにしています。アームが要らないので、デスクの真ん中に配置できるのが◎ベゼルが狭いので、見た目もスッキリ◎
5,Good product
5,Go for it is a good display
5,10年以上前に購入したデスクトップをInspironに買い替えたとき、モニターはそのままにしていたのですが、やはり画質は劣化しているのでは？　と思い、各所で製品をチェックしたところ、同じ機種ではAmazon さんがいちばん安かったので、買い足しました。想像以上にきれいな画質にびっくりしました（新品だから当然か）。マイクもカメラもスピーカーもついていません（劣化していない手持ちの外付け用スピーカーがありますから）が、もっぱらネットによる映画、TVドラマなどの観賞用として使っています。満足しています。
5,Good one.
2,It is a good monitor for the price.  Not for the games and has a noticeable lag.  Not a primary monitor class however perfect as a secondary monitor. It struggles a bit with text antialiasing but raster images look great. However should you require after-sale service please don't be dependent upon DELL service staff  They suck at their job I had to buy a new monitor because they refused to provide repair (it still had many months of valid warranty left)
5,フレームがかなり細くてテンション上がりますMacと繋ぐためのHDMIは付属していないので別途購入する必要があります
5,satisfied
5,One word Excellent
5,means owesome
5,Zero hassles. Great product and delivery.
1,Last time I have given a five star review about the seller @StorazeBiz.Packing is good delivery is on time as committed product is physically ok But after five days of purchase I have notice that the backlight is bleeding from the bottom and left corner of the monitor. Then I talk to amazon expert Also Add All photo of regarding color bleeding issue. He gives me a replacement. But new one is also defective. Red light color several dot appear on the monitor bottom part. It is clearly visible on the dark screen. So I want to refund my money back..
5,Superb product.

5,リモートワーク用のモニタが品薄だった中少し値は張りましたがすぐに発送いただけましたし組み立ても簡単で大満足です。安い1万円台の製品はいつまでたっても納品されないor先方からのキャンセルが相次いでいたので大変ありがたかったです。
5,ビジネスで使うには十分です。配送も早く設置も楽、買ってよかった商品です？
5,It's come with the adjustable height and 360-degree rotation.
5,* Good Pic Quality* Good Value for Money.* Ergonomic Stand for all viewing Angle.
5,Working fine using it with my MacBook Pro old 2012 and new 2018 model. Good product.
5,Awesome quality I was looking something equivalent to what i have in office setup.I got this one. Value for money
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I never expected that Whole box will be damaged and come dirty filled with mud. When I opened the box just after product got delivered and switched on tv I found that whole monitor display was broken. I suddenly took the video of everything. But very disappointed as I was waiting eagerly for this item and received this damaged items.Thanks Amazon for replacement option but again I need to wait for the item.
3,Just received the monitor but it does not have VGA or HDMI cable it only consists of D Type HDMI & SSD along with power cord.
5,Great value for money

5,Best Monitor
1,This monitor is only for basic office uses not for entertainment purpose and content creating and editing purpose Very bad picture quality the screen are too blurry and the accuracy was too bad and screen full of backlit bleeding and glare issues I was returned this product. I'm so disappointed with this product.. if you looking for all rounder monitor never buy this product...
5,Nice Monitor by Dell- P2419H_Highly Recommended
5,Slightly Blue bias picOtherwise very good product from dell
1,This came with a 16A power cord while all other 24 inches monitors come with a normal power cord. This makes this un-usable in a normal scenario. DO NOT ORDER as they will not replace the product or the power cord. I ordered three 24 inches monitors one from Dell the other two from LG and HP. Only Dell has this issue.
1,After 5 months of usage suddenly the display was showing vertical lines and black patches on top.when contacted Dell for replacementthey refused to do so and said it was damaged internally which is not covered under warranty.As we are using this monitor for WFH purposethis issue caused inconvenience along with money loss.Shame on you Dell for cheating customers with poor quality panels.
4,Professional monitor with bezel less displays.
5,Good
1,I am not sure why the seller has kept a 16A power cord and not 10A. Be ready to buy an extra power cord if you buy this monitor. This detail is not mentioned in the product details.  Very bad from customer experience will not buy this if I had known this detail.
5,Superb
5,It's a good monitor perfect for coders
2,There is blurry text macOS have dropped anti-aliasing technology as their screens are retina/4k so don't buy this text won't look good buy at least 4k screen.
5,Perfect for perfect price range.
5,Too pricey but worth option if you are working from home
1,Thus unit comes with 16A power cable. When reached out to Dell regarding this issue Dell asked me to buy the adapter from market. Why should one buy accessory required to power up the unit from outside. Isn't it the OEM's responsibility to provide all accessories required to powerup the unit
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo. Consegna “quasi” impeccabile (prima di Natale)! Assistenza perfetta!!!
5,Excellent monitor. Does what is expected
5,Good product.90 degree rotation
5,amazing product with a reasonable price
3,Picture quality is not that good
5,Very Good product.
5,Very good monitor
1,Note: This is not fault of amazon. This review is against DELL. Monitor is legit and awesome everything is good.But.Dell after sell service is soooo bad. Warranty despite being 3yrs. Dell doesn't replace/repair panels if broken. Instead they ask to buy new one.Accidents happen. I am not going for Dell anymore.
5,Awesome product for budget value
5,Highly recommended
1,I have received different product E2218HN which is cheaper than this productUpdate Day 1 return didn't happen as the pickup person said product no is matching with the invoice. Wat? Return was raised for same reason. Return is rescheduled after my escalation with the customer care. He have said I will ensure pickup will be done.
5,Good product
3,Product is ok but price little high No CD No HDMI Cable.

5,Good for Graphic Designing..
1,I suspect duplicate product was delivered. While connecting itself got lines at the product. Power cord is 16A which is again not Dell Brand. Usually for monitors power cord I get to see original one .Requested for refund and I got it. Thanks Amazon for timely refund.
3,Dead pixel in my monitor
5,Nothing.
5,Value for money. Good for programming purpose
5,Good
5,Nice product best price ....
2,i received damaged product. In the middle of the led panel there's a small red dot. It is only seen when the moniter is on balck or dark colors. I think this is a dead pixel.  I am very unhappy with this purchase. I am going to repalace moniter.
1,Hello SirGood morning!I want to notify you that the product “DELL P2419H 24" MONITORVGA/HDMI/DP/IPS/USB/HGHTADJ 6VL2443Batch: Primary Batch”Purchased on 25 Sep 2020 has defects as the screen goes on suddenly dimmed while working and shows continuous flickering waves which affects eyes visibility while working.Please arrange for a replacement as soon as possible.Thanks for your help.
1,The packing was good but there was major damage with the screen. It was broken so bad and there was no display at all. Quality check was a complete failure. It was a complete waste of time. I had to return it immediately. Now I am too scared to trust any seller as I am not ready to go through this turmoil again.
1,Power cable with the package has 16A bigger socket which doesn’t work in a normal sockets.There is no HDMI cable with the product.It has display port for video and a usb cable for audio.
5,Amazing product from Dell...
1,Why does dell provide this huge 15A power connector ? I can’t connect it to any of my power outlets . This is not something like an air conditioner which needs this kind of plug and I can’t connect it even to my UPS outlets
5,Value for money !!
5,Value for money
5,Excellent product
5,awesome !!!
5,God
5,Good
1,Monitor doesn’t work in Full HD resolution with Macbook Pro it always says that can’t detect the signal.In lower resolution monitor looks so zoomed that you will hate using this monitor. Tried with multiple resolution and system settings but nothing worked.
3,No value for money
5,Love this display.
1,Powe cable is fauly passing current to the laptop when laptop charger is kept in charging. Customer service simply passed the time instead of showing interest in fixing the issue. Dell has the worst customer service. Please don't buy this monitor.
5,Photography good monitor in color
1,I Have Received the HD monitor but The Power Cable is not suitable for our power plug (we need 5 AMS Pluge cable
5,Sooo good
5,Good
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have received only 1 screen I ordered 2 screens it says order complete
5,Decent quality
5,Very good monitor
5,Value for money
1,Product received with Damaged Screen.When I checked off Screen it was looking okay. But when i strated it there was crack on the screen.
2,Was terribly disappointed with this. No exchange is being offered.
1,Seller is shipping the product with over sized power cable plugit needs 32 a socket to plug in.Don't buy it as you can not use it with regular socket plug.
1,The cable socket that connects to the monitor is loose and gets disconnected every now and then.Even when no one touching the monitor or laptop the connection goes off and you see nothing on the monitor.this happens to both the HDMI cable and also power cable.Defective piece has been shipped by the distributor.
5,Good
1,was just adjusting the tilt and it broke. display is black and not turning on the damage is so little still nothing in screen. Not covered in the warranty was not expecting this from a reputable company.
1,Screen material quality is very weak so handle very carefully. Even a small jerk causes screen break.Picture quality is good in the given price range.Screen rotation feature is good.Not good for gaming fps in csgo decreases drastically when playing on screen while it's 3 times on laptop.
1,Very heavy backlight bleeding. Disappointed. Even worse when Amazon customer service just try to make you keep the product and ask too many questions and didn’t solve the problem at the end
1,The screen it's not straight and downward screen.There is no adjustments to place screen straight. Can't left the screen up and downwards. Made a mistake buying this monitor can't even return. Waste of money.
1,Mine was having a vertical blue dotted line in the center (from top to bottom - as seen in the attached images). Searched on net this is the common problem in Dell Monitors and the only solution is replacement.I am lucky that my return period is still active. Trying to return it ASAP.  Thanks!
1,I bought the product on 17th October 2020 and its stopped working on 4th November 2020.Haven't used even for 1 month. Really cheap quality. Not recommended. And dell don't take warranty as I bought it from AMAZON. Now on 18th/02/2021 still I am not able to find any solutions
5,Excellent quality
1,Received the monitor today. Could see a shadow kind of thing in the middle of the screen. Submitted a request to replace which is expected to happen in 10 days. Hope the replacement process will be smooth and new product will work fine.Once the monitor is replaced will update the review.
5,Super
5,Very good all of them
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 As soon as I switched on the monitor for the first time noticed 50% of the screen has flickering issue. It is unaceptable that such defective item is delivered.
1,Original:+ rotates 90 degrees- hard to use buttons- difficult to navigate menu- developed dead pixels a huge blotch of dead pixels; right at the eye level.Won't recommend.Updated (2022.07.31)Died. Retains pixels that it died on. This one was a bad piece to begin with within 3 years it is dead.
1,Stoped working after 2 months.. and no response from customer service..
5,Best monitor
1,Not at all turning on within 2 months of use
1,This is a fake product. You clearly see puxels and its not even hd screen. It gives ete strain just after using for 30 minutes. Text is not clear and you cannot work on word and Excel.Amazon wont accept return.
5,GOOD
1,Recieved broken product. Took about aonth to return and get a refund
1,I'm so sad Dead black pixel 15cm from left and 1cm from bottom is clearly spotted on the day of delivery itself. Requested for replacement.No VGA/ HDMI cables included packing was okay just bubble sheet over the dell package.
1,In Delhi only one service center is there for this model and they straight forward denied for any support (paid/unpaid). Simple claim they don't have material to support this variant.
1,You might receive a damaged product. If you try replacing it the exchange verification might fail. Good luck.
1,Lines on screen
1,ディスプレイにノイズが入るようになり、度々映らなくなる現象が発生しています。2020年5月に購入したので半年弱で壊れたことになります…机上で使用していて衝撃等は与えていないので自然に壊れた印象ですが…箱等は処分してしまったので困りました…
1,See in person before you buy. If not used at a distance it is too pixely and low DPI (FHD at 24 inch). YMMV.
1,There is a white spot at the middle of screen and again I ordered second time but this time no lucky still got a defect monitor...does Amazon even bother quality check.
1,Waste of money warranty is of no use .Dell pseries monitors can't  be repaired. So i won't recommend anyone to buy.
1,no HDMI cable  due to that no sound please revert me back
1,Screen was cracked. Have returned
1,Have to return the monitor as the HDMI cable is missing.

1,Product Returns (Damage product).Please check the product first before you recieve it.
1,It was having white screen patchers on the screen
1,Monitor flickering when white screen...
1,Faulty Monitor . It did not even turn on
5,For a 24 inch monitor I pretty much wouldn't want anything more than this and going better than this is a steep price increase anyhow. I have two of these and use them both with a docking station for work and gaming at least 8 hours a day and have zero complaints.
5,Bought a pair for my home office and I'm very impressed.  Absolutely crystal perfect image sharp vibrant colors and blacks with no bleed.  Light but sturdy enough to stick a couple of cold shoe camera flash mounts to the top (what I use for my webcam & microphone).  The matte finish is professional looking.  Comes with a desk mount power cord and DisplayPort cord (no HDMI cord)
5,Este monitor es una excelente compra. La pantalla la base la versatilidad para conectarse casi con cualquier equipo y adicionalmente los cuatro puertos USB lo hacen una excelente compra. Lo compré para montar un "home office" y este monitor me ha salido excelente!
5,Es estética y sus funciones al igual que la cantidad de entradas que trae la hace muy útil si la conectas atraves de HDMI no se necesita calibrar imagen ni nada y si descargas la actualización por medio de la PC puedes configurarla para usar en modo que tus ojos descansen más del brillo azul y lo fuerte de la luz de la pantalla entre otras cosas de lo contrario lo puedes hacer directamente en la pantalla.
1,Ruined it by simply gripping it at the top to pull the display cable out of it (there's hardly bezel at the top).Extremely delicate and now it is e-trash.
4,brillantes
4,Aun acostumbrandome a este monitor. me gustari un poco mejor brillo y nitidez de colores. Perfecto para trabajar.
4,Good quality monitor good for dual monitor setup. So far no issues.
5,C’ Mon deuxième écran pour travailler.
5,nice for my 2nd screen！
2,Ordered 10 monitors in the past two weeks somehow the white background won't show accurately thought I take a picture so everyone can see the difference. These screens are all set to the same setting. Very concerning.
5,Great monitor. Came with all cables. Setup was quick and easy. A good value for the price.
4,Liked the added USB ports on monitor for video cam an keyboard
4,It's quite unfortunate that you have to buy an extra cable to make the monitor running.I received the product with the urgent need for me but I had to wait till the lockdown ends in Ontario to buy the cable despite the product was in front of me
3,No me mandaron el cable de HDMI
5,Love these monitors. I have two set up for my home office and they work great. Definitely happy with my purchase. Good quality sleek great colours.
5,I needed a nice screen for work but I don't need the larest panel technology or 8k 120 Hz curved visual orgasm. This screen looks great and has good colors. I mainly use it for browsing light gaming text editing nothing crazy. I'm very happy with the way it looks and it was a perfect addition for my laptop
5,Tiene una estructura muy sólida que además permite rotarlo girarlo y ajustarlo en altura.
4,En general está bien el monitor. Me hubiera gustado que tuviera alguna salida de audio (3.5 mm p.e.) y la posibilidad de subir o bajar la altura.
5,Très heureuse de mon achat.
5,Excelente Monitor para Oficina
2,Thin bezel adjustable stand. Text is a little blurry and contrast is kinda low. Dell monitors are priced above competition unless they go on sale. Returned for a similar priced HP.
4,Overall is good except there was damaged hole on the packing box. Lucky there wasn't any damage inside box.If I buy a new item I expect I would receive everything in acceptable condition including the packing.
5,Using it with Macbook pro 2017 and working so far so good.It comes with matt screen and anti reflective coating.Stand is super sturdy and display can be moved in almost every possible and usable angle.Being a P series monitor its colour accuracy seems good.and oh yes the side bezells are too slim so its a pretty good show off .Good job from DELL.
5,Todo estaba muy bien poriqe realmente ha estado en la misma posición al momento de agarrar para subir la pantalla de manera delicada este se daño no tiene ni un golpe!!!
5,Très pratique pour le télétravail.
5,Monitor muy bueno lo puedes mover a la posicion que quieras y esta hecho de buenos materiales. Y sobre todo trae los pues usb que me es muy util ya que la mayoria de monitores en este rango de precio no incluyen. Y en general tiene todos los puerto mas usados menos el de audio.
5,Excelente monitor la calidad de la imagen es perfecta el tamaño 24 pulgadas es ideal para el trabajo con código o conexiones remotas.
5,Buena calidad y practicidad.  Tiene 2 puertos USB laterales de fácil acceso.  Y otros dos atrás.  Muy buena pantalla.  Compré 2.
5,Si me gusto y hasta el momento funciona muy bien con una gran calidad de imagen.
4,En general el monitor está bien y me parece buena relación calidad-precio lo utilizo para desarrollo y es cómodo para Home Office.
5,Es la primera vez que adquiero un monitor y este me encanto porque se puede girar poner en vertical y tiene entradas USB funcionales es un descanso a la vista
5,Perfect for my needs. I use it for office purposes. The stand is height adjustable which is key to my setup. The screen resolution is crisp clear and I appreciate the ‘reading’ preset mode.
5,Me gusta la calidad en monitores dell

5,gran calidad en la imagen y resolución
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La calidad de los materiales así como su construcción se sienten sólida y da la sensación premium.La imagen es nítida considero que tiene el brillo suficiente para ambientes iluminados aunque hay mejores lo que es exquisito en este monito es la calidad fidelidad y profundidad de los colores hace que todas las imágenes te den esa sensación HDR.Tiene HDMI DISPLAYPORT y hub de usb para accesorios adicionales.Aunque no lo utilizo para algunos les será muy útil el cambio de posiciones que tiene este monitor ya que se puede usar incluso de manera vertical.Lo único para hacer a este monitor perfecto es que tenga una tasa de actualización mayor (FPS).
5,Use it as a second monitor in my office. Side by side with the monitor that was at my desk and is now next to this my old monitor has got to go. Need to replace with a second one of these. Easy on the eyes. Crisp picture.
4,MUY BUEN MONITOR CON EXCELENTE IMAGEN Y RELACION PRECIO/CALIDAD
4,Alors cela fait presque 1 ans que j'ai commandé cette article et je suis toujours satisfaite de mon achats qui devient même un bon investissement. Reçu en bonne états bien emballer rien à dire. Pour les dimension je trouve quel sont bien l'écran est large  (comme mentionnée) pour ce qui est du poids je ne le trouve pas lourd et par conséquent pas difficile à déplacer cette écran est amplement suffisent à l'utilisation de j'en fait c'est à dire mes études et je l'utilise même pour Netflix.
5,The metal base makes it stable anywhere you put the monitor. The quality is great good price.
5,Excelente monitor los colores el brillo el tamaño perfecto.
4,Estoy encantado con este monitor. Hay opciones similares por mejores precios y con una mayor tasa de refresco (75 al menos) pero opté por este porque rara vez se hablaba en las reseñas de backlight bleeding o IPS glow. Efectivamente cumplió en esos frentes mi unidad apenas y muestra señales de esos síntomas.Lo más destacable de este modelo es la ergonomía: básicamente lo puedes poner o girar como tú quieras además de que la base la verdad luce bastante sólida. Todo bien por ese lado donde el monitor deja un poco que desear es en la calidad de imagen. Los colores no son tan vivos como esperaba lo cual es extraño al tratarse de un panel IPS y es de ley que hay que calibrar la pantalla para tener la mejor imagen posible la configuración predeterminada es un tanto cálida de más. Fuera de eso la pantalla cumple con lo que se espera de un panel IPS.Lo uso para trabajar y jugar con mi Nintendo Switch. Cumple respetablemente ambas tareas y no tengo queja alguna. A día de hoy sin embargo sugeriría que se compraran los modelos de Dell más nuevos como el S2421HC que tiene dos entradas HDMI y altavoces integrados todo por alrededor del mismo precio.
5,en general el producto es de mi agrado por eso la calificación de la encuesta
5,Great product....

5,Ya tenia un monitor de estos que compré en la dell pero al ver que podia obtenerlo aquí y necesitaba otro entonces lo pedí. Buen tiempo de entrega y excelente monitor
5,The monitor is used for everyday work with texts. Very comfortable picture the image is clear without glare and flicker. My wife is very happy.
5,This is a professional grade monitor that is built to last. They use these in my lab and I ordered myself one as soon as the pandemic hit. Great for a dual monitor setup! They rotate in all directions and are excellent for rotating vertically. I use this very frequently when coding. I have a pretty small to medium sized desk space but I'm very happy I picked the 24 inch instead of the 22 inch. I paid $239.40 CA for this product so anything this price and lower is a great value. I've seen them listed for over $300 so definitely wait for the price to fluctuate down to it's normal price when buying.
5,Good for coding
5,Sus giros lo hacen muy eficiente. Yo lo utilizo para trabajar y cumple con las expectativas.

5,This Monitor came in quickly and was packaged well. It's solid provides great quality and is perfect to hook up with my work laptop and I'm able to work with my laptop. I'm thinking of purchasing a second one so I don't have to use my Laptop screen. Would highly recommend it.
