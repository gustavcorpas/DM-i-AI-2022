5,I really liked it. It's big enough and color changes are really good for gaming
5,Keyboard doesn't fit as it should I think it should be a little bigger
5,This is perfect for gaming it is I would recommend and buy for someone as a gift
5,really clean lays flat easy just iron it out and it will smooth right out. Showed up before 8am and i already love it lol
5,Works great rgb is solid.
5,Looks super clean and has many color options
4,This is a nice quality and good mouse pad the RGBs are really nice but when I got it it didn‚Äôt come with the cord and it was absolutely ginormous.
5,Looks aweosme mouse moves amazing easy to use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The comments didn‚Äôt lie this thing is amazing it‚Äôs almost to good to be this price! Seriously don‚Äôt hesitate buy it‚Ä¶ my gaming station looks even better now
5,Good quality very good size works perfectly. My son is a Gamer and my Hubby DJ on his free time
5,I love that is so easy to clean. Pretty good size and in general is a really good item
4,Also the cable you plug it into easily gets removed. I just got this and haven't cleaned it yet but hope its easy to clean.
5,Not much to say except that works as promised does it‚Äôs job well. And is an extremely good value for the money.
3,Like the title said the pictures are somewhat misleading. It can only display two colors at once so you dont get a full RGB effect. It shines a light into some kind of fluid lighting up the inside of the tube. You can't have different colors in different spots like in the pictures which was disapointing. The actual mousepad is good however. Its material feels nice (except for the sowing connecting the tube to the mouspad which is scratchy) and it is very flexible but tends to bend a little. Its very grippy on the bottom but smooth on the top making this a good mousepad in general. But unless it goes under 10$ (I got it for 9$) I wouldn't buy it.
4,It‚Äôs a good size and good colors. It‚Äôs not a problem but it wasn‚Äôt as bright and the color transitions weren‚Äôt as smooth as i hoped. It‚Äôs also not super thin but i don‚Äôt mind the edges as i have a wrist rest. Compared to prices of things like Razer if you don‚Äôt mind not having color customization it‚Äôs perfect.
5,I had low expectations for the price -- and was pleasantly surprised.  The RBG trim is flat so it doesn't cut into your wrists.  The button to change functions is handy accessible and works as expected.  The surface is smooth and perfect for everyday use and of course for gaming.If you want an extra large surface with lighting this one ticks all the boxes and has no right being this inexpensive.
5,Awesome pad for my keyboard and mouse not to mention it really brings the setup together
5,Great size. The material is thin but nice quality. Nice bright light on the edges of the pad. The light can be turned off but you have to cycle thru all 15 light modes to get to the off position. A minor annoyance but considering the price - it is great!
5,This mouse pad came quickly and with everything well intact. The colors are very vivid and nice to help light up my gaming desk area. I have my keyboard and mouse also set to cycle through a "breathing colors" cycle and this mouse pad fits in really nicely. The material is soft as well. Now in the daytime I mostly just set the colors to off as that's my preference and that's really easy to do because you just have to hold down the little "flopad" button for a second or 3. The only thing I can think of that could be improved is that around the edge where the led lights are sewn into the pad it's fairly soft.. but the plastic+stitching is a bit harder than the rest of the pad. I mention it because that's where my wrist rests most of the time for where my desk is positioned. It would be nice if that edge or "rim" of the pad had a bit more cushioning.Great pad low price great deal!
5,Works great. Plenty of space for laptop and mouse or other things. Nice and bright and lots of color options. Pretty much a night light if you wanted it to be.
5,so good
5,I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas as he asked for a gaming set up for his Nintendo Switch. I bought a keyboard and mouse that lights up the same color way and it exactly what he wanted so when I say this I went for it. The mat is very large which was nice he was able to put his key board on it and still have a substantial amount of room for his mouse. I got it all set up and he loved it but when I plug it in he was so excited and gave me a huge hug. I couldn't be happier with this item. Will purchase again
4,I love it.
5,I like having the large continuous area for both my keyboard and mouse and the surface works fine for my mouse sensitivity needs even with games.It's stylish looking and the lighted piping around the edge is nice.I eat and drink at my desk so I found it to be fairly easy to clean either with a dab of water for a spot or using a small rigid style paint brush for brushing off dust and crumbs.I keep such a brush around my workstation normally for my keyboard and monitor edges.
5,I like the fact like you can change the RGB settings to slow fast solid pulsate ext. just a little uncomfortable when playing but nothing I can‚Äôt stand just have to reposition my arm/ wrist and all is good üëçüèº
3,It's a mouse pad. Thought it was battery operated but it has to stay wired to a USB power source. But that's my fault for not reading thoroughly. Sure would have been easy to add a battery and a USB dongal.
5,Got this for my husband for fathers day and he absolutely loved it!
5,This mouse pad is killer for 18 bucks. My partners sister got into gaming and wanted a small battle station. It was nice to be able to use this as a budget option Incase she didn't enjoy gaming. Not quite as nice as the expensive ones though but it's held up just fine since Christmas. Would buy again in a heartbeat would recommend to anyone looking for a good price.
4,Slight fraying when product arrived. No other issues.
5,Es suave al tacto y los colores de las luces alrededor se ven nitidos
5,Looks and works great lights look awesome
5,This feel good and looks great with the lights
5,My son loves the mouse pad. It's got plenty of room to move around for gaming and he loves the leds.
5,This mouse pad is really cool when lit up and in the dark! You can set the LED's to most colors (red green blue etc...). Very simple and easy to setup. If needed to clean it I would recommend using a rag with a bit of soap and hot water as washing may damage it.
5,Works great lights up. Kiddos love it.
4,The product was good quality lights are vibrant USB cable was a good length for my needs only complaint is it took a while for the edges to relax and straighten out from shipping would buy again if needed.
5,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother a few months ago. It was a pleasant surprise just how much he loved it - he'd asked for a new mouse pad but had never considered one this size before. He loved messing with the lights and how the size let him just roll it up and take it with him everywhere for a more comfortable gaming experience. The product looks exactly like the pictures and the lights are great I highly recommend this!!
5,Love the colors and the ability to change the colors.  The length is perfect for gaming!
5,This mousepad is a steal. Looks really nice on my desk
4,I haven't had any issues with my mouse being able to track with this mousepad The RGB is fine although a bit annoying at night. Hopefully the mousepad doesn't develop any issues in the long term but right out of the box there doesn't seem to be any.
5,This is an excellent premium gaming mousepad suitable for all gamers.  It provides extra space with a non-slip design.  The fabric and build quality are top-notch and second to none.  The dimensions are given.  Simple measure and ensure your desk has enough space and purchase.  You will not regret this purchase.  It has nice LED colors and an extremely easy setup.  This will make any gamer happy.  Purchase with confidence it is a great product.
5,Large enough for keyboard and 2 mice or keyboard mouse and controller (See pictures). LED light is bright but not overly bright or distracting. I've basically left it plugged in for about a month straight with no issues so far. Cycling through the color options is really simple just keep pressing one button until you find a style that you like. The material is what you'd expect in a nice mousepad. I'm really satisfied with it. I wish they sold it in a larger size to cover my uunusually large desk. A+ product and transaction thanks.
3,Purchased two I like them but on of them stopped working after two months
5,I got this one to compare to some of the more expensive brands like U-tech1st below the monitor is this brand2nd is competitors and I've had 2 of them look the same way
5,The gaming pad is very big plenty of space for mouse and keyboard. The colors are fun too.
4,It's a good size fits my.mouse and my keyboard and all I love it exactly what I needed. Love that it changes colors that's a plus it matches my mouse changing color
4,It was a good mousepad large size nice quality and generally felt nice. I unfortunately had to return it due to the large size but if you have the space I recommend it.
4,Ordered for my 13 year old gamer. He loved it; comfortable large and easy to clean.
5,I got this for my son for Christmas along with a light up keyboard and mouse and it fits his entire work space and gaming area perfectly not to mention it matches his keyboard and mouse and the while lite show he has going on in his room! It did get some soda spilled on it and it cleaned very nicely and it doesn't seem to get stained or anything like that! Will purchase another one for my other son!
5,exceeds expectations
4,Bought this item as a Christmas gift for my older brother and he loved it ! Can‚Äôt wait for him to use it ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a game freak lol
4,Great for space that I have perfect.
5,I really like this mouse pad it has so much room for my laptop and mouse honestly you have enough room to put a coaster and a drink on it. Its about the length of the width of a twin-sized mattress (it will fit whatever keyboard or laptop you have. And the lights are so pretty!! they're bright and there are 12 different modes you can do. It looks sturdy and well made. I am really happy with this purchase :)
5,This desk pad pays off. I've had it for about a month now. Still super smooth and comfy. I don't got a wrist rest but atleast it keeps my wrists off the desk. It fit my desk perfectly (even on the corners) and didn't slide around or anything. Once I put it down it was grounded and stayed. Never had to move it. Gives me enough room for both my full sized keyboard and mouse. I think it was well worth it
4,The mouse pad is great! It looks cool when I'm gaming! I would highly recommend this to others.
4,Works great wish it was a bit brighter but even still it‚Äôs so good- especially for the price. Can‚Äôt beat it
5,Bought this for my son who is just getting into gaming. It's fantastic because his keyboard fits on it and there is still plenty of room for his mouse. It also pairs nicely with his LED strip lights he has in his room. It's also really easy to clean. Its high quality and at a great price point.
5,Looks and works great. I only wish the material was not so soft.If I want to write on a piece of paper that is on top of it the pen will create a hole in the paper from the pen point. You need to put a harder surface between the Mouse pad and the paper.  I will be purchasing two more for my other two computers at work and remote office.
4,Product is bigger then I expected. I like that it glows all the time while plugged in.
4,Wish it was closer to 15‚Äù wide but besides that‚Äôs it‚Äôs great. No issue with RGB.
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my Son he was thrilled it's large and covers the majority of his desk.  I thought the lighting on it would be overwhelming and distracting from his screen and it isn't.Also he's a teenager=Picky typically I don't bother surprising him with anything gaming related so the fact that he loves it says a lot.
5,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He's been wanting one simple but never wanted to pay so much for a rgb mat. I didn't have to much to buy an expansive one so this seemed so simple. My boyfriend loves it so much and he really did not mind how simple it was. He was excited he can still change the rgb with a button. So happy!
5,I like that it's a awesome sized mouse pad and has rgb lights around it. Just a fancy way to set up your gaming setup. Bought it as a gift for my brother and he says that it matches his setup perfect so job well done on this one.
4,Rgb isn‚Äôt super bright and has a few options but it a good budget option
4,This is a nice product
5,This mouse pad is definitely worth the money. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loved it. The lights are fun and customizable which I really appreciated. As far as quality the mouse pad is super soft and durable making it perfect for gaming. All in all I'm thoroughly satisfied with this product!
5,Works great. No issues with mouse and lights are good. Had no issues getting to to flatten out. Did have to add some weights due to it being rolled up. But over all good item.
5,It‚Äôs really dope but doesn‚Äôt come with instructions so it took a minute to figure it out.
5,These is the best oversized mouse pad I've had I love the different light modes around the edge great quality for the price. This is so nice I bought a second one.  If I had one criticism that would be that the power connector is a little bulky but that would not stop me from buying this product. I love it.
5,I love the fact that it matches all my sons accessories and he was thrilled to receive it as a gift. Now his mouse moves more freely without falling off the smaller mouse pad he used to use.  He is very happy with it.  I gave it a 5 star rating.
5,If you want to spend little money and have an excellent product that complements your desktop this should be your choice. It is so big as to have your keybord and your mouse with enough space to be comfortable you can move them as you want and they will not interfere with each other. It is soft to the touch and has a non-slip base that cannot go unnoticed. And the colors the colors are beautiful. I love this product.
5,Bought this keyboard mouse pad for my kids new gaming system and they love it the color are cool and lights up!
5,This mouse pad is great the button easily toggles RGB settings and the lights look good. Great buy.
5,I bought it for my brother as a Christmas gift. The RGB that's around the mousepad is very shining even when the lights are out at night. Also it's a huge mousepad that fit the keyboard and the mouse together which is a plus. I would definitely order it again.
5,Great value mousepad.Comes with the cable and mousepad and was easy to set up.Many different colors and modes that look great.Material is soft and the rubber on the back of the mousepad provides great grip.This is a Great mousepad and i would recommend it for the price.
4,Good value for gaming
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†A mi hijo le gusto mucho y a mi tambi√©n. su superficie es muy lisa y el mouse se desplasa sin problemas.en los juegos uhc de minecraft no ha tenido problema. las luces son un a√±adido muy bonito y tiene varios modos para cambiar. llego a Colombia en 25 d√≠as normalmente se demoran 10 pero es que lo compre a mitad de diciembre.
5,Came earlier than expected. This mousepad is the exact size I was looking for and fit in the spot I needed to perfectly. The dimensions were correctly listed as well. No issues hooking up the pad plug and play. Pad cycles through colors as described but I prefer the green.
5,Do not pass up! I got mine a little over a month now and I always get compliments it matches my RGB mouse and keyboard. A must have for any computer desk. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect mouse pad.
5,As advertised.  Great value.  I was just going to buy a large mouse pad but this is way better.
3,Worked amazing after a week or two but after that my green legs stopped lighting only giving me red blue and purple. it appears to be with the connection of the micro usb. the green only worked when the cable was pressed down applying pressure to the connection and there was an audible click when it was pressed and the green started working again. I will be returning but it still is a very affordable and comfortable rub mouse pad. price did dictate the quality of the lights but other than that it is a good product.side note- it is fairly easy to clean instructions recommend no wet wipes or an liquid really-air duster cleans it pretty well however
5,I brought this mouse pad for my son to use while playing his gaming pc and he loves it he said its more comfortable than a regular mouse pad and enhances his gaming experience with the lights
5,Honestly a good mousepad for the money. It‚Äôs a good size not too big or small. Takes up 1/2 of my desk leaving me space for my pc and decorations. Rgb is very bright and nice. Overall if you‚Äôre looking for a cheap but good mousepad I‚Äôd recommend this one
4,Fortnite Kbm
4,Works great
5,Honestly for the price you really can't find anything to complain about. It truly is large so it comfortably covers a good amount of surface. I like it because it's a simple black mat  but the LED border adds a nice touch but isn't overwhelming.
5,Good size . Doesn‚Äôt wrinkle and has a lot of color modes
5,I love this. The colors are so fun and bright. I makes my workspace so cheerful.
5,This mousepad is great. The settings have a very wide range of colors and is nice for a gaming layout. It's also long enough to fit my mousepad and keyboard on. It creates a great aesthetic especially for those with gaming setups.
5,Got it for my son for Christmas and he loves it. He loves that it‚Äôs big enough to go under the key board and still use the mouse. The lights are really bright and is well made. Can‚Äôt beat it for the price!
5,The keyboard pad was a gift for my son and he loves how it matches with his keyboard and mouse.  He also has led strip lights that goes with the lights on the keyboard pad so it looks neat together.
5,I bought this as a gift for my adult gamer son and he tells me how much he likes it. It matches his computer set up and was exactly what he wanted. Definitely worth the price and I would recommend to others.

5,
5,Bright lights
2,Very cheap like it came straight from China. Not comfortable to use at all. The mat and felt is ok. I would look to something much more high quality.
5,I like how it can have different colors along the edges
5,very pretty!
5,Excellent
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I bought this large mouse pad to go under my key but it's too large to go in the keyboard drawer. It's a nice mouse pad but the lights are not as bright and vibrant like my small one is.
5,Great RGB mat. Very spacious and good price
5,It‚Äôs sturdy world great!
3,Meh
1,Received this in good time but the mouse pad's box was ripped open also didn't match any of the boxes shown in other photos. The material felt off but mostly it weighs a lot less than my existing almost identical mouse pad. The weight (or lack there of) causes the edges to not lay flat at all. Tried a couple of things to get it to lay flat but nothing worked. Returning.
1,The packaging was the first hint something was wrong. It had obviously been opened and taped again.  When it was unrolled there were stains and a hair. There is also damage to the power plug. It is going back with hope the second one will not look like this.
1,Wouldn't turn on at all very disappointed
1,The saler didn't supply everything in the description they leave out the power cable in order to operate it which is in the description of the item. Don't buy this item.
3,Really enjoy the texture and the different modes for the lights but unfortunately the creases and waviness are deal breakers for me. I've tried laying heavy flat objects on it for days on end ironing it and stretching it out. It hasn't gotten even a little flatter.If it weren't for the waves and creases it'd easily be a 5 star product.
4,Great size color selections are nice.  Son loves it for his gaming station.
4,This mousepad is great for the money although it takes time to flatten out especially in cold weather.  The lights aren't particularly bright.  Overall this mousepad is great for every budget gamer out there.
5,I purchased this mouse pad for my nephew and he Loves it especially the color changing lights.
5,I purchased this mat for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! The LED lights work great and the mat is big enough for his keyboard and mouse with space around it still.
5,LED lights are vibrant and the mouse pad is just as pictured. It comes rolled up so it does need to be weighed down for a little to flatten it out more. So far no issues! Great find.
5,I‚Äôd post a picture but my boyfriend is currently enjoying it; it‚Äôs a little big for his current desk but he‚Äôs going to take it back up to school. Lights aren‚Äôt too bright and overall he loves it :)
5,It is amazing!!
5,100/100 Love it! Different lighting modes and fits perfectly on your desk.
5,I bought this for my son and he liked it very much.It has different color settings. absolutely value for the money.Very large and not too  flimsy.Just perfect!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It's was very good its comfortable and I like how it's glowing
5,This mouse pad is awesome! It has FIFTEEN different light modes! It fits whatever theme i am going for with my gaming setup and looks awesome! The material it is made out of is really nice too my mouse glides across it perfectly when playing any FPS. If you are looking for a large gaming mouse pad with RGB look no further. This is the best you will find for the best price!
5,Bought for my 15 yo son for his birthday. He loved it. The size is great his keyboard and mouse fit nicely and the lights around the edge are an added plus.
5,Nice mousepad-lights are really cool!  Large enough for gaming and good material
5,I got this for my grandson.  he likes it
5,This is a great purchase. The lights are really cool and it is big enough to fit my keyboard mouse and still have extra space. I would definitely recommend this!!
5,This gaming mouse pad is fantastic. It's quality is on the same level as name brand gaming pads at a fraction of the price. The stitching is consistent and sturdy and it has your usual mix up of colors to customize your setup.
5,Honestly this was way better than I thought it was the lights aren‚Äôt to bring that they are distracting. It‚Äôs smooth and easy to use and can fit in just about anywhere.
5,Forget good for the price this thing is the best choice. Even my crappy mouse slides on this thing. Has a nice comfortable feeling and fits my full size keyboard and mouse perfectly. Making me feel like my profession is a streamer.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Good mouse pad with RGB lights... cause who doesn't have an rgb light problem right now?! I posted a video. Its a super smooth mouse pad also. Good for a gaming mouse
5,I had one of these at work and I gave it away when I started working from home.  I now have my office set-up at home and I purchased this gaming pad and the quality is so much nicer and the lights are brighter.  I am so happy with this purchase.
5,Llego r√°pido y muy buena calidad. Mi nieto est√° feliz
5,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my gaming brother in law and he loves it! Thank you for producing such good quality additions to gaming rooms and they are good sized as well. I would definitely reccomend this.
5,It was packaged very well I have a logitech g512 and a logitech g502 hero and works well with it the size was a lot bigger than i thought so size is not an issue this is probably the easiest thing i‚Äôve cleaned off i spilt some crumbs and more and all i had to do was whipe it off with my hand no Rag or spray no nothing easy to clean setting up was super easy and the lights are easy to use and is bright as well highly recommend this product
5,Great mouse pad make sure to check out the measurements as it's pretty big.  Good deal.
5,This newer model has greatly improved on its brightness!  The colors are more vibrant this time around.  If you're looking for a great addition to your pc setup this is it!  The price for what you get can't be beat either.
5,Good for very long desktop
5,Great mouse pad be sure to use on top of desk as it is too big for a keyboard tray.
5,This is a great mouse pad for gaming! It works great and the lights are an added bonus!
5,I used it for my gaming setup.
5,Very nice to have the extra room for mouse pad. Love the lights good for gaming...so says my son.
5,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it!  Keeps the keyboard and mouse from sliding and the lights are an added touch.  Came as described and seems to be well made.
5,I had recently purchased an almost identical pad from another manufacturer but the quality control was embarrassing to say the least. It was an absolute mess where the pad met the fiber and immediately returned it. Found this pad at an even lower price but higher reviewed and pulled the trigger. Couldn't be more pleased--the pad itself is free of flaws the fiber border is perfect and all stitching is even/clean throughout. Look no further!
5,Good quality
5,Great quality. Lights are pleasing to the eyes and option to select your wall paper theme.
5,The mouse pad is large enough for a full-size keyboard and aggressive moves with the mouse. The colors go well with my RGB lights on my pc and all other peripherals. Highly recommended.
5,I love the size of the mat. It is large enough to rest my phone keyboard and mouse on the pad.  I also like that it is sturdy. I have sent back many flimsy mouse pads that could not withstand the gaming test.  Thanks for a great product.
5,Great value for the money. Nice thickness large size and excellent choice of RGB lighting- very satisified with this purchase.
5,Nice mousepad cool lighting features good size fits my keyboard and my mouse
5,I bought this as a gift for a friend and he absolutely loves it. He is able to use it at his desk or transfer it to his laptop stand. He also said he loves the colors! I really suggest buying this for your gaming friends.
5,Great product great price super fast!
5,A lot of other rgb mousepads are harder to use than this one. This rgb mousepad is a extremely easy to use. I also like how you can turn it off just by holding the power button. Excellent product.
5,I really like the size and that the lights have so many settings.
5,I bought this for my son and it is really cool. As you can see it has tons of room for all of your stuff that goes on your desk he has a ton of extra space for other things because of how large it is. Great buy for a great price.
5,I loved everything about it. Works great!
5,I bought this for my desk at work and it‚Äôs great to not have to worry about my mouse sliding off a mouse pad that‚Äôs too small. It‚Äôs plenty large enough to fit my mouse and keyboard.
5,I bought this mouse pad for my son who is a gamer. He said he likes it because it is big and comfortable and the light works well. He would like the lights to move around instead of only changing color but I think he's asking too much. My own experience it that it feels good using it and you'd never run out of space. We have optical and "dark field" mice that supposedly don't need a mouse pad. However our desks are painted white and the mice really don't work well with white background. This mouse pad is great.
5,This is a great mouse pad both in size and features due to the 15 light patterns. Goes perfect with my G512 and G502! Love the size! Highly recommend if you are looking for a quality oversized gaming pad.
5,Just what my son was looking for. Gaming mouse pad changes colors as my son is playing games. He loves it. The price is also perfect. Would totally recommend!!!

1,The edges fold up really badly on one side. Maybe a way they were storing it? looks kinda trashy not a fan.UPDATE from 2 to 1 star seller claims its fine then when I persisted to show more photos they finally said "ok just send it back and we will replace it".Thing is like 20 bucks if I'm gonna wait like that I'd rather just return it get my money back and get a better one so I'm sure it won't be garbage like this one.
5,I bought this for my daughter.  The pad is as advertised and had no issues with it. I would buy it again. The large size was the best part of it and why I bought it for her.
5,Excellent product. Mouse has perfect traction and a very cool design.
5,Bought for my son he says great.
5,worth it
5,The mousepad is smooth and very soft to tye touch. Perfect for my gaming setup. Thank you!
5,
5,Very nice mouse pad and good value.
5,Very nice mouse pad and good value.
5,This pad has a standard grippy underside with a very smooth and tightly woven top layer. Some pads you will notice have some slight drag to them due to the material used for the top layer but this pad doesn't suffer from that. I feel like it enhances my mouse movement as I'm using it and helps with micro adjustments where needed. I would classify this as a good in between of speed pad and an accuracy pad great middle ground for people looking to have the best of both worlds on a budget. The rgb is nice and the shine through is especially noticeable as the led strip is translucent instead of diffused as some other pads do. This gives it a really unique look in my opinion which I think looks really cool almost like liquid flowing through the strip around the pad. The cable is micro usb and the plug is very sturdy and feels solid when you plug it in no fear of it bending or coming lose if you have things around the pad that might interfere with it. The size is also very nice too as I find it perfect for your average desk to use on either a work from home setup or if you're simply gaming or casually browsing the web. Not too short that it will rub against your wrist/palm as you're using it which is a big plus. If you're looking for a decently priced large mouse pad with a very smooth glide I would recommend this one.
5,Great value for the price! Fast service ~ great company
5,Photos don't do it justice colors are so vivid and bright! Transition between colors is also very smooth unlike the low quality rgb mouse pads. It's the perfect size for a keyboard and mouse with room left for a coaster. The material is very easy to clean also the mouse moves effortlessly on the pad. No driver or software is needed as everything is controlled by a button. You can't go wrong at this price name brands charge double or more for the same features.
5,My brother loves it. It's a good-sized keyboard pad. It's smooth and fits my brother's set-up perfectly. It came quickly just in time for Christmas.
5,Really love this mouse pad! It's my favorite mouse pad ever! Definitely worth the price. I thought it would have been too big for the area I an using it it but it fits perfectly. Definitely would buy another one if something happens to this one.
5,Love the comfort and lights
5,Great mouse pad. Perfect size and awesome to use while gaming. Colored edged light up real nice
5,Love all the colors and features absolutly love it
5,Love how big the mouse pad is and the rgb lighting matches my pc.
5,Awesome pad. Love the LED
5,Just like the product description. Great product.
5,Great product
4,It's a great product the only downside is that the lights are dim but it has great material and is large
5,Perfect Christmas gift for my son's new gaming desk. Sturdy product and very affordable.
5,Way better than the previous version has perfect controls for RGB and lighting styles.  Lays FLAT (no raised edges) mouse glides very smoothly minimalistic branding and cable size. Great product!
5,Nice mouse pad üëçüèª Loved the colors better than my old one.
5,Great product! As long as you are not fussed about all your RGB products being in sync with one another this mat is everything you could need. Great size. Great build quality
5,This pad is awesome! Very confortable and firm. The variety of colors is excellent. Highly recommend.
5,I liked this so much I ordered three of them:  one for work one for my home office and one for the kiddos.  I especially like that it cuts down on keyboard noise during web conferencing and makes for an all around more comfortable keyboarding experience.About the only thing I do not like is the light part of the pad is wrapped with a fishing-line-like material that can be a bit rough on the wrists so make sure you push your keyboard forward.
5,This product matches the description and we are pleased with the product.
5,amazing mouse pad. Big
4,The lights work great not very bright but for the price you can‚Äôt go wrong with this product. You can also detach the usb cable from the mousepad it self so if you want to use it without great feature. Would recomend 8.5/10
5,This mouse pad is the perfect option for anyone on a budget its able to fit both my mouse and keyboard and is super smooth for  my mouse.
5,Love it!
5,Great mouse pad great size...great quality.  It's perfect!
5,I used to have similar no-name brand pad like this which was about $23 and it eventually got stain. I found the similar product which was much cheaper and still looks the same so I purchased it.I am actually very surprised that the quality is actually better while being cheaper. It is more thicker and mouse movement is more smooth.If you are looking for an affordable pad I highly recommend this!
5,This was a great gift for my Kids to put in there rooms. So many color changes
5,This thing is great for its price rgbs are on point never had any problems with it really comfy easy to clean you can use wipes or whatever you need to clean it with and overall really comfy this is a must if you are on a budget.
5,I would definitely recommend this product very comfortable
5,I would definitely recommend this product very comfortable
5,Very nice and useful give my desk that extra look it needs. Very happy with it
5,good bang for the buck. a basic pad with no RGB costs the same as much.
5,Bought for my son and he loves it! It's great size and the lights around it look so cool.
5,I like the way the color is integrated nicely on the outline. Bright colors but not overly. Build quality surprisingly impressive based on first impressions.
5,I like it
5,I like this gaming pad. It is very soft. Great buy! You will not regret it.
5,Great mouse pad! Very large and lights are bright! My last one like this finally went out after 2 years of abuse and drink spills so I know the durability is great. Light patterns and color tones fits perfectly with my other RGB schemes. Will add photos after a cleaning of my setup.
5,The size is perfect for my setup. Colors are bright and everything just looks clean. Won‚Äôt look anywhere else.
5,Makes my WFH time so much easier. I especially like the Led lighting.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This mouse pad is a great deal.I looked at other ones and for example a tiny 8 x 8 with no lights would be the same price at places like target. This one is much bigger the colors are really bright and it‚Äôs really well put together.I would recommend this to friends and family and definitely would buy it again
5,Looks great and the quality is great too
5,Works amazingly! I have been using it for almost a month now I beleive and I have had no issues! It automatically saves your previous light settings which is really nice! I‚Äôve noticed others say that it became wavy but I believe this is an issue for all mousepads in general. As for me however mine has yet to become wavy and it‚Äôs flat.
5,Very nice pad very large colors look great!
5,It is sturdy and thick for a mouse pad. The person I gave it to loved it and I love the rgb lights it has.
5,Bought two of theses for my boys desks and they love them!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†TLDR: watch the video.The picture shows what you get in the box.Very large with ample space for keyboard and other accessories. I personally have my keyboard a large wrist cushion the size of my keyboard and a wrist V support on my mouse side and still have plenty of room to maneuver my mouse.The material is very well made and feels very nice. High quality and at the price point it cannot be beat. They are so nice I actually own two of them.The RGB is very nice and looks great with my set up.
4,The large mouse pad came well packaged and the RGB works as intended. I only wish it could be a little bit brighter to match my keyboard backlight. The material feels nice and it looks premium.
5,It works perfectly and it is good material. Very confortable and the RGB options are plenty.
5,Good quality mouse pad Bright RGB lights.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I really love this product I think personally it is really great and for the price it is very reasonable the fabric is just10/10
5,The colors on the lights are very vibrant and it‚Äôs big enough for my entire laptop to sit on plus enough out to the side for my mouse. Very pleased.
5,I really like it thanks.
5,Love it just the right size. Cool color changing lights. Just what I needed and at the right price point. I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt be able to clean it but dirty spot washed right off with a damp towel.
5,I love the pretty lights and how big it is. Looks good with my gaming pc
5,Perfecto üëå
5,This pad has 14 modes of lighting so many options to choose from! It‚Äôs large enough for a keyboard and then some And it stays on the desk without movement. I recommend this pad over others!
5,I am very pleased with this purchase. Fits my desk perfectly and I love how it's easy to clean. It also has a light changing feature. Two thumbs up!
5,Not too many mouse pad comes with lights and this large size pad come with changing light show which added more pleasure to work longer on our keyboard and scrolling the mouse. Its colors are vivid and lively! Changes of different color tone is smooth. This pad does not move and very sturdy when place on the desk.  Its material feels soft easy to wipe clean and allows the mouse to move effortlessly on the pad.  A very high-quality product with much added values especially in this price level. A break from the normal.
5,This mouse pad is very sturdy and great value as a gift for someone building their first set-up. Easy to install just plug it into the USB port and that‚Äôs it! The RGBs have a good brightness and glow. Love it!
5,The lights are great and you have to do a good job at keeping it clean.
5,My son purchased for gaming device. He loves it.
4,The lights are kind of dim but they are bright where the LED's clump (the corners). It is also brighter right where the power cord enters. Power is fed to the pad via micro USB which is not shocking given the price. A more powerful power input (USB C maybe) to the pad would result in brighter LED's throughout the whole pad for sure. All in all for the price not bad.
5,The feel and look of this pad is one of the best I've had for the price. Highly would recommend
5,The product is great. The colors are good lots of different patterns mouse sensitivity is great. I love it my kid loves it it flows well with my desk very happy. Good job.
5,Fits my work area nicely. Plenty of room for my mouse even with a larger keyboard. The led lighting is easy to use and looks great too.
5,Received this item quick. Easy to use and connect. Lots of color options to choose from. Ended up buying 2 for me and my husband! Great deal with the coupon too!
5,Great product!
5,We like that the pad is large enough for our keyboard and mouse. Our mouse has a lot of range  versus an ordinary mouse pad. We love the LED lights! A must buy!
5,Overall this was a really good mouse pad. It is large enough for both my keyboard and mouse to sit on. The fabric is great and is water-resistant. It has numerous lighting modes and options. It is worth it!
5,I‚Äôve ordered this to make my setup complete. Straight out of the box it lays flat and has minimal wrinkles. The easy set up makes it nice too. You can even cycle through many different color displays. Definitely worth the price! Would recommend to anybody looking for a mouse pad.
5,Pretty good quality it is worth the price. Overall I like it. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the design that was printed in the mouse pad side. I was expecting it to be all black. It doesn‚Äôt bother me it‚Äôs still good!
5,i personally like it ive had no trouble with it and its quite cheap.
5,My son loves this mouse pad . Is big super comfortable. The lights change colors and have different patterns is super cool .
5,La verdad me ha gustado mucho est√° alfombra gamer ya que aunque no te lo diga los colores si se cambian solos y ademas es muy comoda la recomiendo mas por su precio
5,This is a great sized gaming mouse pad and performs as it should. The colors are very bright and vibrant and the patterns are cool too
5,Ive seen things like this going for x5 the price. This has good quality and looks fancy.
