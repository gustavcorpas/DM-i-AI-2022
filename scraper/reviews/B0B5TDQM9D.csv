5,Works great haven't used up a complete cartridge yet so can't comment on longevity.
5,Very good quality so far. Nice clear print. I'll be eager to see how many pages one ink cartridge will yield. If  good I'll surely buy it again.
3,The ink doesn’t work in my printer
5,Works just fine in my Canon printer
5,Arrived today. Plugged it in and printed 13 page application form no problem. So far so good. Don’t know how long it will last. Will update if it is a short life.
5,Printer easily accepted this aftermarket cartridge. Print quality is great
