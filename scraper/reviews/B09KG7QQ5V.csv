5,Our desktop does not have Bluetooth built-in so when my eldest daughter found love in a wireless headset she was devastated that they couldn't be used with the family computer.I had considered buying one of these adapters for years but always got hung up on brand price and specs.HoweverThis product is absolutely perfect for us. The affected distance is fairly small but the signal within that range is impressive.We highly recommend from a **just needed our device to have Bluetooth** standpoint.
5,So this works great and the range is excellent after a bit of a hiccup getting it installed. It only comes with a CD to install the drivers and like most computers today I don't have an optical drive. I used the link that people have mentioned here multiple times and is in the Q and As. But the thing that really threw me for a loop were the headphones I already had paired. I could not reconnect them nor forget them. Which after a bit of thought makes sense because they were paired to horrible BT device that came with this computer. I struggled trying to get it to remove the old paired devices but it seemed impossible. Finally I tried repairing them as though they are new devices and that worked great.The lesson? If you already have BT on your computer and have some things paired you should probably forget them before installing the drivers. I think it would have simplified things for me.This is not an issue with this device hence I am still giving it 5 stars. This is more in the way Windows handles having an existing BT driver replaced.
4,It was weirdly difficult to get the software installed for this. It’s not totally clear to me whether it’s even necessary. The software also came on a little thumb drive that was suspiciously just loosely placed in the box so I was worried I would download a virus. It seems to work fine now though. A big improvement considering bluetooth was basically nonexistent on my computer beforehand and now it works adequately.
5,Such an easy process up to now for the past two weeks there is no problem. Just  connect download your have a blue tooth connection for the selected blue tooth item in my case my speakers. From windows 7 old computer blue tooth service.
4,Super hard to find one of these things that is reasonably good. this one is. You need to install the broadcom drivers or it's essentially useless but that's about it. Otherwise it's great. It also has reasonably good range which is unheard of in USB BT dongles.
4,It comes with a USB drive that has a program loaded onto it you need to install to use it. I don't love that but a scan before and after installation did not show anything weird. Double check location settings before and after install. The antenna works great and I can actually use my Bluetooth speaker with my computer now!
5,Works great but range will obviously be shortened when the signal is going through walls. My headphones don't start cutting out until I'm nearly to the other side of my house. Very very happy and will be buying more fore my older PCs.
5,It has significantly improved Bluetooth quality on my PC and WiFi reception. My websites can be accessed clearer and faster than was possible before the installation of this device. The picture quality is sharper. Details are sharper. The improvement is noticeable.
5,Works well would recommend.
5,I connect a keyboard and a mouse to a Windows PC with it. Haven’t had any problems for about a month. It has a detachable antenna but I have not tested it without it. Also I have not tested it for the range advertised.
4,I’m using it to connect a Microsoft  bluetooth kit keyboard and mouse to my server located about 5 m way. The keyboard is working well the the mouse not. It lost contact.Any use for sound for a while.
4,Works as expected; no real advantage over a shorter bluetooth dongle; the antenna does not make much of a difference if your computer is under a heavy desk sadly but it works well overall
5,It took me a little time to get to the right place on my laptop for this to connect. It was great when it finally connected. Instructions are kinda hard to read!
4,I wanted to have access to a printer in my basement workshop and this allows me to print from my upstairs office without any further configuration. For me it is plug-and-play.
5,The antenna works well. My computer automatically downloaded the drivers and after a few clicks I was good to go…
5,I love the adapter I used it to connect my Bluetooth earbuds to my pc
5,I haven't gotten to use this yet but it appears to be well made
5,Muy buena exelente
5,Easy to install and works great
5,Needed to put on my pc so I could use wireless headphones. Easy install took 5 minutes.
5,I love it works for Fitbit. you do need a cd drive to install it but it works perfectly so far
5,If you want to play your phone through Bluetooth on a Windows 10 Computer you have to download the Bluetooth audio player from the windows store (It's Free)
5,it does its job
5,Worked perfectly right out of the box windows 10 detected and set up right away  connected to my new Sony headphone right away my FABULOUS Asus motherboard had no blutooth on board.
5,I will have this device connected to every computer I own til the day I die assuming the technology is still needed..My PC came with a dogwater bluetooth connection. Sitting with my face pressed against the case and at best I would get garbled static-y noise.This bluetooth connector was easy to install however the drivers are sent to you on a DISC!! So to install it I had to connect my external CD/DVD drive to download the driver. A little bit of a hassle when all my USB ports are taken up already and most people arent going to have the external drive and new PCs definitely dont come with them anymore.. From reviews looks like you can get the drivers online but just more hassle. So i gave four stars for "easy to install"...but the device itself is great works well I can get about 50 feet away before losing signal and not alot of walls in my way... I love it it was well worth the money. Im so happy to be able to use my wireless earbuds instead of a corded headset. Incredibly happy with this.
4,If you try and use a Realtek USB driver from Realtek it tells you the device is not authorized.
5,Works great. Better distance and objects do not block signal as much.
5,Keywords "Extended Range" - totally works.  I can now use my Bluetooth remote *from the other room*.At thought all of my interference issues were due to the device but it was the old bluetooth device in the computer.Realtek drivers means it's easy to install - picked up the Rii9 mini keyboard device right away.ADVICE:  You will need to remove other Bluetooth devices from your PC for this to work as in go to Device Manager Bluetooth > Uninstall device ANYTHING that says bluetooth remove it first.THEN and only then install this badboy...Good luck!
5,Very easy to setup and use. Thanks!
5,Works really well with no issues I am a little unhappy that it only has 5.1 support but I mean it even says it in the title.
5,I have no idea what was causing interference with my existing bluetooth - it worked fine for months then occasionally I'd just have signal dropouts that were frustrating. Having the larger antenna is likely the reason this works so much better. We'll see if this still happens in a few months time but I'm guessing this solved my issues. Not only is the signal strength to my connected PC devices stronger I can now see bluetooth devices scattered throughout my house that are on the other end.
5,The installation of the driver is a bit sketchy if you ask me (comes with an USB drive) but it installed flawlessly and the adapter works great. The range is quite impressive imho.
5,I got it so I could use my new Xbox controller across the room (20ft) when i wanna use my tv for pc games and it works great. Signal never drops and it's plug in play.
5,Easy to install easy to use!
4,Serves it's purpose fine but is a little slow.
5,I needed Bluetooth connectivity on an older laptop. This adapter worked as expected!
4,Pretty good. Long range. Disconnects once a week or so.
3,Inside house the range is bad. No better than builtin Bluetooth card. Great in open space.
5,Excellent!
3,The seller was fine. As far as I know the item was also.  Just not work with my setup.
5,I have two of these installed on an Unraid server. Each is connected to a different Windows 11 VM and they work perfectly.
5,Product works amazingly had an issue at first because of the previous Bluetooth was conflicting with it but after reading the Q&A I figured it out. It was kind of annoying having to search Q&A for solution for the download (product comes with install disk) because who has a cd drive anymore on a PC?Even with the few issues the product works amazing and has great signal. I can walk threw most of my house without it cutting out.
5,I use this on my windows 10 machine. It has no problem running my wh-1000xm3 headphones. It has more range the 3 other stubby BT adapters I have used. The headphones however have stupid built in profiles that refuse to do high quality sound with the mic on and this BT adapter can not fix that.  I also run 2 Xbox series X controllers from this and do not have any issues with disconnections after updating the X-box controller firmware.I would recommend this product without hesitation.It also worked in windows using windows drivers I think I dont think I needed to download any.It also works with the Windows 10 built in Bluetooth control panel.
5,I have tried out many of the Bluetooth dongles (at least 10-12) all of them had some short coming mostly "waking up" when not using the keyboard or mouse even though I had windows set to NOT to put the device to sleep Others would not pair properly etc. on and on! This one worked perfectly right off the bat and and has not given me any problem whatsoever. Super simple installation excellent range. A good deal at a very fair price.
5,Just what i neededIt helped connect my headphones and mouse and some vr equipment to my pc
5,Product was easy to use and worked as intended
5,I plugged this into my PC and it just worked.I use a Bluetooth transmitter for my PC and have a small receiver I plug wired earbuds into. I was using a small Bluetooth 5.0 dongle that kept cutting out at longer distances but this dongle solved that problem.Now I can walk around my home without any audio distortion. Just what I was looking for!
5,I had an older computer the wasn't Bluetooth capabile. This took care of the problem.
5,UPDATE 4/2022: Dealer contacted me apologized and offered a full refund even after I bought this half a year ago. That thing still don't work but at least they made an attempt to get it right.This worked fine for a while until a recent Windows 10 update. Since that day the audio keeps breaking up although i'm only 2 feet away from the antenna. Sometimes I miss 10% of the conversation which is unacceptable. This thing now shows with a exclamation mark in the device list and although I show the latest and greatest driver there seem to be nothing that I can do to make this work. I switched different headsets the problem persists.
5,Works great and no issues -- upgraded my 4.0 to 5.1 with no issues on an older PC.
5,I bought this adapter because it advertises extended range and my Xbox controller that I use with my PC was having trouble staying connected from across the room. I had none of the signal drops on this adapter. Success!With that said the English installation instructions were a little poorly translated and the driver came on a mini- CD(Who has optical drives anymore!? 🤣)  However a simple Google search with the manufacturer name and model number turned up the page on their site with the driver download so not really an issue in the end. Be aware that if you have integrated Bluetooth on your motherboard you will need to go into the Device Manager and disable it in order for this driver to finish installing successfully.  Then you will need to re-pair all your devices through the Bluetooth settings.
5,Very happy with it now. after removing the old drivers I use with my old mini USB unit. The range reaches up to my second floor from the basement and outside about 10 feet away from the house.
5,I use Apple Airpods Pro.  My smaller Bluetooth USB adapters only reach to 30ft. That is around corners and down a hall into another room. This is not line-of-sight and the house was built in 1961. One thing to consider is that the gain is due to the antenna on the device. The antenna in my Airpods it the limiting factor.  I can hear farther than I can talk which is what I would expect. The diff is only about 10ft in my house.  I can't hear very good so can't give a perfect rating on sound quality but they keep me smiling.
5,I have an 11 year old Dell Studio XP 8100 this adapter allows it to connect with our TV headphones and Blu ray player. No issue to talk about. Works well and the range is as advertised our furthest point is about 35 feet and no issues.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had a Tp-link USB and this is way better!Better rangeBetter ConnectivityIt doesn't give me issuesAwesomeThanks!
5,Able to use 2 xbox controllers at once on pc from atleast 30 feet haven't tired any further great for what I wanted it for recommend for anyone trying to play two player games on a pc with no prior bluetooth capable mother broad.
2,This was incredibly easy to install but the device unfortunately isn't worth a darn. No real range poor connectivity even if the device you want to connect is less than 3 feet away and even if it does connect there's no guarantee it'll be a high quality connection or even that it'll stay connected. All in all stay away from this shoddy product
5,needs a disk drive to install drivers windows could not find a driver for it.  The Xbox Controllors connect well and stay connected durrying game play with no issues.
5,Seems to give my full coverage of my apartment.
5,I have been using the Avantree DG60 adapter for quite some time. I am very very pleased to have graduated to this adapter it is far superior. The Realtek drivers were not necessary with my Windows 11 system and pairing was incredibly intuitive.This adapter is highly recommended
4,I try to use it to connect the desktop to my stereo for music. It works with my phone well. With the desktop doesn't.
5,El articulo cumple con su función a la perfección
5,Plug and play!
1,I am constantly using my earbuds with my phone and my laptop whenever I'm out on my motorcycle or when I'm working on things around my home. But when I use my desktop I have to use my corded USB headset because Bluetooth wasn't a thing when I built this monster. So I bought this "Long Range" Bluetooth transmitter in order to finally use my earbuds with my gaming machine. It was a simple plug and play my computer saw it installed the drives allowed me to easily connect to my ear buds. Once I was able to hear my desktop audio playing in my head I was in heaven..... then I was quickly thrown into hell as I had the audacity to go to the kitchen to get a drink out of the fridge. The audio started sputtering and then silence shortly followed then the "oh huh" sound of the emotionless lady who lives in my ear buds saying "Connection Lost". I know what you are thinking "you walked out of range" or "you put too many walls between you and the transmitter". FYI while wearing my USB headset I can walk to the fridge without taking off the headset because its that close I never lost line of sight with the transmitter. After I sat down and got it to reconnect it was ok for a moment then it started sputtering again and cutting out as I was in a death stare with the transmitter. This POS is a crappier Bluetooth transmitter than the one in my water damaged phone. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this the price is the only thing nice about this thing.
5,The range is much better than other USB Bluetooth transmitters.
2,Worked for a few days.  Started getting signal interruptions sound to headphones was cutting out every other word.  Then sound would completely cut out.  reinstalled driver worked for a few hours...problems repeated.  Soon it only worked for minutes before driver needed to be reinstalled.Changed to the ASUS BT 5.0 USB-BT500 and issues went away.Not a good device.
2,Don't believe the hype- This isn't 5.1 and it doesn't go ANY further than my laptop bluetooth adapter located in the same place.  If you have a desktop and you need bluetooth this will work great.  Otherwise it's just a generic ole adapter and it ain't gonna do you know distance favors.Naming a driver 5.1 doesn't make it 5.1.  The seller is misrepresenting this product
5,Now I can walk into the kitchen and even outside with my headphones or earbuds and still carry on a conversation or listen to music.
5,I just had shoulder surgery and sleeping was difficult.  I bought this blue tooth adapter so I could have my wireless headphones and listen to music when chasing sleep.  I can walk anywhere in the house even outside and the range of this device is incredible.  Pair this with AfterShokz headphones and you have television music and telephone anywhere you go at home or yard.
5,Plug in and installed software. It picked up my Microsoft Bluetooth right away. Love it! Tried our Bluetooth with no luck. I recommend this product for ease and performance.
5,I have a PC connected in the office with a 35ft hdmi running to a 4k samsung frame tv in the living room. This enables me to play PC games on the big screen using ps5 controllers connected by this Bluetooth adapter in the other room! No hiccups smooth connection the entire time with 2 controllers connected 👍
5,Even for the Chinese brands like my ZTE android cell phone and MPOW head phones(Don't by these headphones head strap is only plastic and breaks in half had to bend a piece of 1/2 x 1/16 metal flat bar for it and epoxy it to the inside) Also a good idea for better audio control download Equalizer APO by SourceForge.net.
5,Easy to install good range.
5,I had a ton of connection issues with the onboard bluetooth from my Z690. Poof all gone!
5,a ok
5,Dislike is the CD to download it. Because not all computers have one
5,Easy to stall and worked perfectly. Arrived sooner than first advised.
1,Got this to use with my Bluetooth over-ear headphones. I wanted to listen to the audio on my PC and even though I didn't leave the room in fact I was still less than 3 feet away it kept disconnecting and pausing the audio's source when it did it. It would reconnect right away but it made it unusable as it was very distracting to have to keep pushing play again. My TPlink BT dongle may not have a long range but it stays connected.And for general purposes yes I used the most updated driver. I returned this after trying to get it to work for 3 weeks.
5,Satisfied
2,The range is the same as any cheap Bluetooth dongle.It shows up on Linux (Ubuntu v 22) but does not find any devices.This just isn't worth it.
5,Paired BT speaker to laptop very easy
5,Easy to use. Worked well.
1,I got this to support bluetooth headphones on my PC. The product worked well for the first 10 days or so before completely stopped and will no longer turn on making it completely useless.
5,works great and I live in 2 story the signal goes from top floor to bottom with no interruptions.My headset works perfect now.Thank you
1,This does not work on Windows 11. Connection failed due to driver error.
1,I disliked how it required a disc to install and I am very upset it stopped working within 2 days and doesn't turn on.
1,It was good for the first 2 months after that connection became terrible.Bluetooth connection seems fine but sound is breaking up very frequently in sum about 10%~20% of total playtime.
1,Installed it rebooted got message saying pc shutdown in 15 sec to prevent damage to motherboard. I removed dongle rebooted ok except it fried the usb port.
5,As sdapter must be
1,Had it for a few weeks and all of a sudden it just stops working. Had to go back to my old Bluetooth adapter which doesn’t have the greatest range but at least it doesn’t constantly disconnect.
1,Worked out of the box then one day it stopped working
1,Died after 4 months outside of return policy basically lit a 20 on fire.
1,It's unusable driver error 31 cant load driver.  I reinstalled my OS I tried downloading and reinstalling the deiver removing and disabling it would work for a random period of time before failing again and again.I smashed it with a hammer so they can't repackage and sell to someone else.  This should be considered a scam product
1,Terrible piece of trash.
1,Does not connect to anything. Rolls back drivers for Bluetooth and windows will not support it.
1,Did not connect. Messed around with it for an hour gave up.
1,Can't seem to get it to work. IDK why.
1,The 5.1 Bluetooth driver continually uninstalls itself on my computer. I have to reinstall it all the time. I don't even bother anymore and consider this purchase a bust. From reading on the internet this seems to be a problem with the Realtek 5.1 Bluetooth driver. I've tried every suggestion and it still uninstalls itself.  Wish I'd known about this issue beforehand.
1,broke after the first use...would not recommend
1,I tried downloading from the disc that is enclosed and from online on two different computers…a laptop and a PC. They would not accept it I guess because it was not a Realtek sanctioned software. This product is made in China.
2,It's okay for the most part but when I try to use voice chat in arma 3 audio cuts out.
1,Incompatible with some bluetooth devices. Specifically the wireless headset that I wanted to use the most with this adapter.
4,I don't have any bad to say about this. It may take up a little room but works great.
1,The Windows drivers for this adapter are weird and have crashed my computer a few times. Now the adapter doesn't work at all and the Windows device manager doesn't detect it at all. When it did work the Bluetooth connection range was great. Shame about literally everything else though.
5,I've purchased a number of different Bluetooth adapters of this type and none of them have worked... Until now! This adapter is super easy to install and use.  I plugged the adapter into one of the empty USB ports on my Windows 10 desktop computer put the included CD into the disc drive and selected setup.exe and followed the instructions on the screen. I restarted the computer when the installation was finished and it worked! I now have Bluetooth on my computer! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
5,Works amazing with Windows 11 you can plug it and Windows will automatically install the drivers (still comes with a CD with the drivers in case you need it tho) and has a really good range. I can't really find any complaints about this it really works as expected have tested it a lot with my Bluetooth headphones and the audio transmission quality is good as well. An excellent purchase if you need to give Bluetooth capabilities to your desktop PC or any PC in general.
4,I was able to download the firmware online and it was super easy to install! I was surprised that the range was the same as previously using my laptop! It was a perfect for my PC build and the bluetooth light is super handy as well!
1,how could anyone give this product more than 1 start review??it doesn't even download its driver automatically and the driver comes in a disk.  who had a disk driver nowadays?
5,Works very well. Bluetooth is very responsive and very easy to install. I like the addition of a link to the drivers on their website in case you don't have a disc drive.
1,This device like so many others on amazon it seems is *NOT* Bluetooth 5.1. The driver that Windows installs will *say* "Bluetooth 5.1" in the name but the driver itself will actually only support version 9 of the Link Manager Protocol ("LMP") meaning it's actually only 5.0.
5,It works for my whole house much better reception on wireless headphones than a standard antenna.
5,Do you want good bluetooth throughout your house? get this it works quite well.
5,The antenna is not a gimmick the range actually does seem longer than other bluetooth adapters with no antenna.
5,For my setup I sit on my couch and have my PC hooked to my TV. It has a PCI-E wireless/bluetooth combo but I was getting dropped keypresses from my keyboard. I disabled the "built in" bluetooth and added this adapter instead. Since doing that all of my bluetooth devices work so much better. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to improve their bluetooth experience.
5,Great product for a great price.
1,I don't have a disk drive on my computer. The link to download the drivers is broken. The dongle worked for one day without having to download the drivers but the second I restarted my computer it stopped working. Don't waste your money.
5,I have a slightly older PC which did not have Bluetooth 5.1 only 4.x and I was having problems connecting high speed cameras etc.  This device solved my problems.
5,I used this for my ubotie keyboard that is bluetooth and it worked perfectly :D.
5,Works well and connected quickly.  So far so good.
5,Does good
5,I was fortunate enough to have a CD drive in my laptop. So be aware that you may have to source a CD drive to install the installation files to have the device work. Good for older PC and Laptop applications. Works great. I recommend it.
5,connected to my Bluetooth gaming chair instantly
5,Make sure you download their drivers from the link provided. Disable your current Bluetooth device from the windows device manager if you have one. Then plug this in and load the driver's. Once you get over that initial hump this product is fantastic. Way better than the built in Bluetooth I had before.
5,I've lost track of how many frustrating issues I've had using Bluetooth audio devices with my two development systems. In desperation I bought this adapter turned off my the motherboard BT and presto. Fast connection at startup. No dropouts. I couldn't be happier.
5,I needed a way to connect a new set of headphones to my PC.  This was easy.  It installed quick and I had my headphones paired to it in less than 5 minutes.  Would recommend.
2,Tiene una señal muy débil si bien es verdad lo que la publicación dice que el producto alcanza varios metros con señal a los 50cm sino es que menos del punto de origen ya tiene una señal baja definitivamente no recomendado para lentes de Realidad Virtual (VR) o algún otro dispositivo que requiera una señal fuerte para su optimo funcionamiento quedé triste porque creí que esto solucionaría el uso de cables para mi VR... al final tuve que comprar un cable de 4 metros
4,Funciona super bien pero en lugares con muchos bloqueos poco puede hacer.
