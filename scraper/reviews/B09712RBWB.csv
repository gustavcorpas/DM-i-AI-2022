4,This stand is amazing for any home or office space it holds up very nicely and in terms of assembly it took a minor curve when coming to the strange screws that aren’t easily explained within the instructions but other than that the stand comes together very nicely!The only issue I’m faced with when it comes to the stand is simply the drawers being the biggest drawback being very finicky sometimes giving a hard time to pull out! And in terms of the dividers they aren’t the most sturdy and stable but they get the job done so don’t plan on put to much in them unless you want to yank the whole stand forward when pulling the drawer out!In total this stand does an amazing job for my setup! Putting together my room very nicely and helping create extra storage space and coming from a college student who lives in a box any extra space is great space and this stand does a create job brining together my study area!
5,Very nice for the price much sturdier than I anticipated. Just too tall for my desk. Only quirk or dislike is that the drawers get stuck on the screw tops when pulling them out. Not a huge ordeal but made the stand slide on my desk. Could probably put some non skid on the bottom but I’ll be using this at home as opposed to work instead. Top of my right screen gets cut off by my hutch and the left doesn’t fit at all. Should’ve measured first! Lesson learned lol. Great stand for the price! Very easy to put together and came with spare parts. Buying a different height from the same manufacturer.
5,I was looking for a different riser so my monitor did not sit so high.  Based on the height and length I thought this would be a good option.  It was easy to put together as long as you paid attention to the pics (which could be a little larger).  I was hoping laptop could sit underneath but forgot to take into consideration the cords.  Even so I like the look the height is much better it’s very sturdy and the storage helped clean up my desk area.  Would recommend.
5,I am so glad I found this gem on here. It’s easy to assemble and it’s very sturdy. I have two monitors on the stand for work and the bases are large. They fit comfortably with plenty of space to add another monitor if needed. I like the slot to hold a tablet or phone. It’s easy to place small electronics there if you lose devices like me! The drawers are an added bonus to put things in like your pens post it notes or any little Knick knacks. Highly recommend this dual monitor stand.
5,Boards didn't match pictures in assembly manual; supposed to have 3 holes but only had 2. I gave up & let my fiancé do it. Definitely helped organize my desk looks nice & it's great to have a little elevation to my monitors.
5,Product super easy to assemblelittle flimsy in the center between the drawersall in all really good quality for the price and it looks good with the set-up
5,I was using a standup desk to put my monitors up higher but it was bulky and took up too much disk space. This is perfect it raises my monitors to the right height makes my desk look nice and neat it doesn’t take up a lot of room.
5,Easy to assemble seems pretty durable. I liked this had two separate parts for storage. Looks great on the desk than a standard metal riser.
5,Very sturdy; pieces are well made and numbered with stickers to aid in assembly predrilled holes are accurate aligned and smoothly finished screws and pegs easy to identify.  All parts fit together perfectly.  I'm super impressed and recommend this product.
4,Gave me back precious desk space and small drawers for gadgets
5,Nice addition to my desk. Exactly what I was looking for. Now I have room to actually work on my desk. Nice elevation for the monitors as well.
4,It looks very nice on my desk I loved there are color options and I found one that is almost exact.
5,It looks good and works great!  Even dropped on floor and didn’t break.  The amount of hardware was amazing… more than I’ve gotten to put together a large bookcase!  But just follow the steps.
5,Color matches well with my ikea counter top desk. Easy to assemble. The drawers get stuck and does not come out smoothly  but it does what I need it to and organizes my desk.
5,Very beautiful product!
5,I purchased this monitor stand as part of a home office setup for my new job. It's large enough to hold two large monitors and my laptop without any issue. The drawers are helpful and cut down on desk clutter. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.
4,I love the easy assemblyi do have a worry since i didnt have a wall to really station it at. yes the snug fit draws does make the stand move slightly was there any way to make it more grounded on the desk? that would make it better to have instead of worrying if something will make it tumble over…
5,Love the drawers and it’s sturdy. I’ve put two 24” monitors on it and it’s holding up fine. Also easy to assemble. Highly recommended.
5,Looks like the picture! Beautiful and sturdy. I'm not the best at building and putting things together but I was able to follow the directions provided and put it together just fine. Highly recommend this Monitor stand it even fits both of my work monitors on it not just one. :)
5,good value for the money I like it.
3,I have done hundreds these flat packed stuff still found the assembly is a bit tedious the tiny screw driver doesn't have much torque so you better off using your own bigger one to start with before your hand start to hurt.  The worst part was the instruction of one part was wrong (the orientation of the metal brackets with the notch was drawn and illustrated exactly the opposite as they should go on the panel) so you need to redo it which is a major annoyance.  There is no instruction for the internal dividers for the cloth drawer you figure out; the turn-lock screws are not flat top flush with the surface (1-2 mm bulge) which makes the movement of the cloth drawers not smooth and getting snagged on by these screws.  Otherwise once they were put together they are good looking sturdy and good value for the money as always for these Chinese made small things for office and household.  They are so close to make the almost perfect products but always fell short for the last inch they don't pay attention to user experience as much why couldn't they work just a bit on making a little clearer instruction or pay more attention to these little details if the designer or CEO tried to put together and use his own product just once he would find out exactly the same issues the consumers went through.  USER experience including assembly could make and break you.
5,it WORKS
5,Love the unit. Took me about 45 minutes to put together as I had to change the positioning of two pieces. The photos and descriptions did not match and I went on the wrong path. The unit is incredibly sturdy and I have it replacing a 24" wide unit. The drawers are also nice and deep. I only wish the opening below was about 2" wider. The other bonus was that the finished matched my desk. I would highly recommend the unit.
5,This was so easy to put together. This stand frees up alot of space on Mt desk so I can have a nice size keyboard and mouse pad. I have recommended this already.
4,The directions seemed to be off however I was able to assemble it and it looks good on my desk.
5,I was not able to use it for which I purchased it for but I  was able to use it in one of my bed rooms on a dresser. I  use the compartments for storage and the stand for pictures. It was to tall for my monitor but I didn't want to send it back because I really liked it.
4,As I read other reviews I didn’t understand what people meant by it’s weird that the drawer piece doesn’t connect. Now i understand what they meant and had to take a picture to share with others. There’s no way to screw the middle pieces to the top board. Which is the reason one star was knocked off. I just flipped it upside down to avoid unintentionally ripping the pieces off.I wasn’t paying attention when I started and had the pieces flipped. As I unattached the piece to make the adjustment I broke one of the wooden dowel pin. I couldn’t get the other half of the pin out of the board. I managed to wedge the snapped piece in anyway and it was still pretty sturdy so I continued the rest of the build. It’s always great to see extra pieces left over. If I could have managed removing the snapped pieces I had a replacement piece. Above all it looks better than the last one I bought that came with a hole.
4,It's exactly what I expected easy to assemble and stable.
4,Definitely saved space on my desk. I just wasn’t pleased with the width of the center part.  The color’s look great with my black desk. I am pleased with this riser.
5,Worked great on my desk for my double monitor set up.
5,Took about 10 minutes to put together and had easy to follow instructions.
5,I looks around for a while for a dual monitor riser - I had a few requirements1) will it allow two 27 inch monitor side by side2) see the picture regarless of my montor it had to fit my large monitor stands (around 15x9 perimeter)3) had to have storage4) had to be at least 4 inches height5) descent price - did not mind if it was MDF and not woodit was very hard to meet all these requiremenst but I got close  - if you see the image the base does not fully fit but it works and its stable enough the two monitor fit side by side . I have them at a slight angleNow the product - I would say the quality is just above average but I only paid $40 ish - so that is okAs other folk mentioned the top self is connected and is sturdy but the top part where the black shelf and the brown meet is not connectted to the inside side of the drawer (it is connected the the outer side of drawer) SO be very careful after assembly and you have to turn it the right way up . The storage is just cloth material but that was not important for my choice. One bit of advice is to put some felt pad at bottom - the screws may scratch a delicate surface - I used https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7UD93C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Overall I am satisfied
4,Kinda of a pain to put together.  Does the job and worth the price
5,These are handy little stands. The additional storage in the little drawers is nice. Hold decent sized monitors. Good looking color as well.
5,This product came with a multi tool to put together a free gift easy step by step instructions and was very well made!! All screw holes were lined up perfect and there. Very sturdy (I use for 2 monitors) as well. I would highly recommend!
4,Overall I'm happy with this product but Beware when assembling.  The instructions (specifically step 2) are wrong and you don't even realize it until your in the last step.Do yourself a favor reverse the direction of the iron plates (piece G). The last piece doesn't attach to make it sturdy unless you do it this way.Which makes sense why some reviews said it didn't attach right at the end.
4,Looks nice when it is fully assembled.  I suggest doing a loose assembly for the side elements.  After doing one incorrectly I began to understand the way the instructions were written and the rest of the assembly went well.
5,This is such a great way to organize with my dual (actually three with my laptop) monitor setup! It was a distracting mess before. Since I got the monitor stand I find myself taking mini-breaks just to appreciate how neat and organized it all is!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I work from home and needed a better solution to 1) raise my monitors and 2) add storage for desk supplies. I didn't want to spend a fortune and didn't want a product that would detract from my desk which I like the wood color of. This monitor riser worked great for my needs. You can see in the photos that if you assemble it with the screw heads facing inside the unit (where the drawers slide in) you will not have the problem of scratching your desk surface.Pros: Nice looking easy to assembleCons: Drawer separators are somewhat clunky and not attractive the drawers do not slide easily (see video).Overall I would recommend this product as an inexpensive solution to organize a desk and raise monitors to a more-ergonomic height.
3,Once built this is exactly what I needed and the 2 drawers are very useful.  The pictures for instructions had the "U-shaped" brackets showing the wrong direction but I figured it out based on the hole alignments.  Goes together very similar to IKEA but it took some time to follow the diagram.
4,Assembly is fairly straightforward and easy. The labeling was clear directions fairly clear and even had some leftover parts after the assembly (so the extra was intentional which is nice).My only suggestion is to have the drawer sides actually secure to the top of the stand. There is a plate that joins the drawer tops to the center section making this not possible. The result is to have the drawer sections secured on three sides not four.This makes for setup and moving the assembled unit difficult for fear of breaking it.Otherwise good product and good appearance.
5,This looks great and was perfect for what I needed for my desk and a good price.
5,Nice for work from home office
3,Bought this to rise up my monitor and organize my desk area in my home office. The instructions are very simple and I had no difficulty putting it together however the wood is basically particle board with veneer over it and you must be very gentle when you are assembling. When I assembled the first side the screws popped right through the bottom as you can see in the first picture. Thankfully the damaged part is on the bottom so you can’t really see it but I do question the durability over time. Overall it looks nice and it will do the trick for what I bought it for.
3,This is good once it’s together but there weren’t enough screws and it includes the wrong type of screwdriver (flat and you need a Phillips)
5,Ordered to hold my two work monitors higher than my laptop so there wasn't an overlap and screens being blocked. Saw this product and took measurements. It seemed to work. Got it yesterday and assembled. Very easy! Installed on my desk and it is perfect! The two drawers are handy as well. Would highly recommend!
5,My desk was a mess this monitor stand works great. It was easy to put together. Very nice looking and the drawers are a plus!
3,I ordered this monitor riser to use in place of a hutch on a small utility table. The piece itself is sturdy and the individual parts were well labeled and constructed. However the package arrived with no instructions but I was able to request through Amazon. The other issue was that the instructions showed a Phillips screwdriver but a slotted screwdriver was included in the package. I had a Phillips on hand but others might not. Buyer beware!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Sturdy and easy to put together
5,It’s perfect! Easy to assemble with detailed instructions. Even included the tools needed to put it together. They also include a little gift with cute office supplies! So awesome.
5,Great product desk is no longer cluttered.
5,I love this product all the way around. Easy to assemble very sturdy and stands up for what it’s supposed to do. Help really organize your desk.
5,This has worked out perfectly for me. I use the little drawers but not the dividers. It is sturdy ahs actually matched my desk. I love it.
5,Easy to put together and they included both a screwdriver and an Allen wrench. Unit is sturdy and looks just like it was presented. Very happy with this purchase
3,The top 2 pictures on the instructions are wrong. It was easy to figure out but took a little while.
5,
5,Love the height width and adore the drawers.The dividers that came with the drawers are flimsy but the do the job.
5,This is a great addition to my desk and provides extra storage space.
5,Easy to build
5,The directions were a little confusing
4,This is great for saving space on my work desk.  Be careful when assembling it scratched my kitchen table badly so we bought additional protectors so it won’t scratch my desk.  We should’ve been more careful.
4,I was able to easily fit my 25” monitor and laptop on this. Super easy to assemble and looks great. The screws on the underside scratched my desk real bad though when I pushed it into place. It’s totally worth buying just be careful when moving.
3,Well it’s sturdy…ish. Finish is nice and drawers are cute.Cons:-comes with a flathead screwdriver- and you need a Phillips to put it together-the bottom metal “feet” scratch the surface of any wood/semi-soft surface - needs felt pads to address this-the two center supports are weirdly and lazily not connected to the center of the stand meaning picking it up can lead to breaking the entire darned thing… and that unless you put something heavy on top it will bow up.-no stopper at back for the drawers means they can fall out the backside.I have ordered felt pads and will be addressing the structural issues because it does generally continue to meet my needs (and I’ve already put it together)… but there is DEFINITELY room for improvement.
5,Nice height
5,Enough room for both of my monitors drawers are real handy for putting things in that you might need during the course of the day.
5,Very sturdy and works great for my two monitors! Love the two drawers that hold and hide my small desk items like pens and notepads it keeps my desk clean! Great purchase!
5,Drawers are great for storing post-its paperclips and other miscellaneous office supplies.Hides clutter and gives more space to desk for notebook and writing.  It's not too tall for my ergonomic needs.Great buy for price.
5,Assembly was quick and easy. The little drawers are perfect for sticky notes and small notepads pens etc. I have two 17" monitors and its a perfect fit and good height.
5,it was relatively easy to assemble and works well
5,This booster is very suitable for me. It can hold two monitors also has a very practical and useful drawer.  When I put my monitor on it’s is very sturdy so I don’t have to worry about it getting deformed.
3,The tools that came with the kit are junk. I ended up using my own.  Once assembled it does not feel sturdy.
2,This is ok and does the job but it is designed really poorly do when you build it- the nails pop up through the top. I put something on top of it so it’s fine but horrible design.
3,
5,Nice to keep the desk tidier.  I love it.
1,I ordered this and when I received it the box was already open! Therefore when I picked it up everything slid out onto the floor. On top of that the middle piece had a hole that went through the top exposing the wood underneath. Looked like a manufacturing flaw. I tried to overlook this and continue putting the stand together but one of the wooden spokes broke in half as I was assembling the pieces. Pain in the neck AND a waste of money.
1,Thoroughly frustrated and disappointed. Started a new job this week and attempted to assemble this today. I have assembled plenty of things in the past huge storage units and hanging closet storage items and entire desks. This is just stupid. The little wooden pegs that came with it snapped like twigs when I applied a very minute amount of pressure in order to try to screw things together. Came with instructions but none of the parts were labeled which made it extra fun. Half of the things you need to do to assemble this are akin to trying to fit an apple into a shot glass. Sending back for a full refund and will never buy from this brand again.
1,if i could give it a -0 i would. Not sturdy missing parts nail holes in wrong places. Took it apart three times to ensure i was 1)reading the instructions correcty 2) had all the right parts. gave up after third build threw it away and requested a refund.
1,Within 5 minutes of assembling the wooden piece to connect the boards broke into two pieces and got stuck inside. Unable to get them out. Very disappointed for the cheap quality.
1,I really liked the product up until assembly the metal plates were missing. I really did like how sturdy the material was and loved the free gift inside. I'm unsure if I'll reorder.
1,Other than the fact that the instructions have little to no words and simply rely on you being able to figure out what the tiny pictures represent I also received one where one of the drawers has no hole in which to open it with your fingers.  So how am I supposed to open this without pulling it away from the wall every time I need to push the drawyer from the back?
1,Not very sturdy parts don’t go together tight. Cheaply made
1,I purchased two of these and both were just terrible to put together. None of the holes match up. When put together nothing lined up square.
5,First off for the price this is a great stand. Relatively easy to assemble I didn’t have any issues with holes not matching up or any missing pieces. I can see some of the things other reviewers mentioned like the small gaps because of the hardware and a slight issue with taking out the drawers but not a big deal. The space underneath fits my 15.6 hp (so about 14 in. actual edge to edge length) I imagine would fit a 60-96 keyboard a full size or bulky one is just a bit long to slide under. Overall would recommend
5,This is great for my desk at work. The only thing thay can be annoying is the drawer catches on the inside.
5,This was fairly easy to assemble. Gives more space and looks great
1,It has a few assembly flaws with the shelving and its really flimsy. I don't think I'd recommend it.
5,I was able to make much more efficient use of my workspace and cable/accessory management was a cinch. I only use one of the drawers the other cubby holds my hub and my an auxiliary volume switch for my speakers. The other drawer made a nice little tray on the corner of my desk. This thing greatly increased my useable surface on my desk. It was simple to assemble and matches my desk color well enough that it looks pretty natural. I am very happy
4,Putting it together wasn’t easy but once it was put together I really liked it. I no longer slouch Its helped a lot & sit up straight.
5,Fairly easy to assemble but it's exactly what I was looking for with a monitor stand.
5,Great looking and will be a hit at any office!!
5,I like everything about this product.I keep my caption phone on top of it and a few pictures. So far!Still decorating my new home!
4,Cute product . Screwdriver was broken upon delivery so that sucked
5,I love this little stand. It’s sturdy and holds a lot in the boxes. The only thing is that the boxes are a little snug in their compartments. They slide in and out just fine but they still touch the sides.
5,Purchased for myself and another. Sits nicely on our work desks. Raises the monitor quite high so be cautious if you have an overhang on your desk. Was very easy to assemble. Pretty heavy. About 10 lbs. Nice and solid.
5,Assembly was a little tricky. I had to have my husband do it.
5,Wasn't sure if would be sturdy enough based on price but since I bought it everyone in the office wants one now.
5,I'm really really happy with this monitor stand.  I was looking for something temporary until I could find a "nice" piece but this one really seems like it'll stand up to some wear and tear.  It's far sturdier than it looks with a well thought out design.  It was easy to assemble (the only issues I had were user error from not paying close enough attention to what I was doing).  And it's the perfect size leaving lots of room for my keyboard and mousepad.
5,It is very sturdy. Love it very much! It was easy to assemble. Perfect height too.
5,Perfect for what I needed. It was pretty easy to put together. Fits everything that was cluttering up my desk and gives me more space to work.
5,Super easy to build and it looks great
5,I love it! I replaced the monitor stands I received from my employer wish i did it years ago!
5,Though it would look stupid in person but it looks good and is practical. Middle section fits my laptop ipad portable screens and laptop cooler. One of the drawers fits all the cables and mouse the other notebook diary pens etc.So much less clutter on the desk. Love it.
3,Putting this together was not that difficult.  However trying to follow the pictures was frustrating.  The 2 metal supports are backwards in the instructions leaving the inside drawer support hanging.  If you turn those 2 metal pieces opposite to what it tells you a screw fits into the drawer portion holding it in place snugly.  I had it all together before I realized what was wrong so took the drawers off again and reversed the pieces!  Ta da ... it worked.  Mind you I was short of the screws so had to dig up a couple of my own.  And the person who said they had only a slotted screwdriver? Reverse the yellow handle and you will find the phillips on the other end!
