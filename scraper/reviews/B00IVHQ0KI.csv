5,First off you may have never seen this it's totally worth the watch if you haven't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qanlirrRWsGreat wheel.  I also have the TX force feedback model.  I can tell you that the TX is in fact really cool but don't despair if you cant afford that one this spider wheel is very very good.  The 'bungee cord" system may sound strange or cheap but it really works great.  Sometimes I don't even want force feedback and in Project Cars if you turn the feedback way down it makes the TX wheel NOT return to center when you let go of the wheel not good.  So sometimes I still use the spider.  Yes it's really fun to nail down good feedback setting in Project Cars with the TX wheel but for less that $100 the spider is very very good.  Do not listen to the low star people I do not know what they are expecting.  In fact as far as weight complaints about the spider as in it "feels like a cheap toy"....is you removed the back of the TX model the heavier "dash" so to speak that houses all the feedback belts etc the TX wheel itself I believe would weigh just the same as the Spider.  As far as Project Cars I mostly use the Aston Martin V12 Vantage G3 in case you ever get the TX wheel here's the settings I use in case it helps.  Be advised that at least with the TX I bought and at least with Project Cars out of the box it felt strange....the factory feedback settings made the cars feel old clunky like the tires were full of rocks or that the steering column was broken so you really need to be patient and get good with all the settings in Project Cars once I dialed in within the the range listed below the TX was way better than originally again I have only tested these settings with the Aston Martin V12 Vantage G3.  When I say "regular options" I am talking about where you press your start button and go to "options & help"...that is the setting area that ISN'T that settings area when your in the pits just that Options and Help area within the start button or the home pages.Steering ratio 15.0:1.Force Feedback: Master Scale 80.All F & M Scales 160.00.All F & M Smoothings 70.0.Force Feedback Calibration in the Regular Options Tire Force 51.Put steering ratio to 25.5:1 IF in regular options the steering assistance is No Driving Assists Allowed All and Yes to Antilock brakes/stability & traction control.NOW if in regular options the steering assistance is YES instead still all assists yes and yes on all the Antilock brakes/stability & traction control then just put all Scales up to 190.00.This is all with the steering sensitivity in Reg Options at 70NEVER CHANGE DEAD ZONE FROM ZERO IT SUCKS.Lastly in regular options taking the steering sensitivity from 70 up to 100 seems to tighten up that slack sensitivity at the wheels center/or deadzone.Also 180 Scales with 60 Smooths is good tooIf you prefer a little more feedback from bumps in the road with any set up above just i DECREASE all four of your All F & M Smoothings.Keep in mind that in my opinion the lower you put the Smoothings the more of what I call a "belt grind" effect happens.  I mean that the belts inside the TX unit will give more feedback in a sense but it can feel  to me more like just a grinding belt/broken steering column effect...not really translating as road bumps so just test it of course. for me 50 or 60 on the Smoothings is the threshold to keep the bumps still feeling like bumps and not just belt grind.UPDATE: Today I will be testing the settings by Stella Stig on YouTube seen here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joDSaUXxZFkI will also test MoneyMan300 settings at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1WAQCF5OB4I will update this post with how those settings compare to what I listed above I am assuming they will be better.Lastly I use the TX with the Playseat Challenge. Google that if your not familiar of course its a really good seat for regular home use. It folds up which is the main point. Its not your top of the line deal but for space I dont think it gets better and its still very very comfortable. For $250 its a very fair price. One issue I had was the straps your elbows rest on were bugging the skin at me elbows...just go to Home Depot plumbing area get either type of one inch pipe insulation...they have a grey type which has a more plastic feel to it and they have a black type that is smoother looks and feels more like rubber...I tried both its personal preference whichever you like. The more rubber type has this tape you can peel off to stick one side to the other and close the factory split...leave this tape on if you get the rubber type foam you'll need to remove the foam from the chair after each use as to allow the chair to fold up again. Cut your foam at about 15" or 17"...whatever works best with what angle you have your seat adjusted to...open the factory split and wrap the foam around the two straps where your arms rest at then seated in the chair. Works great. These are sold in singles at Home Depot you don't have to buy the multi-packs. You can cut your same 1 inch foam longways with the factory split taking it's diameter down as to better fit the pipe diameter where your knees rest get some velcro straps and make knee padding here. See before and after pics below.Here's a review of the Playseat by Inside Sim Racing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_lxcNdMdmU
4,I bought this Nov 27th 2020 as a gift for my grandson for Christmas.  He loved it however it is no longer working.  Shouldn't these last longer for the price?
4,This Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel works great for the older Forza 5 and Forza Horizon 3.  You will also need buy or build a rig to "attach" the wheel and leave room for the pedals too.  So if you are buying this for X-box One you will need some sort of rack or table to clamp or bolt the steering wheel to.  There is no option to just use the wheel by itself so a 2nd purchase of build out of some mechanism to attach the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel will be necessary.Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel is outdated for the newer Forza and Forza Horizon games.  I am NOT a sim racer nor do I claim to be.  I have been lucky enough to drive some fancy sims and I know that I am not an expert but I have some know-how to keep the car on the track.  I bought the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel looking for simcade capability where I want to use a wheel as opposed to just a controller for the xbox1.  But there are setting that will be configurable for the wheel to work well for the older Forza and Forza Horizon games but are just not available in the newer Forzas and newer Horizon games.For example the Degree radius available for the wheel in the newer games is only at 270 degrees instead of the expected 900 degrees and some of the oversteer corrections simcade driver or Simulation are just not available.  There are 2 methods that can be done to fix this in either firmware updates on the wheel itself or if Turn 10/Forza patches their software to be able to accommodate the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel as it does in Forza 5.Being neither side looks to updating patch or firmware to accomodate the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel for the newer Forza games and that cooperation being necessary for the periphials to work newer beginning drivers wanting the fun of a wheel to add to great driving games may have to look elsewhere or stick to the controller for their driving fix.  If you have Forza 5 it works great on Forza 5 but the newer Forza engines do not allow for the range of use to just use the wheel (and configure around impossible in game tire-wheel lockups) will leave players unable to use this purchase  and most likely whatever mounting rig you purchased to use the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel.  I have also tried to mimic and import the same settings from other wheels and the default X-box controller to match the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel but the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel just does not have the ranges or settings that the default Xbox controller or other wheels have for the newer Forza games.Will continure to monitor Turn10 Forza and Thrustmasters forums for solutions to the outdated Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel to newer racing games.If you have yet to buy a  racing wheel  you will definitely want to research your comparability among your wheel your gaming system and support for the newer racing games as well.  If the controller cannot support the 900 degrees driving configurations for over-steer and wheel lock keep looking for a wheel that does handle those configurations.  Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel just got left in the dust for newer games but if you are only going to play Forza 5 and Forza Horizon 3 the tuning is there to make Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider wheel a very good entry racing wheel for those older Forza games.
4,its good but like i recommend the logitech steering wheel. its better in my opinion and this ones just not that good compared to the logitech one.
3,The product is fine for what it is but it becomes hard to turn after while. If you're wanting a cheaper option this is it if not I would spend more money on a higher end racing wheel
3,This is a great product for someone like me who wanted to dip their toes in before exploring the more expensive options.  It was easy to set up and worked great.  With that the lifespan of this product is very short.  Because of the plastic design of the pedals and wheel wear and tear will eventually break this product.  For me it was the break pedal (ironically enough) that broke.  The problem is when you are immersed in a racing game you want to press the pedal firmly.  However due to the design this puts strain on the plastic pedal arm which over the period of time (6 months for me) grew strained and broke.  with that if you are thinking of buying your first racing set up this is a great option to use and then decide what features you would prefer.  So for what it is 3 stars.
4,Ok so this review is really just my initial impressions.  I may revise up or down later.First some background:  I have been looking at wheel options for driving games and specifically Forza Horizon 2 for a little while now and I'm definitely intrigued by the much more expensive options.I'm not opposed to spending a lot on a good gaming accessory once I know it's something I'll enjoy.  As a frame of reference after realizing how much more I was drumming in Rock Band as opposed to playing any other instruments (and having replaced the stock drum kit once already) I purchased the ION drum kit.But while interested in a wheel I just wasn't sure I'd really be overly "wowed" by it.  I've always been content driving with the standard controllers.Having said that while $100 certainly isn't trivial it seemed like a good entry-level price point to me for this type of accessory.And going in I knew I wasn't going to get exactly the same level of performance out of the wheel but I felt it would at least let me know whether I cared enough about playing the game with it to justify upgrading at some point.So....Out of the box:Ridiculously easy to set up.  Clamped it to a table plugged it in. The Xbox One and Forza immediately recognized it and I was *almost* good to go.  That *almost* however is my first major gripe about this controller.  I have a passkey set up on my account and it requires the joystick/thumpad to enter.  The steering wheel tries to be clever and disguise the thumbpad as an "engine start" button.  The result makes it difficult to use and next to useless.  I had a number of failed passkey attempts before I had to fire up the normal controller to enter it.I'd honestly prefer to forgo the clever aesthetics for a more user-friendly pad.Playing the game:It definitely does add a cool visceral feeling to the game to be able to press on the gas pedal and control the vehicle with a steering wheel.It also takes much more getting used to.  Where I have trained myself to feather the gas/brake as necessary over years of standard controller-based driving I found it was VERY easy to be too heavy with the gas with this controller. Much spinning out was to be had initially.Other than one gripe with the wheel I found it to be very responsive.  Although that gripe is a bit troublesome.  Almost immediately I found that the wheel has a small but significant "dead" spot at center.  This makes subtle steering corrections extremely difficult.  Trying to avoid an oncoming car to score some "near miss" points?  Good luck. Whereas the thumb controller reacts pretty much instantly with this wheel I often found myself either not moving the car left/right at all or over-steering whenever I wanted to make a minor correction.The best way I can describe it is how some older cars have somewhat mushy steering.It's a quirk I have to get used to and I can't emphasize enough that I didn't really expect perfect performance out of a product that is essentially entry level. I'm assuming the mushy steering is just the nature of the bungee resistance system and I would expect the more expensive motor driven wheels to NOT have this dead spot sensation.At the risk of this review coming off as negative that isn't how I intend it.  The goofy control of the thumbpad and the small dead spot in the steering really are the only two complaints I have so far.  And even so I found the wheel tremendously fun to use and it really does add a new dimension to the game.For a casual fan of driving games or someone who like me isn't sure they'll really get anything out of a steering wheel accessory I think this is  a fantastic product and I'm not disappointed.
3,To preface this review I have been an avid player of racing games for the last 10-15 years as well as racing cars at autocross and track-day events so I would like to think that I have a decent amount of experience when it comes to racing. I recently decided that I wanted a more realistic racing experience than a handheld controller once Project Cars rolled out but did not want to spend many hundreds (or thousands) of dollars on a sim racing rig which is largely what led me to this wheel. Because it was only priced at $90 I knew I wasn't going to get an amazing wheel with add on shifters pedals and force feedback but I was expecting a higher quality wheel than what you'd find in the sale bin at best buy. Here is my take on this wheel after several months of use in both Project Cars and now Forza 6.Once I received this and I was impressed with the quality of the wheel it felt heavy and well put together all of the buttons felt very rugged the paddle shifters feel real and have a very satisfying 'click' when engaged and the resistance that the wheel delivers while turning is a nice touch. The pedals however felt cheap in comparison the base is very lightweight and there is no good way to secure the base to the floor. Due to the base being so light and the pedals having such high resistance you will most likely end up having them slide away from you unless you're using them in a stand that holds them in place. As anyone who plays racing games knows the last thing you want is pedals disappearing when you need to stab the brakes at the end of a long straight. I'm sure I could spend the afternoon making some sort of box/stand out of some wood but it would have been nice for the wheel to have weight added to the base or for another solution to be offered (velcro for carpet suction cups for wood etc..) and not for you to buy or build a stand to use a product right out of the box. An additional limiting factor of this wheel is no vibrations which to me is more of an issue than the pedals moving. One of the largest differences between videogame racing and the real thing is the lack of 'feeling' that you get in a game and when you enjoy racing with assists turned off you rely on vibration feedback to know when the tires are losing grip due to too much throttle running over kerbing locking up the brakes etc.. With a wheel with no vibrations it's very difficult to know what is happening with the tires and thus with the car. I found myself running consistently slower times with the wheel versus a handheld controller either due to having to drive with assists on or driving more cautiously due to the fear of losing control.In summary: It's a well built wheel with cheaper feeling pedals but you are really missing out on a lot without vibrations from the controller to the point where the game becomes more difficult. I'd be happy to pay $20 more for this wheel if the manufacturer was to add in vibration to the wheel and maybe place a lead block in the pedals to keep them still but until then this is most likely going back in the box and I'll be using the normal Xbox controller when I want to be competitive.Pros:- Solid construction of the wheel itself- Adds another element of enjoyment to a game using a wheel vs. thumbsticks.- Priced at a fraction of the 'best' wheelsCons:-Pedals are light weight and slide around-No vibrations from wheel are a major takeaway from the game
5,i didn’t liked the way that T was to cheap and it can do so much things
5,But doesn’t turn a full 360 kinda a bummer especially in drifting and racing.
3,Great (very little) wheel to figure out if you want a better one or not. Not for actual extended use so expect wiggling and creaking from the plastic seams and cheap screws after a week or two. It works fine for FH5 (which is all I want it for). Just a bummer I have to buy this find out it is cheap quality then spend another $300-$400 to get anything worth the trouble. Beware
3,See I can tell this is a good wheel. But the problem is  at least in my area the delivery drivers chuck fragile items to you. The wheel would drift left when straight. I guess if you bought it in store it could stay reliable. So probably buy your stuff from anywhere else.
4,It's a great product great xmas gift but the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the box it came in. It's a Christmas gift and it comes in a large box but on the box has a sticker that tells exactly what's inside!! 1) It could have easily been stolen and 2) The person the gift was for brought it inside. The boxes should never ever tell what's inside the package. That was a huge fail.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Everything is good but the only thing is is that the force feedback does not come through and I went to the website and there is no drives for this wheel. Also the pedals need to have suctions below it because when I brake or do anything it will move.
4,I like it and it has great response (when configured properly). I just still need to find the time and patience to configure it properly. Forza is too detailed for my knowledge for all the necessary…. Details lol eventually I would like to add the shifter to the setup
5,Works really good and is perfectly sensitive.  Can’t stop playing Horizon 5 now lol
4,My kid loves this.  It was easy to setup.  The only drawback if there is one is that the pedals do not include a little eyelet or some such connection device to connect them to a board.. they do move around a bit when using them.  We might look into velcro either to the rug or a board.
4,Ot is a really good entry level wheel the quality isnt the greatest there is a little play in the wheel and it doesnt sit centered when not bieng use and the pedals dont have any floor mounting places but for 100 dollars its is great way to see if you want to get a more expensive kind
3,So if you just want a steering wheel for your kids or nieces/nephews. But if you were looking to feel just a glimpse of a car then this is not it. Save your money and get a quality one. But still great if you get a deal on it.!!!
1,Had high hopes for this product. 6 months into operation it stopped working right. Contacted the company through customer service email on website and stated the spring seemed broken for the pedal. Their fix was to have me send a photo of the broken part (I had to dismantle the product in order to do this) a picture of the serial number on the back and a copy of proof of purchase. Once I did that THEN they could send a new spring instructions in a language I can’t speak or read and have me take it apart to do the repair myself. I told them they may want to just send another unit since I am not a video game tech they said no. I played their game. Turns out… that wasn’t the only problem.Their fix to the second problem was for them to send a picture of how to repair the next problem and if that didn’t work to have me upload a video of it not working!!!! Keep in mind average email response time is 2 days. That alone is frustrating. (When I brought this up to them in a phone conversation later they threw in my face that it once took me 11 days to get back to them! Yes it did… but some of us have jobs that take us away from home for long periods of time! I offered to send a photo of my time card for proof since they need proof of everything else.)So once again I played their game and uploaded the video. And finally they have agreed the product in broken and will send me a new pedal set. How ever that won't happen until I  send a photo of the cord removed from the steering wheel then cut to prove we are not going to try to re-sell the part!!!!! This all started on July 3rd. It’s now July 24th. I finally called rather than emailed and the person could care less about my absolute frustration and insists that there is no other way to do this.In a time when most companies will send replacements for broken items sight unseen this is infuriating. I get that they want to make sure they are not getting scammed. I get that they just want to make sure someone is not trying to get a second set. I have already sent videos photos and all the proof of a problem a person possible can. The fact it has taken over 3 weeks to get anything close to a replacement is so ridiculously and incredibly infuriating that I would HIGHLY recommend you move on from this or any other “Thrustmaster” product. Whatever BS they might respond of how they have tried to remedy the issue will probably be true. The reason I am so upset is the fact that I have had to jump through so many hoops have been insulted about my response time as a consumer that they have taken so long on their end that I have to play repair man on a product under warranty and that I have been treated like someone that is trying to screw their company over coupled with the fact that the product failed within 6 months of use that’s what has me so upset. There is absolutely no good response any company can have to that.T
4,This is a really fantastic wheel especially at this price.  I have used both force feedback wheels (which I never could get used to always seems like there is too much feedback for me) and ones without force feedback (which usually felt flimsy and poorly made) and I'm quite surprised at how well this one responds.  For what I want in a wheel this exceeded my expectations with only one small complaint (and the reason this didn't get 5 stars).  The pedal movement was at least for me extremely stiff with no way to adjust it.  Considering the base didn't feel heavy enough to compensate every time I would press down the pedal it felt like I had to fight the front of the pedal base from coming off the floor.  I also had to place some weights behind it to keep it from sliding as it required a fair amount of force to push the pedals down all the way (compared to other wheels I've had I'm not trying to say it takes an olympic weight lifter to push the pedals down).However despite the stiff pedals this is a really well put-together product. Everything feels very solid with no rattles. The paddle shifters are metal and satisfying to press with a distinct "click" for each gear change. And I really like that the turn radius can be adjusted (at least in in-game menus) in case the default rotation is too much.  I do recommend this wheel for anyone just starting out that wants to get used to a wheel after being used to a controller.
2,Just some background I’ve been playing Forza since the original Motorsport came out back in 2005. Since then I’ve gotten really good with a controller and figured I could be even better with a wheel.I saw this one was rated #2 and was far less expensive than the $250+ wheels. You get what you pay for though.It was easy to set up no problems there. I was able to adjust it and fired up Forza Motorsport 7. The controls feel nice the metal paddle shifters feel real and are solid.The wheel looks and feels more expensive than it is. However I quickly discovered that most of the $100 cost must go into the Ferrari branding. The wheel itself is pretty mediocre.The pedals don’t attach to a carpeted floor at all. It’s far too easy to push or kick them away just when you need to hit the brakes or gas. I was constantly using my other foot to hold down the base.Some weights in the pedals’ base would really help.Started an empty free play race to try it out without worrying about other racers. Within seconds I noticed the absolute worst thing about this wheel.Absolutely NO force feedback or vibrations of any kind to tell me when the tires were breaking loose or how hard I was hitting the gas/brake.I knew it didn’t have force feedback (even though there are several wheels available on PC with force feedback for $100!) but to have absolutely no feedback at all for this price is ridiculous.This is a decent beginners’ wheel or a wheel for kids or casual racers. But for someone seriously trying to race and win online this definitely won’t cut it.The reviews giving this 4-5 stars describe buying this wheel for children. For any kind of serious racing look somewhere else.Save your money don’t buy this one. I’ve already boxed this up and will be putting the money towards a more expensive wheel that actually has feedback and pedals that stay in place.
5,Thanks
1,One of the four main buttons (A X Y B) did not operate from the time I first plugged it in.  So I gritted my teeth at the poor quality and used my Xbox controller sitting off to the side to operate the faulty [B] button that did not work on the wheel.Six months later...now the controls (main metal paddles on each back side of the wheel) that will select the sensitivity of the wheel are not working.  This failure is a deal breaker for me because the wheel operates at only full sensitivity now.  It is too sensitive [and] the cars I play drive on Forza Horizon 4 and 5 wildly careen back-and-forth down the road with the lightest twitches of my hands.I should have returned it to Amazon on DAY ONE!  But like a sucker - a dope I did not.  Amazon has a return window where they will generously allow a customer to return mdse. for a refund or replacement no proof of the failure required.  Not so with Thrustmaster!See Thrustmaster requires you to download their testing software and run an electronic data diagnostic test to satisfy them.  They also require a videotape submission showing the product failing to work.So at the six month point I have put the Thrustmaster in the plastic recycling trashcan at my house's alleyway.  I am not a Thrustmaster customer service diagnog-testing videographer.  That's their job!  I should be able to pay to send the product back to them.  So screw them.  Warranty my a**.Eit to add:  If you are reading this and aren't hip to the job of quick back-and-forth pressings down of large spring-loaded plastic pedals to stop and go and the two of them sticking way up on a plastic base that slides away from you constantly then pass on this model.
4,Thought it was force feedback for some reason but otherwise it’s a good item well built sturdy but doesn’t mount to my stand well but that’s ok I love it
5,It’s a great wheel I just don’t use as much as I thought
4,I loved it so far for a out of the box experience no config bought it for Forza 6. I have won every race so far in first place something I would not have been able to do with a controller.The only downside is that Forza 6 does not fully support it nor does xbox one. You can use it in Forza 6 but if you go into the wheel config screen it shows a picture for the more advanced 3 petal steering wheel configuration and so you can not change the button layout at all with in Forza 6. Also though it works on the xbox one if you go to devices it is not detected so no other config options available through xbox one. The usermanual that comes with its is as basic and useless as can be. The website for the manufacture shows the same pdf of the included user manual so no help there either. For the cost and using my Amazon rewards its great entry level wheel. Im sure ill end up buying the more expensive one and selling this one off someday once I have become a better driver and actually want to compete. This is more like a training wheel or low budget wheel for the occasional driver. Looks good works well as is.F
5,I’m 71 years old and have an XBox with a few games and three grandchildren.  I purchased an auto racing game and found that the regular controller works just OK.  Thanks to all of the other Amazon reviewers who gave a thumbs up 👍 to this racing wheel.  It ads so much fun real racing action to the game !  My 6 year old granddaughter told me she was afraid to try it : within two minutes she was hooked and after two game sessions she is already a better driver than me 😀.  Without a doubt this is the Best purchase I’ve made easy to use (the 6 year old sets it up by herself) it’s a realistic driving unit with vibrating wheel and accelerator pedal.  It’s A Five Star ⭐️ Recommendation.
4,This steering wheel is the 2nd best to the Logitech wheel in my opinion. And for the price you can't beat that. The stiffness of the pedals and wheel is about 80 percent of the real thing. The steering wheel goes about 240 degrees and the pedals are just stiff enough. The paddle shifters are almost metal lol and the they are stiff too. All in all the quality of the wheel is superb 👌. My only complaint is the wheel itself is a bit too small. About 80 percent of real life and the steering wheel mount is a cheap and seems like you have to be gentle with it. Also I forgot the pedals are interchangeable which is also cool. Get this steering wheel if you can't afford the Logitech pro.
4,The first thing that struck me after pulling this out of the box was that the paddle shifters were metal. Overall the wheel seemed of good quality though most of it is basic plastic. My son has only used the wheel for about three weeks now but likes this wheel much better than a previous wheel he had wich was smaller and had less of a turning radius. This wheel works well with the Xbox one Forza 6. However my son actually prefers to use the normal xbox controller when playing Need for Speed. He stated that the regular controller is actually more fun and realistic while playing Need for Speed. However He much prefers the wheel when using Forza 6. The wheel clamps firmly to any table like surface. The pedals however do not clamp and often jostle about when moving your foot quicly from the gas pedal to the brake. My son doesn't seem to mind but I wasn't thrilled with that. My son loves the wheel but I am not convinced it was worth the price considering he only uses it to play Forza 6. The wheel may work with other games but we haven't tried any others yet. In my sons opinion he is thrilled with the wheel so it gets four stars from me.
4,It's disheartening that there isn't a budget force feedback racing wheel from Thrustmasters for the XBox One even more so given the recent announcement of the Thrustmaster T150 Force Feedback wheel for the PS4/PS3 at $200. While the Thrustmaster TX can be found for $300 at $95 this is a great peripheral for someone looking for the experience of using a racing wheel with their favorite racing games. The lack of force feedback numbs the experience admittedly but the wheel is precise and a much better experience than using a controller. I've used the wheel with Project Cars and the recently released Forza 6 demo and it's been a fantastic experience. The wheel is simple to use out the box; you simply plug and play. The wheel feels soft to the touch and while toy like doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply made. If you're unfamiliar with using a racing wheel it's a great entry level wheel and offers a fantastic sense of immersion even lacking force feedback or vibration. This is not for someone serious about sim racing. For the serious sim racer wait for the TX Servo Wheel Base and it's eco system such as the T3PA pedals GTE racing rim and TH8A shifter. Other force feedback options for the XBox One includes the Thrustmaster TX the Mad Catz wheel and the Logitech G930 all between $300 and $400.
5,What an amazing addition to our collection of Forza racing games! Driving with this beats using a controller hands down. If you like to play racing games then you need this racing wheel. It even “clips” on to a table or desk so you can use it without having to purchase a racing wheel stand.
4,This is a perfectly good wheel for the price. It's comfortable and easy to use on top of looking good. That said I will be returning this product. I bought this primarily to play NFS Heat and sadly this wheel is NOT compatible. If you are looking for a wheel to play Heat this one is not it. Look online for compatible ones.
5,Works great right out of the box was playing Forza 5 within 10 minutes
4,It is a lot more fun playing racing games with this but it does not have full wheel turnablility so don't expect it to be like real driving. It only turns about 90 degrees either way
5,I bought this around 4 months ago and have used it almost everyday as a way to wind down or have fun on the weekends. The only downside that leaves me wanting more is the lack of a clutch pedal and force feedback however for the price of wheel I’m not upset in the slightest about them being absent. Overall I love this product and will probably return to thrust master for an upgrade in the future.
3,A little touchy with the gas and steering. Also difficult to adjust in game sensitivity. It’s tough to get used to but what’s a racing game without a steering wheel.right??In hindsightI’d buy one with a hand shifter and a clutch. Also if they are made with more realistic gas and break petals it would be money well spent. Nothing is cheap anymore so what’s the point of working if you can’t have the toys worth having.
5,Awesome wheel accurate responsive well made force feedback multiple options and for windows 10 or Xbox one just amazing! A+++
4,The wheel is fun to use but make sure to put one foot on the pedal pad because it impossible to brake without holding it down but other than that is a very cool and useful fun wheel. It does tell you how to adjust the sensitivity of the wheel so you have to look on YouTube to do it but i can tell now. You have to press Y+B+ both peddle shifters
4,Wheel is good but not great you get what you pay for.  Good for NASCAR games and larger ovals especially the plate tracks.  Not so much more technical games like F1 2021 and the type.  Good starter wheel though.
4,I love this and I was awesome after I learned how to set it up. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it slide pretty easily on my linoleum floor.  I'm going to have to hack it with some no slip rug mat or build a little rig out of wood.
5,I got this from Amazon's used store for a great deal looked and worked like new right out of the box.  Now some people knock these wheel's for not having force feedback which is at the premium for racing setups now.  However a decent one of those is going to push you to $300 plus.  This is the first wheel and pedals i've purchased since I had a set for the Nintendo 64 that many years ago.Pro's- The bungie system in the steering wheel provides pretty good resistance as you turn it.- The brake pedal is fairly firm and the gas has a bit of resistance as well.- The buttons on the wheel make it so you don't have to handle a controller while using the wheel.- I don't use them much but the paddle shifters are made of metal which is a nice feel.Con's- This will require a table or rig to mount to and i think should be pointed out a little more in the description.- If you want to chat while playing the game you do have to use a controller because of the no mic input on the wheel.I still give this a 5 star review because for a beginner like me it's still a quality product to get into racing with wheels and pedals.
5,My kids have ordered 2 of these for xbox driving games like Forza. We were immediately impressed with the satisfying quality of finishes -- the solid weight of the wheel the grips the satisfying click of shifting. The boys were looking for entry-level driving performance without wanting to go to the expense of full-seated driving options. This wheel and pedal set met those expectations. Other posters will mention the lightness of pedals: because they are portable not fixed to a chair or frame the pedals do have the potential to slide or rise up with action. But my boys had no problem with this as they used rubber hand-weights (like 7-8 lb dumbbells on hand in our family room) to brace them. It was a ready fix they slide they're readily moved when not in use plus they provide some foot rest comfort. In general steering braking and shifting occasionally are imperfect -- but that is attributable to resistance in the game specific cars driven etc rather than dissatisfaction with the wheel. Overall we were able to buy each of these racing wheel sets for about $80-90/ea which made this a satisfying driving solution at a reasonable price. We recommend it. If you don't think this racing wheel set will satisfy you then you're most likely looking for the next level up in pricing and we just didn't want to go there.
4,Was purchased from Amazon warehouse as used but like new product.  Everything looks good as far as the product goes but felt like the packaging could have been much better  the box internally was not secured and just bashed around and the box inside the Amazon box had its corners and stuff damaged as it was just sliding around loosely in there other than that the wheel and pedals seem to be in working order
4,Pros:Good looking from pictures;Fancy Ferrari logo;Product work fine;Cons:This product is not designed to hold position after installation. I bought a Forza racing chair and was hoping the wheel could be tightly fixed on my chair's table panel. However the wheel doesn't use screws or any good interface to strongly fixed onto the panel. It relies on some pressure above and beneath the panel. For me it works ok. I know it's not firm enough to handle dramatic movement. But my wife can not get used to it. Every time after her playing with the wheel it almost falls off the panel. I would hope if the wheel can be made similar to the paddle that can be screwed firmly and this would reduce the risk of damaging the wheel too.Installation manual would need some improvement too. it took me a little while to know how to install the wheel and paddle.
5,my son is enjoying it very much and uses it all the time
4,It works well but the mounting is a bit troublesome.
5,DISCLAIMER: Do Not Use My Review as a professional review or paid ad. This is purely my opinion.Firstly as an avid Motorsports consumer and Viewer of F1 NASCAR MoroGP mostly and being a new gamer to video games as a whole since the pandemic hit. This has to be the best purchase I have ever made for any form of entertainment for not only myself but my family. This is very easy to use easy to setup and store. And realistic!! I play it everyday and I still feel like it’s the first time! Best wheel ever
2,This wheel does not work with pc do not be fooled. If you are looking for a pc wheel for steam games and stuff this wheel will not work. On the other hand I have used this product before on an Xbox One and it works very sufficiently for that. If you are an Xbox only and need a wheel this one is the best one without a clutch pedal or shifter and works well with Xbox only. Thought I could make it work with pc like the description said but it doesn't work for pc at all.
3,For the price of just 100 dollars I would say that it might be worth it. Now if you're going to be the extreme sim racer then you will need force feedback. But for the majority of people who just want a decent driving peripheral then this is the option for you that won't set you back too much.If you are going to be using the pedals on carpet (like I am doing) then you are going to find a better way to hold them in place. the rubber feet on the bottom do not work on carpet. You will need a hard floor or find a piece of flat wood and place it underneath of the pedals. That will allow them to stick to the bottom.After playing with this for a few hours I would say that it takes a little to get used to but once you get the hand of things it is a real blast to use and mess around with.Although if you were hoping this device was going to actually improve your racing experience then you would be dead wrong. This thing is fun to mess around with sure but I would stick with the gamepad if you need good control for your races. I don't know what it is about this wheel but it made me worse at Forza. I was expecting to be a little better if at least just as good at the racing.I hope this helps you in your search of a good driving peripheral for your x-box one.
4,Great wheel for just messing around but it's very difficult to use due to there being no force feedback. I was under the impression it had force feedback.
3,I was expecting this wheel to have vibration feed back. Witch it does not that would of been nice to know before purchasing
3,Overall I'm fairly disappointed with this wheel I was quite close to purchasing the TX but I spotted this on sale and decided to give it a shot first since I didn't have much personal experience with Thrustmaster and with all the mixed reviews out there on the TX having issues I decided to go with a 'simplier' wheel which I suspected would surely not have any issues for a long time until the bungee cords got completely worn which would take years by my estimate.So this wheel is a decenter "starter" but I don't think I can depend on it to last very long... Mine is broke now only 2-3 weeks after purchasing.The shifter paddle no longer responds when I click it so now I can't shift or switch the sensitivity setting with the pointless 4 Button press to change it.Theres 4 other buttons on the wheel that are not being used for ANYTHING.... Why couldn't one of these pointless buttons adjust the sensitivity ?  I wish the buttons in the rear behind start/select buttons could be used for something.. they have perfect placement for your fingers while driving.. but they do nothing at all.The pedals would probably stick great to a hard surface.. but my area is carpeted so they slide everywhere. I had to rigg up some books and all kinda stuff to hold them in place because I didn't want to drill a hole thru it into my floor!
5,it is only for Xbox not PS4 or PS5
4,Great product. Some of the buttons are matches (hand shifter same as shift knob) making it somewhat redundant to have while gaming. Took a bit of time to get use to.
4,Needs a table to clip onto.  It can’t be too thick of a table.  We’ve noticed one clamped it may slide.  Again the table can’t be too thick.  My daughter is really enjoying it.  She likes the gas pedals that come with it and the feeling of driving.  I’ve tried and is a lot of fun.
3,The gas and brake are so hard to press and it tilts over when pressing the gas or brake. The wheel kinda hard to tilt and the problem is that it’s too small.
5,My son received this as a Christmas gift and he is very happy with it. He uses it to play Forza in his Xbox One.
4,Good wheel for starters best quality wheel under 200$ that I’ve found
5,The setup was easy and directions were easy for 4/5th grader to follow. When older kids and adults played with it they said that the action was great!
5,I love the way that set up was easy. All items needed was included. I think i play on it more then my child.
5,Bought for my son for Christmas. He's been playing Forza with it and absolutely loves it!
5,Very accurate. Not much else to say.
3,This product will get you by for a while. There is no force feedback. I’m running it on Xbox one for heat 5 and it did good for awhile. With a couple weeks of constant use the springs wear out giving a lot of slack in the wheel. Then I experienced it jerking my car to the left causing me to crash. But if I turned it hard to the right in the pits it would be okay for awhile. For the price I wished I would have added more money to what I paid for this and got a better one.
4,I got it for Forza 5 and Horizon 2. For Forza 5 I love it it makes the game so much better. For Horizon 2 I like it for the on road races. It's probably just me but I can not win an off road race using the wheel.Overall I'm glad that I got it. I've wanted a wheel for racing games for a long time and this one is doing the job. It's also relatively affordable. A force feedback wheel might be nice but I just couldn't justify the cost to myself. This is a good alternative. You get the pedals and the wheel and it works well.Another reviewer mentioned which setting to use for the game. That is key to getting the most of the wheel. If you use the default the cars are almost undrivable. I think it's the fourth setting that you get the best handling.
2,Despite being advertised as having PC support it doesn't. Don't waste your time unless you have an Xbox.
4,8/2017 after reporting the problem and sending a video showing the problem the company sent a new thrustmaster to replace the defective one.  Items can break but how a company responds speaks volume.7/2017 physically its fine but the steering it pulls to the right on the screen.  Odd thing is there doesnt seem to be any way to recalibrate and a google search doesnt turn up anything that dixed it.  I would be less upset but the game has had very light to no use during the school year and when the kids are off and playing the game its broken.  Ive reached out to the manufacturer wait and see.I would have given it a 5 star but the controls to navigate the game menu was painful with this the steering controls.
5,Easy to use as long as you mount it to something sturdy
4,wheelwheel is used for racing. ON you tube there many complaints that this wheel will not syn with xbox one. Yhere are also many comments to make it work. I work with these ideas for about 10 hrs.  with no good results. I now use forza 6 to race. It'a a great wheel 5 star but it's advertised to sny with xbone. that's why I replaced my xb 360.
2,I am a casual gamer I wasn't expecting the perfect steering wheel. I knew I was going to have some issues with it. But I was alright with it I just wanted something that I could use for fun every now and then..Well unfortunately that wasn't the case with this item. Again my expectations were already low. So the fact that I was still displeased says something. The steering wheel has NO dead zone at all. The slightest input and the car goes flying to the left or the right. Yes you can adjust this setting but even on the lowest sensitivity it was still a nightmare. I tried for hours and although I started to adjust I just wasn't happy. I  didn't buy this to do slight turns I wanted to hammer it like a real steering wheel.The pedals were no better either.. Every time I pushed the pedal down the front part would lift off the thing was constantly sliding around like crazy. Rendering them borderline useless. Now you can remedy this with some sort of grip or maybe a light weight. Or even a stand (another $80 ouch!) but it was still unacceptable in my mind.The buttons worked really well but I never saw a need for them 90% of them I never used.All in all this was a waste. It gets 2 stars because it looks cool and maybe if you give it some time you can enjoy it more. It was just not for meAlso the company refunded my purchase hassle free no questions asked which was nice. They also paid for return shipping.-Keep in mind I used this with Forza 5 on the Xbox one.
5,Got this yesterday(lucky guy) as a gift and all I can say is this wheel is nice It's well built easy to set up(Fozna 6) on xbox one. System recognized it at once and was breaking it(learning curve from controller to wheel) in soon after the box was opened. Table clamp works well(use an old TV tray here) and the bungee cord set up makes cornering a breeze even on those high banked tracks. Four sensitivity settings can be switched in game anytime and is a nice feature. The peddle's are light weight(but seems durable and well built with resistances close to a car) it needs to be set up with a good amount of force in mind as they can work those arch muscles in your feet a good bit in a few races. No headphone jack but I just power up the controller and use it for chat and  when not racing to save time doing tune ups and menus. I'm looking forward to many years of racing with this wheel.
4,For the money this goes for it's pretty nice. The pedals suck of course as all the money went into the wheel. The only dislike for it is that every time it powers on you have to set the sensitivity or you'll just crash every other turn. Wheel feels great in use and there are plenty of buttons. A completely freely mappable setup would have been ideal though (like how MIDI mapping works for example). Not a fan of the 'start' button serving as the D-pad (and no stick anywhere) but I can understand why they did that. Since there's no force-feedback you have to listen closely for tire squeal so you can make quick enough corrections to steering before you spin the car. Once I figured that out and adjusted the sensitivity - then  I was driving like Nigel Mansell in no-time :)
4,I would have given 5 stars if the foot pedals had had rubber feet or something to keep them from slipping.
3,Gamepass that comes with it alreaddy been used.
3,This is an average controller for an average price. If you have used steering wheel controllers on previous generation consoles then you know what to expect more of the same. If you have used high quality steering wheel controllers on PC then expect to lower your standards and expectations a lot. It has very few features other than the wheel thingy flappy paddles some average buttons and a couple of foot pedals that slip around on most surfaces. The best steering wheel controller for a console was the Gran Turismo wheel on PS3 and even that with its farty force feedback motor and excellent control was still somewhat lacking. Best to skip this accessory unless it goes on sale for under fifty buckaroonies.
5,Works well on forza horizon 345 maybe 2 (haven't tried yet) forza motorsport 5 and 6 and The Crew 2 Love it very much! thanks
4,It works well with Xbox but i wish some more games supported it. I enjoyed it with Forza but gta doesn’t support it.
2,The wheel is overall nice it’s just the buttons broke easily. The D pad is the start button as well and that should definitely not be. It should have its own D pad. Now the D pad goes to the left by itself. Since it doubles as a start button that’s a huge problem.
4,If you're expecting it to perform like a $1000 "simulator" wheel you'll be disappointed.  But for the other 95% of users who play the more arcade-style games this is more than enough and outperforms its price.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the somewhat difficult process to get it working properly on Xbox One. We may just be doing it wrong but in order to use all of the "between races" game features (Forza Horizons etc.) we have to constantly switch back and forth between the wheel and the standard controller.  A bit annoying but not the end of the world - I wouldn't buy a more expensive setup just to get around that limitation.
4,this product is really great but i could still be better in smoothness and that clamp is pretty annoying
5,Easy to put together. It was plug and play on my Xbox one. Very responsive in forza horizons 4.  Took that driving game to the next level. Now I just drive for the fun of it sometimes that’s all I do. No events. Highly recommend this product. The paddle shifters on the wheel are a great feature.
4,Only complaint is I don’t know how to mount it to the floor cuz when I mash on the brake it slides
4,This works pretty well. We have had to calibrate it more than once. We didn’t order a “stand” for it but rather used a TV tray and this is not optimal.We are currently trying to figure out the stand option as my son has stopped using this. It does take up space and you need to commit to having a stand to properly mount it.
4,This is a nice wheel for someone who wants to play driving games but the lack of force feedback diminishes the experience. It does make playing Forza a lot of fun but you do lose the experience with force feedback. The price is right so it's not too expensive but I do remember playing on the old Xbox 360 wheel which was more fun.
5,The grand kids love it
4,Good quality wheel with resistance that feels close to real driving without spending a buttload on force resistance wheels. All the buttons function well and the unit is easy to hook up. It would be nice to have a slightly longer cable for the wheel so that I do not have to sit so close to the TV. Also the pedals are attached to a baseplate that while looking nice and having good grip on top is very light and lifts up off the ground when pressing the pedals. If you don't have a full racing chair setup you may want to either weigh it down/attach it to something heavy or look at alternatives. Overall really good product and is fun to drive with rather than a joystick on a controller.
3,This wheel has rubber band system that is not bad. It is a good wheel for someone who wants a decent wheel. Then I turned a hairpin and the system broke.
5,Great for the price make racing games for fun
5,This is sturdy and well made.  It makes driving games a lot more fun. Pedals are heavy and sturdy.
5,Works great!
3,
4,it is an good product but the grip for the strewing wheel was vary lose nothing tap could not fix over all a great product
5,Muy realista el volante para xbox
4,Good product  but no way to plug in headphones.  Amy I missing something?
5,My 13 year old grandson loves it! It is very realistic. A great Christmas present! The only downfall I wish it had non-skid foot pedals. It was hard to find but glad I kept checking Amazon’s website. Reasonably priced compared to other sites with used ones for sale at 2-3 times the price.
3,It constantly falls off the table that it’s attached to while my son is driving.
1,This review is based on my customer experience with Thrustmaster. I called them seeking help with a interface issue with the steering wheel when I played Forza 7. Just like most companies. You go through their pre-recorded phone to get where you want to go for support. Now I'm listening to "You are the 4th caller. The estimated wait time is 4 minutes". You a update every minute at this point. I made it down to less than 2 minutes after going up 7 minutes. Then it started to climb. When it reached 37 minutes. I was like are they serious! By the time I was the first caller in line. I had been waiting to speak with someone for One hour and 19 minutes. I continued to hold for additional 23 minutes. A different recording of a man saying that you can now reach their online support and they simply hung up on me. I was on the phone for One hour and 42 minutes and I never spoke to anyone. I owe 3 of their steering wheels. This was the first time I had a problem and the first time I called for support. Yes I could have gotten online to get some support. Never been a fan of online support. It's too slow for my taste. I rather speak a human being over the phone. I can listen faster than I read. I can speak faster than I can type. As much as I love Thrustmaster their customer service is the worst that I have ever experienced.
3,I ordered this for my 7yrs old son and when I got it he mounted it on his desk and the wheel wouldn’t stay tightly. It kept on falling off and not staying tight. The paddles also are very light-weight so whenever he pressed the gas the paddles flipped over. That’s why I had to return it.
2,This product would be great if it wasn't broken when we got it. The brake pedal is broke. We set up an account with Thrustmaster but we can not get ahold of anyone and they have not replied back. This was a Christmas gift for my son and he hasn't been able to use it. It was the one present that he really wanted.
5,My 13 year old son loves this. He mounted onto a table and uses it all the time
4,Great wheel for a beginner on a budget. This will defiantly make you feel more immersed in racing games like Forza or Project Cars. However the steering feels quite numb as there is no rumbles or true force-feedback. The resistance bungee cord inside the wheel is used for centering. If you want a more realistic experience go for something more expensive.
4,I love it just a little mad because it doesn’t work for gta 5
5,Great entry level wheel. Without force feedback it's kind of like you're on training wheels. Worked great for me coming from playing car games with a control pad. Now I can't even imagine playing another racing game with out a wheel set up. Speaking of setup the wheel is very easy to setup either clamp it to a desk or bolt it onto a wheel stand. I eventually out grew this wheel though as I wanted to enhance the setup for both a bigger challenge and for a more immersive experience. The only add on available for the wheel was the 3 pedal set with clutch. For that reason I had to order the TX which offers 3 pedal set H--pattern and two other wheels to swap out. Also the TX will have forced feed back which I am now ready for thanks to the VG.
4,Fun to use works fairly well. Slightly delicate might not hold up to rough use or very frequent use. As with other wheels with this form factor you'll need something sturdy to attach it to. The pedals need something behind the base to keep them from sliding away.
2,Bought it at a discounted price of $80 which seemed cheap enough to gamble on. Please note that this was my first NON-force-feedback wheel so my expectations were skewed. If I did not have experience with much higher quality wheels my opinion of this one would likely be much higher. That's just the way it goes I guess. This wheel has a very small turning radius of 240 degrees so it doesn't even feel like a "wheel" to me. The pedals are abysmal and do not have a smooth action when pressed. Not that you can buy an adapter from a company called Ricmotech to us Logitech pedals with Thrustmaster wheels so if you've already got a DFGT G25 or G27 you're better off getting the $20 adapter and using those pedals. The wheel is fully licensed so you can navigate everything on the Xbox One with it. The actual feel of the wheel is nice as long as you're touching the red part.  The base is extremely light and cheap so it needs to be clamped TIGHT to whatever you're using as a stand. For me the experience with this wheel has not been good enough to continue using. My lap times are better with a controller. I learned to sim-race with a proper force feedback wheel so I depend on the feeling of losing grip and hitting curbs etc.... when you use this wheel you have no vibration at all and I miss it too much.
5,awesome. had the gt  force for the ps3. this wheel without the force feedback more enjoyable  great paddles and does the job. pedal stand is light but have it against the wall so its not going anywhere. a stand or left foot as the weight is highly advised. new pedal set with clutch avail on july 1 but weight of product unknown. sold my gt force to amazon 30.00 less than paid and will be using that towards the new pedals.  very hesitant to purchase this wheel after first reviews but so glad i scooped one up. will be getting the new ps4 thrust wheel too  since it sounds like the same product for 99.00  and with this just being the usb plug in i bought a table from amazon and its on the road with me in my semi.
4,Alright for the price. The key to racing with this wheel is turning the senstivity to its lowest setting. Its a bit on the plastic side but its an entry level wheel. The paddle shifters are solid metal and click through the gears without hestiation. I have it mounted to a small kid craft table and seems to work fine. The table mount comes included with the wheel. The included pedals work good for the price. I wish the gas and brake were farther apart from each other. All and all its a good first wheel which can't be beat for the price.
5,I ordered this for my 10 year old.  He loves it.  The wheel has an attachment on the bottom that helps secure the wheel to whatever you choose to put it on.  The pedals will probably need to be secured to something so it doesn’t move.
5,Early Christmas present for my son. He loves it!
4,So this wheel lasted for 9 months. This was my first wheel that I have bought and for the 9 months that it worked it work great. But after around 9 months it started having calibration issues and did not work. However the Thrustmaster customer service was really nice having sent them a short video of how it didn’t work ended up sending my another one. Hope this one doesn’t end up have calibration issues like the other one did.
1,It arrived and after testing it wouldn’t steer so we looked Into it and the parts were broken and some were missing
1,This wheel somehow made it to #4 on Amazon's best racing wheels. It is complete and utter CRAP!!!! No matter how good it may seem do not buy it. I bought for my son as he had a gift card willing to use. He played with it for only about two months when he told me that the wheel started to turn left suddenly or when he opened a game he wheel was already turning left. I didn't know what to do and he was very angry about it so he just put it away for about a month. A month later he took out hoping that it would work again. SPOILER ALERT it didn't. He experienced the same problems again so he just stopped using it. We tried everything in our power to fix it but nothing seemed to help. IT never worked. The thing is when he played Forza Motorsport 6 it would start off straight but after a few seconds the car will start jerking suddenly left or right even when he is keeping the wheel straight. We are currently in the process of calling them and trying to get a replacement as the warranty is still valid for us. I would NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE. IF you want a cheap wheel get a TMX Pro or something like that. The only reason I gave this product one star is onlybecause it looks cool and feels nice.
5,My son loves this for use with his Forza games on XBOX! It beats using the remote and make the whole experience that much better! The only thing is you need a stand or a desk to attach it to for use.
3,For XB1 you don't have much choice in racing wheels.  You either buy this for $100 or the $350 and up for premium Thrustmaster there really is nothing in between except a horribly rated Hori.  With that in mind this wheel is within expectation of a $100 set.  If it was perfect there wouldn't be any reason to buy the more expensive ones.  So for what it is it gets the job done and allows you to have adequate enjoyment of Forza 5 & 6.  But because it is not super responsive or easy to modulate during game play in the back of your head you always wonder what you are missing or would you be better at Forza if you had the more expensive wheel.  Bottom line this is one of those incidences where you get what you pay for.  I can only afford mediocre price and I got mediocrity performance.
4,This is my first wheel It works really well I haven't had any problems with it my driving using  a regular controller was already good this has made it even better. It's worth it if your looking to improve your driving skills in game it does not have force feedback I am looking into getting one with feedback to see the difference if there is any. This wheel is very sturdy it can be mounted to a flat table easily the pedals are good sometimes it will slide even on carpet other than that it's good.
5,Super cool. Had to return because could not reconfigure the buttons as we had on another wheel we had from thrustmaster. (Special needs son so we try to reconfigure all buttons the same) but as so disappointed that we couldn’t keep it. It felt GOOD and looked good.
4,It was pretty good my son loved it
1,If you are purchasing this for use on PC games just stay far away. It is not going to work with any games that are purchased on Steam or any online game store. It will only work for games purchased on the windows store (and this is only conjecture from other posts on steam and other sites). Why the posting says that its compatible for windows is beyond me but the fact that this isn't clarified in the post is simply unnacceptable.
3,The wheel on small turns isn't that good but then on quick turns it becomes very touchy. Not worth the price although if you can find a cheaper wheel that is the exact same I would get it it works for its purpose when you get used to the wheel.
4,Takes some time to get used to driving with it but it’s well worth it in the end :)
4,This is a good item. but this is not a living room item If you have a dedicated space for gaming this item is good. and then also you need to have a separate space for this item in from of the game console. if your only playing racing games this is good.nothing to complain about the item. if your a racing fan and have space in front of the console all the time this is the item for you!
4,Love this wheel it is just very touchy and is a little smaller than I expected.
5,MY SON LOVES IT EVERYTHING WORKED AND HE LOVES IT.
4,Todo está excelente el volante es perfecto para principiantes lo único malo es la base de los pedales de resbala si no lo sujetas con algo o si no tienes alfombra gruesa pero muy bueno en escala de 1 a 10 le doy un 9 👍🏽
4,Great wheel if you don't mind not having force feedback. It does have a different type of resistance and drives great on forza. Got it on sale for 79.99 and so far I really like it. All the force feedback wheels are expensive and ever one I have ever had always broke eventually. Thought I would try it out and I am surprised at how well it drives. The gas and brakes are firm to press so they would try to slide around on my hardwood floor. I solved this problem buy making my own mounting that blocks it from moving.
5,Got this for my grandson. Plays all the time
3,Everything is great great material except for the pedals. When you push one of the pedals the platform moves up or the sides since its plastic but other than that it is great.
4,Item arrived complete and properly packaged.  The item was on backorder for a few weeks but was sent out promptly by Amazon was they had them in their warehouse.  We have definitely enjoyed the racing wheel just which it had the responsive steering but for the money I can't complain.  It's a bargain for what it is.  Quality is descent. Just be careful running the wires as they are thin and you can fray one real easy.  We mounted it to a Playseat which does not have the exact mounting holes as I had to drill a couple myself.
5,What a difference this makes! I had been stuck on Forza Motorsport 6 on a course I just could not get past (Bathurst). To move on in the series you have to place 3rd or better and I couldn't get better than 11th.  My wife said "Why don't you get one of those wheel thingies". Good advice.  After first hooking it up I moved up to 6th using this wheel connected to a TV tray. I then got a GT Omega wheel stand (also highly recommended) and my next race was 4th and then I took 1st!  Even though this is an entry level wheel it is SO much better than the handheld controller for racing.
3,This is a truely great product and i love it but it does NOT work on pc outside of XBOX Play Anywhere racing games even though its usb. There is no way that i have found to trick games into seeing it and even trying to remap it using xpadder did not work. I hate i hade to return it because its truely well made and gives you an experience you cant get with a controller. If you have an Xbox One then don’t hesitate to buy this but if you play on PC save up and get one thats truely supported instead.
4,The response is not any better than using the controller at least that what I learned from using it.  I was expected better maneuverability with the steering wheel but it's not any better not really.  It's a good construction just short cable.  I had to buy another 10' extension to make it work for our setup.
2,The base broke on the first day my son used this - it was a Christmas gift. I was in the room and he wasn’t abusing it. It looks like a pedal rod pushed through. It still works but for how long? Not what I expected from this product.
2,I don't have much experience with other wheels so bare that in mind.I play Forza Horizon 2 and this wheel is essentially impossible to use with that game.  First the instruction manual is non-existent.  Maybe it exists on the web somewhere but it didn't get shipped with it.  Second the 'adjustable' foot pedals aren't adjustable so that appears to be a lie.  Finally there seems to be some combination of inputs that all affect the same axis.  For example it seems that pressing the gas breaking and turning the wheel left all turn the car left.  So if you are turning left you have to make sure you don't press any other control or you will turn too sharply and skid as if oversteering.  And if you turn right and press any other control then you don't turn nearly as much so you continue as if you barely moved the wheel.  The resolution?  Don't accelerate or break going into any turn.  Which means you aren't competitive in any race.I played Horizon 2 through the championship twice the second time using no assists and setting opponent difficulty to Pro.  With this wheel I have yet to complete a race (or successfully make a left turn for that matter).
1,No es bueno es muy sensible y difícil de llevar. A veces se convierte en inmanejable sobre todo en F1 cuando vas muy rápido. No lo recomiendo
2,Ok for a cheap option but not really worth $99.  Spend the extra to get a good one.  Pedals already stopped working and have to set up steering every time you use it.  My son was excited initially but that quickly turned into frustration.
4,Good productAll ok 🤗
3,The pedals don’t stay firm in place I got to put pressure on it with my foot and it starts to hurt after a while but it’s still a fun thing to useBuy this if you’re also planning on buying the stand for it so it can hold it place the stand cost $190If not it ain’t worth buying tbh
3,Wheel pretty decent. But wish it had some good forcefeed back.
3,I have a few racing games on the Xbox One and on my PS4. The controllers that come with the games are OK to drive with but I thought a steering wheel would be much more fun. But I ran into a couple problems that most won't have. I am severe back problems and sitting in a chair in front of a desk is problematic at best. I thought I could rig this up for my use by attaching it to the top of an old tv table and setting it on my lap. It's much to heavy and bulky for that. If you dont have a way to attach it to something solid like an office desk it is probably not for you.I had to return it - thanks again Amazon!
4,Great job! Your delivery guys are top notch!!!! Great job!!
3,It’s cheap for cheap quality. I would save up for a better wheel if I could. At least it still works Ig
5,We have had it for over a month. We have not had any issues what so ever except that it came with the usb cord and I had to go find and buy a usb breakway pc cord to plug into the xbox. I think it was supposed to come with it but I bought this unit used so it’s okay. I found the theee inch cord on amazon for like $12. If you’re looking for it search for EOP Zoll USB breakway PC Cable. I’ll add a screenshot of what it looks like.
4,We ordered two - for our grandsons.  One works fine but the other only worked for about a week. Now it steers the car ONLY to the right! It will need to be replaced.Must say they were a huge hit - being able to use an actual steering wheel for racing instead of the x-box controller.  Eager to get the replacement.
4,I purchased this after buying Forza Horizon 2. This wheel is very fluid but it takes a while to get used to. The brake and gas petals are also very responsive and are built to last. The only reason I can't give this product a 5 star rating is because it doesn't have vibration. Like if I were driving and I hit a wall or another car for example it should rumble/shake due to the impact but it's a good wheel nonetheless.  You won't regret your purchase.
5,I brought this for my 8 year old son and he love it. The controller is really responsive and really great entertainment.
5,Son really likes it.  Bought him an Xbox with a driving game.  Did not want to spend $300+ for a driving wheel.  While this may not vibrate like the $300 ones it still is a great game wheel.  There is sufficient tension so that it gives a realistic steering feel.  It even clips onto a table top so that it does not move around.  It comes with pedals too.  I think over time the tension on one or both the wheel or pedals with go but right now it works great.
5,Absolutely solid seat the steering wheel is actually leather as is the seat. One of the best investments my husband and I made as far as gaming. Absolutely wonderful piece of equipment completely solid...
5,My son got this for use with his Xbox. He loves it hasn’t had any issues and uses it every time he gets to use his Xbox.
5,Absolutely no regrets in regards to the purchase of this product great entry level racing wheel if you don't want to fork over a great. I've never previously owned a racing wheel before so it is only my humble opinion for what it's worth.  I've had it for about a month and though I had my doubts before purchasing it it's quickly become a permanent fixture for me.  The steering is very precise and responsive as well as the foot pedals and paddle shifter.  My only issues with it albeit very minor ones would probably be the D-pad and the foot pedals could be spaced apart a bit more.
3,No real way to keep it stable and from moving around on you especially the pedals.Secondly the pedals are to close to each other need a bit more spacing between them. When your turning it tends to make the whole thing slip n slide on you sometimes tipping it over on its side almost which makes driving with it hard.
1,I used this wheel and pedal setup on an almost daily basis and have had problems since almost day one. Everyday at least twice a day I would have to disconnect and reconnect the pedal set because the brakes would only be working at 15% when fully depressed. I it was a little aggravating but at least it worked. Now after 2 months of ownership it finally gave out and is now useless to me. I would've given 2 stars but the fact that it barely worked from the beginning made me do otherwise. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SETUP! I really hope my bad experience helped someone make up their mind. I would understand if this setup was 50-60 bucks but its 100 whole dollars and still sucks.. If you want quality invest 50 more dollars and get a Logitech wheel and pedal set. Those are as reliable as a '98 Camry
5,Great product the steering wheel is exact to what a real one looks like really enjoying this new toy. Also very nice in handling.
4,I like it alot it's good for the price I wish the wheel would turn more but you get what you pay for with 100$
5,Easy to assemble — some games have noticed it does glitch on only had it for about a month.
1,I can't believe I bought this thing. It was returned and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to buy a "used - like new" product but turns out I know exactly why it was returned. Idk what they do with returned orders at Amazon but they didn't check this over at all. The steering is automatically aligned to the right and doesn't register to the left even on the Xbox home screen. took out the wheel and re-plugged it in to the back USB ports and then it only went left and i was only hitting the gas (hands off the wheel) I did a little research and this seams to be more common of a problem than not. I ran every suggested fix test and the only difference I got was that the problem switched to the left instead of the right so idk what it is about this wheel but I assume it has some sort of software defect.I figure they've looked at it plugged it in and saw the light turned on so they said it was "like new"....absolutely unbelievable I hope they see this and change how they test returned products so that way they can determine whether or not to send it back to the manufacturer for defect.....if you buy this product BUY IT BRAND NEW or better yet not at all.
3,The wheel itself is great. The hold back in my opinion is the pedals and mounting. I also bought the Hori racing wheel and it is just so easy to mount with suction cups as opposed to the weird mounting hardware from this wheel. The flappy paddles on this wheel feel amazing and authentic. It was easy to setup and play. Just took a little while to get used to as steering isn't the same as real life. Also the pedals suck. After playing for a while my legs were sore and hurt. It is hard to press the pedal. All in all I felt the Hori was a better wheel.
1,Bought used with "acceptable" grade with a scratch being on the wheel. I fully understood it's not gonna be perfect because of it being used. I plugged everything in and the pedals didn't work. After a short investigation I found the wire  coming from the pedals was cut and the little fiber strand inside the cord was still attached which was why I didn't notice it from the start. I temporarily fixed it myself to see if it would work and it did but considering I could've spent $20 more and buy new I'd expect amazon to not miss stuff like this. They clearly don't test the used products as this would've been caught immediately. Typical quality issues from a high volume company. Not worth my time to return. I'll find a pedal set on eBay..... If the pedals worked and the cord wasn't cut I'd give 5 stars but being half of the assembly and they don't work you get one star. Had they tested it this mistake would've took less than 1 minute to find.
4,Feels great and is made with good material only one problem it didn’t come with a converter so I had to buy one for 6$ but beside that it’s fine
4,Good for what it does
5,Paso mis espectativas me encanto y el borde de el volante exente caludad el material y es facil de armar
3,Steering is difficult and the floor Pedals slide unless they are Velcro down. My son played it for a week he has played with it anymore. Not worth $99
5,For $100 it’s the best thing you can get hands down but for pro racing you’ll need one with force feed back
1,Bought a wheel as a Christmas present.  It does not work.  The buttons work fine but the wheel itself does not register as turning left or right.If you are unlucky enough to have a problem good luck calling customer service.  They are only open Tuesday through Thursday from 4PM-7:30PM.  That is it.  Even then they cannot do anything except send an email.  When asked how long it takes to obtain a replacement wheel after warranty was verified (via email) the answer was "it depends."  No estimate at all.Don't bother with this company.  Find a product that works and a company that cares.
2,Something must be wrong with the manufacturing of this wheel because it keeps having the same issue of steering to the left on it's own.  My first wheel came with the issue and the seller replaced it with a good one.  Sad to say that the next time I used the wheel it started seeing the same symptoms but not as bad as the first one.  I just gave up and decided I will not use the steering wheel and go back to the old controller.One thing I did miss having was the vibrations you get with the old remote the steering wheel being spring loaded and not having force feedback made it not even worth having.  And not having a D pad made it so hard to navigate I had to use the wheel and the controller to navigate around the menus.  I just think for 100 bucks it could have been better designed.
5,Feels like a regular steering wheel
5,This wheel was very awesome for a low price. Even though it doesn't have force feedback or vibration it still provides enough force to make it half realistic. The pedals are great and provide much more control over the acceleration and braking. And the paddle shifters are great. Loud click and feel great. I really liked the design and how they used every part of the racing wheel including the engine start the key hole and the sensitivity control. Overall if you are a beginner or an amateur this wheel is for you. It's great for the price and well worth it.
5,Bought this for my son and he loves it. Works perfect for Xbox one. Would definitely recommend this product
4,This Is An Awesome Wheel! It Was Super easy to set up. No need for screws you just need to clamp it to your desk. I love how you can change the difficulty of the steering! The only problem I have is that the pedals don't stay on the ground if you try to brake hard. Overall a great purchase.
4,The steering wheel has to be mounted to a table and the pedals slide around when putting pressure on the brake pedal
1,Wheel is just over 2 years old and jerks to left while playing. Hasn’t been abused or eve used an insane amount of time. Customer support said this-“it is no longer our 1-year warranty and that this product is economically irreparable there is sadly not much we can do to help.”Can’t even buy parts to fix it so it’s a $100 paperweight. Invest in a better brand!
1,Never had a chance to plug it in by the time I had a chance all was working but the steering was not reflecting on the screen when the wheel was turned.
1,My son was so excited to receive this as a gift. However just 6 months later it completely gave out and won’t work anymore. Very disappointed.
4,Easy to get started . It is Great for beginners. My 11 year old son loves it.
5,Honestly this was purchased for a grandson.  He seemed happy to get it for gaming  but it is a but overpriced.  Once you buy a game system the additional products should not be so expensive! We were happy to be able to buy it. I just feel excessive accessories for things like PS4 or an Xbox should not cost as much as they do. Still a nice product.
4,Me el estilo
4,Been using the old Microsoft Wheel on xbox 360 for years which has force feedback and vibration. This one doesnt. It is hard to get used to but i am very happy with it. Very precise once you adjust settings to fit your driving style.  Maybe later may get more expensive version that has the force feedback but for now i am good for a 1/3 of the price.
4,Nice quality feel it is a bit touchy at first but after a while you'll get used to it. If you're used to using a controller I'd expect to crash and spin out a lot until you get used to the sensitivity of the wheel.
5,Great xbox wheel and pedals
1,Had to return mine because it does not run on Windows 11 but the return went off without a hitch.
4,Arrived quickly and works great
5,It connects to the Xbox and mostly works with button controls. But won't let you use the wheel to steer.
5,Purchased this to play Forza primarily and hoped to use it with computer games that support controller as well. Unfortunately it will not allow for that but I am very happy with it regardless. The quality is great and it works well after looking up better settings which is likely the games fault and not the wheel.
5,Setup easy and works great for the games it works with my 10 year old son loves it. Per other reviews only 'issue' is that pedals are lite and require support to keep them from moving away but it's solved easily with something heavy behind it. All functions work well and it even has some resistance in the turn feel very cool and nicely built product and so much less then others we saw...
5,This item was a x mas gift and  haven't heard of any problem.  So I figure that he liked it.
5,It is amazing and despite other reviews it does not need an adapter
3,You have to buy the stand
1,Product never worked. It wouldn’t connect to my Xbox and It was so awkwardly big and heavy that my son couldn’t even move it. When I attempted to move it the front metal legs fell on my foot and my toenail never grew back straight. It stayed stored in a closet til it was eventually dumped. Which will happen to you if you buy this product.
4,great wheel. have had good luck with Thrustmaster products wiXbox 360. However @ this price you get no force feedback effects  Have to spend 5x the price for that @ this writing.  I do wish the pedal action was less forcefull though as the springs holding the pedals in place are unnecessarily strong.  Does a grand job of steering & braking though & the wheel buttons are very handy
5,Works great and delivered on time. I am pleased with my purchase 😉
5,I got one of these for my girlfriend it seems really well made buttons function like they should. Grip is great on the wheel. It's a little sensitive but that's a good thing overall. Pedals are light. And may need mounted to a base to get the best  results. I think it will last a long time and get many hours of use. It does not have the feedback feature but for the price I can't complain. I recommend this set for anyone who wants a good quality wheel without the higher price.
4,This steering wheel and peddles works pretty good. Their is some up and down side to side play in the steering shaft witch can translate into some swerving driving sometimes.
3,Wheel performs well and feel sturdy.  Clamps to table which is not too sturdy.  REALLY HATE that it does not have a port to plug in headset.  Workaround is to use a controller for the headset.  This is lame since it sometimes takes control of as the primary controller making the wheel useless until you reboot the controller.  This is a wired wheel and do not like that the cord is just 6 feet - I needed to get a 6 foot extension to be at a normal distance away from TV.
5,It’s good but if you play other games then like for Rison and like racing games the stew was only good for racing games other games I wouldn’t recommend it but I’m still waiting for my package arrive today and 9 PM and if you want to steal it from me my address is Villa Coronado
5,Got this for my 14 yr old son and he absolutely loves it
4,Great entry level wheel for the Xbox One . Has everything except rumble and force feedback. Features that are in more expensive wheels ($300 to $400) . Has a bungie cord feature that creates resistance has u turn the wheel . Not has immersive has force feedback  but it works . For the price it's a great wheel .
5,For an inexpensive wheel it has worked very well. It is all plastic so a little care is needed but have used it extensively without a problem. Setup was no problem either.
5,I got this for my nephew and he has used it everyday since Christmas. He is a 13 year old boy hard on his gaming equipment and so far this has held up! Highly recommend if your in the market for a set up like this but not wanting to spend big $$$
2,This was so close to being great especially for the money. But this wheel has two major flaws.Once you get all set up you realized that as you turn the wheel there is nothing to anchor the base. to imagine trying to drive your car but steering wheel column keeps shifting on you. In addition (the pedals have the same exact problem). It's very sensitive. You may be able to change a setting somewhere but I didn't look long enough to find it. As the wheel snaps back to the 12 O' clock position it wobbles back and forth a bit which makes your car go all over the road. This would be manageable if not for the first problem.If they made a simple tweak or two like adding more weight to the base or putting suction cups on the base to create counter torque when you turn this would be a great product.
2,It fell apart with in the first 8 weeks
5,My son is 11 and he adores this item. He thanks me every single day for buying it.  I'm not very tech-savvy and I certainly don't play video games but he has never complained about a single thing with this set. He loves it and uses frequently. He's a big fan of the newest Forza game on the Xbox One:)
1,I hoped to use this for steam games such as beamng.drive but even though the title says "Windows" Steam nor Windows could find this wheel. It works for Microsoft Store games according to some reviews and forums but alas it doesn't. This seems like great build quality but if you plan to play PC games steer clear.
1,Unfortunately this item came in defective and Amazon was able to refund the item minus the stocking fee. Which I’m hoping I will get a refund in that after I reach out to customer relations.
4,The stand is difficult. I ended up putting it on a tv table. The floor accelarator and break keep sliding away.
5,Hated it at first.....pretty much impossible to use effectively while sitting in your lap or trying to "mount" on a table top.  So this was almost a 2 star review.  But then I added on the stand....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061EER58/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.....and now it is perfect!So buyer beware.  If you want this to work well as is ie "standalone".....good luck.  But if you don't mind spending another ~$150 on the stand.....this thing turns Forza Horizon into an absolutely kick azz and very realistic driving game.
3,I love this wheel but mine has a glitch in it. I got it in July and whenever I am using it in a driving game on the Xbox One it randomly sends the car flying to the left with the physical steering wheel straight. This is very annoying and it makes the driving experience not as good as with a functioning wheel. I'm hoping that I can get it replaced.
3,The power cord is way to short cant play with wheel sending back i will keep the wheel if u send me a 10ft usb extension cable thks tony
4,Very fun product but the pedals should come with some dual sided tape that’s what I did to stop them from moving other than that fully recommended!!
5,Due to Corona virus and the fact that my 15 yo hasn't been playing with his friends this game has been great.
5,My son loved this. It was exactly what he asked for
3,It’s so small
5,Son loves it great wheel & pedals.
2,Out of the box I'm p.o.!  What do you mean I just spent $100 on non forced feedback?!  Might as well be an Atari controller...  In all fairness I took the price tag for granted and didn't read the full specs.  Congrats thrustmaster you really are the master at thrusting it in our $%&*s.Edit: Ok I've used it and I'm not as mad.  With the exception of the missing forced feedback the wheel feels nice.  Paddle shifters feel nice and sturdy.  I gave it an extra star for that.  I can manage but probably not ideal for drifting as you can't feel the tires breaking.  Overpriced for what you get but if you don't care about FF then it's right up your alley.
5,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIENDHE LOVES IT!!!
5,Takes a little getting used to but overall a good wheel better than using a controller
5,It is not worth the money at all over priced and does not work well enough
4,my grandson is playing with that Ferrari 458 like crazy. I am very happy he enjoyed this toy ? so much
5,Product as described. Fast shipping.
4,Good starter wheel and pedal set
4,Great racing wheel with a great relation quality/price. If you like racing games but you do not want expend a lot of money this wheel is a good option. You only have to plug in the USB cable and you are done. All Xbox One buttons to control game and console are in the wheel.
1,I was looking for a steering wheel for my son that works on both Xbox and PC. Even though it states that it is compatible with Windows this is a lie!
5,by far the best cam i have owned to date
5,It is fantastic! It shifts and is just like driving. I did not think it was going to be compatible  so we tried to cancel it. It turned out to be too late. It was one day shipping unexpected but wonderful. Turns out to be just fine! My grandson loves it!
4,Amazing handling and no input lag. Invest in velcro strips though if you font have carpet.
2,While trying to use it it would turn the opposite direction the moment it tried to turn. Made my car drift out of control. Looks cool but I won’t be able to use it for my game. (Forza)
4,The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is because there is nowhere to plug in the chat headset. Otherwise perfect for what we purchased it for!
5,Perfect racing wheel for the beginner to advanced XBox One driver.  You will need to purchase a driving came seperately though to use the wheel and the petals.  Its is easy to install with just one cord plugging into the Xbox one from the steering wheel..it offers true to life driving experience for all ages.
2,It had horrible response and over-steer. I couldn't even control the car in Forza Horizon going 35 mph. I thought it would be more fun using this instead of a controller but very unrealistic and very poor response. The X-box controller is more responsive.
1,I purchased this in November for my son birthday (Nov 24) a couple weeks ago (mid Feb) the break peddle made a pop noise and now is no longer working. He’s used it maybe 5 times in the last 2 1/2 months. Cool concept just not worth the money.
5,Excelente producto
5,Very nice love it.
5,Came fast and works amazing.
5,It is such a good product especially if you are just started my out when you get use to it it is really fun and it is really good quality it feels real
5,We bought our son an Xbox One last Christmas along with the Forza racing game which I also enjoy playing on occasion. He also wanted this steering wheel but at a $400 price tag we said he would have to wait till possibly next Christmas. Then we saw it at Amazon last month for under $100 and bought it for his birthday and he loves it. I also enjoy it and now spend almost as much time racing as he does! It definitely will improve your game!
5,It works really well and I like it
2,The bungee inside the wheel that gives resistance and centers the wheel has broken after just a few months. Unfortunate because I really like it when it works properly.
5,It's a great wheel but it broke and I don't know how to fix it in forza 5 a was playing and just got on and I would push down the pedal and it wouldn't go then I would hold the down paddle and it would go backwards but that all it would do nothing else it wouldn't steer either
2,5 months and it’s already broken. Turned left and some plastic piece inside (we opened it) snapped clean off. Used as it should be by a teenager so no unnecessary roughness. Too bad - he is very disappointed.
5,It’s great my son loves it !!!
1,I bought this item “like new” and will NEVER do that again. I’m so embarrassed that I gave this to my son for his birthday. It WOULD NOT turn on in the back the wires were exposed AND the rubber was missing on the back of one side and coming off on the other. How could anyone ever think this is like new is beyond me. I’m very upset and returning! What a waste of money and now my son can not play with his birthday present.😖
2,The wheel was in its original box. Set inside another box. That was inside another box. That was inside a very large box. And after opening it has a legit hole in the side. Works fine. Don’t wanna wait for another one. So I guess it is what it is.
5,It came with everything 👍🏽
1,Was not compatible with windows as advertised do not buy for a Windows machine
5,Love it
4,I love just having it and playing with it for one entire race........then I go back to using remote because I can't seem to control this thing. But it's great if you just like to come in last place and wreck your vehicle. I mean super awesome at that!
5,My son is happy perfet.
2,Bought one used and it came with no turning input. That's probably noones fault really because as I've seen it is a normal problem. I sent it back and promptly got a refund. I plan on getting an Logitech G920 instead.
5,Son said countable
4,I liked it wheel is synced great and easy to use pedals are stiff but thats good too.easy to set up and so far i'm loving it.
3,The wheel is a little expensive at $99.99 for a steering wheel that has no force feed back. But other that that it's a really good racing wheel. It sure beets having to pay $300 for the force feed back wheel that Thrustmaster has. I'm able to buy a force feed back wheel for my computer for only $100 dollars. It's a shame that they can't sell a force feed back wheel for the same price for gaming systems.
4,works great but I'm lazy. built a stand for it but now never use it due to not wanting to move my arms.
5,My son loves it
5,works very well!!!!
5,My grandson loves it  he's 9 and said that it is fun but a little hard to use at first. But once you figure it out  you want to buy more games that you can use it with.
1,There was no usb like it said so i couldnt even use it it was some weird round connecter that i have never seen before absolutely terrible
5,For the money works very well. If it was in the budget I would have gotten a forced feed back version but this still makes games fun. I used it to make a rig using a real car seat I got from a salvage yard.
1,One month of very limited use and already the brake pedal broke! The window of us being able to return it literally just expired one day before so now we are stuck with this! Don’t waste your money on this product…
1,When it arrived it Wad in very horrible packaging. I assembled it the way I was supposed too clamped it to my desk and then plugged it into my PC for the first time. I turn my PC on and it recognized it but it just wouldn't work on any single game that I owned and none of the buttons would work. I then spent the next three hours trying to figure out if you could download drivers for it but i came to the point where I gave up and then did not feel like messing with it anymore. I then I plugged it into my Xbox and It did not recognize it at all either.  No matter which USB port I plugged it into it just wouldn't work. I know this is an entry-level steering wheel but still you think it would at least work on one platform. Very disappointed.
5,Well made and it seems like it will last. Steering wheel feels nice and you can adjust the face or shoe of the pedal. Very nice. Cant beat the price either.
5,He loves it
3,Wheel is good. Clamps tight to flat surface. Pedals are the weak link. Impossible to get to stay out. I've tried just about everything but when your mashing the pedals in a race there while assembly slios around. I've tried tapping then non skid on the bottom even mounting to a larger base. Nothing hold then in place
5,My 10 year old loves this setup!  He has a touch of cerebral palsy so the gears at his fingertips make it easier for him to play.  Good buy for the money!
5,Kids loved it
1,Item title clearly states that it is Windows compatible. Technically it is but only for X-Box supported games. Bought for my kid so he could rock Assetto Corsa. Super sad when we discovered that it doesn't work.Sad kid angry dad. Some clarity (and transparency) goes a long way.Sending back.
1,sooo.. i play forza a lot as in my ONLY xbox game. after reading your alls reviews i knew i was taking a risk. 50/50 -  AT BEST. but hey why not. it worked for 30 minutes tops. then the accelerator and steering stopped working. i knew the gig was up... the majority rules. this thing (even the 27ish minutes working) was/is not something i would recommend to anyone. ever.
3,for forza horizon 3 you can not do a single race due to the lack of being able to turn the wheel with out over turning and breaking it This product needs better development . Its broken two weeks already.Would like to know if can get a refund?
5,But this product for the grandsons fourth third and first grader they play with that a lot and their dad hooked on to the cart that comes with it so it's adjustable I was suggesting anyone buy this product for their Xbox
5,Granddaughter's Birthday present. She was pleasantly surprised. One of the guests a teen (granddaughter is 9) said he's been wanting one and will be her best friend until he gets one.
5,Very durable. Very lifelike.  Wish the foot petals had a suction cup or something to keep them in position when pushed on. Other than that they are great!!
1,Product description clearly says that it works with pc. However it does not. Also when I went to Thrustmasters support page they specifically state that it’s not pc compatibleNow everything is on back order and I’m stuck. Really irritated. I’d give it an even lower rating if I could.
1,I bought this wheel twice now. Both times the wheel started veering left in the game. The wheel would be straight but in the game it would be left. GARBAGE!. I cant give 0 stars so I had to give at least one
3,For the 2 months of use we would give these (we bought 2) 5 stars but then they started veering and we could not get them to align anymore so my son and husband got very frustrated trying to use them.
4,Don’t know yet this is a Christmas gift
4,Peddle do not stay down
5,When I first bought this product I was really surprised on how many bad reviews there were about it. Getting down to business it's a very good steering wheel. I have little to no complaints about it. For beginners I would defientely recommend this since it is very easy to use and durable.
5,I liked it eventhough it doesn't have vibrating future. But the force back ( manual) is very good.  The steering seems realistic heavy and does the job. You have to use peddles with Forza.  And buttons assignment is dependent on the game you play.
4,Works well!  Looks to be built quite good.  I like it better than the "joy" stick.  Don't know about the kids!!
1,No era el que necesitaba
4,Great device for the money.  Pedals could use a little more weight to keep from moving.  I used some grippy rubber liner to gain more traction.  Still not perfect but useable this way.
1,We bought this wheel 6 months ago and it stopped working. No idea what is happening but having huge huge issues with this product. Worked great when it functioned and then... nothing. Having a very hard time getting customer support on the line too. So disappointed.
1,Expensive for what it is. Steering is extremely loose and hard to control car even with sensitivity changed. You have to have something to clamp the wheel on to or else you are holding it in your lap. Great concept poor design.
5,Perfect
4,Grip easily good quality. Works great with racing.
5,Is it realistic? Check. Is it durable? Check. Do I recommend you buy it? Check. Just buy it already. Great bang for your buck. Be advised that this wheel doesn't vibrate or have force feedback though in my opinion it is not needed to enjoy.
1,Being excited to get the wheel only for everything else to work but the steering. This is a disappointment knowing it is unfixable and I have to spend more money to buy a new one
1,Brake stopped working after just a few hours of playing. Tried to get a replacement sent on Amazon and would only offer  a refund. They same steering wheel is now $50 more than it was when I purchased it and Amazon would not replace it.
4,Turn the wheel right.  The car goes right.  Turn the wheel left it goes left.  Thumbs up!
1,This item arrived in a very damaged inner box. The wire for the foot pedals was frayed almost into two pieces.
5,My kid loves racing games and has been asking for a racing wheel for awhile. So I decided to get this one for him. Now sometimes I forget he is even here he plays with it so much!
4,Very fun! Makes games like a forza 7 feel very real.
1,Was bought as a Christmas present for my child for him to open and not be able to use. Would give negative stars if possible. Internal broke part so it couldn’t have broke in shipping. Will be returning and not purchasing the same brand product.
5,Las cosas que compro en amazon son de muy buena calidad y muy atentos con nosotros los clintes gracias amazon por el servicio que nos brindas .grcias
4,I bought it for my son to use with Forza Horizon.  He loves it
4,Only used it one time really touchy on forza 6 havent tried it in another game
5,Great beginner steering wheel pedals do move when you press hard but that can be fixed by putting your left foot down to hold it down.
1,I saw all of these reviews saying that it breaks down easily and quickly but I went ahead and bought this because of how soon I would get it. That was my biggest mistake although it worked great at first a week later it completely broke down by this I mean that nothing was working. The wheel would move but nothing would happen in the game I would click the buttons and nothing would happen and the same went with the peddle.
2,Wheel is not good.  It works sort of on my X box 1.  2 seconds a lap slower than I do on the controller.  Have to reset the sensitivity every time you start the game. Instructions are minimal .  Press 4 buttons at the same time to change sensitivity is stupid.  Bungee cords are too strong. Clamping to the table system is not well designed. Controls are not user friendly ..  I have had other wheels and pedals for the PC that were much better. Now on the X  box cannot use them.
1,My kids used their pocket money on this. Very excited to be able to play Forza. Mounted it on a dedicated table. Used gently and only very occasionally as the kids usually play with flight simulator. This stopped working within two months. Got hardly any use out of it. It does not pick up the movement from the wheel anymore. You need to rotate all the way to the right before the car will turn even a little to the right.
5,This wheel works really well the grip is really good on the wheel and the pedals work well. You have to mount it properly or it will not work well. Most of the negative reviews are from people who don't know what they're doing or just suck at racing games.
3,It's okay. Super lightweight and doesn't hold well if you get a little passionate about your fake driving. The pedals also slip everywhere because they are so lightweight so they need to be secured down or have something heavy put behind them.
1,It broke after only a few uses. Only had it little over a month. Was a Christmas gift for my son. The plastic inside broke. They should replace it.
3,This was a great product for the price however some of the functions on the steering wheel does not work during the game.
1,The racing wheel was acceptable for about half an hour. Then the right shifter paddle broke. 20 minutes later the left paddle followed. Do not purchase.
5,It works fantastic the steering wheel stand is not included. I had one from my other steering wheel/peddles for the Xbox360. Just slapped these with it and have been playing it non-stop.
5,This is awesome!!!!
4,Good beginner steering wheel no feedback/vibration.  But is convenient for beginners before moving up to the more expensive set-ups.
4,good build quality
4,Bought it for my son he likes it very much.
5,My son loves it. Uses it mostly for Forza 6 and 7. Looks good feels good for being majority plastic (paddle shifters are metal) and the wheel springs back to level if let go from a turning position. Definetly gives you a better playing experience for games like Forza.
5,Makes drifting more fun! Just don't forget to adjust the settings by clicking "LB+RB+Y+B" at the same time on the wheel before playing.  I use setting 4. (Manual that comes with wheel will explain how to adjust)Would of really loved the the other thrustmuster product but do not want to spend $300.For the price definitely 5 Stars!
5,Bought it for my grandson he uses it about every day. Would recommend others that are looking to buy it good quality great price.
5,My grandson loved it.  It's much bigger than I thought it would be.  My grandson is 9 and he has used it constantly since receiving it.  Even his four year old sister has successfully used it.  Good buy.
1,This wheel is the biggest POS I have ever purchased. Hands down = JUNK A$$ crapola!Worked great for 4 hours - just enough time for me to get a feel for the steering feel for different cars. Then I decided to change the steering sensitivity and the entire wheel froze. Believe me I tried everythng. Unplugged it restarted entire Xbox One. yada yada ....NOTHING. The wheel would not connect to the Xbox One after making steering wheel changes.I should have taken heed to the 1 and 2 star reviews of this wheel but I thought "IT CAN'T HAPPEN TO ME." Oh yes it can and it did. Bit me right in the a$$.And returning this item .............. WOW!!! ............... what a debacle!Lesson learned - from now on if I see a product with lots of 1 & 2 star ratings and sold through a third party I will refrain from buying.
1,It broke almost instantly. I was playing F1 and using the break as you would expect not especially hard and the plastic on the pedal itself just snapped off. Piece of junk.
5,The setup wrks well!
5,Make sure you have a sturdy desk and mount for the pedals
3,Started off great. Unfortunately even before a month had gone by it wont turn on anymore. Waiting to hear from Thrustmaster support site before i return it.11/4/15  Update : Never did hear from Thrustmaster so I returned it painlessly and quickly. Thank you Amazon. Got it replaced so far so good.
1,I recently ordered this product for Forza the first wheel I ordered did not work right away the brake pedal would not register. So I got an exchange thinking the problem would be fixed. I had the same brake pedal issue with the new one.
5,This was a Birthday gift to our 16 year old Grandson who had fun “driving” with his buddies.
2,I was pleased with the arrival of the product. My son attempted to use it after it came after Christmas which we knew and it dosent work. The pedals allow the racing games to forward the car but the steering wheel wont allow the car to turn. Not satisfied with this product now knowing i spent alot of money and it dont work.
4,nothing wrong with it just wish the wheel could turn 360 degrees
5,Easy set works right out of box no calibration needed
5,The item was advertised as used.  But was in great condition when arrived.  My son love it.  Works great.
5,After reading some of the reviews I was unsure about purchasing this. FORZA HORIZON 2 was the first racing game that i have played and this steering wheel works great with it. I would recommend it. If you really want to take the game to another level purchase the racing steering wheel stand also.
1,says its meant for pc it isnt
5,Do u know how to connect to gta
5,Great buy!!!!
1,Junk.  My kids bought this for me for Christmas and here it is the 4th of July and it is already useless.  The wheel will randomly jerk to the left even when I am steering in a straight line sending my car straight into the wall.  Really disappointed with this product. I thought it would be a good entry level product that I would trade up for a more advanced version but given the quality of this product I will not buy any thrustmaster products in the future.  Don’t wast your money save it for a better quality product.
5,Really high quality and feel at a low price compared to competition. The paddle shifters are usable in forza games by using custom settings in driver difficulty mode. You can select manual instead of manual & clutch so that you can get the most use out of the features of this wheel without needing the clutch peddle.
5,This was a birthday gift for our 10 year old granddaughter. Her 8 year old brother has a X-BOX 1 so they use it together to play games. They are very happy with it. They love having the pedals with it.
4,Nice
4,not the best but good for price
4,I really like it my first wheel it works really well to play Forza Horizon 3.
3,The product is decent for young player and for the price. our is stop working after 5 months -  turn on light is not functioning
5,My son is 15 and loves racing games. This wheel and pedals xbox controller was such an amazing gift for him. He loves it!! He feels like he is driving the sports car on his game. It really is very cool.
3,I never got used to this wheel while playing and neither did my son. It just never seemed to act right. I would not by this again or suggest it to anyone..
2,Bought two for Xmas for my daughter & I to play Forza 7.  We've only used them 4 times for 1hr. each since unboxing Xmas Day.  Between our busy schedules - her school & me w/work we don't get to play that often.  Sadly went to play the other day & noticed that one wheel no longer works.  Hoping Amazon will replace since NO WAY this thing should break after only 4 one hour uses. Stay tuned...
4,kids are likes it. my coffee table is kinda of thick so I am not able to clam it down.
1,Plugged the unit into Xbox one and Xbox S series. Buttons registered however steering wheel will not work. Tried all of the recommendations for fixing we could find in the user manual and on the internet and none worked. Other reviews confirm the issue with the steering wheel.
3,Arrived on time. Only problems i have is that you must start the game up with the steering wheel and it is really hard to steer. My kids are not excited to play because driving is a struggle.
3,Don't let the description fool you. This does not work on Windows 10. I read that you can use it on Windows 7 so I downgraded and it also did not work.Apparently only the expensive wheels work on pc.
3,doesnt work with Need for Speed at all.  And it locks up in turns on Forza Horizon 2 and Forza Horizon 3.
3,this wheel is really nice for the price and works really well with the xbox one but thats ware the problem begins yup it is as far as i know not compatible with the pc. and i was looking for a pc and xbox one so i returned it to get the force feed back one
4,Its great I give a 4
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I ordered this for my son to play racing games. Maybe had 40 hours of light use and it is broken. You can't turn left. I contacted Thrustmaster's support. Followed all of their instructions and sent requested information and video of the problem. They won't do anything. Poor products poor support. I won't be buying Thrustmaster products in the future. Probably just a 75 cent part that needs to be replaced but it will end up in a landfill. I highly recommend avoiding Thrustmaster's junky products..
4,my son like it very much.
1,Terrible. Not recommended for Xbox One. Practically useless with Xbox One. The wheel is only made to be mounted. The chords are ridiculously short (not wireless) and even if we had gotten it to work we would have had to move the sofa a foot closer to the TV. Keep in mind this is in a small TV room so using this in a normal living room setting would be nearly impossible unless you want to set up a chair every time you use it.It will not work in your lap as the old Xbox 360 wheel did. We never figured out how to get the sensitivity set to a value that makes the wheel functional. Compared to our Xbox 360 wheel from several years back this is a complete disaster.
5,It takes a bit to get used to but this wheel with the right settings is amazing and it really adds to immersion. Must have and a great entry level racing wheel!
4,I enjoy playing the game. A little difficult to learn the setup but he graphics and the wheel and pedals are quality stuff for less than one hundred dollars.
5,My grandson loves this. I think it will help with his driving skills.
5,Awesome Christmas gift for my son he loves it so realistic with forza 4!!
3,The wheel and pedals are decent. A pain to get working and extremely sensitive. Not the best to play racing games due to that fact though
5,This is a low-end priced wheel that does not provide force feed back but has good control when playing racing games. The wheel mounts well and is good for any average player who wants a wheel for a racing game.
5,My son hasn’t stopped playing video games with this. Sturdy simple instructions and works well.
4,Worked great the bungee system isnt the best but it is a must have to better your games and is a great alternative to the 300+ dollar wheels.
1,Santa brought this for my sons. 2nd day brake broke. No replacements available anywhere on amazon. Cant send back or I destroy the magic of Santa ... Geezzz.
5,It works great but the clamping could use a little work
5,Bought it for my son. He is very happy with it...
1,My son saved up to buy this. He was very disappointed. The alignment was all off and he couldn't get it to work well enough to use it. He's pretty tech savy and went through all the calibrations. Now it sits in the corner on a box. Definitely disappointed
3,Seems to good quality unfortunately i was an idiot and did not read the title product this is not compatible with the XBOX 360. for the ONE only
4,on time and as described
3,I got the pedals but didn't came with the wheel
5,My son has a great time pretending that he's in a real race
2,Worked great for a week or 2 then started pulling to the left in the game. Looked the problem up online and it seem to be a recurring problem with this wheel. My son was disappointed in it! Ordered a replacement if this one messes up i will be returning it too and wont buy this brand again. Will update once we have tried out the new one for a while.
1,Broke. Ridiculous. Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 was great for 6 weeks. Suddenly all turning control was lost. Tech support is old school “blame the customer”. There are several DIY repair videos on youtube.com so it seems there is a regular need to repair these things. Our problem began a few days past the amazon.com deadline for returns - sooo WE’RE STUCK WITH IT! LOOK OUT SHOPPERS!
3,Was great at first but only lasted a few months of use from a 9-yr old before wheel started loosening and certain controls became unresponsive when pushed.
5,Bought this for my son for his Xbox one he absolutely loves it. Very easy to hook onto a table for use.
5,My wife loves her wheel and its still kicking strong 💪 I haven't had a problem with it at all and I've had it for about 2months. The only thing I can say is that finding a place to set it up is a pain but I figured it out.
5,Got it for our Grandson for Christmas and although it arrived late and he just got it Sunday he loves it and couldn't wait to get home to use it!
1,This is a cool idea but junk in reality. This wheel has so many issues with Xbox the worst being the games and console just don't like it being connected and will constantly lose connection. Also Thrustmaster had the big bright idea not to make a place to plug in a mix / headset. There is a workaround but that too is ridden with bugs and issues. Do yourself a favor and a trip to the UPS Store to return this piece of junk and stick to the wonderful award winning Xbox One Controller.
4,Its a great wheel for anyone looking to spend just a little amount of money to get a good product
5,Got it in a week after buying and ever since then it's been prefect but the only thing is it need a  proper table to drive on you can't use a fold out one
5,If this is your first wheel and are looking for  decent wheel at a cheap price to play your racing games then this wheel is ideal.For an experienced wheel user it might be worth forking out the cash for a force feedback wheel.
1,It broke the second day of use and it wasn’t a little kid playing so it didn’t get abused sent it back got a Logitech and I’m much happier
2,The stand under doesn't support the full weight of the wheel and the unnecessarily bulky back doesn't weigh hardly anything so it'll constantly topple over on the whatever surface you have it on other than that it works but the pedals were too hard for my son to push down after a while so he just opted for the regular xbox remote so not sure if money was well spent.
5,I bought for my son and he loves it.
5,Wheel doesn't stay in the middle every time after a little use but it's still works just fine.
5,Works good son and his friends play it all the time. I really need to get the bracket it bolts up to thou it makes it easier to use.
1,Doesn't work and is a piece of garbage. It won't work with my Xbox as previously stated.
4,Was a gift and was received with great joy.
5,Ive owned three of these wheels and they are phenomenal. They may not have all the force feedback like expensive logitech wheels but I prefer this one anyway.
1,this is a complete piece of trash! do not buy! repeat. DO NOT BUY!!! not only is this not compatible with most of the games i’ve tried inc Cars 3 and Trackmania but even when I got it working on Forza it only worked for 1 day. The next day the accelerator didnt work and now the steering doesnt work! complete and utter rubbish. When looking online for help I now see the amount of people out there having the same issues! wish i’d have known before buying. This was Christmas present for my 8 yr old who is now devastated his present didn’t work past Christmas day! DO NOT make the same mistake
1,Peices started to fall out of it within 3 days wouldn't work correctly when we looked to see where peices had come from to make it through Christmas- found the thing had been hot glued together stopping the steering wheel from turning.
5,NICE!  open boxes from amazon are best for it. its nice thoe. i have it hooked to a table in front of a 200 inch projector . 16 feet away
5,My son loves it but you will need to purchase the stand for it. The base of the steering wheel does not connect to nothing. So when turning the wheel makes the entire wheel turn.
5,My son loves it. Works as advertised.
5,I got it faster than the date given and it worked. That's good enough for me.  I know there are better wheels out there but their prices are ridiculous. This wheel will do just fine for all you Forza lovers
2,It’s nice but feels cheap. The build quality is not so good and the force feedback is terrible compared to others. Would recommend people put in that extra 100 and but the logictch. It’s so much better and it feels so much real. I’ve only had this for 3 1/2 weeks and the rubber is starting to come off.
3,It took 3 wheels to get one that worked.  Unfortunately this is all you get for $100 these days but it does the trick.USB cord limits the distance from the unit.  Makes me long for the old Microsoft force feedback wheel.
4,Great wheel for the price.  Easy sensitivity settings.
4,It is fantastic except for not having forced feedback.
5,Works perfectly and the wheel feels super comfortable to use.
5,Son Loves it. I usually don't play video games but I did and the wheel make it more realistic in controlling the cars
5,Bought this for a friend and I am very happy with it. Yes it is not force feedback and yes it is only a two pedal setup but you can't really ask for more at this price. It works well and it a lot of fun.
4,Worked well right out of box.  Easy to change the sensitivity lower for better control for a new comer.
2,The steering wheel worked wonderfully at first and was a blast to use. Recently I have started to notice a twitching in the steering wheel in the game even when I don't turn the actual wheel. It completely turns my car even when the steering wheel is straight. This product is very expensive but doesn't last long at all!
1,Bought as a Christmas gift for my son. I I mean he loved it when it worked for the first 24 hours. The D-pad (Engine Start button) which controls the on screen up down left right function is glitching. Resetting the USB ports per Thrustmaster recommendation did not work. Also tried calling Thrustmaster technical support but call says all tech support reps are helping other customers and there is no option to stay on hold. Called back several times and received same message. Going to exchange for a replacement and see how it goes. Will update my review pending the outcome of exchange process and performance of new Thrustmaster steering wheel.
5,The steering wheel works really good Using it for nascar heat four
1,Nothing on wheel worked. Pedals operate Xbox button works LED lights but none of the buttons or the wheel work. Went through the troubleshooting tips no luck. Returned for #2. Looks like the Start Game/Pad button is broken which may be causing the rest of the problems. This is for a 9 yr old so I wasn't looking to spend $300. Honestly Thrustmaster seems to be getting worse. I am on #5 of their T-flight Hotas since May.
5,This is my sons 2nd Thrustmaster he literally wore out the 1st one! He just loves it...
5,Product was a sinch to set up simple plug&play was awesome took simulation racing to a new level
5,Great steering wheel for the price. Makes it alot easier to play forza 6. It doesn't have the feedback but can't see myself paying 400 dollars for a controller.
2,it would randomly start turning one way out of no where
4,Provides exactly what I wanted to pay out of a wheel.
4,force feedback would make it the perfect low price wheel and pedals
5,Not bad for the price. My driving obsessed 10 yo loves this. I recommend that this is used with a driving oriented seat like the PlaySeat for best performance. This wheel MUST be mounted to a table or stand unlike traditional controllers or Wii style wheels.
5,Great wheel minus force feedback for the price point. I attached to the Wheel Stand Pro which is vast improvement over attaching to TV tray or desk and increases the gaming experience and comfort.
5,Great unit. Bought it for my son and it took us a minute to figure it out but overall it works wonderful.
5,Got this for our son for Christmas and he loves this he plays it everyday still and still works great
5,Son loves it.  Keep in mind it attaches to a table via bolt clamp on bottom of wheel and wired to xboxone.
1,Got this for a Christmas gift for my son says its brand new and this is how the box came horrible box is all ripped up huge holes in it  i had to rate it one star because it made me  other wise it would be a zero
1,The Box was damaged and beat up in the box there was only the wheel and pedals the clamp and manual were missing. When i plugged it in and started to race the wheel was turning all the way to the left when i didn't touch it and it would stop turning left. I then restarted the race and it turned all the way to the right and when i touched the wheel it turned to the left. Dont know if it was shipped liked that or it was damaged during shipping but it is unplayable.
4,Good wheel so far. Have to dial in real sensitive. Have not used it much been busy.
1,Brake broke after a month of use.  Save your money!!
5,My son loves this thing!!
4,Love it but it's very sitive.
4,Good little wheel for a hundred bucks.
4,Very good product good price it could be better if it has some vibration or force feedback.
5,good
4,I like it
5,My son loves it! Don’t know how good or bad it is but it was a hit as a Christmas gift!
1,This wheel sucks. It's cheap yes but it works horribly.
5,This is a good steering wheel!!..we had a rather aggressive kid over and the wheel held up..no problems!!..well done!!
3,Aside from a very noticeable lack of feel just off center this wheel is fine but it's not $99 fine.  I'm all in for $49.  Lose the Ferrari tie-in and we'll talk.  Mine's on its way back.
5,I really like this wheel ...It doesn't have force feed back but .... for the money it's not bad.
3,The wheel worked once or twice and then quit working.  The manufacturer is sending me a replacement unit.
5,My 9 year old loves this uses it to play Forza he says it has made him a better driver
2,This wheel is not recognized by the X-Box one in the add a device window in settings so what I've found is every time I play a different game then go back to Forza 6 with the wheel I must re-calibrate and adjust the sensitivity.This wheel also is not very good with Forza 5 at high speeds (100 plus) it is almost impossible to keep the car straight.
2,Seemed like a great addition to our gaming system at first. But after a little use we noticed steering glitches. We looked it up online and noticed many others had the very same problem. Unfortunately for us we learned this one week after the deadline for being able to return the product.
5,Great if you do not want to spend $350 for the force feedback wheel. I've set the sensitivity to 3 and have no issues with the centre feel and it is doing fine on long high-speed straights. Getting a wheelstand is essential IMHO.
1,Well the product itself is decent for the price. However if you do not have the steering wheel completely level it will not work. We have an Xbox one and this steering wheel was purchased to go with forza. Mistake. How can you drive and maintain the steering wheel at a constant level position. Impossible.  So now I am looking for another steering wheel that will mount flat or atleast have a better stand device. Huge disappointment.
3,it is okay but both paddle shifters don't work
5,Got this for my brother and he loves it! It was easy to hook up and he didn't stop playing FORZA 6 for about 6 hours....worth it for the price.
4,No rumble or feedback but overall good product
1,If I could give bo stars I would. It does not work with xbox one like the box itself says. So made my son 13 paid 160 for something that dont work and not I have to drive 30 mins out of my way to return something that should have worked. Not happy with the service and this seller!!!
1,Spent hours trying to get this product to work.  Like others--everything worked but the wheel would not steer.  We tried all the suggestions (rebooting not having controllers on etc.) and we still could not get it to work.  In googling solutions we found many others had the same problem.  Horrendous product.
1,Very disappointed with both Amazon and Thustmaster. Purchased with Prime for my son and got it in two days. He loved it for the hour that it worked then it just stopped connecting. Called Thrustmaster who recommended replacing it through the reseller. Did the exchange and Amazon now says shipping in two to four weeks for the item I got in two days. Really disappointed in both of them. TM used to make good products but I am seeing that the issue we have is common with this and other TM wheels.
5,Now I can play xbox with my boys! It is a very good product. It is amazing how realistic it turns out the driving experience.
5,after 2 months I thought there was no d pad and was pissed because I had to use 2 controllers. Then I found out the engine start button is a d pad. 0.o. Just a hint
4,It's a good investment for the casual forza player
5,NO FORCE FEED BACK. Sorry when i looked at it i couldnt tell but even without the force feed back its a great wheel to see if you wanna spend 4 to 8 hundred dollars on a set up.
4,Still trying it out but seems to be just what I needed.
1,No matter which USB Port I use.......I have had to shut down the XBOX ONE reset the power and it's hit or miss.  It's great when it works.  Called tech support and they said 'This is the First time we have heard this' yet.....there are long tutorials on how this is setup.Very Dissapointed.
1,My son was so excited to get this... Then totally disappointed it didn't work with the Xbox as stated. They sent a shipping label that I had to pay for and it cost me $45.50 to return. My son wants to try it again but no way will I risk it at that shipping price... :(
5,Very nice wheel for the price just make sure you have something solid and heavy to clamp it to because it isn't as heavy as the $300-$400 ones. Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade their racing game experience.
5,Awesome gift for my nephew. Works great and is well made
5,Fun accessory for my son's driving games. He loves it!!! The whole family has enjoyed it as well.
3,Non feedback wheel. Limited to 270 degrees rotation for the price a good starter wheel/pedal.
1,FYI- This Steering Wheel is not compatible with newer racing games like Forza Horizon 4 and F1 2018.When I contacted Thrustmaster Customer Service about this issue they said I should contact the racing game studios to complain. I would hope an update would be forthcoming for these games. This is rather disheartening as I only purchased this for my son 1 year ago.
5,Great
3,Received a defective wheel had to order a new wheel
5,Fast delivery
2,Well shame on me for not noticing it wasn't wireless but even so the USB cable is too short to sit any distance from the screen.  The build quality is quite poor (I design consumer electronics for a living) and the pin was missing from one clamp foot so they don't do much outgoing quality assurance.  I can count on one hand the things I've returned in my life and this was a no-brainer.
1,This steering wheel looks great and feels sturdy. However once we started playing FORZA with it it started to lag and you need to press the buttons more than once.... This was only 3 months after we purchased.  The steering also lags.  I purchased another one and now less than a month it does not work. Both my son and I are quite disappointed with this product.
1,We’ve had this steering wheel since Christmas and it worked for a month and now the steering wheel has a major glitch and won’t steer.  This is very frustrating for my son as it was a Christmas gift and has allready quit working. There are a lot of fix it solutions on YouTube so obviously this is a major problem with this steering wheel However none of these solutions have worked for our steering wheel.
4,Sometimes doesn't work.
2,Was not working great right off was not accurate broke 3 days later entering a left 2 on laguna secca on forza 7. It just snapped inside and went limp :( Amazon handeled the return well and had my money back in 3 days.
5,This is the best thing I got .it works so good that it's like driving a real car
5,Had zero problems.  The wheel is very amazing.  I love it and works very well for fh3.
1,The steering doesn't work.  In Forza Horizon 3 my son will be turning the wheel fully to the left and the game will register a hard right sometimes.  He will also sometimes be holding the wheel straight and it will suddenly throw him off the course.  We've tried all 4 different sensitivity levels and various settings in the game configuration but it just doesn't work.  I know it's a budget wheel and not to expect perfection but the performance is terrible.
1,Bought this 3 weeks ago and at first it worked great on my Xbox One.  Racing games are much more fun with the wheel.  HOWEVER... Today I tried to play some Forza and the best way I can describe it is the right D pad is stuck. Even without touching the wheel it steady switches to right.  No matter what I did it will not unstick.  Can't do anything with it now.  Luckily I am within my 30 days and returning it tomorrow.  Can't recommend it so far.
1,Bought this in April I always wait about 6 months to review. It is a good wheel but it is October now and the wheel twitches on screen and turns to the left for now reason out of the blue. I don't even play the game that much. Upgrade and buy Logitech my dad bought one and is a much better product and will last longer if you can afford seems like a better value.
2,Update: After some infrequent use the wheel automatically pulls to the left in a glitchy manner. Not very durable and disappointed with this product!!Used it for a few times now. Seems like a good wheel for the price. Although the pedals need more weight to keep them from moving around during the drive.
5,Product is nice
5,Bought an upgrade so we sent this one back but the short time we had used it it was worth the price
2,This item broke after 2 months  Would like to return for a refund.  Great idea but the wheel does not work appropriately with the game.  The wheel is too loose and makes the car turn left.  We are not sure how to get a refund.
5,Great
1,It did work for the first race then it started to veer left constantly without turning the wheel. It’s kind of frustrating to play with it but most of all it’s even more frustrating not to be able to have the option to reach the vendor to see if there is anything we can do to fix the issue. The only option given is to return the item!
5,It took me a day before I figured out that the red engine start button is a D-pad. Otherwise this is awesome.
3,works okay I let my 4 year old twins play forza 6 with it. the wheel hasn't broke yet so I'd say its built pretty well.
5,Son love it
2,Got this for my son. It seems to only work on race ing games exclusively. It doesn't work on GTA. But it does work on Forza. It has a very poor stand. (I did not buy the stand up rod) You can only stabilize it on your lap.
3,Did not center.  Had to return.
2,It was too stiff and didn’t seem to work with my Xbox I’ve already gotten rid of it because it didn’t work well with F1 video game.
5,it works just fine thank you
1,this unit did not work out of the box It was a christmas gift and I am very disappointed with this item. The steering is very eradic and out of control.I purchased this well in advance of christmas because I wanted to make sure I had it under the tree on christmas.the return window has expired and I am left with a bad unit.
5,Awesome wheel for the price... Definitely better than a controller..... But if u really want a great experience I'd suggest go big or go home.
4,Good option for that price.
5,Great wheel great quality no complaints at all very well built and good quality happy customer here
2,Is this a joke? How could anyone give this 5 stars. Doesn't sit right for 100$. It feels like a toy this thing they call a "racing wheel"  doesn't even give you half of what a thrustmaster TMX does.
5,Awesome purchase for my son who loves his games! Definitely a purchase perfect for any gamer in the house!!
1,Embarassing quality. Shown as “very good” condition and as I opened it found the centre was all scratched over the logo like someone did it with a knife. Red padding on the wheel was also torn and barely hanging on. Would not recommend it to anyone...
5,This wheel is great. It works very well with all the games I have tried it with. It attaches to the table and it stays very stable and doesn't move around.
5,Awesome gift.  Receipt loves
1,After finally getting it setup to work with our Xbox One it started glitching.. Turning left with no input. Tried resetting by following instructions etc. No luck. Not worth the time and effort spent on it. Good luck getting it to work properly if you buy this.  Looking at all the recent reviews maybe they had bad batch? Compatibility issues? Not my problem anymore.
1,Bought the wheel but it does not work with Forza 5 or Formula1 2015. After many hours of trying calibrating changing settings etc we called Thrustmaster who say it is not their issue but the game maker's problem. Called the game maker but they pointed at Thrustmaster and Microsoft. Calling Microsoft is always hell... So left with a non-working product with no support.Do not buy this products if you are not willing to be your own tech support or expect a stable product that actually works!!
1,This steering wheel is not worth the plastic that was used to make it. The steering is absolutely terrible. The fact that steering is controlled by rubberbands makes driving jerky and uncontrollable. Any small adjustments you try to make in a turn get thrown off completely. This is a piece of garbage!!
1,The wheel doesn’t work I hooked it up and it just won’t work kind of upset that I wasted 100 dollars on it just for it not to work
5,Fun entry level wheel for xbox forza 6. Easy setup. Hopefully lasts long
1,My son barely had this a day and the internal bungee snapped while playing his game. Sent it back for a refund.
4,Great product
1,I wish to return this item as well. It never worked. I needed to also return the foot pedal I bought and wait for the replacement of that so that I could see if that was at fault. It still does not work and I could tell when I received this replacement that it had already been used. Parts were already screwed on.
1,I had to return this item it did not work.  And when it was delivered it was delivered in the actual box and it was all beat up and was taped back together Very poorly.  Very disappointed. I did return the item without any problem. I ordered a brand new steering well instead of purchasing a used one.
1,The thing was missing a cord so I ordered a cord and it still didn’t work pedals were unresponsive
2,Worked well for the first month.  Now only  turns left and stays turning left even when not being touched.  Most likely an internal defect.  Will update review based on customer service experience w/ Thrustmaster.
3,Works well however the lack of force-feedback makes it hard to use at times. The pedals also come off of the floor quite often unless fastened down.
1,When we received the package it was not in a box.  The box was broken and damaged.  When we opened the  product it had clearly been used.  There was cat fur stuck to the bottom of the consul the steering wheel was dirty and it would not turn on.
5,Bought this for my son who plays with it all the time he is very happy with it .
5,So much fun on forza titles.
5,My kid loved it
5,Grandkids think it's great. they have trashed a lot of nice gaming cars and it still works.
5,Great product works as advertised great price and fast delivery.
5,I got this wheel two days ago and so far it has been amazing. It works perfectly. I would recommend buying one. I will update this review if my opinion changes.
5,For a beginner this wheel is amazing. Everything is good feels good shipped fast from a non amazon dealer for a non force feedback this is the best one u can buy!
3,I'm willing to give this a chance even though it is hard along with frustration to use versus a controller which is more fun to use.
5,Awesome it works exactly as it should my son has no issues.
5,This steering wheel is what it is supposed to be it works well and required very little setting up to work straight out of the box.  I am very happy with it.
1,Idk if this happened with you other people but my steering wheel wasn't turning in game I will not be getting another one of these again
5,Ok
5,This was exactly what my son wanted. It was brand new and arrived when it was supposed to.
2,The racing wheel was great but the peddles there was somthing wrong with the gas peddle it kept on like you had the gas on all the time I think a spring broke it work for about two hours then it started acting up.
5,My son uses  it regularly better for driving games than controller.
5,BEST gaming investment I ever made for such a specific use. If you can't get enough of racing on xbox one then this is a must have!
1,Works OK when it works. It broke right after warranty expired. The wheel sends right turn signal constantly to the Xbox which made the car uncontrollable. Thrustmaster didn't want to fix it because the warranty expired. I had to throw it away and bought a Logitech.
1,Everything else worked the peddles the buttons but the wheel wouldn’t move the car
1,This is HORRIBLE! It's defective but we cannot return it. We finally got to trying it a couple of month's after we bought it and it didn't work. We took it to the local Microsoft store and they confirmed that it's defective. It won't power on or accept any power source. I want my money back but this company won't give it to me. Horrible customer service and product!!!!
1,Only worked for an hour then steering was totally unusable. had to steer all the way to the left to go straight. For something like this to only work properly for an hour is terrible. Just out of nowhere the steering wheel was crooked on screen and no way to recalibrate.. terrible! very frustrated and disappointed! definitely going to return this!
1,Ever from the start we expereienced a small amount of un-wanted jerk movements from the wheel that didn't not correspond to the actual wheel movement. As time progressed this became ever more sensitive rendering the wheel use-less as play is impossible. You just get thrown off the road without having any control - no fun at all. My son is back with the standard XBOX remote.
1,My son loved this for the first 2 weeks. Then it stopped working. Pretty disappointed with it.
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift.  Imagine the disappointment after one day of use when the wheel alignment fails.  You have to hold the wheel 90 degrees of center to go straight.  Returned it and got the replacement a month later.  The second one didn't even last a day.  It arrived with the same flaw.
1,this product doesn't work it lets you know it hooked up but you can't use the controls to drive.  We've disconnected it and reconnected it numerous times.  Just got the game released for it can't use it for need for speed heat!
1,I was lead to believe this wheel was tested.  The wheel would not the cars on the screen.  While looking for a solution I found out this a common problem with this item.  After much consideration I decided to go with the HORI RWO.
3,Its ok but it has issues with the pedals some times they work and some times they don't. Can be a bit frustrating.
1,Wasnt brand new had tones of scratches on itI didnt but used I bought a brand new one for 100 not good just say
1,Horrible it does not work and when driving you. Can't feel the road and there's no force feedback
5,I loved how this wheel was cheap and still gave you a great experience playing games like fora 5. It's a way better deal than buying an 399 Dollar wheel.
5,i liked how it steered
1,After about 2 months. It just stopped workingDo not try drifting on games before it stopped for no reason
1,Delayed reaction on our Xbox One XWill be returning this unless someone can tell me how to fix it.Already tried to reducing the sensitivity but doesn't help. My boy is back to using the controller.Reset the xbox several times.Using the Forza Horizon 4 demo to test it.
5,Great controller!! Works well.
1,I bought a new one and it came used and it came with the wrong cables!!!
5,Nice quality works well. Good deal for the price no force feedback but it's not big deal.
3,I purchased this for my son.  My husband hand to adjust the steering because it was very hard to drive.
1,Product missing breakaway cord. Cord was only around $7.00 to purchase. Son was unable to use wheel for 2 days while waiting on breakaway cord to arrive. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT. Cord should’ve either been included or advertised that it was needed separately.
5,A Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loved it!
5,Excellent as expected
1,I bought it for my kid for Christmas and it doesn't work… We tried to install it and the software doesn't permit the installation. My husband started to read other reviews about this product and found out we were not alone. Too bad because not only is this an expensive product but because I live out of the US is pretty hard to return it. Sad kid on Christmas but even more frustrated parents..
5,My son really likes it.
1,Liked nothing past how nice it looked on your website and in the box. This was a Christmas gift to my grandson and he's informed me that it never worked.An inoperable item hasn't earned any stars but I can't get off of this page without tapping on at least one star.
5,Tyson says its great for his xbox and xbox 1 driving games. The peddles work and feel like actual car peddles and the gear shift is authentic.
1,This product was good while it lasted.  It was a Christmas gift for my son who is now very disappointed because it stopped working after 6 months.  We had a fixed set-up with the wheel stand so it wasn’t dropped or moved around in ways that would cause damage.
2,steering didn't work.  Pedals and buttons fine but hey it's a STEERING wheel.  Would have been one star but company gave a quick refund and paid for return shipping.
5,Always worked great.  My son has been using almost daily for will over a year.
1,The instructions were followed to a T and the item didn’t work. Customer service is nonexistent.
5,Cheaper than the store and my son enjoyed this gift!
5,Kids love it. Daddy loves it too. Very responsive and fun to use.
5,Much improved gaming experience
2,It's okay for beginners but you should really save your money and get a better one like the Logitech g920
2,This wheel does not work with any games we have bought.
1,Worked ok for about two weeks and then stopped responding to some turns and turned on it's own.  All plastic- cheaply made.  F1 '17 is much better with a wheel- I'm going to throw this one away and buy the Logitech G920.  Spend the money and get something that will last.
1,This is a horrible product. The gas pedal broke and my son only had it for a month! It was just past the he return date and now we are stuck with a non-working product. I will never order this again!
2,Did not consistently and reliably pair with the Xbox; had to repeatedly restart both systems.  Eventually returned to seller.  Seller did provide prompt refund
5,we bought a 400 wheel that broke then paid around 100 for this one. its exactly the same! cery happy
5,My son loves this!
5,Buen estado y funciona muy bien.
3,I thought It would work on the pc
5,Fun. Very Responsive. Makes the game a lot more fun.
5,Son loves it!  Hours of fun!  No need to spend the big time bucks.  Sturdy construction.
1,Something was clearly faulty with the connection cables. After about 20 days the only button that would function was the power button; even that would only turn my Xbox on not off again.
1,Ordered this for my Grandson who did not get it until end of January -- and Wheel did not work -- and could not get replaced or money back.  Over all Rating -- ):
5,My grandson absolutely loves this !!!
2,Its a decent wheel but there is a huge amount of play and I'm worried it will snap off while playing dirt rally.
1,I used it normally and it’s broken???? How????
1,It does not connennet to the games or the xbo1 my friends bought one and they return there also
5,It's the best steering wheel I've had
1,Junk. 2nd one that glitched on us. Not recommended. I now have a $150 pedal stand for this steering wheel for sale for $50 because I am not going to mess with it any more.
5,Son likes it
1,Arrived on time however the buttons never worked on my Xbox one. I even tried connecting it to another Xbox one and had the same problem. I've heard great things about this wheel but for me it never worked out of the box. Amazon has refunded me. I don't think what happened in my particular case is common but still frustrating nonetheless... Hope it works for somebody else!
1,At first this steering wheel seems awesome. Well constructed and good feel. However doesn’t respond well to driving- may have a glitch. Used with forza- and I was hoping to have a real driving feel- unfortunately this is a waste of money- hoping amazon will honor a return
2,The steering wheel is not bad but after only a few hours of my son using it the rubber grip has started to pull loose. Nothing like having to fix a brand new toy.
1,i just got this wheel today i plugged it in and it bricked my xbox do not buy this wheel
2,Good when it worked right. Kids only used a couple times then it started malfunctioning. Cars on video games go opposite way steering wheel is turning.
5,Great product. Happy with purchase. Item was as described.
1,Was hoping for a decent cost effective first gaming steering wheel.....BUT it pulls at least 1/4 turn to the left out of the box. Really makes it difficult to use. Pretty disappointed.
5,This thing is sweet. Cannot imagine anything being markedly better even above this price point.
5,bought for gamer son.  he is enjoying it.
1,bought one and had to return it in the first three months because it didn’t work. also wouldn’t allow a re-calibration even though it states you can. now a few months into the new one the same thing has happened. not a great investment.
5,Excellent Seller and excellent piece of advise everyone by this seller and give it the full five stars of a well worth it
1,It worked fine at first and was great BUT. About a week later the gas pedal only barely worked now the gas pedal doesn't work at all. I was hoping to exchange it because maybe this one was just defective but it was an Easter gift an we had it too long to return :(
1,Product worked initially but quickly quit taking steering wheel inputs and now doesn’t have throttle control either.  Didn’t realize it at the time of purchase only has a 30 day warranty.  I would not purchase again and recommend finding another product with a longer and reasonable warranty period.
3,Let me open up by saying this wheel was bought at a thrift shop but I felt like I needed to give my opinion regardless.This wheel isn't too bad as a wheel. It's got a good range of motion and the buttons are plentiful. The wheel itself has a "bungee" action that allows it to return to center quickly and I like the rubbery grips. The pedestal the pedals are on feel a little light for the amount of force and quickly moving between gas and brake you'd need to do but otherwise it's decent. There's no force feedback if that's something you're looking for but this is touted as an entry level wheel anyway.What doesn't make a lick of sense however is how this wheel ONLY really works on an Xbox One. I have never heard of this especially in the post-Xinput here and now. I do have an Xbox One X so I'm not unable to use this but a controller that is an Xbox One controller but NOT compatible with PC? Unheard of. The Xbox Guide button doesn't even work in Windows 11. I tried using this on Forza Horizon 5 an Xbox Play Anywhere/UWP game and that should work right. While it did pick up the wheel the calibration was all wrong and the buttons felt spotty in terms of mappings. It never truly saw it as a controller. I guess I can mess around with it on my Xbox One X but in all I don't really see why it was designed like this. Maybe that's why whoever owned this before me decided to get rid of it...
2,I wish it was wireless.  Very hard to control your car on Forza 5.  Seems like a delayed response.  Bulky and takes up too much space.  Wish the wireless u-shaped wheel from 360 was used on the xbox 1.
1,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  After not even a month the wheel stopped turning.  This seems to be a recurring theme with this wheel.  Since I bought it in November per Amazon it's too late to send it back.  Very disappointing.
5,Good product
1,Product was defective out of the box. The wheel powered up and connected to the Xbox but the a button would not work. Thrust master tech support was useless. They took 8 days to respond only to tell me to connect to a different USB port and to make sure the controls were up to date.
5,Hours of fun and one happy lil boy Christmas Day! Thanks for the great price and super fast shipping
1,Junk  broke in less than two months.  Amazon won't refund/ return over 30 days.  My advice  buy one with a legit warranty.
5,Driving games
1,Bought this for my Son. Worked for approx 5 hours then quit steering properly.  Reset reinstalled ... all of it to no avail. I'll be returning it promptly. After this happen my son checked some Forza forums and many other gamers complained of the exact same problem.
1,It don’t work only 2 months old
5,Awesome! Feels natural and the details are spot on.
5,Easy to set up fun to use
3,I wish it was compatible with all of my car racing games.
5,Hgfv
3,Great manufacting but the gameplay doesnt feel fine with Forza Motorstorm for xbox one
1,Purchased a Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Racing Wheel for Xbox One but received a 456 Spider Racing Wheel that ONLY WORKS FOR A PLAYSTATION 4.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT PRODUCT PLEASE TAKE YOUR AD DOWN.
1,Product doesn’t work. Spent a lot of money and a lot of time on a product doesn’t work. Now will have to spend more time and money to shop it back.
5,Awesome steering wheel exactly what I was looking for & excellent delivery service from Amazon will buy from Amazon again without doubt
1,We are very disappointed with this wheel.  My son only used it a few times before it stopped working properly.  It veers off to the side and drives him off the road.  We are in the process of trying to get a refund.
1,It was horrible! I recommend to not buy this item.
1,Only lasted a week and then snapped
5,Works perfectly used non stop since I bought it. Great product arrived in great time. No complaints and no regrets. Race on!
5,Great
5,It was a gift for my fiancé and he absolutely loves it!
5,Always the best price
5,Quick delivery and happy with product.
5,Handled very well during racing game.
1,I can't tell you how confused I am. I got it for my stepson and for the Christmas and it broke down 2 months later. He liked it to the point that I bought it again for him and hopefully this time it last longer!!!
5,Great feel
5,It's for a Xmas present.  I'm sure my Grandson will love it.
1,The A button was the only function that worked.  To access menu items another controller was needed making it really inconvenient.  Drivability was adequate for a non force feedback system.  Even an entry level wheel should function fully and this one does not.
1,0 stars for this peice of crap worked twice and now all it does is turns the wheel to the left.  Have tried several trouble deals and still does not work.  Wish I would of read reviews on other web sites before purchasing
1,This thing is a piece of $#! % and don't believe the description I bought this for my PC but just does not function for anything other than Xbox 1 go buy PS 3/4 it works with pc
1,Would not work properly.  Immediate return.
1,I have had two of these steering wheel they have both broken on me. They have both not lasted  me one year. It is really crappy  engineering unless you want to keep on buying them over and over again.
1,8 months old and the foot pedals broke.Edit:got replacement parts for the pedals then the wheel itself broke. Would not buy this again!
2,Got it all set up and was instanly unhappy with it. I sure learned the hard way not to go cheap. It's either buy a expensive stand or rig something to keep the pedals stationary.
5,I am very happy with this wheel and would recommend it to anyone!
3,The click sound of up/down button is too loud.
5,Makes racing games more fun and interactive for our 5 yr. Old.
5,My grandson is LOVING his racing wheel birthday gift!
3,Hard to brace on a table as instructed.
2,device constantly loses connect with xbox
5,Great. My kid is enjoying it!
1,i bought a wheel for my son becasue he wanted one... 3 days later it comes in the mail and the wire that cwas connected to the pedals is cute into 3 pieces has this ever happened to someone?
1,This version of wheel is not compatible with "Need for Speed Rivals"  the Microsoft rep that I spoke with told me that this wheel is only compatible with ONE game and I do not remember what the name of the game because I do not plan on buying another race car game.
5,Honestly it’s perfect
5,Great Deal Really Good Ish
1,At first this worked well and my son loved it. On February 2 (the return deadline was 1/31/18) it glitches and stopped working. So disappointed it was a Christmas gift so he played with it for just over a month.
1,very dissappointed child chrustmas present did  not work came late and defected
5,My son loves it!
5,It is a amazing faboulus most best racing wheel
5,Super sturdy and well made!
5,I wish the wheel would make a full rotation but overall I am completley satisfied.
5,My son loves it
2,We sent this back kept wanting to turn to the right
1,Worked for 2 weeks then is hit or miss if responsive.  When responsive it won't calibrate to turn smoothly.  Turn right and it turns left then jerks right to track your movement.  Manufacturer's support still not comment.
5,my fiances son said it exactly what he ordered!!!
2,It came one part missing disappointing
5,I've played with wheels controllers since they came out and this is by far the most bang for your buck
1,Never worked and broke multiple times
1,Does not work right
1,This wheel is not worth the $100 it costs.  The controls are awful - its every bit as bad as using a controller.  Save up and get the better Thrustmaster wheel (the 458 Italia Edition).  Its a lot more money but its worth every penny.
1,Would not turn left after about an hour of play. Tried restarting game xbox and unplugging controller. When it did work it was very difficult to control a car in Forza 7 worked well with Forza Horizon 3.
1,It’s not working for need for speed ..so what games does it work for? Reached out to the company still didn’t hear anything back on
5,Works good
2,Broke...returned and replaced broke again... disappointing!
1,This product did not work. It was a real bummer on Christmas morning when my son set it up. The return went smoothly. I did notice quite a few reviews by others saying they had the same problem.
5,It has been great my kids haven't stopped using it and it works just like they imagined it!
5,Exactly as described.  Great product recommend to anyone.
5,Awesome wheel! It is a whole new level of experience when you use the wheel on racing games.
1,Do not buy this! Purchased one for my son for Christmas and it broke the first day. The replacement took weeks to arrive and broke just a few days after the return window closed. Huge disappointment.
1,Received on April 25 2016.  Worked fine first 3 weeks then would automatically scroll down to bottom of screen when trying to start up...REALLY AMAZON - 30 day warranty on NEW $100 item...??  Amazon will not be the first place I look for items anymore
2,It only lasted about a week after Christmas.
5,Great racing wheel!  Delivered as expected!
1,wheel broke just fter the time frame for the warranty. cheaply made !!! now we're stuck with it and cant even use it !!!
1,I ordered this and the first one was out of alignment so did an exchange. The second one worked for about a day and then would not connect to the Xbox. Totally disappointed in the quality.
1,Only compatible with certain games. Purchased for my son for Christmas and it quit working after 4 months of very little use bc the games my son has the steering wheel won't recognize. Very disappointed.
1,The tab at the bottom is very thin plastic and is not of high quality. Broke off in 7 months. Extremely dissatisfied.Before that this wheel was great. Everything else feels of high quality. That all important tab should've been made with something more durable.
5,for the price you cant buy a beter wheel
1,The first day it worked but after that it is stuck on a hard right turn. 4 different people tried to recalibrate it and did research on Google and YouTube with no luck on it working.
2,There seems to be a lag that I can't get rid of. I'm so bummed that I wasted money on this.
1,this only worked for a few days and the wheel doesn't turn. such a disappointment.i bought this for my son for Christmas and can't even send back because he threw away the box. it's unfortunate.
5,Great item!
5,thank you sooooo much
1,All the buttons worked fine the pedals too but steering didn't work at all which made the wheel useless
1,Brake pedal broke now it cannot be used at all only had it for one month
5,Haven't stopped using it since I got it.
4,This is a good wheel if you are a beginner and just starting out.  It lacks Force Feedback so there will be no rumbling or vibrations from the race car you are driving.  Spend the extra money and buy a Thrustmaster G920.
2,can not  be  used wireless.  very  disappointed!
5,I received it in good conditionbut I wish that it was covered very wellThanks
5,Grandson loves it.
1,This wheel is barely better than the basic controller in my opinion. Too much slop in the wheel. I find myself zig zagging left and right. I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
1,Got this as a present for my son for xmas. The adapter for the pedals is wrong! It won't hook into a Xbox one! Waste of money and been waiting to hear from the company for a return label with no response!
5,Awesome
5,Very good
1,Don't buy what a waste got it with the forza edition console and it work for about four days then it will not turn contact Amazon they send me a replacement one and the same thing I am so disappointed unreal
5,Great item love it. Perfect for my game.
5,very happy
5,My son loves it! Exactly like he wanted.
1,We gave this to my son for Christmas and it stopped working less than one week after he got it.  It was always a bit glitchy but eventually it stopped all together.
5,Works perfectly with the Forza Horizon 3 game
5,It is working fine and grandson loves it!
5,My son LOVES this perfect gift.
5,My son loves it
1,This item was played with less then 8 times and stopped working. Does not work well and only works with very few games. Spend the extra money on a better wheel.
5,Great wheel for the price. Just doesn't have force feedback
5,For the price this is a very good deal works well with all racing games I have.
5,My sone loves this new game controller
1,Christmas gift for my grandson. Worked great Christmas Day at my house but started acting weird with minimal steering impact the day after when he took it home. Waste of $$
2,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT ON PC! IT DOES NOT WORK FOR PC!
5,Gift for my son and he loves
5,This thing is the best entry level wheel.
1,Piece of junk. Stay away. Buyer beware
2,Bought it people say it works for pic that's a lie it dosent sadly
5,Son loves it
2,Does not work on a PC although the description says it does.
5,LOVE IT
2,Doesn't work as good as I had hoped. I'm not sure I plan on keeping it
1,Worthless piece of crap!!! Have been through 3 units and none of them work. Total garbage. Do not recommend this product at all.
5,It met all of my expectations!
1,This was a Christmas gift that worked for about 1 hour. Then shifters started to malfunction. Then pedals didn’t work. Trying a replacement but my son is very disappointed.
5,That's ultimately the big question... Will your lap improve? Yes with practice.I recommend this for entry level semi-serious adult players. Kids and people that are just going to stomp the pedals (as opposed to driving smoothly) will just break it prematurely.Update: wheel is working as it did day 1 use it about an hour every night. Nothing broken or even appearing worn. Consistent midfield performance on experienced driver lobby. Can't recommend enough.
1,I bought 2 and they both malfunctioned after 2 hours the car in the game turning without me turning the wheel and not turning properly as it should
1,Recently ordered a wheel worked for a few days now all it does is pull to the right I payed 100 dollars for this and it barely works now
2,The whille works but the Padels doesn't work so I sent it back
5,Works great and meets our expectations.
5,Present worked out great...
1,received damaged does not turn to the left !! I want to return it for a full refund back onto my card
5,Great product arrived quickly
1,I don't know why it won't work I bought it for my son and the pedals work but the wheel doesn't work and i don't know how to get it to work.
1,I HATE IT WITH FORZA 6. NEEDS MORE ADJUSTABILITY FOR RATIO. BARELY TURN THE WHEEL AND THE CAR IS OFF THE ROAD. TRIED TO TUNE IT....DIDN'T GET THERE
1,Does not work on PC just on XBOX ONE. I bought one when I was in USA and I discovered this news when back in Brazil. Thanks a lot amazon!!!http://www.thrustmaster.com/pt_BR/products/ferrari-458-spider-racing-wheel
1,Defective out of the box the only button that worked was the Xbox guide bottom. Didn't work on Xbox one. Generally disappointed.
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR GRANDSONS

5,Very happy with it. Quality construction.
1,Stopped working just after the warranty expired.  Very disappointed as this was an expensive item.
1,Will not work with Xbox One Forza 6. I just need to find a way to send ot back.
1,You cannot use shifter really thrustmaster why make a product that can't use accessories that YOUR COMPANY MADE
1,Only received the petals no steering wheel in the box.
1,Doesn’t work
1,Not for xbox one
1,Complete crap this wheel is fake nothing changes on it the force feedback doesn't change don't buy

1,paid full price when revived the  paddle shifter were broken and the
1,I bought this and it didnt even work Sent it back immediately
5,Favorite gift for Christmas. Perfect & he loves it
1,Doesn't work as stated after repeated attempts to recalibrate.
1,Worked once and then never worked again 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Broke upon the second month of owning.
2,Works fine for awhile but it's not going to last long. It's not solid enough for modern racing games. If you're going to be heavy on the wheel or race technical circuits like Barcelona on F1 eventually you'll put too much pressure on the wheel and the re-centering mechanism will snap causing the wheel to be offline. Then you'll be looking for a new wheel like I am tonight. Spend a few extra bucks on a wheel that's not all molded plastic.
1,Pedals non responsive at times. Did not meet my expectations.
5,Fun and easy to use.
1,Fast shipping but was defective
1,Can’t log in!

5,Game changer
5,It very nice
5,good!
5,thanks
3,Great gift for a kid not an adult. Got the item in and the packaging was great. Install was simple and instructions were clear. The wheel is an OK starter wheel (doesnt have full turning range like a normal wheel) but the pedals fall very short. Second time i pressed the brake the pedal stopped working. I opened up the assembly to see what happened internally and the build quality was shockingly poor. The plastics inside that made up the pedal has snapped causing the sensor inside to not be able to tell when the pedal was down. Overall for this price the setup is understandable and a true bang for your buck but if youre looking to have a solid starter experience in sim racing youre gonna wanna dig a little deeper in ya pockets. Trust me its worth it.
4,I bought this at a local Gamestop but my review will be more useful here.  I came to this wheel from a Mad Catz 2 wheel on Xbox 360 after acquiring an Xbox One for free as a gift.  I didn't want to spend a ton of money as a) I only play Xbox a couple of hours a week and b) my wife would complain :)Unfortunately this wheel is a step down from the 360 wheel I had.  First off there's no force feedback.  That's not a huge issue but the feature ought not be so expensive.  If the wheel were priced between $150-200 with force feedback I might have bought it but I'm not spending $300 or more on that unless some big money falls in my lap.Second both the wheel and the pedals require significant force to operate - not enough that I can't apply it but more than enough to push the things around.  You *really* need to attach this wheel to something... it is *not* made to go in your lap while you're on the couch as the angle of the steering wheel is too low and (more importantly) there's nothing to hold it in place unless you try to wedge it between your knees.  That doesn't work (I tried) so I cut a board to length applied some wood shims to it to raise the angle up attached the wheel to it with the included (and very sturdy) clamp and put it in my lap.  That was much better but then I clamped it to a TV table instead and put some carpet spikes under the foot pedal assembly.  The result was MUCH improved and very usable though I will likely attach the foot pedals to a bigger piece of wood (with carpet spikes) so they don't move or tip.  As a comparison in Forza 5 in an R8 in Prague I was getting last place with the first two methods and when I switched to the TV table I shot up to 1st place.Third it took me a while to figure out that the button in the lower left of the wheel is a D-pad...until then I couldn't navigate the menus in Forza because turning the wheel only moves you left and right.  I didn't notice the little arrows around the button and it wasn't until I went back and re-read the instructions for the third time that I noticed it on the diagram.The last issue is the sensitivity.  The wheel doesn't turn especially far (around 210 degrees stop-to-stop) presumably because of its bungee mechanism and the wheel is very sensitive out of the box.  With Forza 5 I find you really need to follow the directions and reduce the control sensitivity to 3 or 4.  Actually on setting 4 I'm still crashing into things left and right but that's probably just because I'm relatively unfamiliar with the wheel the car and the track... or I'm just a poor driver.  I wish the wheel would remember its sensitivity setting so I wouldn't have to set it every time I power up.Despite all that the wheel and pedals are well constructed there's no play anywhere and the movement is very smooth and translates into precise movement in the game.  And the price is decent enough.  With the above accommodations this wheel is a huge step up from trying to drive with the stock Xbox controller and worth the $99 in my opinion.
1,So I bought this for my son for Christmas and when he started to use it it broke I sent it back and I never received a refund This company is the worst so not buy this product
1,Saying this wheel works on windows is extremely misleading. Apparently it works for a handful of games if you buy them on the Microsoft store and play them on the Xbox app on your pc. Seems like the only games that work on that store are the forza series. (I don’t know that it actually even works for those because I wasn’t willing to pay $60 to play one game with a $120 wheel). This is not a pc wheel. Thrustmaster says on their website it’s not supported for pc at all but they’re happy to mislead pc customers on Amazon I guess.
5,love the feed bak
2,My son is about 45 days in using this wheel since the Christmas holiday and the shifter paddles on the wheel have quit working. Unfortunately we're outside the return window of Amazon and finding any return information on this wheel from the seller is impossible. I would not recommend this wheel if you are considering racing wheels for your Xbox set up.  Not dependable.
5,I love the automatic re-centering it’s great for drifting a bit of a downside is that if you were planing to play on gta v you can’t gta does not count the steering wheel as a controller and I love how all the buttons on the controller are able to use in game play also before buying try to have something to stop the pedals from moving while using them I just have my other foot holding it down overall Design is amazing 💯
4,I bought this wheel because I didn't want to spend 300 dollars. After reading some reviews I was afraid it would be a waste of money. But i turned out to be perfect value for money for me. I think it doesn't get any better for a wheel in this price range without force feedback. the bungee cord system provides a great resistance when going through corners I can steer very accurate dispite the lack of feedback or rumble. You can't expect those things for this kind of money. The pedals are also very high quality with progressive resistance which is also something that you normally don't get in this price range. The resistance is so big that you will need a wheel stand or something like that otherwise the pedals will slide around like crazy. I read in other reviews that the wheel feels plastic like and toy like. This is really untrue. I also own a madcatz wireless racing wheel for xbox 360 and i was expecting this spider wheel to be lower quality but as it turns out the madcatz was more plastic and toylike by far it also had a spring system which made the wheel autocenter when releasing itbut it provided a lot less resistance when turning which made forza motorsport 4 really difficult to steer accuratly. I had a hard time being as quick as with my controller.With the trustmaster spider racing wheel you will easily beat your controller times once you get used to using the wheel.Don't believe the one star reviews those are written by people who expect the quality of a 300 dollar force feedback racing wheel for a 100 dollars that just won't happen for this money.I just want people to know this wheel is the right option if you don't have or want to spend too much money on a wheel.You WILL be just as competitive as people who have. This IS the best non force feedback wheel out there for a real cheap price
5,Fire
3,Bought from GameStop and was partially disappointed.First off when you take the wheel out of the box you will be surprised at how light it is. Very light. However it does feel sturdy.Steering is great but hard. If you've ever played/used bungee cords you know the more you pull them out the harder it is to keep pulling. That's how this wheel is. The more you turn one way the harder it gets so it's not really realistic to a vehicle.The pedals are also lightweight. Unless you're playing on carpet (doesn't always make a difference) or have a way to stick them to your floor they will move. The pedals also can not be adjusted and oddly so close together when real care pedals are not that close. Making it harder to get use to.With all that being said...I'll admit. I did NOT use this in a game at all. Don't get me wrong I own an Xbox but I bought this for my PC and it IS NOT PC compatible. Yes when you plug it into a PC it downloads a driver titled "Ferrari 458 Spider" but it does absolutely nothing. My games wouldn't even detect a controller plugged in.That's why I gave the 3 star rating. You would think a controller that's Xbox One compatible would also be PC compatible. All they'd need is a driver for it to work. But even Thrustmasters website says it's not PC compatible.My mistake for not actually looking at the box so I bought the Thrustmasters TMX from Amazon and waiting for delivery on that (at the time of this review).I'm sure this is a great entry level steering wheel for Xbox One only but I was very disappointed it wasn't PC compatible.
4,I got the racing wheel in good order. I can understand why some people are giving this one or two stars. I plugged it in and was set to play Formula 1 2015 when I realized the pedals didn't work nor the steering. So I thought " hey maybe I will try it on the forza games since that is what it was advertised for." Luckily I had forza 2 horizon so like that was the game which allowed me to connect to my xbox one. So then I went back to F1 and viola! everything is fine now. I also am glad I purchased a racing stand as this you cannot simply place on your lap and go. The steering is way too tight so you cannot turn without flipping the racing wheel over. All in all I am happy however but I can understand others.*****update***** after having this wheel for a couple of weeks I find that you have to start your xbox up with the wheel. That will program it. If you start your xbox one with the controller and then try using it it won't program. So that is probably most of the complaints right there. This wheel is awesome and once the wheel is programmed then you can go to say F1 and adjust the racing wheel settings. hope this helps! See you on the race track!
4,Very nice wheel for the money if you don't have to have a force feedback model. Set a best clean lap at the 'Ring with it on first lap out of the box playing Forza 6... it's very smooth and easy to use. Have enjoyed their earlier models and glad to have this one paired with our new Openwheeler racing seat. Recommend this one over lessor known brands. The smooth transition from left to right through the neutral center is much better than the cheaper spring designs. Purchased this one via membership warehouse as it was available for 10% less but very satisfied with it. Only thing that would like for this price point is little more robust bearings for the wheel as it has a little play radially but overall this is really good for kids and adults just playing Forza or other driving games for fun.
3,I bought this for Forza 7.  It was ok at first but we had a hard time keeping the car on the intended drive line especially at high speed.  Dead spot in the center and the bungee system seemed to pull it off line.  Lack of force feedback also compromised the experience.  Ended up returning it within the 2 week window.If you are going to spend this much try to save up for a force feedback wheel like the TMX for about $50 more (can find on sale for that price).  It is so much better and more immersive.We also have an old XBOX 360 an old force feedback wheel and Forza motorsport 3 - that setup is still awesome; and honestly much better than Forza 7 without force feedback.I recommend you save yourself the wasted effort and just get a force feedback wheel instead of this one.  You’ll just end up either trading up soon or not playing it.More Evidence?  These things are a dime a dozen on FB marketplace and Craigslist.

This IS the best non force feedback wheel out there for a real cheap price
4,I love the wheel for the price but I have an issue after only 3 days of using it.  The steering wheel is getting loose on side to side movements.  There is no free play up and down only side to side.  It is getting worse each day.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Is there suppose to be limited side to side movement?  Mine is now about .5 inch.
1,I bought this for my son for Christmas  it's all he was asking for. The Break pedal never worked.  Buttons on steering wheel and gas pedal worked fine  the break pedal never worked.  We calibrated the steering wheel  reset the xbox one plugged and unplugged it a million times. We watched countless YouTube videos looking for help  nothing worked. I returned it. Amazon made the return process extremely simple and free.
4,It is a fantastic wheel for 100 bucks.Pros:CheapLight weightNice rubbery hand gripMetal shifterNot need power plug just plug usb into xboxdifferent settings for wheel sensativityCons:Mostly plasticNo vibration because it uses a bungy cord system to simulate the turn on a real car. not that goodlack of grip on the paddlesYou can only play Forza Motorsport 5 with this wheel and not the NFS Rival
1,I Got this wheel and used it it for a bit it didn’t have 900 degree rotation and after a bit it started having a twich where the car would not go in a straight line or sometimes it would not even turn left which made my child unhappy and we did try to refund it and Amazon said since it had a issues they could not. We also tried customer support but they only helped us with leaving us in the automatic bio line. DO NOT GET THIS
4,I use this for nascar heat evolution.. works great.. no vibrations but you will get use to that.. for the nascar game fan.. this works great for trying the high line.. also great for the super speedways.. takes a bit to get use to the "engine start" button to adjust in pit stops... only reason I don't give it a five star is because of the no vibration. But it works awesome for nascar
3,GREAT WHEEL! However it has developed a twitch. As you are going down a straight and even hands off the steering wheel it will quickly jerk to the left at random times.(not the wheel itself but the car you are driving in the game). It will also do it if you make slight corrections as you are playing the game. don't know if it is because its been handled too roughly by young kids or its just in the electronics but the precise control is not there any longer. tried different sensitivity settings to no avail. Otherwise its been a great steering wheel for the money the last 10-11 months. Thinking strongly about buying another but would hate for the same thing to happen again. Its a little too pricey to have to replace repeatedly.
4,i got it for Christmas and it worked great until there was one problem... the pedals lacked weight and if you press the break wrong it will tip over... other than that its great!
4,Just for everyone having trouble with the pedals being to light andmoving around go to the hardware store and get one big peace of velcro stick it to the bottom of the petals right down the center and the other side to the ground. Solved all my problems
4,I love the wheel. I've been using it for about a year on forza 5 horizon 2 and forza 6. The only draw back I've found is I used the b button for the clutch. I think it was more use than the manufacturer intended because now the return spring on that button is completely worn out. If you buy the wheel don't use the b button for a clutch.
3,Repurposed old Lane recliner in basement and rigged the wheel and pedal assembly up to it.  rather than sitting upright at my desk.  Works a treat and feels like you would actually sit in a car
4,Pay a little more and get the Thrustmaster TMX. This wheel is not precise enough to race competitively.
3,I got this as a present and the pedals didn’t work
1,It has the wrong connection for our Xbox One
5,I love this wheel. If you don't want to spend 300 bucks or more for a wheel to enjoy driving in Forza it is a good buy. I have more fun than with the XboxOne wireless controller . I'm feeling like driving and I was able to beat my lap time record. I like the feeling and the accuracy at he center. The design is nice I really recommend it to get fun in Forza. Nice buy for 100 bucks.
3,It takes a little getting used to but the wheel and pedals work very well.I have used it with Forza Horizon 2.It works really well with a good car to drive - one that has good handling.The instructions I got in the box had little about using the wheel.Tips:Remember to Power on the Xbox One from the Console Button and not the controller button.The Left Red Engine Start Button (D-PAD) is the Joystick to move the cursor on screen.The Right Red Race Knob is turned to Select the Map/Menu.The Y Button Selects the desired Car View from the drivers seat.With these tips you can control Forza Horizon without the standard controller.If you know how to drive a car the wheel and pedals can only help your times on the road.I wish the pedals had included a third clutch pedal for shifting a manual transmission when I get better at the simulated driving.*********************  UPDATE  01/09/15  ***************************************WARNING: This VG Ferrari 458 wheel does not have a DIN Connector.IT WILL NOT CONNECT WITH THE TH8A DIN CONNECTOR THAT IS REQUIRED FOR XBOX ONE.I read the TH8A shifter manual today.FOR XBOX ONE ONLY it is required that the TH8A plug into a DIN connector on the silver/white TX Ferrari 458 racing wheel.For PC PS3PS4 the TH8A can plug into the USB ports.If you had plans to add the three pedals and the TH8A shifter to this wheel you can forget it for now.Unless Thrustmaster comes out with other software drivers so you can connect the TH8A directly to the USB ports on the XBOX one.I down graded my five star rating to only three because of how they crippled this wheel from the beginning.
5,Being new to steering wheels I have no others to compare this to. I can only offer my current opinion of the wheel...for better...or for worse.It easily attaches to table tops media centers with shelving about anything that will accommodate the adjustable clamp. Once locked down it stay's put unless your an overly excited driver etc. The foot pedal assembly easily plugs into the steering wheel (think phone chord connection type). The steering wheel is plug-n-play so I didn't have issues with it being recognized by the Xbox One.Using the wheel is taking me time to learn how to use it properly (for it's design). Having a bungee chord inside it for resistance and centering the wheel shows a nice amount of resistance and feel. I have found there to be a bit of a dead spot engineered into the wheel/bungee chord system. While playing Forza 6. I use some "Assists" to help make the wheel more responsive which is helping with game driving. Despite the dead spot issue...I gave 5 stars as I really enjoy the feel of the steering wheel and it's ability to use about any button/paddle combo that should work for you.I'd buy this wheel again not having tried other brands. I think it has it's place in the world of gaming/driving sports and does a decent job of it. Thanks Thrustmaster and Amazon for getting this into my gaming world.
3,This wheel is fine it does the job but nothing more. If you've ever played a good working arcade racing game you'll notice force feedback. The wheel pulls and gives some resistance to the player which makes it more realistic and fun in my opinion. I originally bought this wheel to avoid spending the three hundred dollar TX wheel. I didn't get it from Amazon instead the Microsoft Store (The wheel was in awful condition and missing the breakaway cable whats with that?). I was immediately disappointed its just a rubber band to hold the wheel in the center position. I knew that going in but it really felt like that when I got a hold of it. You may think: "Why is force feedback important?" If you're really into racing games you've got to feel the force feedback. Once you do you realize how much that output from the game to your hands lets you feel how your car is handling. My times increased significantly when I could feel when my car was losing traction going out of control and the satisfying feeling of correcting a skid.This wheel works but don't expect much other than a very basic experience. Save the money if possible for the TX Italia wheel. It's leaps ahead of this one.
3,Bought the product from GameStop. No mechanical errors. Only issue I had at first was the terrible sensitivity it comes in. I managed to fix and the racing experience was a bit better. The pedals on the other hand kept slipping on the floor which was the main reason why I decided to reclaim my $100 and returned it. Product definitely is not worth $100 maybe 50. Strongly recommend buying it at a store in case you decide to buy it regardless that way you can return it without a problem once you have decided the wheel is not with it.
1,You can’t use this with any game besides the forza series which is prided as being one of the best racing simulators in existence. The wheel and peddles do it no justice. The wheel barley turns and the pedals feel like stepping on frozen beef if they don’t slide away at the slightest pressure. Can barely use it with any games and the games you can use it with you need to spend hours mapping the inputs to buttons that are uncomfortable and unresponsive
3,I liked it for playing Forza Horizon 3 But it broke in less than 6 MONTHS.
3,It is not too bad for the price but I surely miss the force feedback that I love when playing Dirt Rally. I am used a laptop stand but waiting to try out on a good stand made for these steering wheel.BTW also missing the headphone jack that would be convenience unless I missed it hidden somewhere.
5,I initially thought not having force feedback would be a major drawback for this wheel. Boy was I wrong. The craftsmanship of this item is top notch & it allowed me to fully submerge myself into my racing titles. Great wheel. Great pedals. Happy customer.
4,I come from using fanatec wheels this wheel is nothing like them - but for 99 bucks - it does pretty well if you got a real study stand i get really fast with it on Forza - not bad but not great. Wish fanatec would get with microsoft and get a wheel out for the Xbox One.
4,You really get your money's worth with steering wheel.
2,It works.  I tried all sensitivity settings for hours and could not keep on the track in forza 5.  I broke out the trusty stock gamepad and had no trouble.  Could be I'm not great with wheels and it's not the device but I found the gamepad was more fun than the wheel so why pay for it.Well built connected right up.Bungie cord return has a "large" blank spot at the center causing a weird feeling of no resistance hitting a wall of full resistance quickly.  My peeve with controllers has been the difficulty of slightly moving a thumb stick which results in jumpy swaying back and forth of the car.  I expected to have much more control over slight motions with the wheel as I would in a car.  It just didn't seem to be so.Again I'm not claiming to be the worlds best gamer but I have played many racing games over the last 10+ years and this just didn't do it for me.
1,This product was terrible.Here are the facts:-the red Finnish on the wheel came off is two weeks of use.-There are massive dead-zones where there is no input (nothing happens) when you turn-the wheel does not fully rotate and feels cheap when turning and when fully rotated (about 40 degrees) if you let go of the wheel it violently wobbles and in forza especially it makes the car swivel-the pedals feel cheap and like they are going to break at any second and have a massive plastic creakOverall the wheel is terrible and should only be 30 dollar AT MOST don’t buy this
3,Buttons are a scattered mess D-pad is atrocious and if it only had force feedback....The MS Wheel for the 360 is MILES ahead of this thing and it's 7-8 years older.
5,Listen if you want a FUN steering wheel/pedals combo for a kid who loves racing games this is it. I've heard its not as realistic as some really expensive setups but I wouldn't know. The steering wheel has nice resistance (no vibration though but that's cool). It absolutely changes the game for Forza games though!
2,We have owned it for about 6 months now.Pros: It's a great steering wheel for kids. It's easy to use the lack of force feedback makes it easier for younger kids (8-10 year olds) as the wheel isn't too heavy to use. Works reasonably well.Cons: Needs carpet and a good way to firmly hold the pedals - otherwise it will keep slipping away from you. Wires are relatively short so needs USB extension cables for a typical living room setup where you might be 8-10 feet away from TV.It has had light use in the last 6 months. Mechanically it's fine but electronically it's already starting to degrade. The steering wheel in the game (not physical one) is starting to jitter and I'm told it's losing it's precision while driving.Customer service is hard to get to. It has a 1 year warranty but to claim warranty they expect you to have a windows machine record and upload videos and original receipt (many companies are fine with just serial numbers not this one).
3,First one I got worked well for a while until I shocked the right paddle with one of my fingers while. After that it's as if I was always press the right paddle (which is RB) so I had to return it. Second one I got wasn't able to connect to my Xbox One so I have to return that one as well obviously. When it works it's a decent wheel for the money. If you end up buying it hope for one that works out of the box and make sure you always touch the rubber grips first as to not shock the paddles like I did...Really unfortunate it was fun to use. I don't think I will be picking one up again though as it has just been frustrating me too much and I don't want to waste money on it if me or one of my friends accidentally shocks it after the time frame in which you can return it ends.
1,BUYER BEWARE. Not AT ALL what I expected. If you thought you are gonna get a firm well made piece of gaming equipment that accurate represents a Ferrari’s steering wheel I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Cheap plastic unrealistic pain to set up. HAS TO BE ATTACHED TO A TABLE OF THE PERFECT HEIGHT. Gas and brake set up loosely moves around. And it feels like if either parts were dropped from 2 feet they’d break in half. You’re better off acting like Patrick and Spongebob in a cardboard box and using your imagination than wasting your time on this hunk of garbage. But hey if you just found a 100 dollar bill on the ground and think “hey I’d like to light this on fire and then eat the ashes” well instead you should buy this controller. It’s pretty much the equivalent.
1,I bought this for my grandson’s birthday. He asked for it specifically but he is very dissatisfied with it’s performance.  I have been on vacation since he got it.  Why does it only have a 30 day return window???
5,I love this product. I've had it almost a week. I have no issues so far except mounting. The wheel mounts no problem but the pedals are the tricky part. I made a mount for the pedals. Look at images. Btw works with all Xbox one racing games. It's just not as accurate on some games.
2,I bought one two years ago for Forza. It works well. But it is difficult to fix it on the table so is the pedal. They keep moving around. I manage to tie it to a table and a chair. It looks ugly but it works. The size is not very big. It fits kids better than the adults.We did not use it often but it broke after one year. Some of the buttons do not work anymore. I open the wheel to see if I can fix it. There is some cheap sponge around the buttons that have changed the shape after pressing many times. There is no easy way to replace it. And then I found I cannot assemble the wheel back.
2,Pretty nice overall especially for the price.  Couldn't believe that there's no way to get it working on a PC though.  How lazy does a manufacturer have to be to make an Xbox peripheral completely unrecognized on Windows 10?  Never buying TM again :( which is a shame because again it's a really nice wheel.  Also the "maniteto" or whatever it's called is not a dial as one would expect.  it's a two-way momentary rocker (like a single axis d-pad but z-axis).  In fairness it's advertised accurately just looks misleading in the photos.
2,Overall it’s a decent wheel for the price that said it will sometimes have a wrath jerk to the side. The anamation in Forza makes it looks like the driver is experiencing muscle spasms. This has caused me many a wrecks. I guess if your not trying to set lap times and you just want to race maybe no big deal. This is apparently a known issue as there is plenty of folks complaining in help forums about it. The going suggestion is to turn down the sensitivity.......didn’t solve the problem. Knowing what I know now I certainly would have chosen a different wheel.
2,Very fast shipping BUT the box arrives mangled.  The outside box is ok  but the inside box which is actually the manufacturer's packaging is torn dented & damaged.  It's obviously been opened and returned.  This was intended to be a Christmas gift for my son. This is packaging is unacceptable.
5,I purchased this along with the Wheel Stand Pro F458 Steering Wheelstand for my son's 12th birthday and he loves it! He's been using it now for two days so so far so good. I am really enjoying seeing him driving and wheeling all over the Forza 7 roads. He thought he was a pro with just the remote controller but now he has something to actually challenge him. We love it!
2,Never worked correctly out of the box new. It would glitch in Forza. Unit just broke after 2 years. It was only used a couple times because of the glitching that could cause game loss. Junk for the price. Just throw you money right in the garbage.
5,Forza 5 is the most impressive game I have seen on XBox One and I was looking for gears to make the experience more realistic. Getting behind the wheel of the Ferrari 458 is pretty rewarding: as I didn't not want to invest $300 in the TX 458 replica I have chosen this gear and I am very happy with this gear.It is easy to install thanks to its clamping process it is immediately detected in the game and it provides instant fun.Perfect!
1,This was a huge disappointment doesn't feel like a real steering wheel let alone a Ferrari spider wheel. The paddle shifters have an awkward feel and click. Trying to navigate through menus is impossible so make sure you have your controller nearby. The clamp mounting system for the wheel is awful and you have to use it there's no other way to anchor the steering column portion down. No vibration at all and the bungie suspension system in the wheel is very cheap. Also the pedal platform pretty much has to be bolted down or it will slide all over the floor when you switch between accelertator/brake. I boxed this junk back up an hour after getting it set up if I could give it 0/5 stars I would.
1,Very disappointed with wheel. I didn't care about the feedback and other features that the other mire expensive wheels had. What made me diacars this wheel is that it would lose location and crash the car.  Almost like someone jerked the wheel to the left or right while racing.Didn't need that kind of challenge
1,I bought this for my son for his birthday March 3 and it broke .it was picked up March 4 still don't have a new one or my money back and it is March 19 .my son is so disappointed
5,I bought this for my son and initially we had problems with the steering wheel suddenly turning left or right.  I initially had the unit hooked up using a USB Extension chord that turned out to be the problem.  The original USB Extension chord was very thin and flimsy.I purchased a thicker USB extension chord and the wheel now works perfectly.  Just thought others might have had the same issue.These are the specs of the USB extension chord that I used and that now my son LOVES this steering wheel.10ft USB 2.0 A Male to A Female Extension 28/24AWG Cable
1,It broke after 1 mouth after Christmas and it doesn’t work to this day I would never purchase this again you should buy and different one
2,No force feedback or rumble which are both important to feel what the car is doing in racing games.  Cheap plastic pedals.  The pedal base is not heavy at all so it slides or lifts when pushing the gas or brake.
1,When I got this wheel it worked for about a hour then it started to have problems. First it would only turn right and glitch when trying to turn left and when you would push down on the gas it would go but turn right also. So I got another one thinking the other one just had a problem and the new one did the exact same thing too.
5,I purchased this wheel through my local GameStop however I'm enjoying the wheel so much that I want other people to know this is a quality product.  This is my first racing wheel.  The wheel is very easy to setup attaching securely to my table without any trouble.  I have only used it with Forza 6 and immediately I noticed an improvement in my driving.  I am using a recommended configuration which I found on Youtube which works great.  This does not have force feedback (and I've never used force feedback) but I do enjoy the bungee system.  You definitely notice tension in the wheel the further you turn it.  I would recommend this wheel for anyone that wants a superior racing experience but isn't ready to drop $400-$500 bucks on a better wheel.
2,bought this at gamestop a year ago haven't really used it that much because you cant use it on pc which by far the most stupidest thing ive ever seen. who ever decided for it be only recognized and used on Xbox one needs to be fired it should work on PC and Xbox one. but nope they make you spend another $100 or more for one that does and what does another $100 or more get you a steering wheel that works on pc and xbox one and has force feedback so worth another $100 or more just for that
5,I just got this x my son x mas and he loves it with his new game excited about  this amazing product.
1,This is my third time getting this one and the peddles will just stop working. You will be in the middle of a race and then you will just stop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THIS.
1,I purchased one of these at GameStop it worked fine for about one week then it started randomly steering full lock to the left without any input. I contacted Thrustmaster about the warranty claims but received no help. I then got GameStop to replace the wheel but the replacement began doing the same thing shortly after. Don’t waste your $. I understand this is an entry level wheel but it’s not too much to expect it to work properly.
5,Next level of playing Racing Games. Works great with Forza game.
1,This item was trash massive input lag and very unusable would not recommend to anyone just spend the extra $100 to get a real wheel
5,s rouibor3ot4tbr4ominr4poinu
2,My son saved for months and the Rubber wheel grips ripped and plastic wheel started cracking after 3 months use. Tried to replace but customer service rep asked for pictures original receipt among other unreasonable demands. Overall product is cheap. Surprised Ferrari would allow its name to be used.
5,My son lived it played all day
3,For $100 dollars it works fine only a couple of gripes the major one is that the pedal stand has NO weight in it at all so the thing slides all over the place if you have it on a carpet literally making it useless. Second complaint is the pull on the wheel itself you go to turn it and it feels like you are driving a car with no power steering a bit annoying but you get used to it.Make sure you buy a stand with this thing if you buy it.
1,Complete peace of junk. Three of my friends including me have bought this wheel for our Xbox ones and it’s just horrible. Please don’t waste your money.
1,If you want a wheel set upDO NOT BUY THIS. wait and save up far a better set. I had bought one and it literally stopped working less than a week after i bought it. It is a very poor quality piece of garbage and i honestly wish i hadnt spent my money on it.
1,I will never ever buy anything from this company again waste of my time and money It wouldn’t work the 2nd time playin with it then when i tryed to dissassemble it to see whats wrong 2 plastic garbage filled bolts kept spinning and spinning and spinning so I did whats best for this wheel and company I ripped it to pieces
5,Very good
1,the UK gets two years USA gets one Plus one year means one year. My wife ordered it on 12/11 and I contacted Thrustmaster 12/21 following year because it would not steer allows turning left or right. I received the Thrustmaster for Christmas and explained it to the people at Thrustmaster it did NOT matter the warranty starts the day you ordered it. NO flexibility in the warranty. I will never buy thrustmaster again
1,The wheel is junk.  I used it maybe 10 times before it started pulling left on its own.  Even on the calibration screen without touching the wheel it jerks to the left randomly over and over.When playing a game it is as if someone is turning your wheel as far left as possible over and over.After checking online forums it seems to be a common problem.
2,First off the cord to connect the wheel to the Xbox is entirely too short and Thrustmaster offers no accessory to extend it so the only option is to buy a 3rd party extension that was made for the 360 and hope it works.  Second getting the wheel to connect properly is a trick and Forza Horizon 2 wheel defaults do no match up very well.  It is also a real pain due to the fact that the wheel disconnects frequently and sometimes there is no recourse but to restart the whole system with a complete hard reboot.  While it worked (for approximately one month) it was a lot of fun.  But then... the right paddle shifter became irrecoverably stuck.  So that started the process we're in now.  It took Thrustmaster 11 days to respond to a customer service inquiry.  Their response?  Not a suggestion for how to fix it or apologizing for a defective and mostly likely shoddy product.  "Return it to the retailer".  Well the Amazon seller rejected our return request so now we have to go back to Thrustmaster.  We are now planning on waiting another 11 days to find out whatever we're going to find out.  What a waste of time.  If the $300 wheel would have saved me all this work and time it would be worth the extra dough but I'm guessing it would be just be more of the same albeit with a bigger investment.
1,After having this over a year the wheel turns to the left constantly and there is no fix to this. For $100 I expect something to have better quality and last longer. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.  Spend a little extra and get something better.
5,Great wheel especially at this price. I received this wheel in a trade and have no complaints. You will probably need to turn down the sensitivity by hitting the triggers and X B buttons at the same time. Definitely takes a little getting used to but dont give up because when you got it down it adds a huge level of immersion to any driving game (Im on Forza Horizon 2). There isn't any force feedback but in my experience those wheels actually overdoo that feature and it gets in the way of the experience. This one uses a bungee system and it mimics power steering really well. All in all a great deal. If you DO want a wheel with feedback you'll be spending waaay more.
1,The steering wheel will not plug into the USB port on my Xbox One. I cant use it. Nothing I read said anything about buying an adaptor hookup.  Is there an adaptor from Round to USB even available to purchase?
1,Giving anyone thinking of buying this item a heads up.  There is absolutely no customer service.  If you have an issue with the item you might as well throw it away.  This driving wheel veers to the left by itself and we are unable to correct.  Anyway it is basically useless now.  Moving on to another option.
5,I bought because project cars just sucks with a controller unlike forza which you can play just fine.I thought this would be junk.  I was erong. I can now enjoy project cars and even without force feedback like the 400 dollar wheel all i notice is that my car games are much better.  Well worth 100 dollars and the clamp to mount firmly is the best.
1,I received this wheels as a gift from my sister. I used it 2 times and it broke!Thrustmaster support is a joke! I would never buy one of their products!
5,I had this out of the box set up and helping me win a race on Forza 6 in less than 20 minutes. It's a great wheel and works well with Forza 6 and Forza Horizon 2. Sure the pedals could be a little heavier thus more stable but one piece of double sided gaffers tape solved that issue in no time. Hard core gamers will want the TX but for casual gamers like me and my kids this is absolutely perfect. Highly recommend this wheel.
1,Got the wheel for Christmas to use with the XBOX One S and Forza Horizon 3.  Worked great for about 2 hours then it just stopped turning left.  Could make right turns all day but won't turn left.  There is no way that I can find to re-calibrate the wheel with Forza.  I've tried the power-down reset with the Xbox but the same results when it powers on--no left turns.
1,The wheel is turning left and I can’t fix it
5,I've owned every sort of wheel there is but for $100 this is the best I've found.Granted I do greatly prefer the Force-Feedback wheels but the law generally frowns upon you starving your children so you can beat down other people's children online while possibly enjoying the rumble feature in an unclean and "sinful" way.That being said this wheel really is great. Far and away the best wheel I've ever used at the lower tier price range. It's so good that it's tough to justify the extra coin for the top models...
5,For what this wheel is attempting to offer i think it does a great job. Despite it having no force feedback it still offers good enough resistance. It doesn't match up well with the big dogs out there but for the price it's a great value. It comes with a clamp to attach to a table. It requires no battery or wall plug in. It's a pretty good setup for under $100. If you haven't played your racing games without a wheel this is a great first wheel to get. And you'll enjoy racing at least twice as much with it.
5,great product
1,The Wheel worked only for 2 days i want my money back or a replacement 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡. Very disappointed😤.
2,Got as a gift.  Took out of the box followed assembly instructions all fine... try to get the control to be recognized by the XBOX ONE system. NO dice... tried unplugging the XB1 and plugging back in with only the wheel controller connected didn't work... tried just disconnecting/reconnecting controller from console didn't work.. when clicking the "A" button on the wheel control light stays on for about 30 seconds then turns off not recognized as active controller with the system.Game itself works with XBOX controllers as do other games just not this wheel device.  Thrustmaster website was of no help (seemed to focus mostly on connectivity to a PC for gaming not XBOX... driver downloads and such the primary focus not helpful).  Google search did indicate that the hardware connection wiring is a bit fickle but I don't think this is the case here.Looking to exchange in case this particular one was simply broken when received.
1,In the span of one year I had three of these steering wheels fail on me. The first two lasted about a month each. They all started malfunctioning by randomly turning left even when going straight. Contacted Thrustmaster and they refused to warranty the third wheel even though it is an obvious design flaw.
1,Really great at first. I liked the feel it was awesome. That ended in a short time. Do not buy this one. Get a little bit more expensive one. This one will not last you 4 months will not get your money's worth. Starts by steering itself without you touching it and will eventually not work whatsoever.
1,Much better than using controllers.  Grand children love it.  Easy to set up.  BUT  both springs cracked in the brake pedal and one of the two in gas pedal was broken.Thrustmaster was contacted but they provided no help.  Apparently no spare parts are available.  Back to controllers.
1,Absolute piece of crap. DO NOT BUY just google the number of people looking to try and fix or calibrate it. It shouldn't be this hard! First wheel we bought initially worked and then stopped working (unable to turn left only right). Returned it got a new wheel plugged it in and had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM!Read through every forum and watched YouTube videos nothing solved it. I'm returning the second wheel. Very dissapointed!
2,i bought it for my xbox one to play need for speed and the crew game. It only plays on forza. On the buying page it had need for speed with the wheel so i assume it worked. Can someone help me please.
1,Worked great for a couple months.. now the alignment is messed up.
1,Mine lasted 34 days and then began to jink left regardless of wheel input. I tried the troubleshooting guide stuff. It did not function as the guide said it would. Game Stop wouldn't swap it out or even help with warranty service. Thrustmaster replied with robo email confirmation only. My 1st email was a month ago. Nothing....Then I did some research on Thrustmaster. Owned by Guillemot Corp S.A. in Carentoir France. They have a lot of very angry customers around the globe because they don't honor their warranties on any of their products such as Voodoo graphic cards et al. You are rolling the dice with Thrustmaster Guillemot S.A.  UPDATE March 31'17: After writing to the CEO Thrustmaster agreed to replace my defective wheel and they shipped me a new wheel. Hopefully this will be good news to other Guillemot Corp. customers. My faith is renewed and I thank Erika in the support dept. and M.Claude Guillemot.
1,Bought this for my kid and it broke 3 months later.  It won't steer properly.For $99 bucks the thing ought to work.  I wish I had read all the bad reviews about it before hand
5,This is a very good wheel. I enjoy using it for forza 5 and forza horizon 2. Although one people are disappointed about no vibration you don't really need it. The wheel itself gives you enough feedback. The linear resistance is also very good. The paddle shifters also deliver a very satisfying click when pressed.Pros-Very well madeGreat liner resistanceLooks really coolworks great with forza gamesmakes the experience 100000000000000 times betterThis wheel is amazing!!!
2,For now it will be a 2 star because when I got the wheel the down d-pad button is like permanently jammed down and I can't move in any other d-pad direction. It also will not let change the sensitivity either. Very disappointed however in the process of sending it back and getting a new one so we will see how that goes.On the up side when the wheel is in gameplay it feels great just impossible sometimes to actually play the game with broken buttons.
1,This is cheap plastic and feels like an exercising bungie toy. Does not vibrate or feel real in anyway. Was really excited by the way the box and pictures look and then unboxed and was already bummed before i turned on my system. The clamping system also was not threaded right so...
1,Cautionary tale. Mine stop working in few weeks. Wheel was give as gift receipt didn't show selling price Couldn't create after the fact. Thrustmaster refused to warrant this unit. Buyer beware.
1,When I received it. Steering wheel it’s ok. But the pedal doesn’t work. I’m so disappointed.
1,If there were 0 stars that’s what I would rate it. It’s a piece of garbage. I got it for my birthday and broke within a week. Don’t Easter your $$
1,it is really bad because when playing a game the pedals work fine but the wheel sensitivity is horrible
5,it come with the wheel and peddles for $100 US and some wheels come with a chair shifter wheel and peddles for $400 US
1,Very disappointed with this item! We went thru two thinking maybe the first one was defective...turns out they all are!!
5,This racing wheel works better than expected. The one I have looks and feels well-constructed. If you're on a tight budget and you want a wheel then this one is the one to get. When you think about it. It only costs $40 more than a standard controller and it works really well! just as good as the expensive wheels do.
1,2nd one purchased 1st one stopped working car wouldnt manoeuvre2nd one had 5 mins and accelerate pedal not working will be returning and not purchasing another one
1,About 3 weeks of using it the wheel glitches left when you turn right. And is about 4 times worse when you turn left. Second one I bought... second time it happened.
1,Used product once then it wouldn’t work. Then tried to return for another but had no idea when I’d get the new one
5,Didn't buy it it here but its a great combo. Had a mad catz before and had no resistance. Its light weight so it will slide around if you don't have a stand. Play  on forza 5 and project cars.
1,Got it for Christmas and today it was acting up it doesn't work DONT BUY waste of your money
1,Worked for a few hours now it won’t turn left. Very disappointed. Got a replacement...that didn’t work either.Very poor quality product
5,Johnny5 hey I saw your post same thing happens to me. I assume your talking how about the pedal cord doesn't fit into the Xbox. It is supposed to go into the steering wheel. Hope that helped
1,Do not buy it
1,First thing it's extremely thin/hollow plastic just like it's over-priced older sister except this has absolutely no feedback not even rumble. Also the bungee cord was incorrectly calibrated and pulls around 30 degrees to the left when I leave it at idle/center position. This wheel is only for 1 game atm a very good game but it's the only one since it's not compatible with anything except the Xbox One not even PC really? Disappointing.Since the official Xbox One gamepad is only $60 and that is miles ahead in technology/design and is basically providing the same functionality as this wheel and more (3 rumble motors vs none centers correctly d-pad isn't garbage etc. etc.). With that in mind I would say this wheel is worth $35 at the most.Drop the Ferrari logo make sure the wheel is centered before you ship it sell this at a fair price and you will have me as a customer again. Keep gouging us and keep seeing quarterly losses simple.
1,There is no force feedback the rubber band resistance is laughable pedals are numb no vibration features and it offers less accuracy of movement than a normal gamepad. So there is essentially no reason to buy this product.
5,This is amazing in forza horizon 2
5,Well put together. Feels just like real steering wheel. Easy to handle.
5,this wheel gives video game a whole new experience
1,After 3 months of use the springs used to create resistance on the accelerator pedal broke making the unit no longer usable.
1,Sorry to say this is a waste of money and a piece of junk.  Now that I got that out of my system I have to admit it looks and feels great it just doesn't steer the car.  No problem I am thinking I can just go on the Thrustmaster website and the tech support should fix me up.  Oh my goodness what a useless piece of crap the website is.  First you must register then wait hours for them to send you access then you need to register your product which it doesn't recognize and then there is no tech support.  The links to the drivers do not work.  You get one crappy PDFs that doesn't tell you anything.  No problem I say there is always someone out there that knows how to make these things work.  I will google up some help from fellow users.  HA. I only reinforced what I've just learned. This wheel is a very nice replica of the Ferrari wheel and it looks and feels nice but doesn't work or will only work for a short while.
5,just nice for 100usd wheel...think want to buy one more for dual player games.
5,Works great. If you don't want to spend 400.00 dollars This is a great option.
1,I've had this wheel for a couple months but used it very little. It's pretty good for a wheel with no force feedback but I'm now having an issue where it glitches out and sends you veering off the track. Tried with Forza 6 and Project Cars. Same with both games. It will steer fine then suddenly snap to the right. If I can find a fix for this I'll give it a better review.
5,Nice product
5,Great for beginners!
2,Wheel is great but the brake pedal stopped working after a couple uses
1,Not worth it
1,too pricey for it
1,Terrible waste of money. Bought it it worked for about a day. The RB button (paddle shifter) doesn't work. It's required to change the wheel  sensitivity so even when I tried to remap the buttons I couldn't change the sensitivity and the default setting is also the highest setting. Overall a terrible product.
1,this does NOT work on PC
1,Does not work on PC  Other xbox one racing wheels work on pc but not this one?  I guess thrustmaster likes to deliberately withhold driver support even though microsoft owns xbox and windows and you can even play xbox one on your PC.  Very pathetic.
1,I bought this wheel today from Gamestop.  Ive been playing a lot of Project Cars FM5 and FH2 on XB1 so it was time for a wheel.  This wheel had major issues.  The D pad did not work correctly nor did the LB shifter.  I immediately returned it.  I came back home and plugged in my old xbox 360 wheel  and fired up the OLD xbox 360 and FM 4.  I realized that the original xbox 360 wheel was of a much higher quality than this 458 Spider wheel.  It would be amazing if MS could make their old wheel compatible with the XB1.  Or at least produce a wheel that works as well as that one does.  I'd buy it!!!
1,What's the point to design a racing wheel without force feedback? Totally useless.
1,Very unrealistic. Is 7/10 scale fun to use but not worth the money
1,No force feeback. No wheel below $300 with FFB Do not support thrustmaster.
1,Purchased this steering wheel for my son for Christmas but have been unable to connect it to GTA5 help please ? Anyone else having same problems ? I have a very disappointed son.
5,This has made playing all the Forza games so much more fun. My wife enjoy uses this and refuses to use a controller.
5,Th kid got wanted he wanted and very happy
5,Feel very comfortable very advanced material buy with fondle admiringly after recommend to buy
5,Bought this for my grandsons' birthday. He wanted it set up right away.
5,It's a wheel
5,Super Fast Shipping great quality
1,All you need to do is search "Thrustmaster 458 glitch"... ALL of them WILL break too soon. The potentiometer that senses where the steering wheel is has a horrible flaw. It wears too fast and you (like everyone) WILL get a glitchy or non-responsive wheel. It would be a very inexpensive and easy fix for Thrustmaster but they really do not care.Update if you do decide to fix it and you understand a little bit about electronics you can find this part on Amazon - "Potentiometer 10Kohm 20% 50Mw - PTV09A-4020F-B103"Good luck.
5,Quality is 2nd to none and for the price you won’t find a better bargain. Totally recommend!!!
5,Very easy set up. Best value for money.
5,OMG Ferrari wheel in love now just need to find a way to get my hands on the car in love with these car!! And got it early I think!
5,This was a gift to our kids. They seem to really enjoy it.
5,Did not really it has no clutch or shifter.
5,Bought for my son. He says it realistic and love playing driving games with it.
5,Easy to assemble easy to connect easy to use. Im not new to racing games but I am new to using a wheel. I have to say after a few days of using it I am in love with this thing. It is also the cheapest wheel out right now and I have 0 complaints.
5,Fantastic product!
4,The 1st one i ordered never came i got some random light fixture. But that was fixed and 3 days later (today) i got the correct product. My son loves it I think it's pretty cool I've always wanted to try something like this. It definitely works as intended. Kind of wish the pedals were a little more separated and heavier it doesn't like to stay in one spot but im sure i can just purlt something under it. Definitely going to be a learning curve for forza. I'll update my review once my son and I have had more time with it
5,The great choose in $100 price. I use it to play F1 2021 on xbox series s it’s my first time to use steering wheel and it make me feel funny. The wheel is only 240 dergees but beginner seldom turn it 240 dergees at all the accuracy of the steering wheel is relatively good there will not be excessive steering.But I think the arrow keys in the lower left corner is a bad design. It’s too small and hard to use I often failed to choose the UDLR.....Even though it say that it “restored the steering wheel from the original car”.If you can overcome the most worst arrow keys this steering wheel is a good thing to begin car driving games.
2,I’ve changed my review. The quality is okay. It doesn’t have force feedback of any sort. So it becomes difficult to understand the car you drive. The alignment is 3/10. The box came in perfectly with all the required connector and pedals. If you are looking for a cheap steering wheel then this might be your choice.
5,I bought this for my 8 year old son who loves playing Forza. I ordered a PC /USB converter cord as recommended by the reviews but I didn’t need it for out Xbox one. Set up was Easy as my son did it all by himself.I took a video and it looks like there’s a slight delay between turning the wheel and when the car turns in the game. However it did not feel like anything was lagging.Love the purchase!
5,This was a birthday gift for my grandson.He loves it!
5,It is very fun and easy to use
1,This product looks nice but it took time to make it work though it is simple to connect everything. It worked once or twice and then stopped. We tried to reconnect things again didn't help. Was supposed to be my son's birthday present.More often doesn't work than does so the experience of using it is frustrating as it is just wasted time money and nerve. :(
4,The product works great and would totally recommend it to those in need of a beginner wheel+pedals. However button mapping is quite buggy sometimes and certain buttons can’t have controls mapped to them at all.
5,A
5,I bought specifically to play Forza. Love this thing! And a cheaper price than the big box store
5,Nice
1,The gas pedal is broken
3,My son really wants to like this but despite doing some research we can’t figure out how to get it to go in reverse.
5,wish the pedals were like aluminum or metal but still pretty good
5,Got this for my son as an addition to his gaming stuff. He really enjoys it. Its easy enough for his little sister to use as well. Simple install and good value.
2,Purchased for my son for Christmas wheel was better quality than I thought however the actual game-play was tricky and more difficult than a hand held controller.  Searched forums and reviews to try and configure the wheel properly but it doesn't have the configuration capabilities of more expensive wheels.  After a few uses the controller started acting like the D-pad was stuck in one direction.  Followed re-calibration instructions and it didn't correct. Called Thrustmaster Tech Support and they said it was a hardware issue and to return the wheel.  Luckily Amazon has a fantastic return policy.  Sent back for refund.  Pretty disappointing product basically a gimmicky toy.
1,It is impossible to use this controller with my system because of the brake and gas pedal. The brake pedal is so hard to press that it moves the the entire base around every time you press it. You will have to build or by something to mount it.
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas. Got it at the end of October to beat the Christmas rush. My sone hooked it up and it stopped working after 10m minutes of play time. Amazon says because I didn't buy it in November I can't return it. So the message from Amazon is "don't buy early" and we won't guarantee anything based on when it was opened but when it was purchased. I guess I should return all the early birthday presents that I bought in November.
5,Le volant réagi super bien il y a différente sensibilité 4 pour être exacte et cela fait en sorte que dans mon jeu sur xbox one Forza Motorsport 6 j'utilise le 3 et le volant est parfait il répond au millième de quart de tour et pour les pédales juste a utiliser un tapis de yoga et normalement en conduite on utilise seulement  un pied donc l'autre peut servir de poid pour le retenir en place. IL FAUT BIEN LIRE LE LIVRE D'INSTRUCTION IL APPREND CE QUI NE FAUT PAS FAIRE AVEC LE VOLANT. Pour ce qui est du prix très abordable pour un joueur comme moi de 20 ans qui veut un volant pour avoir la sensation sans trop mettre dans le haute de gamme a 350-400$ minimum sans les bras de vitesse donc que pour 170$ avec taxe shipper au Québec je trouve sa très resonable.
5,This wheel makes playing Forza much more enjoyable.  I think the bungee system is surprisingly good as well.  I had considered buying a FFB wheel but those are 4x the price and would have been wasted on me a casual gamer.This product combined with wheelstand pro v2  Racing Steering Wheelstand for Original Thrustmaster F458 (Xbox 360 Version) F458 Spider (Xbox One) T80 T100 RGT Ferrari GT and F430; Original Wheel Stand Pro V2 Stand: Wheel/Pedals Not included         is awesome.The throttle/brake pedals also have a really nice feel to them.  This is my first wheel so I can't compare to others.  But so far I'm really happy with it.
1,I have had this wheel for about 6 months and this is the third one of these i've bought. It was the cheapest and the only one I could afford at the time. I regret buying this one and will never buy another one again in my experience they are complete rubbish. Each one I have bought has developed the same problem after a while when driving with this wheel the car suddenly and without warning pulls sharply to one side and you have no control over it. Pausing the game and violently turning the wheel from side to side rectifies the problem but only temporarily as it keeps re-occurring. There are videos on YouTube posted by people with similar issues with these wheels. I thought Thrustmaster would have solved the issue by now but apparently not. I rate it 1 out of 10.
4,Bello ma un po' un rottura ogni volta montarlo alla scrivania era uno sfizio più che altro se ci invrsti un po' di più  e hai posto per poterlo montare su una base fissa ben venga non sarà un volante thrustmaster da 400 euro ma il suo lavoro lo fa l ho provato con vari giochi su grido ha un ottimo feedback su forza un po' duro anche provando ad aumentare la sensibilità su Need for Speed imbarazzante a dir poco
5,Its worth the cost you could spend 4 times as much and still get a lemon. I used our heavy rubber shoe mat to put the pedals on so they don't slide worked fine and wheel works well its only been a week we'll see it if can stand the test of timeAfter using now for another week my driving skills are much worse than using x-box controller so with that said I'm returning to the ordinary controller where I actually have control
3,Not for extream racers. Steering column seems weak too much twisting. Throttle seems to stick at 80% down. Not very precise.  Iv used this for 1 week. Sold it. And bought the thrustmaster TMX proIf your a kid playing the Ferrari 458 wheel it's ok but for an adult I fully recommend the TMX versions
2,Lo que no me gusto es que no da mas que media vuelta el volante.Lo peor es que no vibra lo que le quita muchisima sensacion al usarlo.
4,Muy buen volante. Cumple con su cometido de forma correcta. Quiza para los mas entusiastas que utilicen o hayan probado otros no les resulte el volante mas realista pero para el jugador promedio que solo quiere tener una experiencia mas inmersiva es altamente recomendable este producto!
4,There are many things I like about this wheel in the price point. Good feel solid shift paddles etc. as advertised.Where it disappoints for me is something so basic it s hard to believe. The mounting system can't be used on a table with a drop front even a short one. In addition the "Mag..whatever "switch only cycles between change camera and menu.it's useless.
4,This wheel has very good grip and drives pretty well. Once you figure out the sensitivity for the games it makes driving really fun. The only complain is that the petal base is so light when you push the pedals the whole base goes flying. I had to duck tape mine down.
4,Would have liked to have been able to bolt the steering wheel to a base plate so that it doesn't come loose while steering. It basically comes loose after a while. Designed to be clamped to a table and not bolted down. Otherwise works fine worth the money.
4,Easy to use and adds a whole lot more fun to driving games. It is important to lock the wheel and pedals in place so that the controls respond as expected.  Recommend purchasing a mounting frame to isolate movement to the controls and fully enjoy the experience.
5,Great Steering wheel and pedals for Xbox One X. The best entry level wheel for the price. And it works just fine with Forza race Games and Horizon 3 - 😀😀😀😀😀
5,Es un buen volante cómodo y con buenos detalles. Intuitivo y de fácil uso e instalación. Bueno para iniciarse en los simuladores de carreras
5,Bought this for my boyfriend and I’ve never seen a grown man be happier than he was! Has been using it every single day for the past month or soHe however mentioned that there was some lagging or delay between the steering of the wheel and the actual game (but that could just be his ego talking!)
4,If you have a lower budget this wheel is the perfect balance from high end to low end. The wheel has durable rubber grips and metal paddle shifters the bad feels sturdy only thing I can knock this product for is the pedals cause sometimes if you use both feet they lift up but if you use one foot like in real life they are fine
5,El producto es bueno y perfecto para jugadores que no se lo toman en serio ya que este no incluye vibración ni forfickbac pero esta excelente para jugar sin problemas varias horas seguidas juegos como proyect cars la saga forza f1 etc.
5,Min petit fils et mon fils ils adorent jouer avec !!! Sauf ce n'est pas tout les jeux qui prennent l'option de vitesse manuelle !!Merci
5,Better than playing Forza with the game console. Gives a pretty realistic feel for the price although there is no vibration etc. But for a beginner's wheel it's superb.
5,This is the first wheel I've bought andfor the price it seems amazing the quality is very good and sturdy I'm  quite impressed.
4,for the price its defiantly worth it. if your playing forza don't bother with ferraris for this wheel though. insanely hard but every other car i drive i have a lot of fun.
5,J'ai acheté ce produit comme cadeau pour mon copain. Il a ADORÉ! le volant et les pédales fonctionnent parfaitement et donne vraiment une nouvelle dimension aux jeux de course. L'installation a été facile et rapide.
4,Pretty much works flawlessly when you plug it in on any current XBOX One racing game. That's inclusive of Forza Motorsports 7. If a game stops working for any reason unplug the wheel and the XBOX and try again. It will detect.
5,Excelente producto mi hijo está feliz con el desempeño del volante los materiales también se sienten bien se los recomiendo mucho.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEYI bought this a month in advance for my son’s birthday. Unfortunately because of this I missed the return window. He played with it twice and it stopped workingWe are so disappointed
4,Work as it’s supposed to work. The only issue was the amount of steering adjustment. Could have been more.
5,Awsome. Works perfect. It's like driving a real car. Love it. Update doesn't work on windows 10
5,The pedals are not even bad  they’re really good and the steering wheel is the best it is good for need for speed payback in all the racing games for Xbox one S or x what is there to dislike about it it’s the best
5,très satisfait de la commande il est vrm beau et il se manipule super bien
1,Fun but after 9 months its already working very poorly. I expected much better quality from a reputable company like thrustmaster
5,This item was a birthday gift for my youngest granddaughter in Australia.  I live in the U.K. so I have not seen the item.  My granddaughter is delighted with the item thank you.  It arrived in time for her birthday.
5,I love this product!! It is one of the cheaper steering wheels you can get but it doesn’t feel cheap! The only thing that I’m not the biggest fan of is that the wheel it’s self is springy.
5,My Son Loves this wheel.Its awesome!!!
5,A great steering and pedals kit for the price with a nice build and grip quality. There is no feedback but the driving is a big improvement from the controller it’s perfect for a 100 bucks!
4,Very nice quality overall.  Easy to setup and provides hours of enjoyment!
4,Buen control para juegos de carrera a veces no se apaga el foquito que dicta que esta encendido pero es lo de menos.
1,La conduite n'est vraiment pas précise très très cheap..mauvais choix de ma part.j'aurais du m'informé plus avant d'acheté ce produit...ont apprends de nos erreurs ;'(
5,El producto cumplió las expectativas y el tiempo de entrega fue excelente incluso llegó antes de lo esperado.
5,très satisfait
5,Funciona a la perfección y mi hijo lo disfruta mucho
5,Good product
1,pour forza 6 c'est un désastre aucune sensations dans le volant pas de vibration ne vaut pas la peine restez avec la manette et continuez à économiser votre argent pour autre chose !
5,Great add

5,Great Product!
5,This was a Christmas gift for my 14 year old grandson.  He was thrilled with it and had it set up Christmas Day.  He's really enjoying it!
2,Sorry to say it but it Doesn’t work very well the steering wheel doesn’t react fast enough and makes it very hard to drive
3,Cumple con las especificaciones en pequeño realmente no es para una experiencia muy realista ya que solo hace giro de 180° pero fuera de eso esta bien
5,Easy to set up and use. Makes playing driving games a lot easier. Only problem is I wish it would come with longer cord
5,Me encanto el articulo que compre exactamente como lo muestra la imagen llego un 1 antes de la fecha estimada.
3,Good product not that durable though
5,It is easier to do racing games like Crew 2 and Forza Horizon
5,Overall product good clamp design could be better and platform for pedals could be wider to give more room for foot
5,Fonctionne très bien et répond à 100% à nos attentes! Très heureux de notre achat
5,Lo recibí en los tiempos marcados y en buenas condiciones. En cuanto al volante para principiantes es una buena experienciaMuy bien
5,Best wheel for its price nothing wrong with it i strongly suggest this wheel for new players/drivers

5,This was for my son he loves it!
5,Nothing I like everything
1,Wear and tear quickly.
5,Great product
4,Good product
1,It said the wheel was "like new" and then come already broken
5,Todo excelente
5,Works great!
3,Eh
1,Este producto es usado!!!!!
5,Greate for the price kids loved it.
4,I can use the wheel to play Forza and THE CREW without problems.The only problem i've had with this wheel is with the foot pedals. They are stiff which causes the whole thing to move and possibly flip when you switch pedals. It's not a huge flaw because you can use multiple simple methods to anchor it to the floor.Overall this Wheel is decent and it works as I expected.
5,Excelente producto. Cumplieron en la fecha comprometida. Sin duda volveré a comprar.  Sería ideal que acepten pagos con American Express
1,Se ve increíble pero si es un poco delícado no recomiendo dar volantazos. La experiencia de juego es casi perfecta.Ya pasó un mes y ya se descompuso empieza a tener un problema que al parecer todos tienen no gira a la izq correctamente no se puede mantener en linea recta.
4,No es el mejor volante disponible para Xbox One por parte de Thrustmasters pero sin duda si no eres un Hardcore Gamer de juegos de carreras cumplirá con tus expectativas el diseño es muy elegante emulando al de un Ferrari Spider y la calidad en cuanto a precio ni se diga. En cuanto al envío me llego antes de la fecha estipulada como otra compras a través de Amazon pero lastimosamente un detalle bastante importante recibí la caja bastante maltratada con indicios de golpes espero que de haber una próxima compra a través de Amazon cuiden eso fuera de eso excelente compra.
4,The product was purchased for a 14 year old . His feedback was one word. Awesome. So well done. Shipped within a week.
3,This is great if you're looking to buy a wheel and pedals for a young kid but it's not something you want to be using in anger on the track.For the price you get a decent amount I would say. Nice wheel nice gear paddles but the pedals are lightweight plastic and wanting.Personally I bought this to immerse my F1 2022 experience on Xbox which it did to a certain extent. However the lack of vibration/feedback is why this wheel is cheaper than the others. For F1 it's not great because of that and the plastic pedals move around if not secured or against a wall.After spending a week using this (so I got a lot of hours with it) I ended up returning it and buying the more expensive Logitech offering. That wheel I am far happier with and would recommend if you have the budget.So good if on a budget but pay the extra £100 if you want a decent wheel.
5,This is possibly the very best accessory I have bought ever. I thought I was going to be disappointed by the lack of Force Feedback but it really isn't something I miss at all. The resistance band on the pedals is incredibly effective and the action of the wheel is very responsive.The Manual and features:The manual is lacking as is the case so often these days. While it shows the dial for righthand side of the wheel it fails totally to explain what it is why it's there what it does. I've had the wheel several weeks now and apart from changing the camera settings on Forza I fail to see its purpose. It appears to be pretty much redundant which is a great pity.Tip 1 - The manual also fails spectacularly to explain that the "Engine Start" button doesn't start the engine (unless you have a game that will let you programme it" but is a multidirectional button that functions as the D-Pad from the X-Box controller. It isn't intuitive at all and I stumbled across it by accident. Pressing the edges of the button will move the cursor about for selections and so on.Tip 2- Having just said how bad the manual is my next tip is carefully read the section about the sensitivity setting adjustment. You will need to do this each time you plug the unit in which is one of the very few downsides I have found. Doing the sensitivity adjustment though will make a huge difference to performance. Each time you press the relevant buttons and pull on the two metal flappy paddles the light on the right of the wheel base will flash a number of times. The manual reveals how many for each level. I have found 3 flashes to be the best for Forza 6. The second downside of this pedal is the site of the light. It is just in the wrong place and is obscured by the wheel meaning you have to bend at an odd angle to see the number of flashes. You only need do it once per session though so it's not a major flaw by any means.The Quality:The quality of the unit is really very good indeed. It's particularly evident where the table locking bolt fits under the wheel. Normally this sort of fixing is flaky at best but on the Spyder 458 wheel is look less substantial than it actually is and I see no reason other than badly abusing it to cause this socket to fail.The table lock itself is a real plus and very easy to use. This is my second tip of sorts that you will need a table or solid surface to use this wheel. There is no way it could be used effectively without locking it down. but as I state above the mechanism is excellent.The Stand:This brings me to my last point and it is a really important one. To date Amazon continue to advertise "  The Ultimate Steering Wheel Stand in Black - suitable for Logitech Xbox Madcatz and Thrustmaster        " as being a perfect partner for this wheel. IT ABSOLUTELY ISN"T COMPATIBLE!!!I cannot emphasise this point enough. It will cause huge disappointment when after half an hour struggling to put it together you find that the locking mechanism for the pedals doesn't come anywhere close to fitting. The stand claims to be compatible with the Thrustmaster 458 wheel and maybe it is but it most certainly isn't compatible with the 2015 release of this wheel set. The 458 Spyder has a different design for the pedals and the base is too large for the stand lock.I sent it back and did eventually get a refund but it took some time and they initially wanted me to do the running around posting the stand back to them. Being a wheelchair user and this being quite a heavy piece of kit there was no way I could have done it. They were happy to collect it though after asking but the point is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place.I have no idea why Amazon persist in advertising them together but I will say it again   The Ultimate Steering Wheel Stand in Black - suitable for Logitech Xbox Madcatz and Thrustmaster         WITH THE   Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Racing Wheel (Xbox One)        Instead I paid a bit more and got the "  Wheel Stand Pro -Stand for Logitech wheels and Thrustmaster Ferrari F458        " which is far far more effective and is far far far better built in my opinion. It is also far easier to collapse to store so do give it a look and save some more pennies to get the wheel and the stand together.I've given the wheel 5 stars because that setting is for "I Love It" and I do. However I would mark it down on the few points I mentioned above. They are mainly about the poor manual and as such can be overcome but despite Mr Cameron thinking we are all rolling in cash these days I still think that £65 is a lot of money. For younger readers when you reach the age where you need to feed yourself and pay the bills you will appreciate the truth of what I say 😀. I just think at £65 which is already a reduced price the manual ought to be right. It should be clear in all languages and should be checked for errors. With the internet giving unlimited access to the world pretty much there is little reason that companies cannot get contacts in other countries to translate and check for errors. It's really not a big ask these days.Enough negativity though. I think I have kicked Amazon and Thrustmaster enough for shortcomings. In defence of both though Amazon delivered super quick and with a smile from the driver (always a plus to see happy people) and Thrustmaster have delivered a superb piece of kit in the form of the   Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Racing Wheel (Xbox One)        . One very very happy customer.
5,Ottimo prodotto...ben fatto e ottima manovrabilità
4,The Thrustmaster 458 Spider is a good wheel for its price. The wheel is easy to setup and use. It works well on games like Forza & F1. So far i have encountered no major problems with the wheel. It is enjoyable to use but the lack of force feedback is annoying. The wheel itself is nice to hold with a 240 degrees turning radius. The pedals lack a clutch pedal and feels like it is made out of cheap plastic. Overall if you are trying to have an enjoyable time on a game like forza this wheel is definitely a good entry class wheel. But if you want to take sim racing seriously I recommend saving up for the Logitech G920 or G29.
4,Le volant est plutôt bien mes Le pédalier est plutôt fragile notamment la pédale de frein qui pourrait se casser d'ici 2 mois d'utilisation
5,Arrivato puntuale mai visto un imballaggio così accurato per tutelare l'oggetto in questione che si presenta esattamente come in descrizione. I miei figli superfelici ringraziano.
3,Work well with FORZA but don't work with THE CREW
2,Grips fall off veers to the left pos.
5,Ein wirklich gutes und kompaktes Lenkrad für Anfänger und Gelegenheitsrennfahrer bin vollkommen zufrieden!
3,Con los juegos online no funciona tienen que ser juegos descargados o comprados y los pedales depende la superficie en la que lo pongas resbala mucho no viene con unos tacos adaptados para que quede seguro en el suelo
4,El problema es el freno para un crío va muy duro
1,An online review suggested this wheel as a good budget wheel.Said it was better than using a controller for driving.And yes it is better than the controller...much like being poked in the eye with a dull stick is better than a sharp stick.Inconsistent controls make this wheel very hard to use sometimes touchy sometimes loose.
5,This steering whell is the best it is easy to set up as well it has got auto recentering and the pedals are good but they sqeak sometimes but its easy to fix
1,Not worth spending your money it requires a special table to hook it up to
3,Realmente no me convence se ve muy plasticoso no creo que merezca la pena comprar un volante por menos de 200 euros. Estan demasiado caros para lo que en realidad son.
4,Après une semaine d'utilisation (intensive!) je suis tout à fait satisfait de ce volant. Il n'est pas à retour de force et ne vibre pas mais le système "d'élastiques" qu'il contient en interne le remet en position centrale automatiquement et donne une bonne résistance dans les virages. Pour moins de 50€ (prix actuel sur Amazon) c'est un excellent rapport qualité prix. L'alternative serait de sortir 300 à 500€ pour un volant à retour de force mais ce n'est pas valable pour mon utilisation. Seul bémol: il n'y a pas de prise casque sur le volant et brancher la manette en meme temps pour faire passer le son par la manette semble créer des interférences (son genre larsen léger en continu dans le casque). Pas moyen de foncer avec le son du moteur à fond dans les oreilles sans déranger toute la maison donc. Une omission qui ne semblait pas difficile à éviter.Je l'utilise avec la démo de Forza Motorsport 6 et avec Forza Horizon 2 et il fonctionne bien dans les deux cas. Différents modes de configurations dans les deux jeux permettent de l'utiliser avec les pédales (pour moi) ou sans (pour mon fils de 6 ans). Le mode de sensibilité du volant par défaut est adapté (et je n'ai pas senti de grosse différence entre les différents modes). Après avoir fabriqué un support pour fixer les pédales (une planche de bois percée de trous à laquelle elles sont attachée par les deux pas de vis intégrés dessous) et fixé le volant sur une table solide solidaire du support on se glisse dans un "cockpit" fixe et l'expérience est troublante: je me sens parfois partir dans les virages même si rien ne bouge autour de moi!Ne croyez pas les commentaires qui disent que sans retour de force les volants ne valent pas le coup par rapport à la manette. J'ai gagné beaucoup en temps au tour et en sensations... et mon fils à un sourire qui va d'une oreille à l'autre quand il joue et conduit "comme pour de vrai"!
4,Acheté pour un jeune de 12 ans ça l’amuse comme il faut après en étant objectif pour ce prix ne vous attendez à rien de fou il n’y a pas de retour de force pas de 360 avec le volant mais ça fait le taf.
4,good
4,Pas mal pour le prix ça fait le boulot .Pour ma part  j'ai construit mon simracingJ'ai pas l'effet recherché avec ce volant car pas de vibrations et de retour de force .sont retour au point 0 rattrape un peu ces manquent .Pour un gamer occasionnel sur des jeux de course ça fait le taf mais pour un simracing  de type F1 ou autre en simulateur je conseille de passer sur un thrusmaster tmx au minimum pas forcément beaucoup plus cher ou un Logitech g920 pour celui qui a un poil plus les moyens
3,Mon fils se faisait une joie de recevoir le volant pour jouer sur sa console XBox mais il a vite déchanté... Après avoir installé le volant et branché tous les câbles comme prévu et après avoir suivi toutes les explications données dans une vidéo trouvée sur le net le produit ne fonctionne pas quelque soit le jeu sélectionné. Impossible de tourner le volant de droite à gauche et vice-versa. Les autres boutons fonctionnaient avec les jeux mais impossible à manoeuvrer.Têtu et obstiné il n'a pas voulu renvoyer le produit le jour même afin de trouver la solution au problème.Finalement après avoir cherché toutes les solutions sans succès il a décidé de dévisser le boîtier.Constatations : le fil rouge n'était pas branché et en effleurant ce fil le fil jaune et le fil noir se sont également dessoudés.Opération maintenance pour réparer l'article : nouvelles soudures sur les 3 fils concernés et cette fois des soudures françaises bien faites et bien fixées.Quelques minutes plus tard nouveau test du volant et miracle tout fonctionne parfaitement le volant est enfin utilisable.Mon fils a retrouvé le sourire et joue avec bonheur aux courses de voitures !!!J'aimerais tout de même qu'Amazon fasse un geste commercial puisque nous n'avons pas renvoyé le produit et avons donc évité la destruction d'un article qui était facilement réparable. Un geste pour la planète !Je recommande ce produit le volant est agréable en main avec les palettes de commandes de vitesse au volant. Le support des pédales est agréable seul les pédales sont un peu dures à appuyer.Attention aux soudures !!!
4,Parto con la cosa più importante e che tutti gli acquirenti devono capire bene prima di effettuare l'acquisto. Questo volante è progettato per Xbox One e funziona solo con questa console non funziona su PC Windows 7 o 8.1 da testare su Windows 10 visto che adesso è stata aggiunta la piena compatibilità dei controller Xbox One ma non è detto che venga riconosciuto correttamente da Steam e soci.Detto questo il volante è un ottimo prodotto in linea con la qualità Thrustmaster e si presenta come il miglior volante entry-level low cost sul mercato. Andando a spendere circa 70 euro in più si potrebbe prendere il TMX che ha anche il Force Feedback ma rimanendo sotto i 100€ non si trova nulla di meglio rispetto a questo F458 Spider. Il volante è una fedele riproduzione del volante montato sull'omonima auto ovviamente in scala ridotta e realizzato in plastica. I lati rossi sono di gomma garantiscono un ottimo grip mentre le leve del cambio sono in metallo ottimi a livello di sensazione.Il sistema a molla non è male applica la giusta resistenza allo sterzo e garantisce una buona precisione di guida. Il gancio sotto al volante è ottimo si adatta a tavolini di massimo 5cm e con superficie liscia sotto se c'è uno scalino oltre ai 5cm potrebbe darvi problemi.Riguardo alla pedaliera i pedali sono duri al punto giusto per il freno avrete bisogno di un po' di pratica per capire bene il dosaggio le prime volte inchioderete sempre. Il vero problema della pedaliera è che tende a scappare. Aderisce al pavimento solo con dei gommini che purtroppo non fanno abbastanza bene il loro lavoro. In aggiunta la pedaliera tende ad impennarsi davanti se carichiamo troppo peso con i talloni ma anche in questo caso è tutta una questione d'abitudine.In conclusione a questo prezzo non si trova nulla di meglio peccato per la mancata compatibilità del PC sarebbe bastato davvero poco per renderlo utilizzabile il cavo è un normale USB il PC lo riconosce ma non come periferica mancano i driver.
3,Très bon volant xbox mais on peux en trouvé pour 50 euros de plus 10 fois mieux comme le trustmaster tmx qui fait 900° et celui la a que 240° le trustmaster tmx a un retour de force alors que celui la a que des élastique donc bon volant pour un petit budget mais sinon privilégier le trustmaster tmx que je vous conseille vraiment.
3,発売後かなり経っておりレビュー需要があるのか疑わしいが、備忘録も兼ねて記しておく。本当は同じThrustmasters社のフォースフィードバック(FFB)付きの上位機種が欲しいが、同社が正規輸入していないため新品で購入しても保証外なのが最大のネック。Xbox360時代の純正ワイヤレスホイールを2台購入し、いずれも保証期間内に故障したので計4台を使うはめになった自分にはFFBハンコンを非正規ルートで手にする選択は除外したかった。と言いつつ本品は中古。安価であった上に機構的に壊れる余地がないだろうと踏んだ。バンジーテクノロジーとは噴飯もののキャッチフレーズだが要するに伸縮性のあるゴムひも。ただし登山や人命救助にも使われるだけあって強度や耐久性は十分すぎる。外観もきれいで使用感も感じられないが、フェラーリを象徴するステアリングの赤いラバーは小豆色に変色し加水分解で多少べた付く。とはいえ動作に問題はなくロックトゥロックわずか240度でもコントローラーではなくステアリングとして本体に認識される安心感(安価な非ライセンス品だと標準コントローラーとして認識される場合があり、ゲームによってはハンドルと相性が悪い補正処理がなされることがある。ゲームでハンコン専用の設定画面ががあるかが目安だ)と、現在好んでプレイしているラリー系のシミュレーションには操舵によって細かい切り返しができる恩恵は何物にも代えがたい。そして何よりコントローラーでは得られない運転の雰囲気。とはいえかつて慣れ親しんだFFBが懐かしいのも正直な気持ち。不可抗力で姿勢が乱れたときの修正舵と戻しのタイミングと角度が判断できないので往々にしてタコ踊りに陥ることが避けられない。難点を幾つかの挙げると、耐久性がありそうな金属製のパドルシフトが何故か上半分で切り落としたような形状なので、9時15分で手を添えると引っ掛かり難い。360ワイホイのようなイヤホンジャックがないのでオンラインチャットのために標準コントローラーを別途用意しなければならない上に無線接続のままだとオートセービングが働き同時に本製品の接続も切れてゲームが中断する。本製品のボタンのみで再開が可能だがどのようなゲームをプレイしていようともかなりの挙動の乱れを覚悟しなければならない。Xbox Oneは360に比べて全く勢いがなかったが、 X/Sの販売で盛り返しているようなのでT社も英断を下して、是非ともXbox向けFFB付き製品を正規販売していただきたい。それまでじっと我慢の子。そうそう、PS向けの同等製品には振動機能があるが本機にはない。これはXbox Oneの純正コントローラーが標準で備えているインパルス・トリガーのせいなのかな？振動だけでもあればドライビングの情報源としてありがたいのだが。
4,Great wheel plugged it in and all working.Ours had a slight fault reported to Amazon and they sent a replacement out to arrive the next day and arranged to have the old one sent back.Can’t fault the customer service. Fantastic
4,Volante ottimo per quanto riguarda qualità/prezzo penso che a questo prezzo è il migliore sul mercato.È arrivato in tempo e in perfette condizioni.L’installazione facilissima con la mia xbox one-s praticamente l’ho collegato e funziona  subito sostituisce totalmente il joypad.L’unica cosa che non va è la pedaliera nel senso che appoggiata per terra scivola e premendo il freno essendo duro la pedaliera si alza e si sposta..Praticamente inutilizzabile se non si compra un supporto (circa 70euro sul mercato).E allora mi sono dato al fai da te e ho fissato la pedaliera ad una tavola di compensato spesso 4mm (fortunatamente sotto la pedaliera ci sono due buchi per viti tipo M6) e a quest’ultima ho attaccato delle ventose potete vedere le foto.Adesso la pedaliera è incollata al pavimento e non si sposta minimamente.Se prendete delle ventose con vite M6 potete provare ad attaccarle direttamente ai supporti della pedaliera ma non so se regge.Infine tutte il materiale mo è costato 1255.Ciao a tutti
4,Firstly I would like to say that this is a very good racing wheel. It feels well built and of high quality and i would 100% recommend it to anyone looking to buy a cheap but decent racing wheel. However at no fault of the wheel it is unsable on forza horizon 4. on every corner you spin out making it very frustrating and hard to play. however I have heard that it work on other racing games so keep this in mind when purchasing. overall I think this is a very good racing wheel for an affordable price however due to it not being able to work on forza 4 I had to send it back
3,Volant renvoyé essentiellement pour cause de l'excessive légèreté du pédalier tout plastique qui ne supporte pas l'action
4,Seit ein paar Wochen habe ich jetzt das Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Lenkrad im Einsatz und kann mit gutem Gewissen behaupten das es für den Einstieg und Gelegenheit's Spieler wie mich bestens geeignet ist.Das Design ist ansprechend und das Lenkrad ist meiner Meinung nach griffig und liegt gut in der Hand. Getestet habe ich das Racing Wheel mit dem Spiel F1 2019 welches wunderbar funktioniert.Die Installation gestaltet sich recht einfach man verbindet das Wheel mit den Pedalen und dann per USB mit der Box. Mit einer Tastenkombination kann man dann die Empfindlichkeit einstellen und loslegen.Leider braucht man hierfür eine gute Befestigungsmöglichkeit gerade für die Pedalen wenn man diese normal auf den Boden stellt wackeln die hin und her.Mein Fazit:• Einfache Installation per Plug-and-Play• Getestet mit einer Xbox One S funktioniert einwandfrei• Gute Verarbeitung für den niedrigen Preis• Leider benötigt man eine gute Befestigungsmöglichkeit um ungehindert zu spielen
4,Buona fattura i gommini della pedaliera scivolano sul pavimento liscio di legno. Risolto mettendoci sotto la retina antiscivolo per tappeti.
1,I was looking for wireless
5,About 9 months ago I bought it just as an "entry wheel" and then I was planning to upgrade to a new more expensive wheel with all the pro features.But I changed my mind! After 9 months of using the wheel at least 2-3 times every week I can clearly state that I don't need any other racing wheel this console generation.  The quality is great it's built to last it gives you a very nice simulation feel.I play only with the most hardcore settings in Project CARS it works really great with very high precision. Of course I miss having Force Feedback but it is not worth EUR 200 more for me personally.Side note (which perhaps is not fault of the manufacturer) is that it is not well supported in the Forza series especially in Forza 6 I actually had to cancel my pre-order of Forza 6 because after playing the demo I realized that the game is absolutely arcade and unresponsive using this wheel at least.I tested it with WRC 5 FIA World Rally Championship (works pretty good although not as good as in Project CARS) and with Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo (again works pretty good).  I expect a decent support with the upcoming Dirt Rally & Assetto Corsa as both feature a lot of customization options for the wheels (unlike Forza).Bottomline - even if you can afford a more expensive wheel consider getting this one it's absolutely well made and it might as well satisfy all your racing needs even if you're more than just a casual player.
1,Not working with amkette TV box
4,Volant très bien mais il faut vraiment avoir un siège + support pour jouer correctement. A intégrer au budget
4,I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews that I could have a nightmare trying to configure the wheel. The instructions really arent very good and I did end up watching a couple of youtube videos but once i figured it out it wasn't too bad. Once operational it works really well has a good feel and you don't really notice the lack of force feedback. I did however do something rather silly. A bolt comes with the unit which goes into the underside of the wheel base to clamp it down. The stand that I bought didn't need this to be used but to keep it safe I thought I would screw it in place. However i wound it in too far. I didn't know this but the wheel would not work properly. It would only turn in one direction and with some delay. I took the unit apart and realised that the bolt had gone in too far and dislodged the sensor inside which picks up the rotation of the wheel. I was then able to fix this and put it back together. Then worked perfectly.
4,Tutto ok forse la pedaliera poco stabile
3,Something missing but could not be bothered to send it back
2,Bon produit dans l’ensemble mais ne fonctionne pas du tout avec un ordinateur
3,Main issue we had was that as a Christmas present my son tried to set it up.  Found it to work except for steering.  A little look on these reviews plus the Forza and Thrustmaster sites we considered that the fixing bolt had interrupted the link between the potentiometer and the steering column (heavy handed child).  Took it to bits to find that to be the case.  Fortunately no real damage - and some work with the screws and 3-layer bracket holding it all in allowed us to repair it easily.  Once running we found that we could only steer to the right.  In this case however it was just the steering-wheel settings in the Forza game where 'A' had been incorrectly mapped on the Xbox One for left instead of 'LS'.  Unit is now up and running with a happy kid.  We'll see how long it lasts.
4,The Thrustmaster 458 Spider arrived within 48hrs.  I have to admit for the price it was worth every penny. I connected it to my xbox one & tried it with Forza Horizon 2 and Forza Motorsport 6. It worked flawlessly. The build quality is excellent. The clamp is adequate. The only caveat I have is that the pedals are really quite firm to push. Within a few minutes of using them my right thigh felt like it had had a good workout. Another issue is that due to the firmness of the pedals when depressed fully it tends to make the base raise & tip forward. It also tends to slip on the carpet. My son has size eleven feet & the base is just comfortably large enough for him. The one saving grace is that there are 2 bolt holes under the base allowing for it the be secured to a larger base. We're it not for the pedal problem I would have given 5 stars.
4,Wir haben das Lenkrad an der X-Box 360 angeschlossen. Es ist leicht anzuschließen es ist klein und kompakt und alles lässt sich sehr einfach bedienen. Man braucht nur eine stabile Möglichkeit es zu befestigen. Wir haben derzeit einen kleinen Golztisch müssen aber mal sehen wie wir es zukünftig befestigen da wir weniger Plarz haben und auf den Tisch verzichten müssen. Ansonsten sind wir sehr zufrieden mit der Funktionalität.
3,Naja kam kaputt an die eine Taste ging nicht richtig. Getestet haben wir trotzdem kurz bis wir gemerkt haben das die kaputt ist. Naja Pedale waren schrecklich richtig billig und habe es mir auch anderester vorgestellt vom Spaß faktor her. Haben es zurück geschickt durch den Defekt.
5,non mi è piaciuto il fatto di aver acquistato due articoli insieme che servono l'uno all'altro e il supporto arriva la settimana prossima anche se è prime mi sembrano troppo 10 giorni cosa lo.pago a fare prime? Non si può fare un regalo in due riprese un pezzo il 24 e l'altro pezzo a fine mese.
5,- Les bon cotés du volant : le produit est excellant  le volant est agréable avec une bonne prise en main  les pédales sont bien  elles ont l'air résistante malgré qu'elle glissent un peu ! Au niveau des touches rien à dire  les palettes pareil  il-y-à plusieurs sensibilités pour tout type de jeu !- Les mauvais cotés ( cela me concerne ) : Pour ma part le volant n'étais pas très réactif avec la sensibilité normal  je l'ai descendu mais là sur les virages secs ! la voiture ne se tournait vraiment pas assez  ensuit les pédales ne se connectaient pas très bien il fallait que je branche et que débranche puis que je rebranche pour que tout soit opérationnel ! Dés petit problème un peu chiant mais réparable ! Je suis tombė sur un produit défectueux mais le produit vaut largement le coût donc je vous le conseil.
5,Offert à Noël pour mon fils et il est ravi.Il l utilise sur la Xbox one s.Vraiment contente car produit de qualité.Merci
4,Also es ist gut... Es funktioniert prima! Aber es funktioniert leider nicht an allen Spielen.Hier sind die Spiele die ich ausprobiert habe. Funktioniert:Forza Horizon 4Forza Motorsport 7Need for speed heatneed for speed paybackSnowRunner. Funktioniert nicht: Burnout Paradise remasterdGTA5need for speed HOT PURSUIT remasterdNeed for Speedneed for speed rivals. ansonsten gut.
3,Das Lenkrad schaut nicht nur stylisch aus sondern ist auch gut zu fahren. Leider fehlt eine Beschreibung in D/E und die Anschlusskabel sind gefühlt etwas zu kurz und die Pedale sind nicht rutschfest.
5,Se configura solo en 3 minutos estaba instalado. Funciona perfectamente en xboxone. Se ve robusto y queda bien fijado.Buen volante para iniciación.Ahora jugando en xbox series S. Y sigue funcionando perfectamente.
4,J'ai décidé de mettre la note de 4 car tout d'abord le prix était raisonnable pour un volant d'occasion. J'ai décidé de l'offrir pour un anniversaire j'ai donc demandé au vendeur s'il pouvait faire plus vite au niveau de la commande. Aucune soucis pour cette partie car il m'a répondu dans l'heure qui suivait et le lendemain le colis partait en étant très aimable.  Autre point positif le volant était très très bien protégé je n'ai vraiment pas été dessus j'avais peur qu'il ne fonctionnait pas mais pour un produit d'occasion tout est fonctionnel. Seul point négatif le volant avait quelque trace d"usure ( normal vu que c'est d'occasion ) le carton était un peu explosé mais rien de grave.Pour conclure rien à redire très bon vendeur je recommande.
5,Brilliant obviously it doesn't have force feedback but for the price it's well worth it.  I have invested in a better wheel however this will make for a brilliant backup wheel.
5,I found the clamping system worked well. Using the wheel very smooth and comfortable to hold. There is a couple of millimetres of movement on the wheel where you're in game steering does nothing. Ideal for slow pace driving. Racing a bit more difficult. All in all I like it. Does what it's supposed to do.
5,I was a little dubious given the price and some previous comments but it's lockdown and I'm bored but reluctant to spend a lot of money on one of the fancy wheels available so went for this one.Very surprised that it's as good as it is for the money worked fine for me straight out of the box and makes racing games so much better. Given some of the other reviews I was expecting  it to be a hassle to set up but I had no issues with it at all simply pluged the pedals into the steering wheel wheel into Xbox and then switch on and away you go
4,Good
2,Bought this item as was told it was one of the best out there for gaming at first WOW then at times when braking or going into reverse it doesn’t work then it works then doesn’t tried using another port problem still occurs HELP
4,Il volante di per se è ottimo sia come costruzione che come funzionalità. Non do la quinta stella perché purtroppo non è compatibile con tutti i giochi di guida per Xbox One ma sono con alcuni cosa che non viene adeguatamente descritta.
4,Ottima qualità prezzo il prodotto è esattamente come descritto. Perfetto per chi è alle prime armi con videogiochi automobilistici (F1 Horizon) semplice da montare e smontare ( prestare solo attenzione al gancio che vincola al piano perché è plastica ).  Arrivato nei tempi corretti consigliato!!!
4,se desideri divertiti a livello amatoriale con questi soldi non credo si possa comprare meglio.certo se si vuole raggiungere livelli quasi da simulatore non è questo il prodotto ma non si spenderebbero 100 euro.per questi soldi  è un ottimo affare
3,J'aime ce volant le problème c'est que il n'est pas compatible PC je trouve pas ça logique et pas compatible sur tous les jeux Xbox one voiture ça serait bien de faire un pilote pour qu'il puisse est compatible PC
3,Bon volant pour débuter très bonne prise de main. Je l'ai essayé sur forza 6 et c'était très bien même addictif par moment. J'aurais pu donner 5 étoiles mais j'en ai donné 3 pour les raisons suivantes: 1) l'absence de retour de force et de vibrations oui ça fait vraiment défaut. On veut sentir les pistes de courses sentir le moindre impact le moindre souci…mais avec un petit budget on ne peut pas demander plus. 2) quelques petits bugs par moment la console ne détecte plus le volant pourtant bien connecté c'est dérangeant. Et enfin 3) la façon de régler la sensibilté du volant: un seul petit voyant qui clignote en fonction du niveau de sensibilité. Mais après on oublie vite ou on en était il fait recommencer la manipulation pour voir combien de fois clignote le voyant. Pas très commode.Sinon en général si on n'a pas un gros budget on peut se l'offrir en attendant d'économiser pour un plus cher avec retour de force. Il fait son job il procure du plaisir dans les courses beaucoup mieux q'une manette.Et pour finir un service impeccable d'amazon comme d'habitude le produir m'a été livré avec 1 jour en avance sur le délai de livraison il était bien emballé.
5,Un volante da gaming che per il prezzo che ha fa benissimo il suo dovere restituendo una sensazione e delle emozioni di guida eccezionali super consigliato.Anche la pedaliera molto reale con il feedback di durezza dei pedali
4,My 9 year old son bought this out of his birthday money and is not disappointed!The product feels like good quality and is very easy to connect to the xbox and to see up. It attaches easily to a table top however to get the best use a stand would be preferable however these are as if not more expensive than the wheel itself.As a controller it does what it should (makes it easier for me to use as I am usually hopeless at driving games)!No complaints so far but only had it for a week!
5,👍🏻
4,It is a great wheel to buy if it is your first racing wheel. Takes time to get used to it but once you improve it is a great experience. Don't feel bad if you are bad at the start getting used to it took me a couple of weeks that is all.
4,L'articolo è arrivato integro  prima della data prevista e risulta consona alle foto del venditore. Il gioco è molto bello . L'unica cosa è l'applicazione del volante sul tavolo tramite morsetto che non è proprio il massimo.
4,Il prodotto corrisponde alle caratteristiche tecniche della sua fascia di prezzo piazzandosi tra i migliori. Peró non forniscono un manuale esaustivo che indichi tasto per tasto le funzioni possibili
5,Facilissima installazione su Xbox One e prestazioni ottime per uno come me che non ne aveva mai provato uno. Assolutamente soddisfatto.
4,Buen volante pero sin compatibilidad con algunos juegos en pc
3,Description did not state this was second hand item. Another issue I have  the box was damaged and price- on the box is £55 and it was sold to me for £84.99. Gutted that it wasn’t checked by us before giving it as Christmas present. On top of this it was playing up at first but with YouTubes help it was reset and it is working fine now.
4,Perfecto para Xbox One y un uso normal el tacto agradable. En el Forza 7 y en el F1 2019 se disfruta.
1,Gets in the way off your desk.  Looks good but disappointing
5,Das lenkrad hab ich gestern erhalten und direkt ausprobiert.Es war natürlich auch sehr gut
4,Parfait pour utilisation loisir sur xbox one. Beau produit agréable. Prix raisonnable.Helas inutilisable sans le support adequat: il faut rajouter 100€. C aurait ete bien de le savoir ou d avoir un prix pour le kit. Pour autant aucun regret pour cet achat.
3,nicht zu empfehlen für pc.. :D
4,Le volant et de très bonne facture le grippe aux mains son dousagréable et performant le ressort spiroidal remet le volant bien en place et appose une résistance agréable je regrette juste l'absence de vibrations et de retour de force qui fait que l'on n'a pas de retour correct des informations du jeu  mais il fera très bien l'affaire pour des budgets limitées je lui mes que 4 étoiles à cause de ses défauts mais je ne regrette pas cet achat car ce volant et aussi compatible avec les jeux de simulation sur la xbox one contrairement au volant officiel de Microsoft
5,Also die negativen Rezensionen kann ich nicht so sehr verstehen aber naja. Ich habs jedenfalls bestellt und kam auch superschnell an. Bei mir hat auch alles funktioniert mit dem Lenkrad und so. Was ich auch sehr gut find ist das man es direkt out of the box verwenden kann. Ich benutze es übrigens mit der Xbox one s und es funktioniert super in Forza horizon 4 und 3. Alles in allem ein super Produkt
5,When I got this item it didn’t work so I contacted the company whoReplied quickly. They sent me somePictures and directions on how to fix the Steering wheel. It worked and I now have a happy child. Am thankfulFor the good communication these guys had with myself via email. Thank u
1,Je l'ai acheter pour jouer a euro truck simulator  et snow runner sur pc  malheureusement le volant ne propose aucune configuration sur ses jeu après plusieurs jours de recherche on m'apprend que le volant n'est tout simplement pas du tout compatible au jeu .Très déçu que l'on préviens pas avec quel jeu le volant est compatible dans la description j'ai du aller sur le site du constructeur et des forumsà éviter pour les joueurs PC
5,This is a well made and robust item that my grandson saved his pocket money for.The the product instructions that come with it are pretty rubbish but we found a lot of help on youtube.(Even those can be unnecessarily complicated though).This is pretty much a plug and play item that an 11yr old and 8yr old soon got to grips with navigating their own way through the controls and the game menus.If it is bought for somebody who has only just got their first console and is not fully familiar with the XBOX 1 controls it would be more complicated to navigate around game menus to begin with but for some who has been using one for a while it is a breeze.
1,Wir haben das Lenkrad unserem Sohn zu Weihnachten gekauft. Die Verbindung mit der X-Box hat problemlos geklappt und der Spielspaß war groß. Allerdings nur von kurzer Dauer. Nach bereits  zwei Wochen fing das Lenkrad an der Lenksäule an zu wackeln es ist nicht möglich das Lenkrad wieder festzuschrauben. Während dieser Zeit hat auch bereits das Gaspedal immer wieder heftig geknackt hört sich an als ob bald eine Feder bricht. Nach weiteren 2 Wochen begann sich nun auch noch die rote Gummiummantelung abzulösen. Auch wenn es ein günstiges Lenkrad ist nach 4 Wochen gebrauch kann das nicht sein.  Für mich unterste Qualität und nur ärgerlich. Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung. Inzwischen spielt er wieder mit dem Controller.
4,Great wheels. One of the few available for xbox out there.
3,Buon volante su project cars 2 si comporta bene e anche nei giochi di formula 1 ma... seriamente non è compatibile con il pc!? io ho preso questo qua e non il 458 italia perché pensavo che erano lo stesso volante ma soltanto che questo era compatibbile pure con xbox one ma non che era SOLO per xbox one!!
5,This came super quick even with the “virus” craziness going on!! Got as a b/day pressie for my Forza mad 11yr old...he loves it!! Many happy Xbox hours connecting with friends in these weird times Wheel needs to be mounted to a desk Works so easily plug in and go he done it all himself! Awesome but of kit...so much so his friend has now ordered one too!! 👍🏻
4,Una volta usato non ti stacchi più dal gioco. Al inizio mi sembrava troppo sensibile però dopo che ti abitui e eccezionale.
5,Sembrava non andasse.Ma trovandomi a casa il gioco forza 3 originale.ho istallato.e vi assicuro che va a meraviglia.✨✨✨✨✨ Ottimo acquisto.grazie.
5,Nn posso ancora valutare il prodotto posso solo dire x ora che è arrivato imballato con una cura indescrivibile.. ottimo
5,Responde y por el precio pa jugar aveces esta bien de momento no hay problemas
4,Die Produktlieferung war mittelmäßig bis schlecht wurde nicht an dem von Amazon angegebenen Termin geliefert.Das Produkt ist für den Preis ganz okay bis gut.Für Neueinsteiger meint mein Sohn ist es perfekt.Werden sehen wie lange das alles noch hält.
5,Great product as a first racing wheel. Good calibration and steers perfectly. The fit and finish is top notch. The buttons have tactile feel. Will last long. My son can't seem to get enough of it. The pedal console is sturdy. Response to throttle and brake pedal is perfect  and steering can be set at 4 levels of sensitivity. The setup and instructions manual on settings is detailed and helpful.Packaging received was good.Deliver was as promised.Thank you Amazon!
4,Great steering wheel for people new t driving sim games works well and does what you ask giving 4 stars as it came in both a battered box and one of the pedals rub/stick.
2,Da mein altes Fanatec Wheel nicht mehr mit der XBox One kompatibel ist musste langsam mal ein Ersatz her. Durch die völlig abgedrehte Preispolitik bei Fanatec kam ein solches für mich nicht mehr in Frage. Mad Catz und Logitech vielen für mich (bisher) auch durch das Raster weil auch teuer (und im falle des G920 teils venichtende Tests). Da dachte ich mir 9999€ kann man ja mal probieren.Für den geringen Preis kann man natürlich kein Leder bezogenes FFB Lankrad erwarten.Einsatzort bei mir ist ein Schreibtisch Eigenbau. Pedale sollten nur auf dem Boden stehen. Ohne extra Befestigung. Das ist dann auch das Problem...Pro:+Preis ok+obwohl nur Kunststoff und Gummilenkrad für 99€ wertige Habtik+Tasten und Schaltwippen ergonomisch verteilt+originelle Idee den "Engine Start" Knopf als Steuerkreuz auszulegen+Konfiguration unter Forza Motorsport 6 einfach+präzises Lenken möglichContra:Wenn ich den günstigen Preis berücksichtige nur einen. Aber der reicht um das Lenkrad zurück zu schicken.Die Pedale sind ein Witz. Viel zu leicht und die Typen bei Thrustmaster haben wohl beim Hebelgesetz in Physik geschlafen.Der Widerstand des Bremspedals ist so hoch das die Pedale nach vorne kippen. Beim Gaspedal ist der Effekt nicht ganz so extrem aber vorhanden. Das macht natürlich ein vernünftiges fahren unmöglich.Bastler die sich die Pedale irgendwohin schrauben können es ja mal testen.Aber ich denke wer sich einen Rennsitz baut/kauft oder einen Wheelstand besorgt bzw. sein Eigen nenntder wird eh auf ein Lenkrad mit FFB zurückgreifen?
2,Ho ricevuto il pacco in tempi rapidissimi ma ......... praticamente del tutto privo di materiale antiurto. La scatola è arrivata protetta da una semplice pellicola nera e una reggia di sicurezza per evitarne l'apertura. Purtroppo come si vede dalle immagini si è danneggiata parecchio ma per nostra fortuna non sembrano esserci stati danni al contenuto. Il volante è ben fatto e la pedaliera è regolabile anche se non ha delle ventose per bloccarla al pavimento ma basta un tappetino per evitarne lo scivolamento poiché i gommini presenti la bloccano a dovere. Nella confezione viene fornito un cavo usb abbastanza lungo per poter giocare con almeno un paio di metri di distanza dalla TV. Io ho utilizzato una prolunga USB per poter far giocare i miei figli più lontani. Il meccanismo di blocco è abbastanza robusto e non bisogna esagerare a serrare eccessivamente la vite poiché non serve.
4,Ho preso il volante per giocare a Forza 7 con mio figlio su XBox.Installazione immediata funziona anche da controller tutto ok.Ha bisogno di un supporto ovviamente ma per quello che ci è costato (una sessantina di euro) svolge il suo compito egregiamente.Unica pecca è che ancora non siamo riusciti a calibrare correttamente la sensibilità e quindi a piccoli angoli del volante il sistema reagisce con sterzature molto accentuate.Quindi è questione di abituarcisi ma per il resto tutto bene.Consegna puntuale come al solito
4,Argh je voulais un volant je suis un grand fan de simulation de course j'ai fait un championnat avec ce volant et puis il m'a bien suivi je regrette juste l'absence d'une prise casque et de la possibilité d'ajouter un levier de vitesse.par contre j'ai eu du mal à l'attacher à mon burreau comme ils sont plutôt fins j'ai dû ajouter des boites et tout ce qui me tombais sous la main pour essayer de compenser dommage. mais je ne vais pas en demander plus pour le prix
1,Etat satisfaisant mais problème ce n'est pas le bon câble donc inutilisable sur x box
4,Love the detail on the steering wheel itself. Driving with it is great just what I expected and more.The only letdown and the reason this is not a 5-star review is the pedals. Because they’re not weighed down enough pressing the pedals sometimes causes the whole thing to tilt backwards.
4,Sehr preiswertes lenkarad für Leute die heraus finden wollen ob Simulatior racing was für sie isPs funktioniert am pc noch besser als an der xbox
4,Livraison au top.Le papa est vraiment content de son cadeau et s'éclate bien avec son volent.A voir à long terme maintenant
2,Pedels base is too light to keep it steady steering is ok
3,Eins vorweg:  das ist kein Profi-Gamer-Teil aber kann durchaus Spaß machen.  Das Problem ist die Sitzumgebung die man sich selbst einrichten muss. Das Lenkrad an sich ist einfach und stabil an der Tischkante zu befestigen aber für die Pedalerie muss ich Abzüge geben. Das Plastikteil ist einfach zu leicht und die Gummifüsschen an der Unterseite können das Verrutschen bei Pedaldruck nicht verhindern schade.
5,Having never had a steering wheel before I thought I'd try this before splashing out for a higher model. I've only used it on Forza Horizon 2 so far but its brilliant! So much more engaging than the gamepad but it does have a learning curve to it.The wheel feels pretty solid and does rotate smoothly but as it uses "bungee cords" the first few degrees are very light getting heavier through its rotation. I use a wheelstand pro with mine so can't comment on the clamping system or the grip of the pedal base.Overall I am loving this wheel and my brother has now bought one too. Highly recommended!!
3,Gegenüber einem Controller  fühlt sich das Gerät um Lichtjahre besser an. Es macht Sinn wenn man etwas Spass an diesen Spielen hat weil es einfach sich besser anfühlt und auch bessere Ergebnisse bringt. Man braucht allerdings zwingend eine gute Befestigung. Vor allem für die Pedale. Ansonsten kann man es vergessen. Daher sollte man das einplanen und einen Wheel Stand gleich mit auf die Liste setzen.Das Gerät hat aber auch Grenzen. Das merkt man schnell wenn man den Vergleich zu anderen Produkten hat die aber auch locker mal das 3 bis 4 fache oder sogar das 10 fache kosten. Da liegen dann noch einmal Welten dazwischen. Aber für den Anfang ist es eine wirkliche Verbesserung. Irgendwann reicht es dann nicht mehr.
4,Buon prodotto per qualità prezzo. Unica pecca nn si possono attaccare le cuffie e nn c’è la vibrazione. Mi figlio 13 anni lo usa su F1 19 e si trova bene.
4,Acquistato a 48 euro pochi giorni fa mi è arrivato il pacco a casa senza nessuna scatola protettiva tipica di amazon e lo scatolo era anche un po rattoppato con pezzi di nastro adesivo.Inoltre alcune parti sembravano già essere state aperte. In pratica sono sicuro al 99 per cento di avere ricevuto un reso di un altra persona.In compenso sono contento di averlo pagato solo 48 euro.Per quanto riguarda il prodotto è davvero ben fatto per la fascia di prezzo dovete costruirvi una base per tenere fermi i pedali io l ho fatto con qualche tavola di legno.Oppure compratevi il kit del valore di 100 euro.
4,Good.Works as described
5,I have used this wheel and peddles a few times now and I find it a good set the wheel has nice resistance when you turn it and the peddles have good resistance when you push on them. No force feed back I don't care at this price the set is great value and much better than trying to use your pad to race with. I do not know if this setup will work with all race games but with mine it is vary good.In a nutshell I am vary happy with this setup. I use the ultimate racing wheel stand at £49.00 and they work great together.
4,molto bello e funzionante nipote entusiasta
2,The wheel is good for my 14 year old but he finds it difficult because there is not feedback. It looks great and works fine but I wish I had bought one with force feedback as it gives a better feel. Disapointed
5,A game changer for me. Can't believe I've been breaking my knuckles with a hand held controller for so long.  I play the Forza games & now controlling vehicles is fantastic much more fun & way more comfortable.Great product arrived on time well packaged...
5,I bought this for my son  and he love it I can definitely recommend.
3,Nicht für den PC oder Den Laptop!
5,Best bit of fun I've had in ages. Makes playing forza 7 much more entertaining. Well worth it's money 💰
5,Really pleased with this - its expensive but worth it... sturdy enough that it withstands my son’s vigorous play and he was so thrilled with it! Its added an extra dimension to his racing games.
4,Buon prodotto!!
1,Je suis très déçu  j’ai acheté cet article et pile un mois après son achat l’alimentation lache . Donc je n’ai pu renvoyer mon article à Amazon pour un échange donc je me suis tourné vers Thrusmaster qui ont un SAV fantôme donc je me retrouve avec un volant que je suis encore en train de payer car je l’ai pris en 4x sans frais et un enfant triste car son cadeau de noël ne fonctionne pas . En fouillant sur le net  on peut voir que c’est le défaut de ce volant . Bien sûr c’est un petit pourcentage donc dommage pour ceux comme moi qui sommes tombés sur les mauvais numéro de série . C’est dommage car c’est un bon volant.
5,Bene : arrivato nei tempi precisi e imballato perfettamente.Non benissimo: non funzionava e prima di rispedirlo o altro ho consultato vari siti per vedere se era un problema comune . Non avendo trovato nulla ho deciso di aprirlo e ho trovato il circuito corroso come se fosse entrata dell'acqua riparato da me e va.
3,Restituito perché non simulava realmente la reale sterzata nelle curve più strette non funzionava adatto a giochi come gran turismo ma non a giochi più professionali come f1
1,First the good; it looks great is responsive and really improved the experience of any driving game (normally F1-2020 and Forza Horizon).......when it worked....Now the bad; after 3 months without any previous degradation in performance the wheel developed a 'twitch' where it became unable to hold the car in a straight line. Online support did proffer some advice but this did not resolve the issue. Amazon to their credit were great and and replaced the wheel with no problems.The replacement worked fine for.....you've guessed it.....3 months when the same problem has arisen only this time I have returned the wheel for a refund rather than a replacement as this problem is too much of a coincidence to risk getting the same type of wheel again.
1,alors reçu aujourd'hui 1er test sur Assetto Corsa ( Xbox)..... J'avais peur au début suite à certains commentaires sur le non retour de force de ce produit. Mais il n'en est rien!!!!Meme sans retour de force comme le volant à un retour au point 0 c'est assez impressionnant.Juste une petite critique c'est bruit des palettes il est assez fort.... mais pour 100 euros ya pas mieux et je ne veux pas mettre 200 ou 300 balles dans un volant.Je recommande le produit qui pour 100 euros vous apportera une très bonne expérience.Edit du 15.01.2021Bon c'est sympa 5 minutes mais sans retour de force genre sur Dirt 2.0 ou F1 2020 c'est incontrôlable
4,Volante buono e di qualità l’unica pecca che non si gira a 360 gradi ma solo a 180 gradi.
5,My son absolutely loves this. It was so so simple to set up with his Xbox
5,Works very well with Xbox one
4,très bon volant pour le rapport le prix. acheter pour une utilisation sur forez motorsport 6 il fait des merveilles. seul le système de fixation n'est pas pratique et la longueur du cable n'est pas suffisant pour une utilisation dans un salon. je vous conseille vivement le système Universal pro driving simulator avec lequel les chronos pourront tomber
4,Arrivato  nei tempi  ed  Amazon  in  questo  sa'  il  fatto suo  il volente  e'  ben costruito ed  e'  compatibile  con  la  xOne.L'impugnatura  e'  comodissima  e  tutti  i pulsanti e  leve  sono  posizionate  nel  punto  giusto.  Si  puo'  settare  la sensibilità.  Unica  cosa  che e'  da modificare  e'  la  pedaliera  perche'  scivola  sul pavimento.
4,Great value for money obviously you can get better but they cost a lot more
4,This is a great piece of kit works very well and feels realistic only had 1 slight issue with the allignment of the bearing so now and then it veers to the left. Other than that this is a must have unless you want to pay extra £££
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Molto deluso da questo prodotto ora vi spiego il perché. Ho comprato il volante un anno fa e andava benissimo con tutti i giochi con tutte le macchine. Non aveva nessun problema nessun tipo di bug niente finché qualche settimana fa non inizia a fare degli microscatti verso sinistra quando ho il volante dritto (guarda il video). Purtroppo la cosa ancora più brutta è che non ha un sito/app per poterlo aggiornare o ripristinare su PC. Io ho provato in mille modi per provare di risolvere questa problematica ma niente se sapete qualcosa fatemi sapere. Mi dispiace veramente sono molto deluso. Grazie.
5,alles gut
5,bought this as a surprise for my son for achievements at school.he was over the moon it feels like your actualy in contact with the car and so responsive.paddle change gears are awsome just like the real thing.pedals are responsive and true to form. Robust and well constructed.great price and well worth purchasing.
4,Simple elegant weighty sturdy and easy to set-up and use. my only issue is that it doesn't work on both the PC and X-box one which are both products owned by the same company. worth the money if you only plan on using it for the X-box one
4,Son is very happy with this just some of the rubber popped out on the wheel and tapped it back in. Was going to contact the seller but my son didn't want to be without it after sending it back!
4,Got this for my sons birthday and he loves using it so does his dad the only downside is that we will either have to make something or buy something to put it on the stand is available to buy but is very expensive for what it is.
5,does what it is ment to do .... before you buy this NOTE the thurstmaster wheels do not have a mic imput ....yep no mic ...weird but you can get a PDF from their site explaning how to use your controller and headset with the wheel... very easy to do also ....  oh and the peddle box .. slipes slides and tilts you are going to need to secure it or wedge it rubber mat could help.....hope this helps happy racing see you all on forza 6 ...ManixApex Racing
4,Buona
3,Il prodotto è abbastanza valido come materiali anche se risulta poco sensibile e quindi non si adatta perfettamente si vari games.  Per certi versi può essere divertenti ma in altri casi risulta completamente inutile. Non si configura facilmente. Peccato
4,Ottimo. Davvero ben costruito e solido i pedali se messi alla distanza giusta non si muove quasi per niente molto bello esteticamente e anche funzionale anche con led che indica la sensibilità su 4 livelli molto utile per regolare lo sterzo carino anche il fatto di aver mimetizzato il per e il menu nei stati accensione e modalità del volante.Ottima anche la qualità prezzo stupendo poi se giocato su project cars o forza
5,Regalato ad un bambino per giocare con l'xBox One S a Forza Horizon 4. Arrivato perfetto per tempi imballo confezione e qualità. Facile da installare regala ore di divertimento.
4,Conforme alle aspettative
5,Parfait pour Xbox one aucun default
5,Moto molto bello materiali ottimi ottima risposta dei comandi. ottimo acquisto
2,HalloIch wollte in Forca 6 ein richtiges Renngefühl haben und hatte mir den Wheel Stand Pro V2 und diese Lenkrad bestellt.Leider finde ich es sehr unpräzise bei den Lenkrad Einschlägen. Bei ca. 45 Grad Lenkeinschlag macht er plötzlich einen Voll Einschlag des Lenkers im Spiel. Die Verzögerung hatte ich auch probiert einzustellen mit den 4 Tasten am Lenkrad und durchprobiert von 1 bis 4 mal blinken der weißen Lampe am Lenkrad. Am direktesten ist es bei 1 Mal blinken aber das hatte den Lenkeinschlag nicht verbessert.Dem Lenkrad fehlt auch das ForceFeedBack(Vibrationen) für mich gehört es dazu um ein Gefühl der Straße zu bekommen und ob man über die Randsteine/Bodenwellen fährt oder Gegner berührt.Trotz das ich mir  mühe gegeben mit den Einstellungen und auch einige Rennen gefahren bin komme ich mit diesem Lenkrad nicht zurecht.Hier nochmal die Zusammenfassung:- kein ForeFeedBack- Lenkeinschlag unpräzise
5,I liked the product it was in excellent condition delivery was fast and efficient
5,Volante per giocare con i giochi di auto per XBOX ONE ben fatto con paddle dietro il volante e pedali freno ed acceleratore su supporto. Facile da configurare si connette tramite cavo usb. Occorre trovare una base stabile per il volante e un modo di fermare il modulo freno/acceleratore. Consigliato per i neofiti
4,Ok
4,Arrivato prima del previsto buon acquisto
4,It is a good steering wheel but I must admit I should have bought the forced feedback optioned wheel.If you are on a budget or it's just for the kids well worth the money.
5,I have used many wheels in the last 20 years and the best was my TSW but this wheel is very nice it worked with my X Box 1 games like I F1 and NASCAR so I will buy another one when this one where’s out — for the price you can’t go wrong
4,conforme au descriptif mon fils de 11 ans adore
1,Venía en una caja todo suelto sin instrucciones y sin ni siquiera los cables recogidos. La goma roja del volante despegada. Lo he devuelto.
2,Reçu hier  et surprise les pédales ne fonctionnent pas  le volant oui très bien mais le but 3st d avoir les pédales...
1,While the Thrustmaster Steering wheel is one of the better ones I have tried it is either poorly made or very fragile.I've had two now. The first broke after two weeks of reasonably light use and no abuse whatsoever; I'd even forked out for a folding stand to make sure the steering wheel was not unduly stressed. The fault was with the wheel only. All of the buttons and the pedals worked exactly as they should.Amazon swapped this one out quickly but the replacement has lasted only 3 months and now the wheel does not function properly when turning right. Everything else is ok.Now however I can't return the item for repair or exchange. Nor can I get in touch with the seller because (and maybe this is me) I can't find any method of contacting them! Very disappointing because when it's working it's very good.
4,A little difficulty setting it up but once got over that found it to be very good my son who this was purchased for thinks it is fantastic and that's what matters
3,Its well made and looks the part but is too sensitive for me. you can't grab it and use like a steering wheel because slight movements are needed just using finger and thumb to rock the wheel. Being old I probably expected too much but I think there's a really enjoyable product here if there was an accessory to slow it a bit. Love the foot peddles that come with it.
5,I’ve waited a while to see how it went.Can’t fault it.It’s used daily by our boy and when I’m home I get to nick it for a while.Control set up is easy it’s robust and does what’s required
4,The elastic band inside the wheel Broke after about 4 month but it was good while it lasted. Ive now upgraded to the thrustmaster TMX and have no problems.
5,Tres bon volant maniable bonne qualité
5,the wheel lacks force feedback and it is broken already after 2 months of use
5,Used the wheel for 3+ years without an issue at all work perfectly and how you expect however before purchase make sure you know there is no force feedback which was the mistake I made but it’s not the companies fault so I can’t mark them down for it as they never said they have it anyways so besides that it’s perfect
4,Macht Spaß und funzt einwandfrei..
4,inutile je sais tout ...
4,In Forza the gear change is the wrong way around and sadly it lacks force feed back apart from that it does the job and make racing easier than using a controller.
5,Perfecto estado
3,This steering wheel isn’t compatible with gta on Xbox. Apart from that it works fine with fall horizon
5,Très satisfait
3,Volant moyen le pédalier est vraiment très léger les pédales sont dure pas de vibrations  ça fait un peu cher .
3,Non mi aspettavo chissà che cosa per la cifra investita difatti è stato così. Il volante l ho trovato anche di buona qualità la pedaliera molto meno un plasticone.
3,Non proprio convinto a quel prezzo mi aspettavo un prodotto con una qualità migliore sia nei tasti (menù a b x e y)Per quanto riguarda la sensibilità in curva non mi ha impressionato. Questo volante non ha un motore interno che lo muova se la macchina prende un cordolo.
4,Me ha gustado por precio I calidad
4,Only complaint is how it arrived. HERMES dropped it over my back gate and left it out in the rain all day while I was at work. Luckily it still works
5,I am very happy with this wheel! I've been trying to justify spending £265 on the TX but this more than does a good job! I am sure the tx is better with force feedback etc! But it's too expensive.This wheel works really well with F1 2015 the pedals have a great feel and it's the first time I've been able to take the traction control off F1 2015!Worth trying out.
2,Nach etwa 4h Forza Horzion 4 ist eine Seite der Lenkung ausgeschlagen. Man kann bei leichten schütteln hören das sich etwas gelöst hat. Das Gerät lässt sich aber wegen Schraubendummys nicht öffnen um den Defekt zu beheben. Also geht es wieder zurück und ich werde mir ein anderes Lenkrad kaufen. Dieses mal werde ich aber wohl etwas mehr investieren in der Hoffnung das die Qualität besser ist.Wer billig kauft zweimal.
4,A good entry level wheel for the Xbox one but with no force feedback it feels like something is missing but for the price a good purchase for the casual driving gamer.
5,Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis sehr gute Qualität TM versteht eben was wir Zocker wollen. Die Zauberformel lautet: Ein relativ preisgünstiges aber qualitativ überzeugendes Racing Wheel halt das auch einwandfrei auf der X1 funktioniert ! Project Cars lässt sich damit wunderbar und sehr präzise spielen ohne "Deadzones" oder diesen "2 cm Lenkverspätung" Quatsch stimmt nicht! Daher absolute Kaufempfehlung (mag sowieso kein FF) bin daher sehr zufrieden. Das Kabel ist sehr kurz aber was soll's ich klebe ja fast am Bildschirm beim zocken... Werde noch Forza 5 und Forza Horizon 2 damit testen. Warte ungeduldig auf Forza 6.  Kauft es euch einfach ihr könnt nichts falsch machen
4,der Lenkkranz wackelt immer mehr. Am Anfang sehr schön und realitätsnah. Aber nach 2 Wochen (oft benutzt) fing der Lenkkranz an zu wackeln. Nicht arg aber merkbar im Nicht-Benutz. Nun wurde dies stärker aber beim spielen stört es nicht.PS: Die Schrauben am Lenkrad können nicht nachgezogen werden.
4,Good product with solid feedback from the wheel just attach to a solid table for driving fun.
4,... leider gibt es ein paar Minuspunkte. Ich habe es mir für Forza 6 gekauft und bin im Großen & Ganzen beeindruckt. Aber wenn man um Kurven fährt darf man nur leicht lenken sonst fährt das Auto weiter geradeaus (was sehr schade ist). Bremse & Gas werden sehr gut angenommen. Qualität = 1. Hier kann ich nur über die Lenkung meckern.
5,No habíamos caído en que hacer falta apoyar el volante en una mesa o en algún saliente.
4,got this wheel this morning hook it up 2 f1 2015 in seconds and love it.only cost 60 rips.bosshogg.now got the thrustmaster tx with the ferraia f1 wheel and its alots better.
4,Also all' die Horrormärchen dass die Präzision nachlässt dass irgend wann die XBox nicht mehr mit dem Lenkrad spricht und andere Geschichten kann ich nicht bestätigen. Auch die Qualität ist nicht so schlecht wie beschrieben. Gut ist halt alles Hartplastik. Und das eigentliche Lenkrad hat sogar eine eher wertige Haptik. Alles in allem ein fairer Preis für ein echt gutes Einstiegs-Lenkrad.
5,super produit facile à installer et belle érgonomie
5,My grandson thinks it's fantastic
5,Ich denke ich muss nun mal eine Bewertung abgeben da ich sehr im positiven überrascht wurde.Ich habe es gebraucht bei Amazon gekauft für knapp 65€. Der Karton sah schlimm aus und ich hatte schlimme Befürchtungen.Ausgepackt angeschlossen eingestellt wie in der Anleitung beschrieben (sehr wichtig!) um Forza 6 zu spielen und ich war hellauf begeistert!Super Fahrgefühl auch ohne FF. sehr präzise. Ich wollte es testen und ich hatte schon geplant es dann schnell gegen eine Lenkrad um die 300€ auszutauschen werde ich aber nicht machen ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Gerät und empfehle jedem nicht Profi es zumindest zu testen.Viel Spaß damit
5,Excellent wheel does what it says. Early days yet but so far so good 👍used it much more now and it is great. You need to adjust the sensitivity which  is easy otherwise it over steers. But it's great quality for the price and I am beating my fastest laps set without it. Very happy with it 👍.
4,Excellent purchase but son has got a different desk now so not sure how to attach it to that !
5,Amazon n1 nel settore della spedizione 1 settimana prima arriva il pacco. Imballaggio ben fatto con ben 2 scatoli + scatolo del volante. Sono ben fatti bisogna vedere col tempo.
4,Bevor ihr diesen Artikel kauft schaut welche Rennspiele ihr habt und gleicht diese mit der auf der Herstellerseite aufgelisteten unterstützen Spiele ab.Es ist ohne GForce das war uns klar. GForce erhöht bestimmt den Spassfaktor kostet aber eben auch viel mehr.Uns reicht es.Das Lenkrad ist stabil griffig und wertig.Den Punktabzug nur wg. den Kopmatibilitätsengpässen sonst immer wieder.
5,Very good product
1,Well i only bought this wheel a month ago and have missed the returns date by a few days but the wheel has developed a fault where it pulls to the left ever so slighty on its own. I thought i was imaging this to begin with until i tried to recalibrate it in the game settings and you could see the numbers changing on the wheel settings as if it was been turned. Tried it in forza and this was even worse! where you can turn the wheel to navigate through the menus and the wheel would shoot through to the left on its own! I have seen something similar on the xbox joypads where they get stuck in one direction. Really dissapointed with this product and how short lived it has been.
5,Supercontenta!! Se agarra muy bien a la mesa de escritorio. Los niños contentos...
5,Love this steering wheel only downside is no force feedback but knew that before buying.Word of advice adjust "deadzone" settings on games as you don't want a deadzone on this wheel in the middle! Search for game advice online to help adjust to the right levels (made a world of difference on Forza!!)
4,Volante molto valido e ben rifinito.Unica pecca è che manca la vibrazione ma per il resto fa decentemente il suo lavoro.Il livello è di fascia media e vale il prezzo pagatoImballo ben curato.
5,Troppo bello e funziona bene
5,Bien mais manque de poids sur le pédalier il bascule.
1,Item returned on the 31jan still no update or refund
4,Responsive and feels good. Throttle response good but brake could do with more resistance to pressure.  Sensitivity adjustment very necessary for Forza
5,By far and away the best wheel I have ever bought. I didn't want to pay the megabucks for a force feedback wheel so this looked the best option. And it is. It feels really sturdy - and when attached to the WheelStand Pro it adds hundreds of percent to the enjoyment of all driving games. Absolutely recommend
4,Verarbeitet und Haptik gut. Befestigungsmöglichkeit für Lenkrad Verbesserungsfähig.Für Forzza eine völlig neue “Erfahrungen“. Verbindung mit xbox one ohne Probleme.
5,You don't need built in rumble feedback to enjoy driving games with this. Its a fantastic high responsive good quality and sturdy wheel. Its perfect for your first time having one. I use it for both Project cars and Forza 6 but I don't recommend using it with Forza Horizion 2. Stick with the controller for this game but some might disagree.
5,mio figlio è stato contentissimo di ricevere il volante ferrari lo usa tantissimo
4,Ottimo acquisto... Peccato manchi la vibrazione al volante...
4,Molto sensibile ai comandi e di buona fattura.  Buon rapporto prezzo/qualità.
5,après paramétrages fonctionne parfaitement sur XBOXone
4,No es muy centrado y no responde bien
2,Grandson bored easily of it.
5,Bought for my son oft santa he absolutely loves it  easy to set up and handle.
4,Preso in offerta come prima esperienza con il volante e' buono 3 livelli di sensibilita il cambio con le levette e' veloce ma segnalo anch io il fatto che la pedaliera scivola ma tutto sommato son problemini risolvibili
5,das erste war für unseren Sohn und jetzt für unsere Tochter.nach ein paar Monaten intensivem spielen erkannt man noch keine Ermüdung des Materials.auch ist bisher noch kein Lenkungsspiel vorhanden
5,10/10 Great build quality
4,You can't get a reliable steering wheel controller at this price. This has changed my way of looking at racing games. Must buy if you njoy racing game.
5,Keeps my son smiling for hours after his home work is done
5,Great for kids. No force feedback but good for Dirt Rally etc. Smooth tracking and v responsive. Recommended
4,Ich muss sagen für den Preis echt unschlagbar.4 Sterne da natürlich noch Luft nach oben ist.Aber für Anfänger genau das richtige.Man muss sich erstmal damit rein spielen.Aber wenn man wie ich bei forza horison 2 mit dem Lenkrad zockt macht es mega laune.
2,ho comprato questo volante principalmente per il prezzo abbordabile. i feedback positivi lasciati mi lasciavano ben sperare...secondo me l'assenza del force feedback e l'angolo di sterzata veramente limitato riducono notevolmente l'esperienza di gioco. per non parlare dei pedali che sono durissimi!!!! neanche il pedale di una macchina senza servofreno è cosi duro da azionare. testato su forza 6. anche riducendo la sensibilità al minimo la guida rimane sempre MOLTO nervosa visto l'esiguo angolo di sterzo disponibile. il mio vecchio volante x la 360 della microsoft era di molto superiore!!! rinscatolato subito e rispedito ad amazon! nella speranza che scendano un pò di prezzo i volanti di gamma superiore. sconsiglio assolutamente l'acquisto di questo volante se vi volete divertire davvero.... il force feedback è un elemento chiave nel trasmettere quello che fa l'auto....senza non ha veramente senso!!! non puo essere sostituito da un elastico!
4,may be abit over priced...used it twice and could only sell it for less then half the price
3,the product is really good the only bad thing I have is you need to keep your hand on the steering wheel so the whole thing don't move .. So you will have to get a clamp or something to keep it still
3,great product  shame it is  xbox only  and NOT pc compatable . if it was pc compatable it would get 5 stars
4,forza6をドリフトで使用した時の感じでは多少練習すればそれなりにできるようになると思います。ただ、リプレイで観たときの前輪のカクカクした感じはコントローラーを使用した時と同じ見た目になってしまいます。（２００°位の回転角なので）それでも、コントローラー使用時よりは全然雰囲気は楽しめると思います。普段はＧ２７を使用してますが箱１では使えなくてコンバーターを使ってもやってみましたが正直コンバーターをつかってＧ２７を使うよりは全然こちらの商品のほうが使いやすかったです。とにかく全体的に安っぽさはごまかし切れず特にハンドルの戻りなどは正にゴムを使ってますと言わんばかりにボヨヨ～ンって感じです。しかし４段階で設定できる感度やゲーム内の調整でそこそこ使えるようになったのは意外な誤算でした。現状箱１で使えるハンコンはｐｃとの互換性を考慮するとTHRUSTMASTER TX Racing Wheelが一番だと思いますがｐｃとの互換性はありませんが予算的に厳しいかなぁ～という方などはぜひこちらの商品を使ってみてはいかがでしょうか。
5,volant conforme à la description. bon rapport qualité prix pour un usage amateur. Mon fils de 15 ans apprécie.
5,Das Tretpedal wurde sofort wieder ersetzt
2,Good wheel for the first few weeks or so but after about a week I noticed problems with the wheel itself moving around on the thread. Up until now it's been getting worse and today it has just started creaking whenever I turn the wheel left. Too annoying and distracting to be ignored. If it's a wheel to stand in for a new one for a while until your £300 one arrives its perfect. Otherwise there must be more durable options elsewhere.
4,Perfect in every way... except for one thing: no "rumble".  This is my only grumble!
3,Great for first 6 months of having it but after that whenever I turned left by a millimetre on forza the man was turning it 90"!! I have to waste my money for a new one.
5,Appena arrivato sembra ottino e molto bello spero che sia veramnte buono di qualita anche se non ha il force feedback non è male da girare ho fatto una piccola prova...per i prinicpianti è il migliore soprattutto per rapporto qualità/prezzo
1,Didn't even work was supposed to be from Santa 😔
4,Volante di buona qualità dei materiali e dalle dimensioni di diametro ottimali. Facile da installare. Pecca nella mancanza di vibrazione.Venditore serio consigliato. Consegna avvenuta anche prima del previsto. Imballo ottimo. Consigliato
4,Très content du produit livré.
1,This item is terrible not only did I have to return this twice the first one didn’t work and the second one doesn’t steer in a strait line even if I’m not holding it
5,Bought for my son's birthday. He loves it. Very sensitive on first use but it can be turned down.
4,prodotto valido per il costo
3,È perfetto ma non mi sembra molto funzionale. Si muove troppo lo sterzo e i pedali
5,Siehr super toll aus funktionier sehr gut
1,my son was so happy to get this 4 his birthday...but unfortunately after using it a few times the wheel becomes loose and the calibration needs resetting.. when you drive it pulls to the left going all twitchy and basically making f1 awful to play and that's the only game he bought the wheel for.do yourself a favour save the extra money and get the logitech 920 cos this was a waste of money in my opinion...
4,Très bon volant malgré qu'il ne fonctionnait pas la première fois je l'ai remplacé sinon installation compliquée et notice largement incomplète. Sinon le volant est très bon.
5,Amazing product. Realistic steering and acceleration.
5,Does what it says on the tin no complaints here
2,There are four settings and even on the 'slowest response' time it is far too sensitive which causes you to 'snake' along whilst driving invariably leading to crashing.  Its a real shame as the actual build and grip of this wheel is first class.  But when you barely turn the wheel just one or two degrees the car turns too much.  There must be more settings available or may have to look for another wheel.
3,La resa del prodotto rispecchia pienamente il prezzo. E' un volante che limita un po' le esperienze di gioco non essendo dotato di force feedback o vibrazione. La pedaliera non resta salda a terra ma tende a spostarsi soprattutto spingendo il volante del freno. Buoni i materiali: la gomma del volante offre un buon grip e le levette del cambio in metallo danno una buona sensazione. Pienamente consigliato se si vuole spendere poco e non si pretende troppo.
5,Easy to set up on Xbox essentially plug and play. The desk attachment is secure and robust. Our son loves it uses it on Forza Horizon 4 and highly recommends.
5,Un très bon volant pour s'amuser avec des jeux de voitures. Le câble est un peu court.
5,Ottima qualità dei materiali. Ben strutturato penso in futuro acquisterò però il supporto predisposto. Conforme alla descrizione.
4,Das Lenkrad ist gut. Was mir nicht so gut gefällt ist das man es nur an der Xbox One betreiben kann. Da es in unserem Haushalt mehrere Konsolen gibt schade.
5,Ottimo
5,Consegna come di consueto eccellente. Il prodotto è conforme a quanto descritto. Però non sono in grado di dare dati sull'aspetto tecnico perché è stato un regalo per mio nipote ma dev'essere un buon prodotto perché da quando lo ha ricevuto non si è mai lamentato
5,Very nice product
5,Very good quality but would be good if they removed the short xbox extension & make the whole wire into 1 peice
4,My boy loves this and very rapid delivery
4,Do 4 stelle perchè pagato solo 48 euro i materiali usati sono principalmente plastica a vista non sembrano molto resistenti altra pecca manca del force feedback e si sente molto questa mancanza ma per il prezzo che ha è solo da consigliare se non si vuol spendere più di 200 euro
4,Man kann mit dem Lenkead sehr gut fahrenich spiele damit F1 2017 und damit geht es super. Kann ich nur emgfehlen!!
5,Teamed up with an X-Box Forza Horizon and an enthusiastic daughter. A lot fewer excursions into the hedge and a lot of fun.
4,初めてのハンコンです。他社との比較はできませんが、あまりキツく回すと壊れそうで豪快には使えません。こだわらなければこれで十分だと思います。あと、同じような内容のボタンが多いのでこんなにいらないかなと。
1,Bellino ma ho avuto un mucchio di problemi. Non sono riuscito a programmare i tasti come il controller originale di Xbox one; contattata l’ assistenza che ha risposto sollecita il problema non è stato risolto. Mi hanno chiesto di fare un video su un test della Microsoft che probabile debba essere scaricato su un pc che non ho e che non è disponibile ne sul sito Microsoft ne sullo store della Xbox one. A questo punto che ci faccio?
2,Prodotto perfetto ma a dispetto di quello che ho letto in alcune domande/risposte non è assolutamente compatibile per pc. Mi vedo costretta a fare il reso..
5,L'ho comprato per il compleanno di mio nipote che è stato felicissimo. altro non saprei dire perchè io non gioco con la x box ma sono contenta che sia stato un regalo molto gradito e che abbia giocato tutto il pomeriggio con i suoi amici
5,Good starter wheel had no problems with it
2,I know the product from a previous purchase and we thought to give it a second chance. Unfortunately the seller couldn't fulfill the order. But also reminded me the product itself seems to be relying on an elastic chord with a limited time span.
5,Quick delivery. Good quality wheel for the price. Easily fitted to the desk
5,My 11 year old son loves it!
3,Preso dopo tanti anni di giochi d'auto senza volante. Esteticamente bellissimo la qualità dei materiali sembra buona. Purtroppo la pedaliera risulta quasi inutilizzabile perchè non rimane ferma per terra errore mio non pensarci prima di prenotarlo. Ma comunque a questo prezzo non credo si trovi di meglio.
4,Descripton of the use and function of the buttons would help.Control excellant.
5,Good product
1,Produit de qualité mais non compatible pc
3,Il volante Thrustmaster 458 Spider seppure di materiali di buona qualità non l'ho trovato adeguato per il prezzo pagato. Infatti la sensazione di guida con la mancanza della vibrazione e l'eccessivo gioco del volante non offrono un'esperienza di guida completa.
3,El volante da vueltas sin control. No te da sensación de realismo
1,Connecting the whole console was all easy and good. Unfortunately when using this console for my Forza Horizon 3 game the steering wheel didn't collaborate only the braking and gas system. I am not sure why this has happened maybe due to an update or something non compatible with this version of the game hopefully somebody can fix this problem amongst some users some time in the future.
5,Tutto ok
4,Good wheel for gaming my 13 yr old enjoys it
4,Articolo molto bello e funzionale....funziona perfettamente con forza horizon di xbox one..... unica pecca il bullone..... la plastica è debole e si rompe facilmente..... per altro perfetto!
5,Arrived ahead of schedule and was easy to install my 14 year old did it before I had chance to help him!
2,Average wheel. Cheap and cheerful. Obviously no force feedback. Broke within a couple of months. Steering calibration went out of sync and no matter how many settings I played with couldn't get it back to normal. Every race it steered to the right on any game. Infuriating. Binned it and bought a different branded wheel with force feedback
4,Buon articolo con una qualità prezzo ottima non ha niente da invidiare agli articoli con prezzi anche 5 volte maggiori. Regalato a mio figlio per x box e chi gioca molto anche con il padre.Soddisfatta.
5,Bello e rifinito bene facile e divertente guidare qualità prezzo buono consiglio
4,Very easy to use wheel great for for beginners
4,happy good price
5,piaciuto e collaborazione perfetta
4,so far so good takes some getting used to
3,Kein gutes Lenkrad da spiele ich lieber mit meinem Controller.
4,Ottimo prodotto per un volante con qualità entry level va benissimo non avrà le prestazioni di quelli di categoria superiore ma comunque si difende... Ottimo prodotto tutto funzionante.
5,Fantastic product easy to set up instantly. Stand great too if you order separate.
5,Molto belloLo uso per forza e ha la giusta sensibilitàMa non mi piace il ritorno al centro del volante oscilla troppoE anche la spedizione immediata nonostante il coronavirus
2,After the initial pleasure with this gift my 11 year old son is so upset that his Xmas gift broke today. The Xbox 360 version broke the first time he used but fortunately we were able to exchange it. Too much time has passed for this one so £70 down the drain.
4,Très bon volantbelle couleurpratique mais il manque les vibrations et les retours de forcesmais je le conseil car très bonne calité pour pas chère !
1,Ordered a used ‘like new’ one and it didn’t work. The steering wheel sounds work. It turned but not steer in the game
5,Sehr gut
5,Super
4,bon produit correspond exactement à mon attente descriptif de l'annonce respectè à conseller à un eventuel acheteur à fixer sur une table
4,My sons happy with it!
5,Mi son convinto all'acquisto grazie al basso costo e alle recensioni positive pur avendo avuto una brutta esperienza con un  accessorio analogo in passato ma devo dire che é fantastico si guadagna una sensibilità eccezionale sia di sterzo che di gas/freno in confronto al gamepad; veramente un alto pianeta e personalmente non mi importa l'assenza del force feedback. Consigliatissimo per chi vuole provare l'esperienza volante e non vuole donare un rene per prenderlo. La sensibilità minima con forza6 é perfetta!
5,Excellent product bit expensive but worth IT. JJ
4,fidandomi di Amazon ho acquistato questo volante per pc ma scoprendo in seguito che è solo per l'xbox one quindi posso solo dire che ha dei bei materiali e non fa molto rumore grazie al assenza del force feedback
3,Das Lenkrad ist für den angegebenen Preis wie erwartet. Mit leichten Aussetzern ab und an dennoch ein Spaß für geringes Geld.
5,Great wheel. Looking feels like iam driving a real car
5,I mounted this to the Wheel Stand Pro V2 to play F1 on my XBOX ONE - Absolutely love it!Wheel is very responsive feels great and the pedals are fantastic!
5,Bin sehr zufrieden
5,Bon volant il revient au milieu (sans retour de force ni système de vibration)la pince fourni m'a permis de le pincer sur la platine d'épaisseur 3 mm de mon simulateur.
5,this steering wheel and pedals have a nice feel of quality to them. Well built. Nice sized steering wheel. Easy to use. Great for Forza. My son loves it. Highly recommended.
5,8 year old Grandson very happy with this birthday present
5,Tutto ok
5,Better than I had expected for the price. Very responsive with 4 settings to adjust the response time. Good looking and feel to the steering wheel. Complete with a strong gas and foot brake.
5,Qualität und Abwicklung ok!
1,
2,articolo restituito..non perfetto nei movimenti...consigliato forse per dei bambini piccoli senza pretese ma non per ragazzi e adulti...i movimenti dello sterzo non sono precisi e spesso non si riesce a giocare come si vorrebbe
5,Volante comprato per un amico e provato insieme molto bello buone le finiture ottimo feeling di guida e soprattutto prezzo veramente competitivo. Per giocatori occasionali direi che è un acquisto ottimo L'unica pecca l'obbligo di essere attaccato per forza ad una base di appoggio in quanto la sua superficie inferiore non è piatta e non permette di essere appoggiato semplicemente su un tavolo. Consiglio di abbinare uno stand di guida.
1,Started off Great on my Xbox but after a couple of months of use it developed a twitch so no longer useable I’m contemplating a Logitech wheel just need to find out if they last longer than thrustmaster
5,Excellent
4,Good for the price but if you can go for a wheel with force-feedback.
2,Pensavo decisamente meglio. Con Forza 5 è praticamente ingestibile in ogni impostazione; non mi aspettavo prestazioni uguali ad uno da 300 euro o più ma oltre 86 euro sono una rapina. Ne avevo uno di anni per Xbox 360 (non Thrustmaster) che oltre a costare la metà era migliore alla grande. Peccato...Amazon pur con Prime ha consegnato primama non certo nei tempi adeguati a Prime cioè 1-2 gg ma molti di più; inoltre è arrivato senza imballo adeguato (scatola originale e non impacchettata) senza sigilli e leggermente ammaccata; chiunque poteva prelevare qualcosa senza farsi accorgere da chi ritira. Mi spiace ma da quando pago Prime il servizio è peggiorato non lo pensavo da Amazon....
1,Dopo un mese non funziona il pedale. E vabbe ripariamolo. Poi non funziona più' il gancio. E vabbe ripari amo lo. Mo non funzionano ne i pedali ne il gancio. Che cosa dovrei fare? Io non riparo più' niente. poi ha poco angolo di sterzo e non ha il force feedback
1,Bought this product for my sons birthday in August 2019 - he has played on it for a handful of times since and it has now broken no idea why it just will not work at all and I am unable to return this product as the "return window" closed on 4th September! That is not acceptable this product should last more than a few uses at nearly £100! Very disappointing.
5,Very good brought for sons birthday. For his xbox one. Super quick delivery and great customer care and amazing detail.. would recommend this to anyone who loves the racing simulation.
4,Nearly perfect there is no headphone socket for this.
5,Was a Christmas present for our teenage son who loves it.  Arrived in good time and was well packaged with no identification of contents as requested. Was competitively priced too.
1,Zuerst hat dieses Lenkrad gut funktioniert und nach 5 Monaten zuckt es nur noch. Man findet nichts wo man sich dran wenden kann damit es ausgetauscht wird. Sehr schlecht und ärgerlich.
4,A very good accessory. Very pleased with it.
5,Mein Enkel ist hell auf begeistert
1,pas de retour de force actif volant tout petit si on aime les sensations de conduite je conseil le t150 ou le TMX. je renvoyé immédiatement
5,👍🏻
5,My soon love it. It's very good quality
5,Doveva essere per PC... Era solo per xbox
1,Ich hatte das Lenkrad März 2015 gekauft und hatte anfangs keine probleme außer das die Bremse ziemlich schwer zu bedienen war so das die Pedale gerne mal vorne abgehoben ist da zu wenig Gewicht. Nach ca 3 Monaten war es dann soweit Lenkrad hat sich leicht nach rechts verzogen kurz darauf ist irgendwas an der Gas Pedale gebrochen da dachte ich mir dann bevor ich es zurück schicke ladet es im Müll so schlecht verarbeites habe ich noch nie bei Thrustmaster gesehen.Nun besitze ich das Thrustmaster Lenkrad Bundle TX Servo Base inkl.Pedalset und GT Wheel Add-On und bin zufrieden was ich auch nur jeden ans Herz legen kann.
5,Very simple purchase arrived when told it would arrive. We bought it for our grandsons birthday and he loves it.
1,Absolute GarbageNot worth £5The steering is completely broken all pedals work but no reaction to movement on wheel attempted on multiple games certainly not worth anything. Instructions are next to useless never buying from this company again demanding full refund
4,A perfect tool to go with F12015
5,X BOX ONEのレースゲームをプレイする為購入しました。ハンドル…見た目の美しいだけではなくハンドルが握りやすい形状で気に入っていますボタン…ほとんどの操作がレーシングホイールのみで行えるのでゲームに集中でき、満足しています。まとめると見た目は写真そのままで使いやすいが値段相応の安さは滲み出ている。ドライビング操作はステアリングは片方120度でゲームを楽しむことはできるしペダルも重く踏みごたえがあるが勿論FFBはない(PS対応のハンコンで言うとT80ステアリングで、ステアリング径だけがDFGTくらいに大きくなった感じ。実車ほどではないがそこそこにハンドルが大きいのでそこまで不満が出ないとは思うがFFBがない物足りなさはある)ある程度しっかりとはしているが、それは値段相応の話なので質感や操作感を期待してはいけない。詳しく書きます…ゲーム内で(Forza Horizon 3)運転してみると、舵角はやはり240度まで(左右120度まで)。アーケードのレースゲームなどをプレイしている方には馴染み深い(？)かと思います。ハンドルを持ち替える機会はありませんが、ゲーム自体は不満なく行えるはずです。このレーシングホイールはフォースフィードバック(FFB)がついていないのでゲーム内で段差に乗り上げようが雨の日にタイヤがスリップしようがハンドルに振動などが伝わることはありません。ハンドルを切り、手を離すとハンドルが元の位置に戻る、というシンプルなものとなっています。もちろんその分FFB付きと違いモーター音がないのでハンドル操作に関しては静かにプレイできます。音が出るのはシフト操作です。触るとしっかり作られていて驚きましたが、しっかり作られているが故操作時に「カチッ」という音がそこそこ大きくします。一人暮らしならば問題ないとは思いますが…(一応ハンドルの裏、パドルシフトの近くに左右それぞれボタンがあり、それでシフト操作ができるのでゲームプレイに支障は出ないはずです。むしろボタン操作の方が運転しやすいかもしれません笑)ペダルは重く踏んでいて操作に関して不満はありません。ただ重い分踏む時に力がいるのと(慣れればなんてことありませんが)、そのためある程度しっかりとペダル位置を固定しないと踏む度にペダル位置がズレてゲームを十分に楽しめません(ハンドル部分と違いペダル部分はグリップこそあれ固定するための部品がありません)。全体的に美しく作られたフェラーリのハンドルでゲームができるという点は、ゲームを楽しむ上で重要な部分だと思いますし、Thrustmaster製品ということもあり全体的にある程度、値段相応にはしっかりしているので(とはいえ舵角の120度まで「ガンッ」と力一杯切ったりするのはいけないことですが)「これからハンドルコントローラでゲームを始めたい」という方や、この製品より低い価格帯のハンドルコントローラを持っていて、「それが壊れてしまった」「ステップアップしたい」という方には合っていると思います。一方、「以前FFB付きのハンコンを使っていた」という方にとっては物足りないかもしれません。勿論製品の説明にも書かれてあるので「舵角の小ささやFFB無しってことは理解している」という方が購入を検討しているのでしょうが、それでも購入してプレイした時に悲しさに似たようなものを覚えてしまう時はやはりあります。確かに慣れてしまえば騒音の心配がなかったり電気代もかからないのでFFB無しの良さには気付けるのですが、ですが！、「今までのFFB付きと同じ価格帯でFFB付きのヤツがないからとりあえずこれで」という気持ちで買ってしまうとあまり良い結果を招かないかもしれませんのでお気をつけください。追記 2018 6/1 ステアリングのみが応答しなくなりました。ボタンは使えます。この時点でプレイ時間は約700時間。保証期間内であったため6/5に交換のため発送し、手元に新品が戻ってきたのが6/26でした。しかしこれもまたボタンが正常に動作しないなどの不具合がありました。
1,Alle Knöpfe des Lenkrades bis auf den Xbox Button funktionieren nach knapp 1 bis 2 min nicht mehr. Der Kundendienst hat mir jetzt nach knapp 5 Werktagen nicht zurückgeschrieben (per Email). Im Internet steht zwar etwas von einer kostenlosen Hotline aber diese vermittelt einem nur dass der Kundendienst zur Zeit eingestellt ist. Ich habe immer Glück gehabt bei Amazon Bestellungen und jetzt das erstmal richtig pech da der Versand auch 5 Werktage gedauert hat. Falls sich jemand das durchliest und denkt: bei mir wird das nicht passieren. Denk zweimal :)
3,Ok
4,Diciamo che per il prezzo probabilmente è un prodotto valido il problema è che non avendo motore che permetta la simulazione della trazione/sterzo sembra quasi di non aver nulla in mano. Comunque un prodotto di buona fattura. Amazon impeccabile
3,fonctionne parfaitement mais mauvaise qualité des caoutchouc façon cuir ils se dégradent déjàautre  reproche conditionnement d'expédition .la boite du volant était complètement défoncée il n'y avait pas de sur-emballage .j'aime conserver mes emballages car quand je revends c'est plus pratique .
5,Bought this for my 10 year old son he loves it but have found that not all racing games work with it.
4,No es un ferrari es solo el volante el resto del coche no viene y el volante no creo que sea tampoco.
5,Good product and happy little boy.
5,Good
5,Consegna nei tempi previsti! Facile e veloce da montare. Ottima soluzione se non si dispone di un tavolo alla giusta altezza vicino al televisore. Il volante è molto sensibile rispetto al controller dunque all'inizio è un po' difficile da utilizzare ma basta poco per acquisire la giusta sensibilità e divertirsi.
1,The only thing that works on the pict thing is the home button ... not getting anythingFrom the buttons on the wheel  is like it’s broken !im still waiting for a refund was sent back over a month ago !
5,Super mon fil adore et livraison rapide
3,I like it but it just moves to much
1,The securing handle snapped after 9 months. Got it replaced and the replacement snapped in exactly the same way after 4 months. Item is now out of warranty and cant be replaced. The securing handle is obviously sub standard and not fit for purpose.
5,Il volante è fatto davvero bene. Di sicuro il migliore anche considerando il rapporto qualità/prezzo. Peccato che nei giochi più da simulazione sia estremamente difficile da usare. Se non siete troppo esperti e non siete dei veri e proprio fanatici dei giochi di corsa ve ne sconsiglio l'acquisto! Finirete per stancarvi subito e buttare così dei soldi al vento come ho fatto io.
4,Very good
5,Great price and fast delivery
5,Liked everything
1,The paddle is not working wheel is not connecting
5,Make the driving experience much more realistic when playing games such as Project Cars on Xbox onebe aware that does not support Force feedback or rumble
2,Not very happy with this purchase as we haven’t been able to connect it to the pc. Really struggling followed all the instructions and still no joy!!
5,Mit dem Lenkrad lassen sich Spiele wie F1 super spielen. Mehr Spaß als mit Controller... Nur zu empfehlen
1,It’s broken! It broke with my 11 year old using it last night he’s gutted he bought it out of his birthday money and it hasn’t lasted 6  months let a lone one year! Gutting don’t buy don’t waste money
3,It was ok
5,Prodotto ottimo e divertente per chi come al ragazzino a cui l’ho preso piace questo tipo di prodotto. L’ho provato anche io e anche se non sono un professionista mi é sembrato preciso sia nel cambio delle marce che nella sterzata così come nella frenata.
5,Best value for the money
1,Whilst this Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider Racing Wheel was advertised as being XBOX one compatible it did not have a USB connector therefore this could not be connected to my XBOX one.The connector was a round connector with a pin in the center clearly not XBOX one compatible.There were NO instructions included with the Steering wheel so even if I could have connected it I would have not had a clue how to set it up.Beware other reviwers claim to have also received the steering wheel with a round pin connector.
5,Gift for grandson who was delighted with it.
3,Vibration fehlt kabel zu kurz ansonsten ganz okay glaube es gibt mittlerweile bessere um den Preis!! Verarbeitung ist nicht schlecht
5,arrived on time works brill
1,BonjourJ’ai acheté cette article 1 an jour pour jour.La pedale a lâché impossible de jouer.Comment faire jouer la garantie ?C’est pas normal qu’au bout d’un an il soit cassé. Surtout à ce prix. Pouvez vous me dire qui contacter? Je vous remercie.
5,Buon rapporto qualità prezzo
5,Prise en main et aux facilités des pieds convenables. Pratique et facilité d'utilisation.Gestion parfaite. Tb pour f1 forza etc.
5,Très bien
2,No driving force no rality filing
5,Thanks
5,Lo uso con il gioco F1 2017 Xbox One (ediz Regno unito). Girano alla grande!!! I miei figli sono soddisfatti.
5,Great wheel
5,We received the order after 3 days and in good condition.everything was perfect.thanks
5,Das lenkrad und Padalen funktionieren hervorragend. Schnelle Lieferung auspacken anschließen und losrasen.Wenn dann noch ein F1 Spiel dazu kommt ist das perfekt. Auch mit anderen Rennspielen möglich.Das ist wirklich für Rennfahrer ein super Teil.Kaufempfehlung - JA!
1,Not compatible with PC
5,Très bon volant et très bon rapport qualité prix
5,Love love  love  it said my grandson. He has had lots of use with no problems at all
1,buttons worked but could not get steering working with any games F1 Rally etc. Tried the various methods to resolve this issue but nothing worked.
5,I find it so good for all driving games but mainly F1 is perfect.
5,Volante eccellente perfetto in tutto dotato anche di staffe di montaggio. Pedali che non scivolano palette volante robuste in acciaio. Per il prezzo consigliatissimo a i principianti
3,Discreto
5,Come me lo aspettavo molto divertente
5,Das Produkt erfüllt alle Ansprüche mein Sohn spielt nur noch damit seine Rennspiele an der Xbox one.
4,Funziona molto bene è molto preciso maneggevole e sicuro la pedaliera si sposta leggermente se molto sollecitata sicuramente un'ottima scelta a questo prezzo
5,Prima di tutto complimenti ad amazon perché è arrivato prima del previsto l ho comprato per un amico ed è rimasto molto soddisfatto.. 5 stelle meritate
3,non precisissimo
5,Ottimo divertente lo consiglio!
1,If you're looking to buy this for a pc don't. Some buttons work and the rest don't do anything.
2,Salve dopo aver giocato poche partite mi sono reso conto che il volante ha qualche problema mi può mandare gentilmente lo scontrino fiscale per la garanzia siccome quando è arrivato lo scatolo era sprovvisto oppure se si può fare il reso grazie
5,Il regalo è stato accettato ed è piaciuto tantissimo. Peccato solo per i tempi di consegna ma per il resto tutto ok
5,とても良い対応でした！商品も値段の割りには良く働いてくれますなんと言っても値段と使いやすさ初心者でも簡単に操作が出来今後更に追求したハンコンを！！と思いました！
1,Rubbish item and poor service. Item broke within a few hours and getting the refund was a mission!! Avoid at all costs
5,Sehr gut
5,Super Günstiges Lenkrad was echt Präzise funktioniert. Habe es mit Projekt Cars und Forza Horizon 2 getestet und bin echt zufrieden.Wer auf FF verzichten kann macht mit dem Lenkrad echt nichts Falsch.Die Schlechten Bewertungen kann ich so nicht Bestätigen.
5,My grandson  does not put it away and plays every chance he gets fantastic.
4,good product value for money
5,buona qualità costruttiva  ma non proprio preciso  per riuscire a dileguarsi nelle corse occorrono molte ore di allenamento  inadatto per i rally
1,Un coté de la description sur le site du fabriquant indique compatible PC mais de l autre coté....non fonctionnel sur windows. Le bouton XBOX fonctionne cependant. Le fabriquant devrait être plus précis ainsi que les réponses FAQ sur Amazone.
4,Buon prodotto! È come ci aspettavamo facile e immediato da usare molto realistico. Il prezzo è soddisfacente rispetto alle prestazioni
5,Erlaubt Sehr präzise lenkmanover und für den Preis ist echt sehr gut
5,È stato perfetto per quasi un anno ma dopo un po non so come si è rotta la scheda madre e non posso più sostituirla poiche non ne trovo in giro quindi 90€ volati💸
5,Very good my son loves it
5,Nach mehreren Monaten immernoch in benutzung. Ohne Probleme funktioniert alles. Gibt keine Fehler. Pedalen ein wenig Steif aber man gewöhnt sich dran.
5,tres bon volant
5,Ottimo volante. Non presenta force feedback come i modelli più costosi ma per il prezzo a cui l'ho pagato (48€) è eccezionale. Qualità costruttiva e dei materiali soddisfacente. Sterzo e pedali molto precisi. Inoltre grazie ai 4 livelli di sensibilità è possibile utilizzarlo con svariati giochi di guida. Assicura ore di divertimento.
1,Very poor lasted just 4 days - great christmas present?.. now when you turn left it goes right then swings widly back lft. Unusuable. Just google thrustmaster 458 wheel issues.. we are not the only ones. There are pages of issues.
1,no steering input but everything else works
5,Solid built quality and works really nicely! Definitely recommended !
4,Prezzo minore confrontato con quello dei negozi. . Spedizione ottima nulla da dire . Volante efficiente  per giocare !l ho regalato ad un amico
4,Molto bello da vedere e ben rifinito.....la plastica del volante( quella di  colore rossa )migliorabile....ma nel totale ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo
1,Got it as a christmas present they used it once and it has broken already can hear rattling inside like something has snapped off.
5,Prodotto arrivato 4 giorni prima della data prevista ottimo prodotto e buona qualita' lo consiglio a chi vuole un prodotto di qualita'senza spendere cifre esagerate
2,Ich habe es wieder zurückgegeben. Für den Preis bekommt man ein gutes Lenkrad wäre da nicht diese Steinharte Bremse. Mein linkes Bein tat ständig weh.
5,Really good product I use it all the time but the asmmble part is little difficult but overall it is really good
5,Sometimes needs unplugging as forgets throttle but unplug rep lug starts working really gives the race game a lift
1,Wheel has broken after 2 months of minimal use resulting in me being out of pocket by £100 and one very unhappy teenager.
5,購入してから、しまったっと思った。木の机に仮止めするしかないやん。プレイシートに、ボルト止めできへんやん。
1,This was my son’s Christmas present. After all the excitement of unwrapping it and opening the box the pedals did not respond at all when plugged into the Xbox one. My son was very disappointed.
1,Really Good at first used it for a couple of years but about 6 months ago stopped working as it is a glitch phoned up thrustmaster and they said it is a non reparable issue that has to be replaced.
5,YES MY SON WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT.
1,Sorry das Teil geht gar nicht bin echt nicht doof aber ich habe es nicht installiert bekommen
5,Acquistato in abbinamento a F1 2017 e' perfetto per sentirsi in pista alla guida di una vettura di formula 1  grande simulatore. Sono soddisfatto  lo consiglio a tutti per un grande divertimento.
5,livraison rapide qualité prix niquel pédalier un peu souple et léger mais sinon rien a redir. correspond vraiment a se que je chercher
1,Not happy bought this for my son for a Christmas present and Amazon decided not to box this up so the description and picture was on the outside for everyone to see completely ruining the surprise and wasting nearly £60.Now I have to find MORE money to buy another present!
5,Sehr gut passt alles funkioniert richtig gut
1,Wheel doesn’t work - steering not responding to wheel movement. Called help line and told to ask for a replacement!
1,ich hab dieses Lenkrad im November 2016 für meinen Sohn als Weihnachtsgeschenk gekauft und im Februar 2017 wegen Lenkproblemeausgetauscht seit 2. Monaten haben wir wieder die selben Probleme bei den Motorsport-Spielen funktioniert die Lenkung nicht richtigtrotz mehrmaliger Konfigurierung laut Beschreibungkann man dieses Lenkrad kostenlos austauschen oder reparieren
1,great wheel (4 star rating) at first but 4 months in and it is now broke (1 star rating). not what I expected from such a trusted brand. My boys Christmas present broke. one upset lad and annoyed parent.
5,Grandsons choice for his birthday. Very pleased with it.
1,Dopo averlo usato solo  due tre volte lo sterzo andava in panne .
5,Alles bestenses macht viel Spass damit zu fahren
1,Doesn’t work poor and tight petals can’t push very upsetting
1,Great to start with bit stopped working properly after 8 months. Leaving a very disappointed 9 yr old.
1,No lo hemos podido usar aún por la Xbox no me lo reconoce . Y el vendedor no me ha sabido dar una solución 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
1,Le produit est tombé en panne au bout d'un mois.La palette droite (RB) du volant ne fonctionne plus.
5,Very goodmakes you feel like you're in the car while playing Forza 5 on Xbox 1
5,Habe das Lenkrad heute bekommen ich kann nur sagen für das Geld super macht richtig Spaß ich damit gta macht viel Spaß  sieht super aus
5,As described pleased with item -good service
1,Total waste of money very poor product.  I've used the xbox 360 wheel and it is brilliant but this alternative for the xbox one is not good. I just couldn't get on with it.
5,Alles Super jeder Zeit wieder.
5,Grandson said best thing he ever had so many thanks.
5,Great steering wheel.  No force feedback  but works great and complements Forza 6 perfectly.
2,Useless without a stand
5,Amazing! My son loves this! can even control the windows wipers! Great toy
5,Heel leuk
5,Ottimo prodotto risponde bene ai comandi. Consigliato
2,Il volante è davvero di ottima fattura fedele in ogni minimo dettaglia purtroppo non si può dire lo stesso dei pedali che fin dall'inizio non erano funzionanti...
5,lo utilizzo da anni. Non ho mai avuto un problema. Molto resistente e preciso. Molto bello esteticamente. Lo consiglio anche a chi ha bambini poiché molto robusto.

1,Junk and would not work with the bundled XBox One we did everything beyond dismantle the Xbox we sent them both back and purchased a Logitech G920 and it worked out of the box

5,Ottimo lo consiglio per il suo prezzo e ottimo non e per pc e solo per xbox one.Compratelo velo consiglio
2,Bello il volante peccato che con Xbox One non risponde bene troppo sensibile e si fatica a tenere in strada le auto.

1,La pedaliera é instabile serve tenerla ferma con qualcosa e i pedali un po' troppo duri. Lo sterzo troppo sensibile e con poco raggio di sterzata. Dopo qualche mese non funziona più.

3,Les daría las 5 estrellas pero no porque la entra de los pedales al volante venía rota
5,llego en excelentes condiciones
5,me encanto
3,hola mi problema esq sirven los botones de el volantelos pedales funcionan pero la direccion de el volante no me la detecta osea giro a la izquierda a todos lados y no lo detecta alguien sabe como arreglarlo??¡¡?  como si no detectara el volante a la hora de girar
4,What a Great Present for an 11 year old boy
4,Für 100€ gibt es hier fast nichts zu bemängeln. Lediglich das Pedalset ist nicht optimal. Ohne rutschfesten Untergrund gleitet es schnell nach hinten weg und beim Bremsen kippt es auch gern mal ein wenig. Ansonsten ist das Lenkrad top verarbeitet. Durch die Gummierung hat man stets einen festen Grip. Die Tasten sind auch wunderbar zu erreichen. Was ich mir vielleicht noch gewünscht hätte wäre ein Anschluss für ein Headset da man zur Kommunikation leider den Controller einschalten muss der sich dann aber natürlich immer ausschaltet da er nicht benutzt wird. Für Einsteiger wie mich trotzdem ein wunderbares Lenkrad. Für ein paar Rennen zwischendurch abolut ausreichend und zum reinschnuppern in die Lenkradwelt absolut empfehlenswert..
5,Excelente producto muy buena calidad
5,Reçu en parfaite condition  il fonctionne bien aucun problème
1,le volant ne fonctionne pas ....
5,Merci good job
5,Excelente y muy padre
5,Producto sin problemas perfectamente funcional.
4,Cuando uno pasa de control a volante es una sensación totalmente diferente  ya que te acostumbras a la vibración del control (cuando aceleras derrapas una curva entre otros) y en este volante no quizá muchos se decepcionen pero en mi opinión esta bueno para entretenerse.
1,No es practico
3,Le volant est bien mais si vous compter jouer beaucoup avec autant prendre un autre volant (plus cher) car celui ci n’est pas fait pour l’utilisation quotidienne. Cela fait 3-4 mois que je l’ai je l’utilise souvent et les pédales font un bruit bizarre ma pedale de frein est à moitier briser et le volant tourne bizarrement. Sinon le volant est bien et j’ai eu beaucoup de plaisir à l’utiliser.
1,Do not buy!
5,Jeux
5,My grandson loves it!
1,In the questions and answers it said it was compatible with both windows and PlayStation turns out it not true it only compatible with Xbox.
5,
5,Cool..Geschenk kam super an
5,Bon produit
5,Muy bueno para personas que se quieren iniciar en juegos de conducción con volante y pedales. Responde muy bien sobre todo en juegos de  F1. Muy recomendado
1,Doesn’t work properly not accurate car doesn’t turn when suppose to turn lack of sensibility poor quality accuracy no good very hard to control .not worthy of money paid low quality for money invested  son doesn’t play with it anymore after two weeks  tried it myself hard to drive !!!!
5,Es un volante de muy buena calidad los giros son muy realistas en la pantalla y se siente el cambio de un control. Al principio me costo trabajo acostumbrarme a la sensibilidad pero una vez que lo logré es mi mejor juguete.
1,Starring wheel doesn't work....all other controls do but not the steering wheel
5,The most i like to the item is bring me comfortable to my part to my next step in the actual handling those item.
5,Ottimo sia qualità che prezzo. Buoni materiali. Settaggi precisi
5,X box one
4,Lots of buttons and ability to shift manually with buttons which my son loves.  We did have to rig up our own stand for pedals because otherwise they slide around when pushing gas/brake
5,Better than expected solid structure feels great good response from wheel and pedals.
5,Excelente producto mi hijo está encantado
5,great
5,Nos encantó
5,Mon p’tit fils est très heureux avec ce cadeau !
4,He loves it because it's glow in the dark. It's not hard on the head.
5,Grandson's enjoyed hus birthday gift... spent hours with a group of kids...
5,Mi hijo esta encantado
5,Qualité
3,A little flimsy and NO force feedback. But for someone looking to start out in sim racing on Xbox this is a good starting point for those on a limited budget. I found the wheel fit loosely on the base but it functioned ok once calibrated.  Buttons are all easily accessed by your thumbs paddles are metal and have a good solid click. Many redundant buttons though.
3,We ordered this wheel and pedal set for our son's birthday not realizing until it arrived that it was obviously a set that someone had opened/returned/refurbed.  The box was untaped the parts inside were not in sealed bags and some of the bags had holes in them from being pre-opened.  One of the feet on the wheel was missing but we made it work because we didn’t have time to find a new set before his birthday.  Thankfully the wheel and pedals work with the Xbox but we will need to buy a longer cord so he can sit on a chair vs the floor next to the gaming system.
5,Justo lo que necesitaba
5,Buen producto y muy buena calidad
3,Esta muy bien la calidad del producto es buena lo rojo del volante es como goma y se siente bien pero dice que gira  270 grados y no es así y no vibra para nada.
4,O volante é muito bom convém ter um espaço mais alto para prender e ele e assim que ele fique confortável.
