5,I love this ring light. It is 12 and 12 inches wide and height and he‚Äôs so much better than my old 8 inch ring light. It comes with a stand and it uses an AC outlet to power it. You can also use with a USB but I prefer the AC outlet. I love the fact that the stand is adjustable and you can go really high or however how you need it. I I use this ring light to help provide additional light when I crochet so that I can see better any dark colored yarns that I‚Äôm working with. I have Use this for online meetings and it really brightens up my face on video. The ring light itself the circle part and adjust up and down. This is one of the best realize I‚Äôve seen and bought but I‚Äôm sure there are plenty others out there but for now I love this ring light
5,This was such a great buy! And I‚Äôm actually going to invest in another one or maybe two. It‚Äôs bright sturdy and it was very easy to assemble.
5,Hands down best light I've purchased !!!! It's super bright and sturdy! It can also stand very tall like 7 ft if you Adjust it!! 100/100 recommend!!! And the price is GREAT! This light is just as bright as those 20" $100 ring lights fyi
5,This was a really good buy for me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything different with this one than the other ring lights I have purchased in the past. I was pleasantly surprised when opening this one that it seemed sturdier than the others. I am not one who likes to put things together but this assembly was really easy. And what makes it even better it comes with a remote making it easier to control the light. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt get a larger size which I‚Äôll probably eventually do.
5,I really like the sturdiness of this item.  Everything is packed professionally and I highly recommend this item
5,I love it. It‚Äôs awesome ü§© my daughter use it for her hair business
5,I haven't even put it to use but the quality is amazing. Super sturdy stand with nice materials and functionality. Light is not flimsy or makes any rattling noise. Lights up bright enough for my use cutting hair.To turn it on/off you have to hold the power button. I thought mine was broken when it didn't turn on with a click. I also didn't read the manual.Apparently the brand is Taotronics. They make lots of nice electronics so I have high hopes for this light. So far very worth the money.
5,The quality of this ring light is beyond my expectations its very durable and bright everything works i am very happy!!
5,If you‚Äôre a content creator or even a photographer this light is strong enough to make your videos and photos sooo much better I was skeptical cause it wasn‚Äôt $100-$400 like the ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù ones!!!! This one is just as good! Love it! Just got it today‚Ä¶ if there are any issues I will update this review but until then. BUY IT!
5,I hardly ever write reviews but this stand and light are super high quality for the price! The stand is sturdy and and the telescoping legs are great. I love the matte finish. The light is bright and comes with a good amount of brightness and light settings like warmer and cooler tones that have made it easy to record self tapes no matter the time of day. The remote is well designed and responsive. I am so pleased with this product!
