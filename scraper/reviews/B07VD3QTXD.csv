5,I spent entirely too much time quadruple checking around to make sure these were going to fit my specific car (2022 Chevy Traverse).  Apparently the newer headrest options for specific car makes and models are more narrow than others?  Who knew?!  We not only live pretty much 30 minutes away from all the things but we also frequently go on weekend trips and the occasional annual long haul vacation away with the kids in tow so keeping the children occupied when looking out the window or talking isn't ideal is a must.  Among the countless reviews of several products along these lines including the OEM options many begroaned instability with large/heavy devices.  Well... I bought 2 of these and tested it on a 3 hour drive one way and both held my children's 10.2in Gen 8 Ipads (Inside Osmo cases.... essentially a thin casemate case) and not once did we have falls or swinging around of the Ipads!  Granted you do need to fully tighten down all of the adjustment knobs to prevent that from happening INCLUDING the ball joint!  Logistically I felt getting all of it set up into the correct position prior to the drive and locking everything in vs. leaving some room for my kids to move the devices around would be better for our specific needs and I was correct on that.  As long as the kiddos could see and reach the screens to change selections they left it well enough alone.My only negative on the sturdiness side is 1) The further it is extended out the more "jiggling" from the car is noted.  The device is still secure in the holder and the holder is still secure on the headrest... they aren't going anywhere... but if you have a child sensitive to motion sickness be aware that the jiggling of the screen in front of their eyes will be more pronounced the further out the device is from the headrest.  It's easily fixable by pushing it closer to the headrest where less momentum is placed on the extended arm but as a parent of an easily motion-sick child I just wanted to make others aware of that. 2) I can see the possibility that the adjustment knobs may loosen over time or eventually break.  It's all plastic (with some foam pieces glued in for better grip hold where it needs to be) and depending on the weight and size you are putting on the end of that long arm and how far you extend it out tighten and retighten the knobs etc.... its a high possibility that this product is not going to last a lifetime.  I could be entirely wrong but that's my personal observation.  I wouldn't hold it against the product itself... I wouldn't expect this sort of product to last ages but I know some can be pretty critical in their search so again... I thought it worth mentioning.All in all It's money well spent imho.  It's not an eyesore it's functional does what it says it does and its versatile.  We plan to test out the Switch in it next to see how it does but I can already say these don't extend far enough out to be able to share one small screen between 2 captains chairs... it comes relatively close but I imagine it'll cause a battle in children's eyes on who can't see as well.
4,This fits the headrest bars on the driver and passenger seat of my 2017 Chrysler Pacifica but not the 2nd row seats which is what I was looking for as my child is currently rear-facing in their carseat. However it is a sturdy mount that grips the tablet easily and I was able to get it to stay by sliding it between the headrest and chair and locking the headrest down on top of it. I would give 5 stars if the fitting was more versatile and if the arm could extend more. But for the price it is an overall good mount that can hold both small tablets and large phones.
5,I like it because now my kid isnt looking down while holding his iPad.  So this helps with his posture as well.  It was easy to install and easy for him to use.  He can even use it while lying down.
5,Bought two one for each household vehicle. My kid enjoys his trips having his switch vertically and not having to strain his neck looking down at the screen.
5,It's so easy to install and extremely convenient to use!! I can switch it from the back seat to the side of the front seat in order to connect the device to my wifi and play the show my son wants to watch. Its been a hit with my son because he is entertained and im not struggling having to go to the backseat to change anything. Really it's a great buy!!
5,Works well only disappointment for us is it will not hold a nintendo switch lite it will hold the regular switch with the remotes removed.
5,Took our toddler on a 9hr car ride (across two days) and this was our trip MVP.(Just kidding it was me because) I preloaded episodes of babybum on a tablet and put it in this fabulous contraption.  We used it only once in a while to take the edge off and when done it detaches easily from the seat. I don't think I'd ever buy a car with screens IN the seats the kids would beg for them on all the time so out of sight out of mind.  Highly recommend!
4,We first got this mount for our Chevy truck and it works fantastic in that truck. When we moved it to the GMC Yukon XL  the prongs on the headrest were farther apart and it was no longer sturdy.  To get it to work we had to put the head rest all the way down and smash it into place.  It worked okay that way but not great like it did in the truck.
5,It twist in different angles allowing you to make adjustments and it stretches out long if you need it to be in the middle of the two seats.
5,Easy to install and worked perfectly for both the iPad and Nintendo Switch!
4,Worked fine held the tablet tightly and was easy to put in and move around.
4,Perfect for hands free road trips in the back seat. Will hold cell phones tablets and Nintendo Switch w/o the side controllers on.
5,…it was EXACTLY what we needed for our road trip (and everyday life).  My son’s iPad and Fire tablet fit perfectly. Didn’t fall out when we went over big bumps. SUPER easy to install.Only thing I wish it extended out more. If someone has the sit up I don’t want him to have to lean forward to use his device. And also if the headrest bar could adjust as well. We have a 3rd row and the second row head rest bars are closer together than the main row. So he can use it if he’s in the 3rd row. But overall would still give it 5 stars.
3,I have a Nissan Armada and this was too wide to fit my bacckseat headrest. Silly me I didn't bother trying it until months later. It had to be at least 1/2" or more too wide so it just didn't work in my car. I couldn't find any dimensions for the widths that it fit between the posts. It only says what size tablets it fits.
5,Works just as describedFirm feel to it
5,Grand child use it in the car on trips.
5,These make long car trips not so bad! Easy to install and easy for kids to use.
5,Love how easy it is to take on and off. And love how flexible the arm is.  Bought another cause I liked it so much.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very easy to installVery sturdyRange of motion on FULLMy kids now fight over the backseat as opposed to sitting shotgun. 🤣I only have one (1) negative thing to say about the design of this accessory. When it comes to the grip I think it could have been a little better. It's fine as long as the tablet doesn't get bumped by someone entering or exiting the vehicle. A fix for this would be too add some type of clamp that would not allow devices to pop off of the mount if bumped. Other than that it gets the job done. The ability to swivel and extend the arm as needed is great. It also holds in place quite well after adjusting the tightening screws. No movement after that. I really like this thing... 💯
4,This is my second one I purchased. Happy with both.  The boys are happy with watching movies in the back seat.
5,This product works amazingly and just keeps rotating. It is amazing at making you able to watch a show almost wherever you want to. It shakes a little bit while driving but overall a very good product. If your thinking about buying this this is your sign to.
3,Been a year. The joints honestly haven't held up very well I have to tighten them often. There are tightening grips for all but one of the joints. This joint has worn down enough that the tablet moves when I turn. I've put some nail polish into it to help the issue but they really should have put one more adjustable joint in.
4,Someone suggested this product and I am happy I purchase this. My two year  is able to use her phone (old iPhone 7) in the car without holding it. I am able to swing it to the front and adjust what’s being played.  Attaching to the head rest was not hard but it gave a little bit of a struggle.
4,My kids love this!  I snap a phone in and put a show on and can drive for hours!  It tends to swing a little though and the tightening screws don’t really get that tight. But it takes up so little space and works soooo much better than balancing your phone on the console that it’s 10/10 worth it
5,Super easy installation and I like that it can pivot and move so both children can see it well for our long car rides. Definitely a good investment for us
3,It’s okay for what I paid for. My daughter has the iPad 7 and it has a case on it. It don’t hold the iPad very well with the case. If I take the case off it does great I can even extend it and it holds up. Just sucks I got to take the case off of it every time we use it
4,Bought for road trips with for the purpose of allowing my 2 kids to share a tablet and easily see between their 2 seats.  This installs easily & is made of pretty durable plastic however the arm is not long enough to make it past the edge of the seat it's installed on.  I didn't read the full description so that's my bad so if you are also looking for this solution it's not great.  For it's price point tho it is a nice tablet holder and gets it off their laps and at a much more comfortable line of sight.
5,This was the best purchase I've made this year. I bought this so my daughter would stop holding he Nintendo Switch so close to her face on long road trips. It would make her car sick. Her eye doctor said to get something so that she is looking forward. I found this holder to be the perfect item and it was. I would suggest buying it!
4,Nice holder with great quality
5,This is perfect for road trips. I have always hated for my kiddo to be arched forward while watching the phone or playing his Nintendo switch. Of course at home there is options to avoid that but in the car there has not been much. This fits perfect on the headrest and it has saved my son’s neck from getting any kinks. The sturdiness is great and I love the fact that it can be very versatile.
5,I have some issues with this product but over all it’s a good buy if you are not overly picky. It installed well no issues at all. We used this for our daughters fire tablet for a long car trip. First issue has to do with holding the tablet itself. If you have a case cover for your tablet you will run into problems. We had to remove the case in order for it to hold without falling out. The clasp only extends so far. Now for an IPhone it worked with non issues at all. Th other issue was my daughter was able to kick the mount easily so you will have to adjust the distance if you have a compact space this product may annoy you more than help. However for us we were able to adjust it to where it worked for us 90% of the time. On a 10 hour road trip that was a good percentage. I would like to add the we had a toddler case on so it was extra thick other slimmer cases may cause no issues. I would say it is worth a try just give yourself enough wiggle room in time to find out.
4,I saw my son always have his head always looked down on tablet watching movies or youtube when we are on a long trip. I find that bad to his neck on long run. So I decided to buy this mount. It installed easily. However you need to make sure your head rest would slightly lift up or it will pinch your leather seat. So far it can hold the Fire HD8 plus weight on 4 hr trip. I do need to remove the tablet case which is not an issue. We will see how long this will last.
3,This works great but it just hangs too low for us.
4,I've been trying to figure out how to put a mirror and mount a phone or tablet for my daughter on longer car rides so she can watch shows and I can still see her in her ear facing car seat. This doesn't quite work for that but it is able to hold a phone or tablet better than my previous non extending version for our seats. We have a Kia Sedona mini van with the car seat in one of the captains chairs and this works great for holding a 10 inch ipad. It's not perfect but it functions well enough for now until I figure out a better solution.
4,I bought this for road trip for my nephew's and it was perfect for them to watch anime in the car to keep them entertained. It was very easy to install and uninstall if it needed to be moved to another seat.
5,it helps a lot with roadtrip keep my kid entertaining while adults are focusing in fdriving
4,Excelent
5,i like it a lot i used for phone holder for adults and kids to watch video very happy with it and satisfied.
3,I have a Chevy Equinox and the part that goes between the bars of the headrest did not clasp enough to fit.
5,This is sturdy and so easy to install. Glad I bought it for our road-trip.
5,Excelent
5,Great product! Wife and son loves it! Perfect for a road trip! Highly recommend it
5,I purchased this for my baby to have her watch movies I enjoy it worth every penny the value of the product exceeds the price you can swivel it any direction even from sittin in the front seat im happy that shes not bored on car rides anymore now thank you
4,This could have been awesome but without headphones and a splitter the two kids fought over how loud it was and it was too near the driver s ear to be up super loud.  I will buy those things and try again ! Still have hope
3,I tested it out the day we received it. I really like the idea and design but it shakes and moves a lot during the drive. One moment it would be a the center the next thing I know it moved either left or right depending on where I turn and I don't drive fast or make sudden turns. I wish it was more stable and had an anti-shake feature. I may return it.
5,This is exactly what my son needed. We travel a lot and this was used the day after we got it and it was perfect! Still using it!
4,Great product seems high quality.  Giving 4 stars because it did not fit on the seat in the vehicle I bought it for.  If the headrests do not move up and down there may not be enough room to fit it in.  Also the bars are closer together on my rear seats than my front seats.
4,Easy to install very little movement or bounce easily heldmy 10" MS Surface Pro laptop to I could work in the car during our road trip.
4,They work they hold a tablet no problem.  Had to buy two for my children they love it.  Makes watching videos on the go easy for them.
5,We got this for my youngest son. He uses it most often for the Nintendo Switch. He's also used it for a phone and his Fire Tablet. They all fit well and make it nice for playing in the van on the go.
4,Was easy to install and use. It was strong enough to hold up a Samsung Galaxy Chtomebook2. The bar that attaches to the head rest is sturdy. The are three holes that the clamp attaches to but no locking mechanism. When nothing was on the clamp and off you barely hit it it comes off.
4,Such a life saver! All it took was a tablet mount and a few downloaded movies to stop my baby from crying. Only thing is after a while the part attached to the tablet starts to look down so we have to move is back into place. Otherwise best $10 ever spent 😅
5,I purchased a 2nd unit after loving the first one I bought in August but the tightening knob broke off from one of them.  My sons loved their mounts.  They used it for their Nintendo Switch Samsung Tab 10.0 Mini iPad and our LG G7 ThinQs.  The Amazon Fire 7.0 also fit in.  Bummed out after I couldn't improvise to repair the broken piece I contacted the seller to inquire if they sold spare parts. The response I received was very prompt.  They did not have any spare parts but offered to provide a full refund if I ordered another one - essentially getting a brand new unit for free.  I got the new one and the total amount I paid was refunded/credited back to my account right away.  That is what you call an awesome customer service!  I recommend buying this product from this company to anyone who is looking for a mobile device mounting kit. Thank you once again for the professional and wonderful and awesome customer service!
4,Could use a bolt tensioner on the head rest.  It gave specs on opening sizes.  Wish it fit tablets with cases better.  The prongs to hold it need to be longer.  Otherwise nice product.
4,This works exactly as expected. Our Yukon Denali’s headrest supports (where this mount connects) are almost too far apart for the mount to connect to. It remains a little loose which isn’t a deal killer but it’s not ideal either.
4,Holds our iPad perfectly and it can stretch out for my daughter to reach it. I have noticed that it does seem to tilt downward slightly. It could just be from her being too rough with it or from the weight of the tablet.
5,My kiddo loved the mount and the fact that it can be turnt and expanded. Great item!
3,The mount doesn’t fit on the metal pegs of the headrest as advertised and the phone holder portion isn’t truly attached. It almost looks like a peg or hinge mechanism is missing.
4,This is a great little gadget for the switch my boys were crinking their necks looking down to play on long trips so we ordered this and it's perfect only thing that could make it better is if the arm extended a little bit longer.
4,Purchased this for my four year old son to use his tablet during long road trips. This is a great product to prevent my son from slouching over the tablet.My only concern is I wish the arm was a little longer. When attached to the chair in front of him he had difficulty reaching the tablet. Granted his arms are a little shorter.We will keep it for him to watch movies however he won't be able to play games.
5,We use this in the car and for the bed too.
5,This was easy to assemble and attach to the headrest supports. It held a 7 inch tablet (without a case) securely. As advised in previous reviews measure the distance between the supports before ordering (mine are 6 inches apart).
4,I am really bummed that this product will not work for us because it is a very nice holder. I really like how many positions it can be put in. Sadly it does not fit the Kids Kindle 8 (released in June 2020) WITH the bumper case it is just a smidge too small. However It will fit WITHOUT the bumper case. I would like a holder that fits with the bumper case so I will unfortunately be returning. Otherwise it is a great product!
5,Picked this up for long day drips. I blame my childhood but it seems that every time I crawl into a back seat it's lights out.So I decided to get this so that I could watch shows or movies and still be part of the convo up front (not gonna lie... I still fall asleep...).It installs quite easily holds my extremely large phone (Samsung s21 Ultra with defender case) without an issue and it just works....
4,The only reason I gave it a 4 stars vs 5 is because of installation.  The bracket that is suppose to hook onto headrest falls right where my car headrest bar bends. The bracket hand does not fit snugly because it lands on the bend but it fits good enough to hold my sons Nintendo switch or fire tablet during long trips.
5,For my grandson IPhone viewing..
4,Have to constantly tighten the little knobs on top not a deal breaker works great in my Honda CRV kid likes it as well
5,Easy to install.My son sits in the middle of the back seat so there obviously isn't a headrest directly in front of him to attach his tablet to.I set this device up in just a couple of minutes to the drivers side headrest bars. It swivels so I'm able to extend the "arm" that holds the tablet just in front of him.The only downfall for me is that my toddler car reach the mount with his hands/feet & remove the tablet himself... but I'm hoping this may only be a problem for a little while until he learns to leave it alone!
5,This works great for my 2014 dodge ram.  Make sure to remove the headrest completely and slip on from the bottom of the pins. Couldn't angle it on with the headrest in place.
4,Absolutely love this product! I  don’t have a DVD player in my vehicle and we are on the road quite a bit. With my iPad I can Maneuver it to where all my daughters can see just like a tv! Only down fall was it didn’t fit for my back seat headrests
5,Get 2 if you can. Works on my daughters Amazon Fire 10 Tablet and my sons Iphone 12 mini.
5,I like it Easy to install and my son loves it it’s like he’s watching TV in the backseat
5,This is a wonderful little gadget I take six hour trips at least once a month this is the perfect thing to hook to the backseat so my son can watch movies on the tablet when he starts getting tired of being in the vehicle. It works great with my 10.9 inch tablet and my iPhone mini so it’s very versatile!
3,I bought this to use with the extendable arm from the back middle seat head rest to my baby's rear facing seat for him to view on a very long roundtrip. I do not have the head rests that come off on the back side seats. This did not fit those so we are not able to use it and the return window has already closed. Check car measurements before buying. When he is forward facing we will see how this works. We have quite a bit of time before this happens.
4,It’s a great products strong durable but only for phones with no case or a very skinny case. Definitely not otter cases
5,Great mount
3,Product is as described.  Measurements are accurate and fit on my headrest as expected.  The tension on the tablet holder is good and worked well with our iPads although we had to take it out of our chunkier kid cases which isn't ideal.  My biggest problem with it is it is not very adjustable.  The arm only swings straight out and doesn't adjust vertically at all.  You can only tilt the tablet slightly.  If the front seat it is attached to is reclined at all it makes it difficult for kids (especially in a third row) to see it at all.  Overall it served it's purpose and worked as designed and described but I wish I had looked for a more adjustable design and would have gladly paid more for that.
5,It does what we need it to do for the price. We are using it with an iPhone SE and a Nintendo Switch for the road ... its perfect for it.
4,Easy to install easy to use. I use for my son's 10in tablet. We love it!
3,This product did not fit my truck head rest bars. Did not compress small enough to fit. It’s currently on my  2013 Cadillac XTS it fits there.
4,Could use some extra length in the arm but otherwise a good buy. Long enough when front seat is further back but hard to reach for a kid when the front seat is not all the way back.
4,Excelente
4,Got this for my daughter ipad 6th gen I believe its 9.6 - fits snug sideways with the tablet - the arm seems a little stressed at the head rest but other than that its a sweet product - The arm seems just a little weighed down with the tablet but it does the job and my kid loves it
2,It is so close to being a superior product. The arms could be longer. At current they are functional but just a little more would be so much better. Seems sturdy using with a nintendo switch. Biggest issue is that the headrest clamps are not wide enough to fit my car so i had to use foam to build up one headrest arm and then i used electrical tape to make sure it wouldnt come off the headrest. Like i say it is sooooo close to being amazing but so far away!
4,My daughter loves this! Works exactly the way it says
5,This is easier than other seat back holder we've had previously.  Just pops right on and has strong staying power.  I love the fact that it folds up out of the way when we aren't using it!  It also can get closer to the kiddos in their seats so they can still operate it to find what they are looking for.
5,This was super easy to use. I slapped it into the headrest minutes before we left and then after a couple hours we broke out the old Fire tablet and the arm held it super securely. Also my wife was in the back seat so it was nice that the arm was long enough that she could swing it over to side to start new shows or whatever.Would highly recommend.
5,Love this one specially because you can angle it. My  toddler didn’t care for the tablet being directly in front of her. SoI was able to buy it on the other seat and angle it perfectly where she was able to still see it. My toddler didn’t cry once on the four hour road trip. Run and get this!
5,Bought this primarily for a 2 day road trip to Florida. Takes about 5 minutes to take out of the box and install in the car. Holds up great had no issues holding my children’s iPads. Only downside is if you have a case on the iPad you have to take it out of the case in order to put it in the holder which can be a pain depending on the case you have. No fault of the design but something to consider when purchasing.
4,Good price for a good  sturdy product. But it didn’t fit the headrest in my car. I have a jeep and the space between the headrest was too small for the length of this product. Found another way to install though!
5,This is so easy to pop into our head rest. (Mazda CX9) We use it for a phone Nintendo switch & iPad...works perfect for all of them.
5,We purchased two for our children in the backseat. We're also able to swap them back and forth between our SUV and truck.  The kids (teens) love them so they don't have to hold their phones or tablets on our frequent road trips.  They're easy to use and easy to install.  I didn't rate sturdiness five-stars due to one of the knobs falling off. It was easy to place back on but we didn't expect it to fall off.
5,It’s good. It’s strong. It’s tables holder.Does with it should.It’s a spring fit so there are no screws to fix the headrest holder.And there is no screw to hold the tablet holder at one position.At the end of the day This Will Do What it is Made to Do.
4,I mostly like this.  It works well and does what it is supposed to.  The only thing I didn't like is one of the adjustment screws is right next to the mounting posts on your headrest.  So you can't put your headrest all the way down.  I ended up mounting the holder upside down and it fit better than right side up.
5,We have been using this for a month now and used it in on a long road trip. Kids love it and can put their iPads and game consoles. Would really recommend it
3,It’s nice but does not fit in a Honda CR-V….. it’s too big maybe for a bigger car
4,Do not work well if you have extra stuff on your cell phone case. ( makeing it too thick)
5,Works great for kids on long car rides! I bought two- we have even put them in another car for two 7 yr olds and they loved having them! Definitely worth the buy! I don’t have to worry about them hurting their necks with these while looking at the screen.
5,I love this I can swing it around to watch my tablet when I'm parked my riders can all reach my tablet when they want to. My only note would be if it could be a hair firmer  it wobbles a bit better way of securing it to the head rest? Still love it thiugh
5,We used it for our most recent road trip. Very easy for myself along with my 7 8 and 11 year old kids to use. We used it for our Nintendo Switch and cell phones. It worked just fine! 5 stars all around!
2,I was so excited to buy these. The car my dad is giving me was in the shop so I couldn't try these until it came back tried them in my mom's car they worked great. Went to install them into my my dad's old car and they didn't fit the posts were too wide on the headrest.My dad's new car I tried these in and had the opposite issue the posts were too close together to fit. A fail on 2/3 carsTho when they fit they fit fantastic and are great
5,Works great in car for holding kids’ IPads and Switch. Keeps them upright and avoids the usual head bent over position while they play. Very easy to install and use.  Has proven to be sturdy. Good price too.
5,Great for the back of driver and passenger seats. Did not fit on back row seats for rear facing kiddos. Still a great product just didn’t work for our current need.
5,Love how it will hold a Nintendo Switch Galaxy Tablet or even my S10 phone. Had no drop on a trip 7hr trip both there and back. Would recommend to anybody.
4,Great tool to use when connecting to the headrests of the front seat. I didnt realize that the rear seats head rest bars are a little narrower so I wasnt able to use it for my rear facing child to view but will be handy when they are front facing. Fits my kindle fire hd well!
5,This was perfect for a long car trip. The kids were able to watch movies on an iPad and even mount their switch!
4,Note this did not work for the rear head rest in my 05 GMC Sierra. Did not expand wide enough so it was returned. Although it does work with driver and passenger seat head rests. My son is in a rear facing car seat so it was not useful in this situation. Seems like a sturdy product though.
4,Easy to instal
5,i never leave reviews but this product is perfect. worked so well for long car trip with kids. Design and sturdiness are top-notch. it's worth twice what it costs
4,👍
5,Best parent buy thus far... You got toddlers??? Lazy preteens?? Happen to drive a lot for fun or family visits? My only complaint is I didn't buy more than one. Easy to install. Perfect for an Amazon fire tablet and holds my cell phone just as well. Saved my sanity more times than I can count.
5,I use this to hold a Tablet in my work car and it holds up very well even when on unimproved roads. I wish the arm were a little bit longer but it is still great!
5,Works great and feels sturdy and not cheap given the price. Also extends which is great on long road trips to watch videos or anything really while keeping hands free. Easy Attachment to head rest.
5,it need adjustment on the length both the spring and head holding device.
5,it does what it's intended. holds the ipad for kids.. it is not too stable and moves around but it's OK for the price
5,Fit our 2012 pathfinder very well.  Joints tighten up securely holds the nintendo switch as advertised.  Worked out nicely on our recent long road trip.  Good value.
4,Item is much smaller than expected but it does get the job done. It holds my tablet very well and extends to a decent length.
4,Un poco tricky para instalar pero cumple su función el material no se siente muy fuerte
5,This product was even better than I could have hoped. A nice piece of genius engineering that will honestly make my life a whole lot easier. It looks complicated but it's so intuitively simple there's like a zen quality to it. Minimal instructions becasuse there's not much need. Seems ready to fit just about any headrest and just about any phone. Loving it so far!!
5,Easy to install (Highlander). Fit 10” iPad well. No squeaking or vibrating. Kids loved being able to push away from them when watching shows/movies and bring it closer for games. Highly recommend
1,It seems as though the item is missing a piece. The arm will not attach to the piece that holds that tablet. It does not come with instructions but it looks like there should be a piece that screws the two together. Disappointing as I’m unable to use this.
3,Only thing I hate about it is it doesn’t extend fully out to the center of the seats. It’s rather short barely comes past the edge of the seat it’s attached to.
5,These are awesome! I bought these after a lot of research. I love how they have an extendable arm. They took about less than a minute to install and are incredibly sturdy. They don’t bounce the phones around at all.  Both my kids love them. They move the phone and ipad in all directions up down horizontal and vertical. The arm allows them to share with a friend sitting in the middle.  Completely worth the money. Do not hesitate to buy.
5,Perfect for our road trip. My daughter loved using it to watch movies on her iPad Air. Worked perfectly as described.
4,This worked well to hold my iPad as I was a passenger in the back seat however I got car sick from looking down and watching movies. If you don't get car sick it should work well for you.
5,I bought this hoping it would allow my 4.5yr old (who sits in the middle spot backseat still in 5 point harness) to be able to reach the device when needed and have a more comfortable watching experience for long road trips. Tried it this morning on our commute to school quick and it was Perfect!! Not only could he reach it but was at perfect eye level no more wrecking his spine :) It was extremely easy to install. Thanks for the awesome product!!
5,Solid mount for my Kindle. I really had to work to get it to fit between the headrest posts.
1,This will not fit the back seat head rest posts on a 2018 Chevy Equinox.  The posts are too close together and the bracket on this is too far out to fit.  If it doesn't fit on my husbands Edge then I will be returning it but I bought it originally for my car.
5,These are awesome.  Bought two for our iPads and worked great. My 8 and 4 yr old can both remove their iPads if they want to hold them and my 8 yr old can get them back in.  Awesome product!
5,These are the best! We were traveling with our 6 year old grandson from Michigan to Tennessee in a Dodge Journey. They held our IPads-8th gen perfectly & kept him entertained.
3,Easy to use too big for periods but found a way to make it work. Uncomfortable to put my device in but also fixed (with legos). It’s great for small devices ok for others.
3,It's a decent product but the two arms are too small to fit between the head of the seat.
5,my son love this and so do I. my son doesn't have to hold his tablet while in the backseat and it also helps him to keep his head up and down all time while watch some of his shows.
5,Mounted them in '21 4Runner. Used by kids in backseat with phones and tablets for 6 day road trip. They said they're glad they had them. They seem sturdy and hold the electronic device well.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to install and sturdy. I the red color matches my car. Easily the best 15 dollars I've spent in a while.
5,I love it! It was so easy to install. It was sturdy so my phone wasn’t flopping everywhere. Perfect for road trips. I have a iPhone pro max and I have a hard case and it fits perfectly.
5,Extremely easy to install & very sturdy product. We just did a 20+hrs road trip and it came handy for the kids to be entertained.
5,Super easy to install doesn't bother front passanger like previous headrest mount with velcro. Sturdy and keeps phone in place and keeps the peace in the back seat while I'm driving!!
5,Very sturdy. Easy to adjust and manipulate. Very happy with this car mount.
1,At its widest this mount is a fraction of an inch too narrow to fit onto a 2015 Subaru Outback headrest. I was actually able to squeeze the bars together to get them to fit inside the mount but then they were too narrow to be inserted back into the top of the seat. Back to the drawing board...
5,I bought two of these for my two boys as we traveled and it held my boys tablets and it was the best. They were able to watch their shows at eye level. Great purchase!
5,Sturdy we’ve been pretty rough on it already had it for about a month we move in and out of the car easily fits both head rest and we don’t have to take the case off of my daughters Amazon fire tablet it also fits iPhone snuggly great purchase
2,I’m surprised this got such high reviews. I bought these for my sons to use on a car trip. Both of our tablets have childproof covers on them to protect them from breaking. These holders would not hold the tablets with the covers on them - the arm isn’t thick enough to really grab it with a cover so it would just pop out after a few minutes.So the only way you could use these is if you take the tablet cover off which to me just isn’t practical.Also as a heads up these do not fit in the rear seat of an Odyssey 2019 because the middle row head rests are too narrow.
5,This is a great product. Not to big easily movable and extendable. Works for phones and tablets. Its great for the road with multiple kids.
3,We have a 2017 Nissan Rogue and a 2018 Dodge Ram and it would not fit any of the head rest uprights in either vehicle. It seemed like something I would like nice and sturdy and held the phone well seemed like it wouldn't bounce much because he spring was pretty hearty I'll just have to see if I can find another product that will have the width we need.
5,We had a big cross country trip (twice) and these were absolutely amazing!!!! I highly recommend. Easy to use and not cheaply made. I would recommend checking the screws to make sure they're tightened. My 8 year old "knocked" his and it felt into the abyss of the floor 14 hours into our trip. No bigger just a pain to look for it.
5,Easy to use and install. Locking screws will loosen from repeated extension and retraction. Relatively sturdy as my 7 year old is tough on everything she puts her hands on.
4,Didn’t work for our 2015 Subaru Outback but the span between headrest bats was 3.75” otherwise seemed very sturdy and well made
5,My baby love this thing :) For me it is easy to use comfortable at any positions. Minuses is: cheap plastic and terrible white logo that spoils interior of car.
5,good product
5,Easy to install. Easy to use. Makes car trips with kiddos much easier.
5,I bought this for my kids before we took out trip to pigeon forge. This unit is sturdy and fits the nintendo switch perfect.
3,Works to a certain extent. Fits well but can easily get yanked off with a strong enough pull while adjusting the length of the adjustable arms. Please use caution if using it for child use of entertainment. Child can pull and get fingers pinched.
5,IT WORKS GREAT! Awesome price for and awesome tablet holder. I can extend it towards the middle so both my kids can watch. I use it to hold the samsung galaxy kids tablet and it holds it up nicely doesn't shake. Plus if it needs to be charged I can plug it in while its holding it. Love it!
5,So far so good. Had this in the 4runner for a few weeks now. Fits Amazon fire tablet with foam case.
5,I like it it’s easy for me to put my phone n play a movie for my son without him grabbing it
4,Great price and fast shippingJust make sure to check measurements on your headrest
5,Fits perfect on my rogue. My son loves it. I have tighten as much as I can and it still moves. It's not too bad though
5,This mount works so well for Amazon Kindle and other devices. It's very durable and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone!
5,Muy útil meMantiene entretenida a mi bebé cuando vamosEn el carro y le pongo el celular ay
3,Product appears to be of good quality. I just opened them up and tried to fit them in my car. They do not fit in the headrest posts for a 2019 Subaru ascent. The posts are too narrow for this holder.
4,Works like charm
5,Great for the kids in the car is sturdy and easy to reach no more iPads falling out of the truck or getting stepped on great value great product
5,Will hold a phone or a tablet well
4,Didn’t fit the backseat too big
5,Perfect for my son to play Switch in the car.  Fits on my 2021 Highlander headrest.
5,If you have kids or just want to be hands free while enjoying a movie. This is worth buying. Very sturdy and easy to install. I love it!
4,I just installed it in my car so far so good.I haven’t try to extend the arm to the fullest extension yet. My kids are please with it.
5,That was easy to install and has really good sturdiness. Great thing to have on long car rides
5,Great product. Kids loved them for the trip
5,Easy to use pretty sturdy and can view at multiple angles. Made the 2k mile round trip great
3,These are great for the kids to hold their tablets and doesn’t strain their necks from looking down. Make sure you measure the posts of your headrests because the clamps don’t really get small enough to fit most vehicles. I had to remove my headrests and jam them in to get them to work. Very sturdy just make sure they’ll fit
3,This mount worked really well for holding a nintendo switch. It didn't work for holding the kids tablet with a case on it. We ended up having to buy another one that would fit their tablets and the switch.
5,So far so good. Holds in place.
5,Well worth the money spent. My kids love it. We hook it to the headrest bars and they use it to watch movies on tablets and their phones. They also use it to hold the Nintendo switch to play two player while we travel!
5,I bought this for my elderly father so he wouldn’t have to hold his phone all the time when we are in the road. This makes it easy for him to look at his phone in the backseat with ease. It was easy to install and very useful.
5,Great for my autistic son! Fits tablet and phone ❤️ Never have to remove it
5,Excellent product easy to use and easy to installI use this product for my iPad
5,Pretty ingenious idea. With the frequency of portable electronics these days these are a must fir young’s kids and their smart devices.
5,I love it! Kids enjoyed it while long drive watching shows to my phone..
5,It was used to hold the phone to play movies for kids in back seats while traveling
4,Did not fit between the headrest bars
3,It worked great but after a while it couldn't hold in place anymore. I really enjoyed having it but as we used it everyday the item broke while trying to put the tablet back on it.
5,Perfect nintendo switch holder for the car.  Super easy to install.. literally takes seconds.  My son put his switch in the holder and was set for the road trip
5,It’s great easy to install sturdy. If I could change anything it would be that the arm moves up and down not just forward and back to the headrest. But overall it serves its purpose.
3,Holds my iPhone XR really well but it seems like my ipad 7th gen is too heavy for it. No matter how tight I turn the screws so it doesn’t move and hit my kid on the face when the car breaks it still moves a lot.
4,Doesn't stay in place as well as it should considering it holds electronics but otherwise useful and good enuf.
5,Absolutely great. Love that my kids are not looking down at their tablets during road trips now. Its sturdy and holds phones and tablets
5,Love it don’t have to hold my phone with my hand and everybody in the back seats can see..
5,This works great for long road trips. We use it to hold a Nintendo Switch in our 2019 Highlander.
5,Perfect and very easy-to-use and install. My son loves this as he doesn't always want to hold my phone to watch his cartoons when we are in the car
4,I use smasung galaxy note 9 and it is really difficult to put it on because the holder is way too tight.
5,I will buy again.
5,Works great on 2017 toyota camry se. Fits between the headrest. Adjustable. Works great for fire hd8 tablet with a case on it.
4,It barely fitted on my headrest but I managed. Now son use it every time he in the truck.
5,It has worked great with our car!
5,Easy to install easy to operate. Holds 7'' Fire Tablet even with kids bumper! Can be folded and rotated so passenger can operate the tablet that turns it back to back sits. Very convenient.
5,I had high hopes for these and my expectations were absolutely met.  Easy to setup install and move to a different car. My kids love them for the pandemic road trips we’ve been taking.
5,Lifesaver for those with young children. I just pop this in and the car rides are a breeze.
5,I was pleasantly surprised to see how sturdy and stable this Mount is. I was a little skeptical at first because of the price the once I got it was very pleasantly surprised.
5,Easy to use it’s very sturdy. Works great with iPhone 12.
4,The product works great.  I gave it 4 stars only because i don't know how long it will hold up.
5,I have a Samsung galaxy 20 and this fits it. Worked great for a car ride for the kids.
5,Super great for the price! Does the job and is extremely easy to install. It’s literally changed my toddler’s life in the car on road trips 😂 definitely recommend.
4,Ok
5,Worked great for my kid's tablet while on a long road trip! Was exactly what I was looking for and I love how it swivels.
5,My son love it we drove for more than 6 hrs and it was a super life saver since he spent the time watching shows and playing educational games
5,Perfect for my car so I don’t have to get monitors put in my headrest! Bought my kids some $30 fire tables on here on black Friday and bought these and now we are long trip and road trip ready!!!!
5,I like this so much.  This can extendable  spring force by stable phone.  Cell phone won't shake when you drive.No need to hold your phone in the car.  This is really a good choice.  Enjoy any movie and music in the car. Thank you!
5,Bought two of these for my kids so they can watch downloaded movies on their fire tablets in the car.  They love them!  They're great!  So easy to use.  They fit great and they can be easily moved from car to car.
5,Probably the single best purchase I’ve ever made!
5,Holds my kids tablet Amazon fire 7 perfect .
3,This product did not fit in either of my cars front of backseats. Very dissatisfied with the quality and will be returning.
5,Holds my phone very well on Camry.Glad I got this
5,Nice and sturdy pretty good quality.  I really like it for the price but measure your headrest first...... it did not fit on my car.
5,Work great for the kids iPhone 8 in the otter box case. Very happy so far.
5,Great product 😀😀
5,Money well spent! I use my hotspot on my phone to play the iPad and she hasn’t cried in a vehicle since!
5,Got it for a year old and she loves it
5,Actually work much better than I had anticipated on my Jeep Wrangler.... to the point where I ordered a second one for my other seat.
5,Love it
5,Worked great for our road trip. Fits the Nintendo switch perfectly.
4,Overall it does the job.
2,Too chunky. Not easy to maneuver. Ordered a case with a strap that fit around the headrest. I returned this one.
5,Very easy and both of my children love it.
5,Easy for my girls to use and perfect size.
5,Exceeded expectations
5,Me a sido de gran utilidad
3,This works great in my Chrysler Pacifica. Easy to install. My only complaint is that I wish it were just an inch or two longer. It was difficult for my kids to touch their screens.
5,Game changer! Super easy and versatile
5,My son uses this with his Nintendo Switch.  It is easy to install and easy to use.  He loves it.  Great purchase!
3,This item is good in theory and made well; however it does not fit my car.  I am going to try it for one trip as I have it rigged up and then make the decision whether to return.
4,It works great. Wish it was longer to reach between the seats better.
3,This item does not fit the headrest in our 2020 Subaru Outback. The headrest bars are too close together by a few tenths of an inch. So bummed.
3,Wish it was a little longer to reach to center of seats but works well
5,Did not fit at first. Had to take out headrest then slide it on.
5,Very happy with this holder. My grandkids can reach it to pull towards them to change what they are watching easily. No neck aches from looking down anymore. Only drawback is I have to take iPad out of case to fit.
5,Used this once already. It holds strong and securely. I do wish the power plug could be added on both sides of the mount but I love it.
5,Great product so far. It works perfect especially because of the long arm. When you’re in the driver’s seat you can reach back and turn the phone/tablet towards you to change the video that your kid is watching.
3,This didn’t fit our car - it’s too big. We have a 2016 Lincoln Navigator. So sad because this would have been perfect for travel!
5,This mount was a perfect fit for iPad.Easy to use and quick to take in and out. My kids love to watch their favorite shows in the car with this. I’ve tried others but none compare to this sleek design.
3,Would have been great if it fit! The posts on my headrest were much thinner than the u-shape “clamps”.
4,Perfect My 1 year old grandson loves it.
3,It is sturdy. The hinges are stiff which is good. The hooks that hold the actual tablet however cannot accommodate a protective case. It will sit on it but fall off easily. If the hooks to hold the case were deeper I would have kept it.
4,Bought for a preteen's auto trip. She liked it. Worked well.
5,This works perfect! I installed it very quick. It holds the iPad Pro very well. It’s well made. It feels very sturdy so i was not worried about it falling out or breaking.
5,I bought two of these for my kids and they are Wonderfull. Easy to use and well worth the price
5,I love that I can put my cell in and it adjusts close to my peripheral vision! Holds the cell snugly and easy to adjust position. Takes less than 5 seconds to attach
3,Had to return... didn't fit well & wanted it more durable
5,Really easy to install
5,Great product but if your phone has a pop socket your phone will not fit.
5,Easy to install works great
5,Muy buen producto me escato excelente muy faci de intalar
3,This would be great if it fit a standard headrest but it's about half an inch from fitting properly. I just pushed the headrest down onto it to get it to work. Otherwise it swivels and holds perfectly.
3,Easty to install. The only thing is the tablet falls forward making it difficult to watch on the tablet.
5,Works good
5,Good product
5,Thanks
5,Good
5,It is perfect for a Nintendo Switch. It was very easy to mount on headrest ( Acura MDX ).
5,Worth every dollar
5,Loved it!
5,I didn't  know what I'd been missing all these years. Holds iphone or iPad.  Portrait or landscape. Easy to install. And a prefect travel companion for kids!
3,Does not fit between headrest of GMC Acadia the spring loaded action is literally a half an inch too big. Not sure if similar size SUVs will have the same issue or not. Other than not fitting between my head rest post seems like it would be a nifty item
5,Easy to installGreat product
4,Great for holding the phone also
5,Very good choise
4,I like the variation in size
5,Perfect
5,Great product! Very sturdy flexible easy to install and remove
3,Looks good and is sturdy. Does NOT work well with a Nintendo Switch. And does not extend to the middle of the front seats which is unfortunate. I will be ordering a different one.
5,Bought this for our kids to watch iPad or our phones in the car— spring loaded for easy install and very versatile. Many positions
5,Not really happy with it. Once I put my mini iPad in it it kept falling down. It would not hold at eye level. A waste of money.
5,Love this for for my grandsons iPad mini in the car.The ability to swing it back and forth to get it started and then back toward the baby saves my back from leaning over.
5,Works great...easy to put up and my almost 3 year old can reach the screen as needed!
5,I use this for my toddler on long car rides. I use my iPad in it. It’s flexible and can easily lock into the headrest. Highly recommended
5,This is actually better than I had expected! Fits my daughters iPad 10.5 inch. Strong and sturdy! Totally purchasing another one in the future!
5,Great product! Used for 10 hour car ride and held my tablet the whole time...really easy to adjust position so multiple kids can watch!
5,Super
5,Great for travel. My 3 year old daughter loves it!  She can eat and watch YouTube kids!  Game changer!!!
5,Made my recent road trip a lot more comfortable for people in the backseat.
3,It’s okay but it’s not good for back seat only good for front and it’s not helping me out for now still need t to wait for our baby get bigger
5,No problems installing using and storing.  Seems studding.
5,My 2 year old loves this and it prevents him from throwing his iPad when he has one of those 2 year old fits.
5,Fácil de instalar
2,Doesn't shorten enough to fit Mazda 6 headrests. Bought it to keep my toddler entertained on a car ride but unfortunately couldn't use it. Seems sturdy and seems like it would be easy to use if I COULD use it though.
5,They stay attached when driving over speed bumps .
5,Exactly what I needed for our child. Holds the Amazon fire and iPad mini perfectly and solidly. Highly recommend.
5,Awesome product
5,Love this! It works great for our daughter when we’re in the car and she wants to watch a movie.
5,Awesome very sturdy
5,great product to have for your children
2,Loved the concept and it the idea for my son while in his car seat on long drives... however it doesn’t fit on the back seats of my explorer. The gap between the head rest is too small... really wish it would have fit
5,Easy to mount. Plus the baby doesn’t have to hold the phone/ipad with his neck always bent downward to view. It twists and turns to the ideal position.
3,Doesn’t fit all car headrests
5,There's nothing to dislile about this. It's great.
5,Great product.  Simple to put in.  My kiddos and clients haven used them.  Both to high praise.
5,My daughter loves it.
5,I love it
5,We ordered two for a long road trip. Our boys loved having them. They were perfect for us.
5,Perfect for what I needed.
2,This looked promising and I was excited to receive it before our long drive for vacation however it did not fit the front driver or passenger headrest of my 2015 Chevy traverse so it had to be returned.
3,A good product... but wouldnt fit my car model... its a Brazilian Volkswagen Gol G4.. so I gave it to my Sister... it Works on her Hyundai HB20
5,Fast delivery sturdy product works effectively once the kid gets some practice
5,Useful
3,Had it for month and it’s not staying still
5,I love this product!!!! Totally recommend it!!
5,It helps allot specially on a long trip for the kids
5,Good for the money
3,Nice for phones but not sturdy enough for holding tablet my Fire tablet
5,We travel all over US w a 12 yr old. Works great
5,Love this perfect for my iPhone 7 keeps my toddler quite in the car :)
5,It support a iPad Pro a Nintendo switch too.  Easy to move around and support the weight too.
5,Set it up in about 12 seconds.  Well designed and seems durable.
1,We have the most popular kid friendly case on the iPad for my son... This doesnt expand enough to accommodate the case so its basically useless.
5,It works best with the case off but it holds my daughter’s 7th iPad perfectly
1,IT DON'T FIT FOR ALL HEADREST!!!
5,It's nice my granddaughter can look straight ahead and not down when in the car traveling
5,Both of my kids can watch the screen pretty good
1,My Honda Odyssey has headrest poles that are too thick in the middle seats. So if you are in the back of the van you cannot connect this product to the headrest in the middle row. The pole holders are not adjustable and only work on the front seat headrests in this van.
5,easy to install it has good support fits my ipad 3rd gen.
5,Super easy to install and exactly what we were looking for!
5,We used for our switch game in the car
5,Great for traveling
1,I didn’t like how it mounted so I ordered a different style. Stuck out way too far in the car also.
5,My son enjoys this car mount. Especially on our family trips.
5,Exactly what I was hoping it would be!
3,This product does not fit a 2013 through 2017 Chevy Traverse.
5,Works great in the car.  The kids love it.
5,Super convenient for traveling! Didn’t come with instructions but it was easy to figure out
5,Works great with my iPad. Holds it steady.
5,The product is sturdy and reliable.  Thank you.
5,Good product for entertaining the kids on a trip
5,Easy to use. Stays in lmace
5,😍
5,Fit to my iPad 10.1 inch.
5,Perfect for road trips! Fits iPad perfectly!
5,This product holds up well. My daughter loves it.
5,Its easy for my ten year old son to use
5,Works great for cell phone and a 10" tablet
5,Very easy to use and set uo
5,Wow wish I would I found this along time ago
1,I was so excited about this but after the first use it dented my iPad! The description on this item says that it will fit an iPad 10.2 and that's the size I have. I couldn't believe this. I took it out from the holder and realized what it had done and I was horrified. My iPad isn't even a month old. I never thought this holder would damage it. DO NOT BUY! I WANT A REFUND AND THE COMPANY TO PAY TO HAVE MY IPAD FIXED!
5,Muy práctico
5,Great product. Better than I expected!
2,Did not fit my vehicle but I gave to family and worked fine in their's
5,Que es  facil de usar
5,Great way to keep granddaughters occupied on car trips
2,It was too big to go between the bars and didn’t shrink down enough. Sent it back
3,Nothing to say about this product.
5,Professionally made vey sturdy
5,Works fine little flimsy but sturdy enough
1,The description for the spacing between headrest posts is functionally inaccurate. The photos state 3.8” between posts the written description states 4.7”. Neither is accurate as you actually need over 5” to clear the u-shaped brackets. Unless you are able to remove the headrest and slip this over the top do not expect it to work unless you have over 5.125” between the inside edges of your posts.
1,No se adapta a cualquier carro tengo 3 diferentes carros y en ni guno se pudo adapatar reciente mente tenemos un nuevo carro y finalemnte en ese si pudimos instalarlo pero con la novedad de de no tiene la fuerza para detener al 100% ni siquiere un celular
3,Not bad product for the price
5,muy practico
5,Great product
1,Just removed my child’s iPad that has been in the car overnight in the middle of the night the pressure from the device messed up the screen!This is a iPad mini. Well within the specific measurements for this item.I AM SO UPSET.I have no idea who to contact what to do only write this review to WARN PARENTS NOT TO BUY!!
5,Very sturdy
3,It’s ok
3,Ehhh it’s okay not very sturdy
1,As others have pointed out the headrest mount portion of this device is NOT a universal adjustable span. Some model automobiles like our Subaru Outback 2016 are not compatible with this spring-mounted adjustable span device. It would be very helpful for purchasers if the minimum and maximum distance between the mounts were listed on the description.
5,Awesome product
1,in the pictures the item look great.  I will admit it was given 50/50 reviews.  I wish it had longer extension AND it will NOT fit on all head rest as stated. WILL RETURN ASAP.
5,Good product!
5,You can adjusted as needed.
1,This doesn't even hold a phone it will fall out and hit your baby. Poor design.
2,Product will not support itself between our headrest posts at 6.5" apart.  Will have to return.  Other than that product is of good build quality.  Measure before purchase.  If your headrest posts are more than 6" apart I would find another product.
5,Great product
3,Doesn't fit headrest.
5,I love it
5,Awesome
1,I must have gotten a the wrong item because this will barely stretch to fit a phone. Not a fire tablet. Returning
5,Good product
2,Keep in mind before buying this is not for a rear facing seat.  The gadget does not work on backseat headrests. Otherwise it’s great for forward facing.  I liked it just frustrated it did not fit the seat.
2,This did not fit my gmc yukon 01 it was too lose I really wanted it to worm
5,Perfecto
1,Did not expand wide enough to securely sit in the headrest mounts of any of the cars i tested it on. It would have only need to expand another centimeter but seemed to fall short on all the cars i have access to.
1,Dislike that it had missing peices now it garbage
1,Did not like it at all
1,product is good quality not so good.It will start breaking due to car temp. I dont live in a hit place but heat started making pieces fall from this
1,Doesn’t fit the Rogues headrest bars are too close together. had to tape it to the headrest for our trip.
1,Will not hold any kind of weight and a 10” tablet is way to heavy for it. I will be sending it back it might work for a cell phone
2,Was a little loose when in place. After using it for only 3 weeks it broke when I adjusted it. Not worth it.
1,Does not work for suburu suv
2,When you install it  doesn't get tied.
1,I was unable to fit it into the headrest of my 2018 Forester. I can’t comment on anything else since they were never installed
1,It did not fit my type of headrest
1,Not very sturdy and doesn’t fit tight to the uprights on the headrest.
2,Broke on me after using jt for a week
1,Didn’t come in a box and won’t fit the seat of my truck......disappointed
1,Does not fit my head rest in my car
1,The iPad was too heavy. The rotating ball meant to rotate the screen can’t handle the weight. Also with the iPad case on the holder wasn’t large enough to grasp the edges.
1,Doesn’t fit my Subaru Ascent.
1,It says it’s for a tablet and doesn’t hold one. Can only hold phones. Do not recommend for tablet use
4,Upon receipt I was put off by the damaged box with tape over one end. I thought this might be a returned/repackaged/resold unit. The unit appeared to be new and unused and I did not notice any damage. Easy to install and while I've not extensively tested this it did pass the 'shake and wiggle' test holding my iPad on the extended arm.  So far this appears to be something that will help in longer road trips with the kids in the back seat.  I'll update this review after using it for a bit.
1,Doesnt even fit the ipad i bought it for! Way smaller than advertised.
1,It’s a little small to fit on the car headrest.
1,Make sure you measure your car's headrest before purchasing. This product doesnt extend to fit.
1,It's not stable
1,Cheap
4,Easy to install and although my headrest was a little wide (2008 Chevy Tahoe) pushing the headrest down kept the bar in place. Could not use however because it kept losing it’s tightness and would end up facing the tablet down during our drive. Also the grips are very super thin I had to remove the thick cover from my child’s tablet which i don’t like doing. My mother tried using her phone (with thin case) but bc the grips were so thin we were scared it would pop off in my child’s face.
1,I order one a while back and it didn’t last long broke with the simplest movement . Decided to buy another one. And it broke during  assembly. 😬🤷‍♀️ Wouldn’t  give it a third try . Sorry
5,This is just the coolest gadget for our SUV and practical for our son to play some videos and stuff on. It holds our tablet great and can position it for our 2 1/2-year-old. the cool thing with it being on the headrest bars is he can not reach it to change or touch the touch screen and mess it up. This is awesome for the little money.
5,My son has a ROUGH time with car rides...Now I can let him watch his favorite little nursery rhyme shows in the backseat.  This is seriously a game-changer!  And for the cost you really can't beat it!
5,Easy to use and install! We have a SUV and it fits inside the headrest really nicely. Doesn’t store slim when not in use if it still attached to the headrest.But overall well worth it!
5,I bought this for my son for long car trip so I don’t have to hold it for you(while sitting in the back). As perfect when i have to drive. Stay in place and keep him Entertain
5,My kids loves it!.
5,These are great! Bought for a trip and they worked great for both tablet and switch! Good buy!
5,This is a perfect solution for a tablet holder for my vehicle.The swivel feature is excellent.I love that I can use it as a stand as well.I would definately buy again.Highly recommend it.
5,This mount is GREAT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
5,This item should come standard with on the Nintendo Switches!
5,Easy to put together and install. It fits our iPad easily and both kids can see it without straining to see.
5,Easy to install
5,It’s perfect! My 2 year old uses it cause her car seats in the middle seat. It’s sturdy! She kicked it a few times while it was holding her iPad and it’s still there :)
3,Did not fit out headrest but we were able to make it work.
5,love it alot
5,Me encantó! Es muy fácil de colocar buena calidad muy buen soporte.
5,Works great.  No more neck cramps for my daughter on car rides.
5,Was easy to install and remove if needed.  Lots of positioning options.  Works great.
5,Me encantó. Super fácil de instalar y quitar. Ahora mi bebe podrá ver sus muñes desde el asiento del carro. Muy buena imbersion la recomiendo
5,just as shown in picture great for my toddler when we are on the road:)
5,Very good product.I wasn’t able to fit the iPad though.Easy to install.
5,Good
5,So easy to install and use.
5,I can play some games that required the joy con in hand now and makes it easy to play and view!
5,I’ve actually purchased two of these now for my kids in the car and they were great and are easy to transfer between cars when we need to
5,Exactly what I’ve been searching. Great quality!
5,Perfect for movies in the back seat of the car
4,Fair
5,Helps with the long drive and kids don’t have to be looking down and messing up their posture
5,No more screaming babies during long car rides!!! Product is very sturdy. I expect it to hold up for some time.
5,This has been one of the best investments I have ever made! Always an issue with the kids in the car and the iPad. Now I can prop it up and put a movie on with no issues! I might end up getting a second one for my oldest that sits in the back. She is jealous she doesn't have one lol!
5,Fix just perfect. Easy to install..
2,If you drive a car and you NEVER make a turn get this.  But if you’re like me a normal driver who would turn left and right on streets then you should definitely NOT GET THIS. ❌❌❌Installation ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: super easy! Squeeze the thing and put it under the headrest and you’re golden!Functionality ⭐️⭐️:  If you make a turn at all this thing WILL SWIVEL.  The first and last time we used it I had it behind the driver’s headrest and my 3 kids were sitting in the second and third row.  I had it stretched out all the way so the person on the third row could see the iPad.  I constantly got “MOM! I can’t see.  The iPad is doing that thing again mom!” because it swiveled behind my head and I had try to not take my eyes off the road to adjust it CONSTANTLY.  It was a HUGE distraction.  So I decided to just turn the iPad off and decided this iPad holder has got to go.Overall:  ❌❌❌👎🙅‍♀️
5,I bought 2 and use them in a Jeep and a Kia Soul. They work great
5,So great I bought 3! Looks great in my VW Atlas black and red match nicely. Kiddos are loving them in the longer rides.
5,Easy to install and my grand baby is happy while traveling.
5,So easy to install and definitely sustains my kids switch for when we take long trips
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
2,This is not very sturdy. Moves to much while driving. The foam pads came off so now it won’t hold anything. Waste of $$
5,Good
2,Works well tho its a bit difficult to get the tablet in place.Update:It broke a month later...
5,An effective and high-quality product
5,It's a good quality
4,Seems to be good quality but was just a hair too big to work with my 2021 Subaru Crosstrek. I was able to get it on but then the posts didn’t line up with my seat. I measured but it didn’t fit. Just wanted to save other Crosstrek owners some time.
4,It’s very good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it turns a bit when the car turns.
4,So nice! But a little short ;(My boy needs that
5,When I tell you this is perfect for road trips with the kids I need to purchase a second one because my kids were entertained up untill they did not want to watch the same thing. Love that you can pivit product
5,Bought as a gift and for one of our vehicles.  So happy with the ability to move and reposition as needed.  Great purchase qnd definitely recommend.
4,Pretty good stand for price only issue is I have an iPhone pro max it sometimes will weigh the stand down if we run over a small bump in the road. Not sure how this thing is supposed to hold up a tablet
5,Extension is helpful!
4,I bought this for my Silverado product itself isn't that bad the issue was the Silverado headrest brackets arw wider than this product is able to extend. But with a very slight modification with some ducktape problems fixed more than likely I'll give to family as a "SUPRISE" gift and order a larger one...
5,Super easy to use and really sturdy. Not worried about a phone or tablet falling out of it onto my little one.
5,My little six years old son is happy with this product better than expected
5,Work very well for intended purpose. Seems to hold firm even on bumpy roads which I feel is important for a device that holds an expensive tablet. Would recommend.
4,We have a Kids Amazon Fire Tablet and in order to fit in the holder we had to remove the case. (No big deal) We are using it for vacation in our 2020 Ford Explorer and the tension rod is too wide for the headrests. We were able to wrap the “arm” in between the headrest and the top of the seat and push the headrest all the way down. Its holding just fine but not ideal. We will try it in our 2020 Subaru too but haven’t had a chance to yet.
5,This product is perfect for long car trips. Fits my switch perfectly for the price I say this is money well spent.
5,Worked great with the switch. Easy to install and pop off the headrests.
5,It can move around freely and the part that holds your phone and turn in a full circle. It holds my s22 ultra with ease and it's not hard to get my phone in it. Compacts away neatly and out of the way for people coming in and out of the car.
5,Love this product. It was super easy to install and works with everything iPads fire tablet Nintendo switch even iPhone fits. There super sturdy and grip the iPad very well. I’m telling all parents with kids to get these. Perfect for road trips. I only wish I found these sooner.
5,This is the best i can’t believe that I didn’t know about it before its so cool and it fits perfect it every device i would definitely buy another one. 5 stars
5,Buen producto muy practico.
5,Cheap and easy way to mount the kids kindle fire we purchased. Also works for our Iphones.
5,Love this item makes traveling with granddaughter lot easier and safer
5,Works great we will purchase another in the future!
5,Kids now can eat in car and not scream they cant see the phone because its hands free and adjustable so that every one can see ot and folds back up like its nor even there fits and adjusts to bars on head rest and cell size this saved me
4,Decent but not entirely stable especially in the extended mode on rough roads not quiet too there's a bit of rattle
5,Perfect for kids/adults on road trips. Very good and easy to watch whilst in the back seat. Whilst on trips for work in the evenings to set up and have it sturdy whilst cooking in the van is ideal!
5,Mein Sohn muss seit der Halterung das Handy nicht mehr in der Hand halten und kann so gerade im Sitz sitzen und hat danach keine Schmerzen am Rücken.
1,I have and old iPad and the height is 9.5”. The description of this item says it suits iPad up to 10.5” but my iPad is too big for the holder when I try it out. The description is clearly wrong.
4,Von der Qualität her ist die Halterung OK. Einziger Mangel ist das letzte bewegliche Element.Da es sich nicht fest drehen lässt wie die anderen Gelenke ist dies bei dem Gewicht eines Tablets sehr locker und schwingt in den Kurven hin und her. Ich habe es jetzt mit Sekundenkleber voll laufen lassen damit es bombenfest ist. Dadurch sind wir sehr zufrieden damit.
5,Passt sich durch den Federmechanismus perfekt an den Abstand der Montierung der Kopfstützen an. Die Lage des Tablets bleibt stabil und kann vertikal und horizontal verwendet werden.
5,Super
5,Einfache Montage. Sehr stabil und absolut praktisch. Gerne wieder.
4,Sehr zufrieden damitzu jeden empfehlen
5,Sehr zufrieden!!!
5,HelloGood quality  no asseble needed.Lenght is perfect for 10" tablet.No wibration when you drive.However  arms lenght is too little for phone.Thanks
4,Bis jetzt alles ok ...Hat meine kinder gefallen 😙
4,in unser Auto Opel Zafira. Allerdings nicht in einen Renault Scenic was ich irgendwie komisch finde ansonsten Stabil und praktisch… würde ich wieder kaufen
5,Es war sehr einfach zu montieren und hält auch super das Tablet wackelt fast gar nicht. Für diesen Preis ist es sehr zuempfehlen .
5,Für die Kinder damit sie im Auto was anschauen können. Hat sich gut gehalten und ein Ipad wird damit super gehalten. Passt
4,Stabiles Produkt mit sehr guter Qualität. Einfach anzubringen.Nur die Drehknöpfe zum Fixieren stören da die Kopfstütze nicht mehr komplett nach unten gefahren kann. Das erzeugt Sicherheitsbedenken beim Beifahrer/Fahrer. Bitte nachbessern. Sonst empfehlenswert
3,Der Arm müsste länger seinDas Tablet liegt auf dem Sitz auf
2,Product comes with low quality fitting not worth to buy
4,I was pleasantly surprised at how effective this is given the price point. Easy to use and holds the kid's Amazon Fire Tablet in place perfectly well.
2,Leider kann ich die guten Rezessionen hier nicht nachvollziehen. Das Gestell ist wackelig ohne Ende. Meinen Kids ist das iPad mehrmals während der Fahrt heruntergefallen. Entweder weil es aus den Klemmen gesprungen ist die zu wenig Zugkraft haben oder weil das Gelenk aufgeklappt ist. Die Stellschraube ist bei uns bombenfest zugezogen und der Arm bewegt sich dennoch.Keine Kaufempfehlung...
5,Arrived quite quickly sturdier than previous stands we had cleverly designed but a little bit of effort for use with larger iPads with covers. Using these with the Amazon fire HD is a breeze though. Totally recommend.
5,Haben 2 Stück im Auto wirklich toll
1,Ist nicht für tablet geeignet.Das Kugelgelenk hält trotz festem Verschrauben das Tablet nicht aus.Es kippt nach paar Sekunden direkt.Haben es extra für den Urlaub gekauft für ein tablet. Echt ärgerlich.. Ich musste es ständig wieder aufrichten..Würde es nicht nochmal kaufen!
5,Es macht was es soll …..
1,Wieso für etwas werben was nicht passt. Geht leider zurück
5,Little expensive but great product
5,This is a quality unit which works exactly as described. Take note of the negative reviews and most appear to be due to (a) the unit not fitting the car or (b) the unit not holding the device. You can avoid both these problems by measuring before you buy. This has saved me buying any expensive car tv unit and has lasted for months with no issues and expect it will last for a lot longer!
1,I returned this product because it didnt fit my car’s headrest. But the return havent reflected yet in the system. Been 10 days already.
