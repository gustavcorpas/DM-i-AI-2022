5,This weekend I went on a family road trip. While we made some fantastic memories we also made each other absolutely insane! However this would have been a LOT worse had we also been fighting over power cords for our many devices. This little plug was a lifesaver. Even with short cords it made it possible to plug it in the front seat and have 2 cords reach the backseat passengers but with the long cords we actually had access to all 5 from any seat in our car. I am not techy enough to know if they charged slower when all the plugs were engaged (probably?) but it wasn't noticable if they did. Note all of our devices used were just Android phones or tablets (and a Nintendo Switch for a bit) so I can't vouch for whether or could have handled like a laptop. But for our purposes it was perfect. I'm never going in the car more than 5 miles from home without it!
5,This is just what I needed. I had a few peripherals I had like BT and a dashcam that I wanted to wires hidden so I used the extend usb's for those and the remainder as my phone charger. Works great with my Samsung wireless phone mount. I got two one for each of my cars. They were slightly different versions but similar and both work great.
4,My car doesn't have chargers at the back. I was undesided to buy it. But  i gave it a chance. It's still working eventhough the high tempeture. It has 4 usb connectors.2 direct to the charger and 2 at the end of the cord. I don't like the cord is too long but it has a clip to place it at the back packet of the front sit.
5,Charges my phones pretty fast and it does the job! No complaints!
5,I have a Car mount wireless charger. A Dash Camera  that records inside the cabin and out the front. And LED Color changing lights all plugged into the device. Rand the Cory’s under the center console and use a thin Mounting tape for the the second set of USB because my civic doesn’t have anything the clip to. Makes it grate for my Lyft customers and family to charge Their devices. My Civic only has one Car port and so this was the best thing ever. At some point it stoped work and I took it out and pressed on the metal connectors to make sure the the fuse didn’t blow or melt. Plugged it back in and switch right back on I’ve had mine in use and still working for about 7months and still is the first one I bought.
4,Rep from company reached out and expressed their apologies for the damage. A new item was sent to me. Very thoughtful and professional act on her part I have not used the product yet again. I’m sure it will work fine. The other one may have just been a malfunction.
5,Hope i can reorder.
5,The support team is incredible. I had some concerns about the durability of the unit. I received responses immediately by Amy until she made sure I was taken care of. Great unit. Great charging power. The LED screen is not as bright or bluish as on the listing but it works. Not sure about durability as it seems thin and plastic but hey it has a lifetime warranty and they respond quickly and really seem to care. Definitely would buy from this company again. Haven't tried all the ports at the same time but it does super charge my galaxy fold.
5,Works like a charm!
4,My ONLY gripe is that the clip on it should be turned opposite. Because the weight of the 2 wires for the back seat pulls it off whatever it's clipped to. If it was flipped it would stay on.
5,My previous charger kept disconnecting from the outlet but this is snug and I didn’t have to worry about having a low battery after using for navigation during a long road trip. I didn’t have a need for all the ports on this trip but confident it will work just as needed and described when I do. A lifetime warranty adds to the knowledge that I made the right purchase.
5,Just got this it arrived on time (even if it was late it's no big deal with me) and it really helps. Got for my 2 phones I use for Uber & Lyft use it for my dashcam and now I have extra plugs available for me to hook up 2 tablets in my car so people can watch TV or play games during their rides. A big time MUST GET.
5,Bueno
5,Perfect
5,As advertised.
5,This company and product turned out to be better than I expected. The product actually does help charge both android and iPhone quickly and simultaneously. The materials that it’s made of aren’t flimsy either they it was worth price . Also at first I didn’t receive the correct items at first but customer service was very accommodating and resolved the issue quickly. I would purchase from the company again
4,Good item would buy again
5,So far works great charges fast provides enough for the kids could be a bit longer but otherwise so far so good!
4,Worth purchasing
5,I’m Uber driver and this charger is really good to work because we need to use for camera phone and when passenger needs… I received the order one day before. I recommend!
5,This product is fantastic and works great absolutely love it. Customer service is amazing. If you have any questions problems or concerns just send them a message and they will respond immediately. That’s a major plus as customer service and company standing behind their product goes a long way. I highly recommend product and purchasing from this company. Again product is flawless and customer service/company is professional responsive and backs their products. Amy was fantastic!!!
5,A trucker's best friend. Get you one of these and you won't be disappointed.
5,Simple yet gives me everything I need.
5,The cord link is plenty long enough to reach the back so my kids can plug their tablets in
5,Bueno
5,Pretty durable good length. I’m happy overall!!!
4,So far I like the charger it allows us to charge multiple devices in the car at the same time.  I am happy with this purchase so far.
5,I use this charger with my coworkers while driving to/from a job so everyone can play their devices at once!!
4,Power output seems to be lacking as it takes forever to charge phone
5,Good
5,Cord feels a lil flimsy and the power 🔋 charge is pretty good so far. Dnt have any problems with it.
5,This this is great charges fast and it perfect for ride share driver to have chargers for passengersLove this thing
4,Charges well and doesn't take up much space
4,We've only had had this a short while  but I purchased it primarily for a family move of over 2300 miles.  Slow miles!!!!  Both my daughter and I were able to keep our phones charged and my Grandson could watch Netflix on his tablet all at once.  It did not overheat nor overheat our devices as other reviews have stated.  These are NOT fast charging  but if that's not a priority I feel it's a good value and product.
5,We needed a better charging system for our RV trailer; we have several devices that we take camping with us and the charging station that is above my head in the trailer only has 2 USB ports (and one car charging port).  This charger allows us to use the faster charging port and charge multiple devices at once.  The long length on the extension allows us to have some of the devices near the seating area in the trailer.I was contacted by Amy in customer care contacted me to ensure that I received this in a timely manner and that it worked.  I did receive it on-time and testing it with my car all 5 ports work for both Samsung Galaxy and iPhone phones.
5,My daughter loved it.
5,The product was great for my husband’s GMC Truck.
5,This allowed for 5 devices to charge at once! Cord length is awesome for the back seat. I definitely recommend!
5,Love this product ot work well with all my  Devices in my car
5,I used this product to charge phones for passengers in the back seat of the car/truck.  So far it’s living up to the advertised billing.
5,Love seeing the voltage as soon as I plug it into the charging port. Usually 12.4-12.6V. Now I’m thinking it could be very helpful in winter to let me know the battery is running low.The front USB-C port works for my iPhone and iPad speed seems fine in charging. I really like how the extension clip can extend from the front console back around the center console and clip on the seat pockets. Haven’t used the rear one yet but it will be really nice for road trips.Overall great product for cheaper than the Apple single port charger. Would definitely recommend.
5,I liked this car charger. It has a very long cord. Seems to charge fast. Lots of ports. Great value. Have seen and bought in the past worst products in the category and this one standsout as very good. Good value
4,Works
5,Works great! Very handy that there is a wire going to the back seats.
5,Mine doesnt work properly but to have a 5 in 1 is epic ! The cord reaches to the back seat and has a small clip so you can clip it to stay up if wanted . I will be ordering another in place of this and i hope it works !UPDATE 7-16-21I am traveling and on the go at the moment but had to update my review from 2 stars to 5 stars and explain . I received a message from tollefes customer service after they saw my review and they asked if they could help in any way and i explained that i am on the road and cant do a return right now so i bought a second one bc my first wasn't working properly and they offered me a replacement or a refund . Now let me tell you most companies don't care to check up on their customers after they see the reviews but this company does and deserves all of the stars . They didn't hound me as i have seen some say they weren't pushy and they didnt ask me to update my review i wanted to update it to tell my experience so otherw can see everyones experience isn't the same . If for some reason you need customer service they are willing to help in fact as i said above they reached out to me just to check to see if i was satisfied and to me that is everything ! I am adding pics as well . The box and opening it as well as the clip on a plastic box cover bc those are pretty thick and it fits just fine i have also clipped it to the back of the seat in the car where i have an organizer hanging and it fits but this is just to show you for reference . It looks small but the clip does work . Thank you for your outstanding customer service and making sure i am satisfied i truly appreciate it !
5,I got this for my driving and it's epic! Works perfect as a back spot to charge phones in the back!
5,Love this split charger! We have a large SUV that’s 3 rows with 3 kiddos in the back and 5 when we’re babysitting and this charger has made life so much easier. They use to fight over who would get to charge their device but now that we have enough ports and enough power for all of their devices it’s been quite quiet back there. Lol. 10 out of 10 recommend!
5,I brought one because of the length of the cord. Everyone who gets in my car sees it and wants it now I've bought 3to replace the first one I bought now I give them the Amazon website to purchase their own.
3,Galaxy S22 will not charge at normal rate build quality is worse than what you would expect. Then again it is cheap.
5,The ability to have additional charging ports in the back seat for my grandchildren has been a game changer since they never remember to plug in and charge at home.
3,I didn’t like that the clip part was not wide enough to clip to anything
4,As advertised. Charges multiple phones  single fast charge. I have the dongle mounted to a rear seatback headrest  for rear passenger use.Works  get it.
4,As a rideshare drive I am always asked for the ability to charge passengers phones. I have multi plugs in my center arm rest but it is cumbersome to plug in phones. So I found the Tollefe Multi 5 Ports (3+2) USB car charger and my problem is solved.  My front cigarette lighter plug allows for my phone to be always available and my wife's phone when we are together.  The 5' ft cable allows for the two additional ports to be accessible to the rear passengers. They either have their own cables or I offer my additional ones for use.  Now here is when the 5th star is LOST!  Unless your front seat has a back pocket that is paper thin you will break off the clip trying to attach the 2-port adapter for back seat use JUST LIKE I DID TO MINE!!  But resolved it by use of a 1" square of velcro and problem solved.  Other than the clip not being what I needed the over all device is spot on!!
5,I purchased this charger and it looks like a great product but unfortunately it would not work with my very old vehicle. I worked with this company and they worked with me to get the correct item to work with my vehicle. I'm sure this charger would have worked great and the new one they sent me works perfect! Their products are not cheaply made and are good quality.
5,I couldn't believe how small this is I really thought I dint get the correct order..I was wrong. It WAS the 5 device charger..and it DOES charge really fast!  so far awsome  real test will be when our 12 yr ol granson is in the back seat and needs a charge on his cell he'll be so surprised I got a charger he dint believe they made them for us that dont have a USB ports in their oler suburban trucks (like mine is)  thrilled to have a charger makes me feel right at home cuz the last cell I carried around was in 2007 and the chargers were jus like this :)  I'm a happy camper thank you!
5,Having this many ports is a dream come true lol! When my husband wants to charge his phone and headphones and I’m doing the same and also charging my laptop or something we never have enough space and someone has to suffer. This thing charges fast and offers lots of plug in options. Doesn’t take up a lot of space and is now a permanent fixture in our car!
5,I was waiting my order as we always fight for charger in the car. I have a big family and this is a great addition to our van. A great value for a complete set.Durable braided cords withstand many uses without falling apart. Now everyone is happy.
5,Great charger perfect cord length for both vehicles and CHARGES the Nintendo switch!
3,Slow Charging on Samsung Galaxy smartphone (Note 8)-(Galaxy S22 ultra)
5,Thanks very nice
5,Me gusta mucho la longitud de adapta perfectamente a la necesidad y carga bien rápido.
5,The length allowed my children in the back to easily charge their tablets on the go.
5,Melissa and Amy in customer service are great. Plus this has lifetime warranty.
5,Awesome for large vehicle with 3rd row seats & people needing to charge. Very convenient.
5,This came on time works as expected and doesn't disappoint.
4,The tripod so far has worked good for holding my phone as intended. The height and portability is wonderful. My only issue is the tilt angle of the camera/phone when on the mount. The notches that lock in place when you adjust the angle are not granular enough so either my lens is looking to high or too low. I had to put a notepad under one leg to get the camera lens pointed the right angle. I have since ordered a ball head mount to go on top of this tripod to give me more flexibility with the camera angle.
5,Great product and great customer service. Amy was the best!
5,Great for family trips on my 2004 Chevy Express 1500 Van
5,Great purchase. Charged an iPad iPhone and tablet on a long road trip and had no issues.
5,I like the length of the cord and the extra 2 charging ports for my passengers in the backSimplifies the need for them to ask for charging when now it’s readily available .
4,Definitely does what it says . Wish Chord was longer however .
5,This is great it provides power for the front passengers and also to my kids in the back for long trips.  I love it.  My only complaint is that the clip for the extension isn't very flexible and I had a hard time finding a spot for it in the back seat of my vehicle so it is currently just loose.  I am thinking of using some double-sided velcro.  But this saved me hours of wiring.  Also since this is portable I have taken this on vacation to use in rental cars which is awesome and something I hadn't though of.
3,The extention piece doesn't work
4,It works great I just wished that it had a bigger hook etc to fasten to any or all seats etc. I have mine hooked onto the rear of my Rogues rear pocket behind the seat it's on there firm even with passengers it stays put. On my girls Honda CRV it doesn't fasten well to her rear pocket via it's too thick to attach it too so I try to slot it on the headrest seat covers it'll stay sometimes then other times it'll fall off a few times 😑. 😁Overall it's very convenient to have. Although I wished that it was a quick charger it'll still charge your items though 😉.
5,I bought 2 of these. Tried both. It does not charge at 3.1 Amps. But at 1 amp.  I ruled out my cords and used a different  brand charger that did work. See photos. A Samsung Note 10 23% charged. This charger would take 3hrs and 9 minutes.  Different  brand 1hr 25 min.
5,I waited too long to send back  Bought in August but I am not in my car often to use it.  it must have a short because it turns on and off and doesn't stay on so basically useless.  But maybe I just got a lemon?  Window to return was a month ago.  Dang.UPDATE:  even though window to return was past I received a very nice note stating they would refund of send out a new one.  This is from only placing a review.  I am happy with that level of customer service.  I like the product I just think I was that lucky customer that got one that didn't function.  I will give it another try!
5,This was great to keep 4 kids charged up on our trip to florida. The only design piece I wish would be different is the clip on the extension piece it would be better if it was more of a spring loaded design to be able to attach easier in places around the car to keep it from getting tangled. Otherwise it did exactly what it needed to do!
5,I needed something for myself and for our 5 year old who loves to take his Kindle everywhere. This fits and works perfectly in my Kia Soul. Its long enough for me to hook it on the back seat where I have a holder for books and other stuff. Now if ever I need to charge his Kindle or anyone else sitting in the back needs it I know it will work flawlessly. Only had to use it once  but it kept the charge didn't fall out of the Kindle or cause any issues with my usage.  I keep my phone charged all the time while I'm driving. The look is clean and not an eye sore. Looks to be made well. Glad I found this product and had my husband take a look at it also I think it was a great buy.  ~Michelle K
5,Works great I use it everyday
1,What I like:Extension for passenger side of camper van so my wife can conveniently charge her devices.5 ports 3 on driver side 2 on passenger side.Things I don't like:Orange USB outlets. Generally orange outlets are high output QC2 or QC3. Not these. This unit puts out a rock solid .94 amps at 5.2v. Remember back when you got that new high technology 3g Razr flip phone? Yeah. This charger is good for that phone. For today's rechargeable devices? No good. Less than 100mah in 5 minutes. This thing puts out 1 milliampere every 5 seconds. If you have a dead phone with a 2000mah battery it will take FOREVER to charge. Don't even think this is going to keep your kids iPad alive while you're on that road trip to Disneyland.My 20000mah power bank with QC3 charges the same phone at least 7x faster than this charger.My QC3 house charger is even faster.The moral of this review is do your due diligence. This is not a quick charge device. It is a very slow charge device made to look like a quick charge device. It uses the color convention for quick charge devices and fools you into thinking that's what you're getting. Do yourself a favor don't waste your.money on this one.***Update***  This companay has sent me over a dozen emails imploring me to remove this review or at least change it enough that they will be in a more favorable position. They have offered me a refund. They have offered me gift cards. Credit on Amazon. Payment by mail.What can I say? I gave an honest review of a product that I think has been marketed and produced in such a way as to mislead the consumer. I still have the item. I've refused to change my review unless they changed their marketing strategy or minimally stated the product specifications honestly and ultimately have let them know that if they continue to bother me about my review I will report them to Amazon. I appreciate that they are trying to earn a living just like you and me but this company currently has 2800+ reviews on this product. That's $47k just on reviewed purchases and they have a large catalog of products on sale at Amazon... I wish I was able to say something decent about these guys.
5,I was using this in my over the road tractor trailer. The extension connection reached to my bunk which was convenient to not have to move my cords off the dash every night.
5,It fits great and it’s very sturdy clipped onto the back of my front passenger’s seat.  My ride share passenger’s love it and it’s used all the time know.Great product 👍
5,Finally can charge my phone while I’m driving using my GPS all the time. Love it.
5,Charger works great for our long road trips. The cord is long enough to reach the backseat. Charger did not over heat with continuous use .
4,Basically it's a charge with an additional extended charging port  (for 2) and the base has 3 USB ports (ideally for the front I suppose). Works great however I broke the clipping piece for the extended cord. I don't think it's really designed to fit the back of seat or I'm just too rough either way it's still worth the buy. The wire just runs between the seat anyway.
4,Long enough to reach the back seat.
5,Lightweight powerful and very useful.  Nice - it's 'fine' feeling light in weight. Plug in has 3 one wire out had one unit with two USB ports.
5,This is a really great product it has multiple chargers one can stretch all the way to the back of my minivan which is perfect while I’m charging my phone upfront while my daughters can you charging your phone in the back it works really good for long trips and it’s very convenient it is also extremely reasonably priced I would definitely recommend and I will definitely get again the charge seems pretty fast it doesn’t take very long and you can store it on the way when you’re not using it
3,I used with no issues for awhile but then it blew my fuse in the car. I have used others that had more plugged in no problem.I replaced the fuse and it blew again. I updated from 15amp to 25amp and seems to be working fine again now.
5,Okay this is one simple solution that powers 5 devices simultaneously while utilizing one 12-volt power plug. We drive a small vehicle that has only one 12-volt power plug and 4 passengers. Perfect solution for needs!
4,This worked great for our family of five on a massive family road trip. We drive a mini van- so the cord reached to the middle of the van. You will have to have long cords to connect the kids in the back. Other than that- no problems.
4,Got a new charger to provide charging to backseat passengers. At times it gets a little warm but it's expected when you have multiple devices. Cord length is good. Bad: the LED lights inside are too dim you cannot tell which porta are available at night. The clip on the charger is way too thin and will not clip to anything without breaking off.
4,The good news is that it works . It fits in the car cigarette lighter fitting so it uses the current to supply the three charging ports on the connector and two more which are on a cable for the rear passengers to charge their phones. The  problem is that the cord is just too short .
5,UPDATE: So after I left my unsatisfied review a customer service rep Annie reached out and made things right. She sent me a new charger that works great! I am very pleased with this experience and their kind customer service!!Over the last 3 months this charger has been used about 10 times. After the first use two charger ports stopped working. Though out the handfuls of times it was used it no longer works.
5,This is perfect! Great for long car trips with the family. No one complains about their devices not being able to get charged.
4,I decided to buy a more efficient charger after my original went missing. I wanted options like length and 2+ ports. I impulsively bought this on a whim and I have already used it once to my satisfaction. I would rexommend
4,Está perfecto para compartir la energía en varios celulares
5,Muy bueno para la familia que viaja a menudo
5,Just what I was looking for. A discreet multi-port charger.
5,I have had 3 or 4 adapters go bad on me very quickly  - this seems better made . Good adapter
5,Love the fact the is long and it has the extra cord for my kids on the back ofThe car they love it now they won’t have to fight for having to wait on someone to use it they all can have there devices charge at the same time on road trips
5,Worked pretty well for our road trip. We were able to plug four things at a time and not have any significant decrease in charge to all of the things we had charging. There is a clip on the 2 charger component which is attached to the 5 ft cord so you can clip it somewhere to keep in place. It’s perfect for charging items in the back seat when there are no outlets for charging.
5,They went All out to make it right for me.Thanks Amy!!!And Tollefe Team.
4,Wasn’t what I hoped for.  Customer Service excelled at making it right.
5,Exactly as advertised. Works perfectly!!!
5,This was a perfect addition for a family road trip.  The adapter provided amble ports for everyone's devices and more importantly supplied adequate power as well.  It wasn't anemic like others chargers I've used in the past and the secondary dual plug extension was a life saver for those in the back seat.  Everyone was happy and that made for a great trip.  I highly recommend this adapter as it's the best I've used to date.
5,Product is as advertised. Cords are sufficient length to allow devices in back seat to plug in. Nice handy tool on long car trips.
2,Wouldn’t order again. Seriously thinking of returning
4,Es bueno para poder hacer más conecciones
4,Haven't had any problems with it.  All slots work.  It does what it's suppose to.  Can't complain. 4 stars because for a 5 star it needs to have that wow factor & it doesn't.
4,works great has good length kids can charge their stuff in the back seat and have some in front to
4,It was broken right out of the box... Fuse was fine. Seller reimbursed me so they are excellent people to deal with. But the product i cannot say the same about.
5,I have a dash cam so I am covered when there are commies blocking the road.My ford has a couple of usb ports but both the car entertainment system and the dash cam BOTH get offended when they hear an opinion or device they don't agree with.This allows me to run the dash cam keep the phone charged and keep the capsaicin accelerator at max battery
3,I had to unplug it from my car.  It didn't work. I was disappointed. It may not be the unit.  I only have one place to put it.  So will try again. I like what it offers.  If I can't get it to work the next time. Will give it to my Son.
5,Buen poder de carga excelente la longitud del cable y maravilloso poder extender a la parte de atras del carro la posibilidad de carga
5,I enjoy my item due to being to charge up to 5 devices at a time! Works well and enjoy that fact that I don't have to disconnect my phone to charge another! Thanks Amy for your service!
5,This charger makes more easy long car trips with 2 teenagers who need to have their phones charge at all times even on the back seats! Very sturdy charger.
5,This USB power outlet is great for my car since my car did not come with any power connection in the rear passenger area.
5,So many USB ports. And the cord that has 2 ports is an awesome addition. Having 2 teenage girls that can never seem to find the ports I have purchased in the past having this one come from my port is great. Plenty of length to make it to the back seat!  Getting ready to purchase a second one for our other vehicle
4,Good product
5,The charger works great. I especially like the extension. Works great for my kids to use in the back seat. Had an issue with my original charger. I reached out and the customer service was great!! Thank you
5,I have 3 teenagers and they always need a charger for their phones in the car. This charger allows everyone to charge their phones at the same time. I would buy this again for sure.
5,No more reaching to the front to charge a phone from backseat my friends are very thankful.
5,Really like this car charging system. Previously had a dual USB car charger and with a family of four someone always needs to charge their phone or device. This device doesn’t give you the fastest charge but that hasn’t been a problem for us. The ability to be able charge 3 + devices has relieved the fight over who has priority & that has meant peace in the car. That is worth so much more than a slightly faster charging speed for us.
5,Good
3,This would be great if all the USB ports worked but one does not work right out the box. This makes me uneasy to even use the other ones - maybe it has a short or something. I wouldn’t recommend.
5,Me gusto mucho por que es practico y adecuado para los chicos cuando viajan en el asiento trasero del vehículo.
5,I have owned this unit for a few months now and it works perfectly. I do not use the clip so I am unsure as to the quality. I have 3 cell phone charging cables a bluetooth audio connector and a dash cam all plugged into the unit. Works like a charm and have had no issues with power.
3,Works it's not the amps it says
3,Much much much smaller than anticipated!Back clip broke when trying to hanging on seat pouch.Wouldn’t recommend
5,I have an older car with no bluetooth built in. This device allows me operate and charge my gps echo auto apple charger and 2 android chargers with no problem.  You can't beat that at any price.
5,I can connect my echo auto uber sing my phone one usb type c and lightning cables for riders.
5,Amazing little charger fast charging charges up my sons iPad really fast better than other Chargers out here.
5,We don't even have a car but I am glad that we have this for when we use a rental car because you never know where the ports will be. A must have for road trips with kids (or adults who still act that way).
3,I thought this charger would have been perfect for traveling and having multiple devices attached but for most devices it is not enough charging power to charge a device while it is still being used.  A better option ended up being a multiple USB charger and just using multiple longer cables attached
5,I took a friend to the train station and he thought it was awesome that I had cord for charging that many objects
5,this car charger is amazing! it seriously charges my phone so fast and has more than 1 usb port. we took this on our roadtrip of 6 and everyone was able to charge their phone. everyone was very happy about this purchase4.
5,Very convenient in our Honda Odyssey (2014).  East to run with tiny cable clips to 2nd row.  I then taped it just under the armrest with enough space to the trash bag holder can still pull out.
5,Clip for extension to tight and will not clip to leather seat pockets.  Having an extra 12 inches of cable would allow better routing of cable in a full size vehicle.  Charger works great.
5,Para cargar mis celulares en mi vehículo
5,Loved how many ports this unit has loved the price. I do wish it had a longer cord and maybe a different attachment style for the cord part.  That clip on the cord just doesn't mount to anything. Even saying that I will buy another for my other car this works perfectly.
5,The length of the cord was good. It reached to our middle row. My only complaint is the the clip wasn’t very strong. It didn’t stay on the netting behind the seat.
5,To provide service to my rider as a Lyft  driver
5,We have a basic kia soul (no upgrades) so no charging ports in the backseat we have been using this everyday for about a month and it's done exactly what it needs to do!
5,Perfect buy if you own a SUV or VAN and need extra chargers for rear places in the rear of the vehicle. I own a FORD FLEX and there's an outside in the rear of the vehicle this USB cable will be great for!
5,This item is great if you travel with kids who have multiple devices
5,For the price the best thing we have found to use in our vehicle. No glitches.
5,Perfect
3,the clip broke off on the 1st use
5,Esta bueno
5,Great item used on a youth trip we had the happy van because they all had their phones charged & could listen to music & for their Bible studying. The other van had dead batteries lol
5,The one thing I would change is that the extension port would be 12 inched longer to better reach the backseat. Besides that it is an awesome product.
5,Works like it should! Great value for the money!
5,I use this for the back seat and it works perfectly. Dual USB plugs mean no fighting for the charging cable they each get one.
5,I needed a multi port USB charger for my truck. I don't have rear USB port so this is very useful for road trips and tail gate camping.
5,Works with Apple products great for connecting people in the back seat.
5,Lo recomiendo es bien largo ya no tengo problemas en el vehículo con mis hijos al cargar varios al mismo tiempo ya que tiene varios compartimentos🥰
5,Very good
5,I wanted a fast charger. This was not it. I do like that you're able to charge 5 devices though.*****Update: Great customer service I appreciate the retailer immediately reaching out to accommodate my issue.
5,I only need 3 ports but the other 2 will come in handy if I have passengers. If you need more than 5 ports you either have a large family or you need an intervention. Lol
5,this is small but mighty product.. really love it. use it to charge multiple devices at once.. has one extension with cord I keep it in the rear seats. awesome.
5,Works great. 2 ports w tend to the backseat great for backseat passengers to charge devices. The extension piece can clip on to pocket of the front seats so it doesn’t get lost of steeped on.
5,I used my charger for multiple phones and computer. It has enough power to charge all my devices @ the same time..
5,Used in the car to keep several items charged including 3 cell phones a mi-fi a smart watch and mini-refrigerator for a 5800 mile road trip. Worked well.
5,Everything good I like it
5,Used it for a road trip so my daughter had charging power in the back seat. Worked good.
5,Worked great as a charger.  I wish the clip was different.  It did not hold and really won't fit anywhere other than the net on the back on the passenger side.
4,Muy bueno!
5,Works great in our older car!!
5,I found this product and was able to tailor exactly to what i needed in my 2015 RAM 1500.  I’m using all USB ports and have had no issues. So far i love this and it’s performing greater than expected.
5,There isn’t one thing that I had disliked about it
5,Needed some usb ports in back to charge phones and didnt want to mess with splitters. This gave me a charger up front and another in back with the extension cable.
5,It’s was awesome. Good quality fast charging.
5,Great charger!!! Charges really fast. My kids don’t bug me no more for mine. Thank you
3,Use Mounting tape instead of relying in the clip to attach.. Mounting clip will break off.no grip
5,Great for me and my family. Cord is long enough for our MDX and the kids in the back have their own charger. I paired this with two 6' charger in the back. Fast charging.
5,I like this drive to florida I had six people in my suv  everyone had a charging plug.(no fighting) thanks
5,Perfect for my van
4,Bueno
3,It's not what I expected poor charge power it doesn't charge almost nothing
5,AwesomeWorks great
5,Best invention ever for my 2011 Mazda. Multiple kids but only one power source. This is fantastic for everyone in the car. No arguing over who is charging. I LOVE how the back seat get their own ports as well.
5,This product works well in our cars especially when we are travelling and using our phones and I-pads.
5,Finally something my kids won't argue over. It charges and holds muktiple cables. Hooks to the back of the seat.
5,Easy to hide. .
5,Charger works for me although the cords are really long. Best suited for an SUV where your kids might need a charger in the 3rd row.
5,Works great. Needed it for a long family trip with my 4 kids needing devices to be kept charged.
5,Product works really well especially with multiple people charging phones and tablets at the same time.  Definitely does the job
5,Clip isn’t really useful due to its small flimsy structure but the cord is long enough to reach from the front of the car to the back. Arrived quickly and works exactly as described.
5,The best item for extended trips with multiple people. Easily supports all of your accessories.
5,Cord length is perfect it works great!
5,Works
5,Bought for a car trip in Audi. Worked great. Everyone was happy.
5,Loved this. Came in handy on a road trip with 2 grandkids.
1,A cheap piece of junk. Recommend not to buy it for any reason.  Good waste of money it will fall apart as soon as you use it the 1st time.
5,I like the charging ability and the high amps that it gives when charging.
5,product is awesome
5,Perfect! It’s low profile should keep my child from snapping this off in the socket as she bails out of the backseat hopefully.
5,This charger is so awesome! It charges five phones or devices at once and it’s perfect for a family
5,She says it works well in her semi truck
3,Too long
3,With two cell phones and a tablet  all connections worked well for us.
5,Too many devices between personal and work. Keep some in the backseat and still on the charger which this allows.. keeps devices out of my way but still within reach.
5,Just as described
5,Muy bueno
5,Perfect for our trips  no more fighting over a charger.
1,Es gancho para el bolsillo del asiento no sirve. Se rompe fácilmente
5,This is great for charging multiple devices on the go
5,es muy util me gusto mucho
5,This item I like the most because it has the charger just in case there no more room. I dont think I dislike this item at all
5,It was so convenient that everyone in the csr could keep their phones charging!
5,Just what i needed
3,No es tan útil como pensé
5,I don’t have any dislikes for now. It charges my iPhone fast and I love that it has 5 ports.
5,Omg no more of the kids asking me to plug their stuff up cord runs to the back seat
5,I'm very happy with this
5,
5,Great quality. Works really well with my new Audi.  I have no complaints.
5,Para la Familia
5,Can't live without it
5,good
5,This has been a life saver for my family in the car!
5,Really nice for road trips with extra ppl in the car..
5,Keeps all my cords tidy and in one place to disconnect when needed!
5,One of the best investments i made with having kids
1,scrap
5,Concept great
5,Excellent 👍👍👍
5,Works great especially with kids!
5,We went on a vacation and everything about this charger is great
5,Good
5,works great!
5,Recomendable
5,A useful tool for my Uber/Lyft riders!. Love it!.
1,I bought this 2 times (first time the issue in my opinion was probably some sort of short circuit) and then I bought an adapter (has space for 2 devices) which has extra power and independent and removable fuse. Then I got a second one and it died few months after and the fuse (from adapter) reads that it is still good (the outlet still passes electricity) yet the charger is dead and came to the realization the device itself really worthless for the price.I do not advice to own such item.
5,Tiene buen tamaño
5,I love it it solve my charging problem. Thanks
3,Didn't show fast charging but works well.
5,I love it works perfect for the whole family
5,Very good product.
1,Buyer beware!!!*****stopped working after only four months.
5,pretty good purchase
3,Very slow charging
2,This charger worked great for about 6 weeks then it totally failed. The return policy for Amazon is 30 days. I won’t order this again.
3,Doesnt really charge phone charges my phone 10 % in 2 hour
5,Nice item
1,Nothing lasted 1 month stopped working
1,I don't know if mine was defective or what but this just did not charge my phone (Samsung Note 8) nor 2 others (Samsung S9 and Samsung S20+) that were plugged into it. The phones lit up and indicated they were charging but battery power percentages did not increase at all after a 90+ minute drive. They actually decreased as if they weren't even plugged in at all and were hot to the touch as was the charger. I returned this item today. I really wished it would've functioned properly.
1,Ok it worked well for a whole hour then it wouldn’t work. I just received a replacement so I’ll let you all know how it goes.
1,Perhaps I didn't read the description close enough to notice that this is NOT a fast charger but that is what I was shopping for. I do like the product design and the ability to extend a couple outlets to the back seat. Unfortunately there is not enough power output to charge and use your device at the same time.
2,Don't buy I though better of it it really sucks had to refund it
1,It's great to reach the rear of the car.  The device does work however the charge is weak and can basically just keep whatever is attached drain its battery extra slow.The customer service will literally harass you to no end  if you don't give them a 5star review or take down your negative one.  So you. By far the worst customer service I have ever seen and I have been getting messages from them for months since I originally posted my review.
1,Clip is to small flimsy it will attach to shirt pocket. It won’t clip to anything in the car. otherwise it seems ok. The seller constantly harassed me for better review. Over the last 3 months. They want better review. On product that didn’t work. 8 months later their relentless badgering and harassment continues. From their parent company JoyRoom. They’ll even steel your ideas don’t offer them anything them. Harassing thieves. Your better not answer them they’ll take advantage of you.
1,This was a waist of money. Doesn't work at all
1,The clip can only be used on a shirt. Can’t be clipped on to anything in the car.
1,My phone dies faster with this charger than it does with no charger at all.  I literally only have my phone and my dash cam plugged into it.  Poor overall quality. The rear power outlets are just as bad and even unplugging the dash cam it makes no difference.
2,Does not charge phone just slows down the battery usage running apps like Spotify while driving.
1,Product cannot be returned or refundedDoes not work anymore
1,It says fast charging but when i plug in my phone it takes 3hrs to fully charge. Unlike other car chargers it only takes 1hr for the fast charger to fully charge my phone
1,I can't see why anyone would rate this 5 stars. Two major failures the clip on the secondary charger broke instantly and is incredibly flimsy. The second is the voltage on this thing is by far terrible. My phone was still losing juice while using this charger. I had to switch to a external battery pack instead of using this guy.
1,I have a Samsung Tab 6 and a Note 8/ Tried to charge these with my Samsung brand USB cables and neither would charge in fact while  plugged in "Charging" they lost battery percentage. I did order a different one from another seller and was successful at fast charge so no it was not my cables or equipment.
4,Cord reaches to back seat of SUV and multiple devices can charge at one time however it does not fast charge even with a single device connected.
1,Good length of cord super slow charger
1,Looks ok on the posted pictures “but” the plastic that u clip on the back seat looks like it’s super easy to break & i cannot even clip it to the back seat b’coz that clip is too tiny.won’t buy from this seller anymore👎🏼Don’t ever waste a dime here!
1,I bought this to reach the kids in the back seat bought ahead of our trip  well we opened to use and it never ever worked and we are past the time we can return it
1,Poor quality. I gave it away.
1,NOT a fast charger.  Does NOT negotiate a fast charge based on the device.
2,Not working properly
1,I have 4 kids and a lot of electronics to charge. I only had 3 chargers plugged in and it heated up. It also made my phone heat up and stopped charging. Would not recommend.
1,Despite the claims this will not charge an iPad even when it is the only device plugged in.  Had to switch back to my old charger.Sadly I threw away the packaging and can not return it.
1,This product the idea is good... but the product does not work properly at all.... poor n dont charge my phone properly at all.... at all waste of my money...
1,Blew the circuit in my car instantly. Company was very nice & issued a refund.
1,The cord is long and convenient  especially for the passengers on the back seat of the car but it charges very very slow
1,No bueno won't charge fast enough phone loses power instead of gaining!!
1,Please don’t buy I don’t have time to return items that don’t work on first try so I put it in the trash.
1,After a little over a month this product stop working!! And I can’t return it because the return window is closed.
1,it doesn't work.don't waste your money.
1,The charging power is slow for s8+ the length is great and it made good
1,It worked for about a week. I would not recommend buying it.
1,No me duro mucho muy mala lo siento es así
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Used twice with OK ability to charge then it completely BROKE
1,Not good at all take days before charging
1,Attached part does not work.
1,Does not fast charge as claimed
1,Definitely NOT a rapid charger...again you get what you pay for.
1,The extension ports don't charge.
1,It's not charging my phones
1,The quality is really bad.
5,Great customer service quite attentive with their follow-up. Product works perfect for me as it is quite versatile.  Especially if you have family or friends in the back seat!
1,Is not working
5,Tiene buen poder de carga y el largo del cable es ideal
1,The orange usb plug-ins usually indicate a high output charge. This is a lie used to get you to feel justified buying this product. It heats up while charging drains your battery and will not hold a charge on today’s devices. This group has several products selling on Amazon but this product is very misleading and deceptive. The device will not charge your cell phone under an hour and it will not keep a device charged while on a road trip.Do not waste your money on this product.
5,I was spectical about this but I really like it. The best part is that you have 3 usb ports in the front and 2 in the back. The back cord is long I have a Toyota Corolla and just tucked the long cord on the side. As you can see it can just be clipped to anything you have available. So far happy with it.
5,Used this on  a roadtrip not too long ago with a few other people in the car and EVERYBODY was telling me how usefull this is which i agree 100%. I've had plenty of car chargers before but this one offers so much for such a great price. I've had no issues whatsoever and every port charges pretty fast. Would highly recommend if you have people regularly over in your car.
5,This is the handiest little gadget ever! I wish I would have had this one option years ago! Definitely worth the buy
5,Only one point needed now to  charge several devices simultaneously. A must have excellent purchase.
1,Doesn’t work at all
5,I needed a charger for my girls who sit in  the back seat great .. the length of the cord is exactly what I was looking for and now no more arguments of who gets to charge what..
5,Love that this has a cord that easily reaches from front to back so the whole family can easily charge at the same time.
5,Convenient for road trips in a sedan. Everyone kept their electronics charged without fighting to share cords.
4,Update: customer service agent Amy was so helpful.  She quickly sent a replacement for the faulty charger  without any cost to me.  She kept in contact and made sure that everything was going smoothly.  She is a great asset to this company.I bought this product so my kids would be able to charge their phones while I'm driving without taking over my charger.  The cord worked great one time and now it doesn't work at all.  I checked my fuses and looked for damage to the cord there was nothing not even a scratch. It just no longer works
5,Product works good my 2012 mini Cooper clubman there are no charge ports in the rear passenger seats this works good to run power from the 12 V socket in the front seats to the back. Quality of build materials feels very high cord length is nice and long and not annoying me long. No like that it gives you three ports right on the plugin. Super easy to use even easier to install
5,Works just as I needed for the kids in the back!  They always seem to need my charger cable when I’m using my phone as navigation!  So this frees it up for the whole family!!  Planning to buy another one for the other cars!
5,Perfect port extender for those who travel with back seat passengers. My kids no longer fight over who gets to charge their phones as there is plenty for everyone now.
5,Bought when my USB plugs weren't working. I love it! Easy to use and the cord for the back is perfect length. Worth the money
5,Perfect size fory family of four.  It's length ensures everyone can use at same time. Looks great! A great buy for my family vehicle
1,Product stop charging error keep showing on phones don't buy
5,Much smaller footprint than expected. All ports work as expected. Great option to upgrade you vehicle to have rear USB charging options.
5,This car charger port is a great deal. You get 3 ports for the front seat and additional cord attached which will reach to the back seat; giving passengers in the back seat 2 ports. So 5 ports for the price was a great deal! My teenage daughters will be happy now!
5,I chose this charger because of the extra piece that reaches to the back seat. Our kids can charge their devices at the same time we are charging ours up front. Works great so far!
5,Great product and transaction just what I was looking for.
5,Absolutely perfect for conveniently placed USB charging ports. I couldn't be happier!
5,great for the truck five of us can use this charger at one time cord length is long enough for the folks in the back seat.
5,Everyone has electronics these days so it's perfect if you are not trying to share 1 or a dual charger.
5,Great product and value..
5,This was a real good buy...I have several items to charge and this helps me to charge them all at the same time.
5,Very valuable very convenient ! #RealReview
5,By far the best charger I have ever gotten for the car.
4,Love it
5,The 5 port charger is a great addition to our vehicle.  Our children are able to charge several electronic devices in the back of the vehicle.
5,Perfecto
5,Great buy..
5,The cord is perfect to reach to the backseat and there's enough power that no one is short-changed.
5,This is a nice charging station. I drive for Uber and its perfect and long enough to reach the back seat.
5,Great product for the rear passenger users especially the kids on the ipads. Nice affordable than other products out there.
5,It's perfect 🥰
5,Had it for 2 weeks. Was great.  Then died
4,I like
5,I was looking for something to add sub ports to an older car and this is perfect! It reality chargers my phone and my laptop at the same time. The back seat extension is great for passengers too! Would definitely recommend.
5,This device is perfect for our car by allowing two people in the front seat to charge their phones while our two grandkids can plug-in from the back seats.
5,I like it because it charges fast
5,Worked very well.
4,Muy bueno
5,Fantástico el tamaño justo y el funcionamiento inmejorable
5,This car charger really helped when have to charge my phone and hubby plus portable fan at the back for my kid and other devices. The cable for the back was long enough so it doesn’t stretch any cable which is great. It charges better than other ones I had. Price wise to me is worth it.
5,I absolutely love this product!!  When we travel my 2 pre-teens are in the backseat charging their phones with long cords from the front seat. The cord on this item is a perfect length to slide long the floor boards for my kids to comfortably charge. And then my husband and I use the front charger for our phones. NO MORE CRAZY CORDS EVERYWHERE WHEN WE TRAVEL!!
5,I like the flexibility of the product and the quality 👌
5,So convenient and works fine
5,Great power charging port amd a vehicle is always in need for more port to handle more devices. Great Product. love it.
5,After 6 months this product still works great. They all work the same even if it’s one or all 5 being used. Love this and that it works as well as it does.
5,I've had this charger for several weeks and it works really well. It obviously isn't as fast as a wall socket but in a bind or during a long drive it's a life-saver.
5,I like that this charger has several ports for charging several devices in my car. It helps eliminate long cords strung to my middle seats from the front part of the car. I was looking to replace my previous multi-port charger and this ine is so worth it!
5,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👌👍
5,3 ports with extended USB cord ports. What are you waiting for?In addition the cord was long enough to attach additional devices in the car.Finally it was very inexpensive. Get it now before it is gone!!!
5,Charges pretty quickly as long as you also buy fast charging cords for your devices. We have one slow charger so that show sit depends on the cable you’re using. I bought those popular red super fast charging cables for iPhone on Amazon and paired it with this and it charges pretty quick. Get it. You may need to test your cables. Hey sometimes the items are defective so always attempt have it replaced to make sure. This works!!!
5,This fit our needs perfectly during our last road trip
5,Liked the pruduct.
5,Nothing to dislike; everything to like about it. Any issues that my car had regarding not having enough USB sockets has been answered.
4,All family can charge iPad phone the same time.Very practical.
5,Great for every device.
5,I was having issues with the charger and commented on it.  Customer Service reached out with a resolution for the issue.  Thank you.
5,By far the best adapter yet! Having a extension that reaches the backseat to charge the kids tablets is awesome
5,5 Multi USB Car Charger Car Charger Adapter USB Car Charger for Multiple Devices 12V USB for an older Van with very little electronics in the rear areas this allows any passengers back there access to the internet and phone service when traveling since almost everything is upfront in this vehicle and this is a way to give people sitting in the back to use there electronics.
4,Like the length of the cord and the ability to charge more than 3 items at a time will purchase again when need it.
5,excellent product & seller
5,Charges extremely fast
5,Perfect for multi units and chord length is super helpful too
5,Greay price
5,My son loves it and works for him and his passengers Works great !
3,It was great for about a year till it slowly feel apart and blew my fuse for it so I replaced the fuse and it installed it again and boom right away fuse blown and it’s not like I was over working it I had a phone charger and a camera connected that’s it never used more then 2 ports so kinda disappointed
5,Really perfect for traveling
4,Nice compact product
5,Bought this for a road trip from NY to SC. With a toddler and my s.o we have many devices that’ll need charging within 11/12 hours. This is perfect! And it’s small not big and a hassle. This will easily stretch from the front charge port to the back seat
5,Easy to used
4,First off let me say how helpful the seller is! I got the wrong product and they helped replace one for me at no additional cost almost immediately! They also gave me a lifetime warranty for the product (which I hope I will never have to use)So far as I have tried it works perfectly fine although I was expecting the USB c port on the charger head itself to be quick charge (it wasn't) but the other ports for the extension were! So it works out fine for me in either case.
5,This product solves a few problems for my partner and I.  First the built in USB ports on our car are extremely weak and take forever to charge this unit provides way more amperage and charging is noticeably faster.  2nd this provides 3 standard USB ports and a USB C point which when we both have our personal and work phones provides us outlets for all of them which is great.  Lastly by having the extension line it really provides a lot more flexibility than having everything plugged right into where the cigarette lighter plug is.  Really happy with this purchase.
5,I have been looking for a durable high-quality and affordable car charger. I found it with this charger and I like the multiple ports when traveling with family and friends.
5,Charging power quality of material
5,This has saved my sanity. My wife's 2019-model car came with no USB ports in the rear seat and my grandchildren drove me nuts handing me things to plug into the front USB port. And sometimes there were not enough places to plug in everything that needed to be plugged in so that would start an argument.This little device has saved my sanity by giving us outlets in the rear seat and extra outlets in the front. All is quiet in the back seat.
5,They contacted me & said it came with a lifetime warranty!! They said they’ll replace it if anything happens to it!! That’s amazing!! All I had to do was reply to their message to activate the warranty! I hope it’s true!! You can’t beat that!! Amy is the best! Hope this helps her keep her job! 😂Oh yea… and the product is great so far!! It’s low profile so it doesn’t stick out from the car lighter. It’s perfect for my car because I have a dash cam & phone holder/charger in the front of my car! I can plug those two devices in & still have an outlet for one more. Then I ran the cord to the back & clipped it to my middle purse bag. I wish the clip was bigger so I could clip it to the backseat but its still really cool!!

1,I bought this car charger 4-5 months ago and suddenly stop working. Don’t waste your money! Don’t buy!!!!!
5,The quality of material is amazing! It charges fast. And it does work by charging two things at the same time not like the other chargers at gas station. I recommend this product
5,My daughter uses it a lot in her car. Since she only has one be plug.
5,Fulfilled what we needed
5,Best one I have ever bought
5,No
5,Great use while travelling with multiple devices. Works great. Fast charge too.
5,Easy install good power
5,Three ports at the lighter insert and additional ports extended to the back keeps everybody in the car happy and there devices fully powered.
5,- The product in general is excellent - The product is good - Easy to use and comfortable to handle - I think the product is expensive
5,Good quality good value good design
5,Works great
5,very nice
4,The system ultimately works but takes some manipulation every time! I have a device that plugs in snd turns on and connects to Bluetooth. With this product I have to manipulate the cord for the device EVERY time but once done works fine!
5,I needed a charger for my 2003 4 runner that would accommodate family sitting in the backseat. This charger our needs perfectly. I have only had is a week or so. If there are problems later I will update this review. For now I give it 5 stars.
5,good
3,Wish it didn't have a clip on the one end and had some sticky tape or a place for a screw would be nice
5,I love this charger the cord is long and durable. And the extra outlets are amazing and everyone can charge their phone
5,Looks great on the 2008 Scion TCMinimalist and allows the rear passengers stay charged
5,Perfect for the backseat passengers for charging !
4,The base that goes into the cigarette lighter is actually not bulky and I LOVE IT. It works. It's convenient. I don't have to buy unnecessary long cords to plug in.
5,This worked great on our trip. No fighting over who's turn it was to charge their phone. Haha. Had great length for the back seaters. Great quality! Charged our phones with no problem and it's not a slow charge :) Definitely recommend getting this for multiple charging opportunities 👌
5,I got this for my car for a girls road trip. My car doesn't have a charging option in the backseat. So I bought this and it was great. The cord was very long and the people in the back had no problems using it. For for apple and Android
5,Works perfect and allows us to charge 5 devices at once. Length of cord extends to 2nd row so both kids can charge their devices as well. We have an old Honda Odyssey with no USB ports built in.
5,So far so good. Really fast charging power.
5,First of all the customer service was amazing they checked to make sure that the product arrived in good condition and offered a full refund or a new one if anything was wrong with it and they were very friendly. The product works exactly as it's described I've had no problems with it.
5,it is a great tool for a family of 4 and need many electronics running
5,Glad I  brought this.
5,Good charges fast and never have a problem not have more than enough outlets
4,Not recommend for larger suv worth the charge though for many
5,Simply great ! Fast charging power and best of año itvhascan extencion that reaches the backseat so my son can plug his tablet and phone ! Just what I was looking for  thanks
5,Love it
1,Broke on the first day. Clip is REALLY REALLY sensitive and does not take any flexibility. Only thing you can hang it on is the pocket of your clothes. Not made to hang to car back seat. If that’s what you want it for DO NOT BUY.
4,Too bad it died
1,Ne fonctionne pas et je comprends pas!!
5,Muy buen producto práctico y cómodo cuando tienes hijos
