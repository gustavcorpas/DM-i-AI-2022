5,I've had a pair of these before but a different color. The sound quality is very good and they are comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them!
5,I use this manly for hands free when driving or work. Very helpful product!
3,I have used the wired Beats earbuds for the past couple years and love them. But I wanted to get something wireless for the gym and these were recommended by a coworker. I wanted to love these… I really did! But alas I do not.I’ll start with the cons- They just don’t “hold on” to my ears and they are always falling off. If I am wearing my glasses or a mask they become completely IMPOSSIBLE to wear. Having said that… it is probably a “me” problem. Maybe it’s just the anatomy of my ears. Also the little squishy ear bud part is always falling off. The seller included an extra pack which is great… because you will need them!Pros- The sound quality is great! The noice canceling is more than decent. The battery life also seems to be very good! Lastly the design is very good looking.They make work really well for someone. That someone just didn’t happen to be me.
3,Overall the headphones were in good condition and work perfectly but they’re missing the piece that allows you to adjust the wire and make they tighter.
5,Is good equipment and I use for work
3,People complain about a hum they are not as comfortable in the ear. Battery does not seem to hold up
4,Like them but will probably buy a NEW pair eventually
5,Love the 90 day return policy. I use these everyday and love them. My old Beats just finally wore out. These come with everything a brand new pair would expect the price tag!
5,This is my 3rd pairi lost 1 and broke the piece that hooks over the ear. Best headphones I ever bought. Sound is great and very comfortable.
4,I ordered these specific headphones for my friend after he listened to mine and said they were exactly what he was looking for. Then not two days after I recieved them the Beats I bought brand new 6 months ago (not Re-newed like these) took a dump on me and stopped charging or connecting. So I’ll say they’re great while they last I’ve never gotten more than 6 months out of a pair of these and I don’t use them all day. Only about 1 at most 2 hours of actual use a day. Most of the time they’re sitting “Off” in my bag. Oh and I had to super glue both ear hooks back on as they always come off and the headphones are useless without them.
2,I dislike that this Powerbeat had a charging problem. One day it would charge and the next time it wouldn’t.
5,People say quality of sound is not good......it’s because they are not using them correctly.  When on ear if you rotate ear piece forward the sound level is brought down so that you can listen to sound around you without having to remove ear pierce completely off your ear!  Put on the ear piece and rotate to a right angle and you will hear the music like you’re supposed to with these Powerbeats.  I give vpcomfort level a 3 star only for the first 3 weeks (different for each individual) till my ears got used to the fit.  C’mon people we wear more uncomfortable items or clothing these are not bad.  Do buy Powerbeats and find the perfect rotation on ear for the Best Quality Listening.  Works great for working out with them also they don’t fall off!
4,These beats worked perfectly fine and we’re comfortable. I’ve had them for two weeks. Then all of a sudden they wouldn’t turn on. First time the battery die for whatever reason. Second time I plug them in to charge again because they had died. At this point the charging light wouldn’t come on and it wasn’t charging. I’m not going to write a terrible review because they worked fine but only lasted me two weeks...
5,As expected from Beats most excellent sound for its size & comes with different size inserts.  Seals well to ear.  I work outside in Florida as a heavy equipment mechanic.  Constantly in all weather conditions.  Thought many many times I’ve ruined them while working but they won’t quit.  Couple years old at this point.  They won’t die & still the best audio quality of any headset I’ve ever bought.  I’ve owned 3 pair of them.  Only had one pair fail inside of 1 year warranty & was replaced At no cost.  I’ll continue to buy these till they stop making them
1,Highly disappointed with these they worked well for a couple months and stopped charging. Conveniently shortly after the return date expired. There was zero warning that this was occurring because they held the charge like they normally should up until they stopped charging completely. Multiple different charging cords were attempted before realizing that the product no longer works.
1,I bought these because my other pair (l bought new) have seen better days. The battery life is horrible (about 3-4 hours) my old ones get about 8-10. The ear hooks are also not like the original ones. My old one are way more comfortable. Probably going to send these back.(Update) so I returned the first pair and should have just got my money but I got a replacement instead. Less than 6 months and they won't take or hold a charge. Plug them in and red light forever. I think these are knock-off's rather than renewed. My first pair I bought from Verizon 3 years ago still work even with the wires exposed and the ear hook split. They look like they went 6 tours in Iraq with the Marines! Learned my lesson. Wish Apple still made these literally the best most reliable Bluetooth buds I have ever owned and I have bought many looking for the right ones ( all the LG tone models Samsung buds pro scull candy bossjbl and now I have the wireless beats) they all suck in one way or another. ( poor sound quality poor mic quality or placement poor battery don't stay in ear.....
4,Need to fit around ear better
3,Pros:I’m cool because I have beats headphones.Have not had an issue with battery life.They are comfortable...when they stay in.Cons:Cannot get them to fit snugly in my ears with any of the provided rubber pieces.They frequently fall out while running.The sound is mediocre at best.The main button doesn’t work well. A single short press sometimes plays/pauses/answers phone calls. A long press activates and cancels Siri at the same time.Bottom line:These are mediocre headphones at a premium price.
5,I use these as my alternate set and run with. On my 3rd pair in about 11 years or so? I get value
5,They are exactly as they claim to be.
1,Plugged in with the cord provided and they wouldn’t charge. The cord provided charged other things just not the headphones. Personal cord (from and other pair of beats) tried to charge the headphones which was also unsuccessful.
1,I’ve had these for less than a year and they just stopped working. :(  They’ve been great while they lasted but definitely not worth the $80 I paid for them since they lasted less than a year! I wish I had not gotten refurbished Beats and had paid more for ones that weren’t going to break. I didn’t get the service plan for these although I did try to add one after purchasing (before they broke) and was told I couldn’t add one. Also the part right by where the cord that connects the two earpieces attaches to it it started coming undone about a month ago. Don’t waste your money buying cheaper Beats from these people!I’ve also been very very gentle with these and they haven’t been thrown around or shoved in my bag ever so there’s no reason for them to already be falling apart other than maybe shoddy refurbishment
5,I got this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law who works out at the gym everyday. He sweats a lot and has used these several times now and said that in the past he has had trouble with his sweat ruining his ear buds but has had no issues with these. He really loves them!
4,I received the headset in its original packaging with the original power cords. They are in good condition and works well; so far. My daughter loves them.
5,Nevermind the bad reviews! These headphones are GREAT! At this price even better! They were shipped fast great seller! Package was well protected for shipping. I got them for bike riding so I don’t have a chord hanging while peddling & so far I love them. Thinking about getting a 2nd pair. I like to have 2 of some things like sunglasses to keep in different places so I have them when & where I need them. Traveling with these is very easy pouch fits anywhere but I tend to rush to work & forget things. So at this price buy 2 pair!
5,Best head phones ever!! I am an audio head and these are amazing for the gym outside running studying everything!! They are perfect for the gym or when youre on the go. I keep mine in my car and go 1-2 weeks without a charge using them at the gym 5-6 times a week. If they are low on battery then ill charge them for 5 min and thats 2+hours of play time. I've used in-ear Bose over-ear-bose over-ear-beats like 20 cheap pairs from target and these are hands down the best!!
5,My son loves the headphones and his only knock is that the volume when he's using his tablet is lower than when using his wired Bose Noise Cancelling headphones. He's tried everything (increasing the volume on the headphones the volume on the videos/platforms he's using etc) but that was something he identified.
5,Great sound quality.  Great for listening to music while working out. When using the headphones to talk handsfree you cannot have any outside noise going on because the mic pics up everything around you!
4,Product is awesome. Mine came smelling strongly if another dude’s cologne. Pretty gross.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 What i dislike alot about this headphones was when i was doing cardio meaning running with a jacket the wire will keep on pulling the other one out of my ear every 3 minutes and with the sweat i will had to keep on pushing it to my ear after 8 months of use i will turn them on and they will blink white light 3 times i coulnt use them i will always had to reset them and everything i will turn them back on they will still blink 3 time white light and if i get lucky enough they will turn on and i will be happy after 2 minutes into the song at the gym OOF the headphones will turn off it made me step on them.I bought them for 150 and it was my first beats product i bought and im never ever in my life BUYING BEATS PRODUCTS
4,They are great headphones battery life is amazing and they stay in when I dance. I wish it had a button to skip songs and that the volume controller was on the right side not left. Overall a great product.
3,Disconnects from my phone a lot. I have had many issues with this purchase. When I am exercising they fall off. They are better than the knock off versions but not 2x the price better. I purchased this six months ago and they are already showing signs of age.
1,They don't work 100%They only work when it slighty raining during the may June and early july on a solar eclipse. When they do work the quality is that of HDMX brand or MPOW. Just be warned when this product is in effect a dangerous DreWolfs start to appear and are blood hungry for your money. They will be wearing expensive clothing chatting about how they just bought another BMW or Mercedes while bragging about their family which 100% of normal Americans don't care about. They will pin you done and pre pressure you into buying beats Becasue the white girl at the gym whos slept with 37 people at the age of 24 has 2 pairs of big dumb pink or pale color headphones. Yeah we all know that girl the attention girl advertising how much she spent on beats informing the others she also likes bbc. I want my money back and i want more money becsuse of the stress these beats have bestowed upon me. Who ever in corporate that reads this please know that i do not like DreWolfs and i am suffering metal breakdowns Becasue of the entire brand Beats. Someome needs to be a hero and save us from these monsters before its too late. I hear something at the door... their here................................
5,So far these headphones are amazing from the fit to the design and sound quality. There is a mobile app that adjusts the sound settings to fit your comfort (oh you can't hear anything once that volume is turned up). It comes with a small case to store the charging dock and headphones. As I'm writing this review it's hard to find any cons I would recommend these headphones especially because of the price. Great Buy!!!
1,No sirvieron no de escucha en llamadas
4,Very uncomfortable to my ears
5,These are great. Syncing with the iPhone was a breeze. Once I got the right size ear pieces on these fit over and in my ear comfortably and securely.
4,Keep the microphone clear because it rubs up against your clothes beard etc... Which causes problems with the person on the other line hearing you. .
1,I like the product have had before and will again. This particular item was defective
1,I love my other ones but I will need to purchase new instead of refurbished
4,bass was ok i would still buy them
2,This product is pretty good all around. It just sucks if you want something that lasts though. I got a pair in September and it’s been just over 6 months and they are completely broken. The outside cover started popping off before December (I remember because it was before winter break so roughly 1-2 months-ish started breaking) But now the piece that hold it on your ear has completely broke off. I was walking with them on and it just fell off my ear so I was like huh weird and looked and the hole thing had broke off. The sound comfort and battery are all fine and good. The shell that holds all of it together is awful though.
3,They didnt even clean the ear pieces they were crusty and im grossed out second guessing this purchase and hoping they are reliable. I purchased the asurion warranty for 3 years but when I got the package it had a warranty for "cell works unlimited" a refurbishing company so now I'm just confused as to wether I have a 90 day warranty or 3 year and what the grey lines are.
4,Very good product. Mishaps are do not notify you when you are not close to said phone. Not EXCEPTIONAL.
4,Excellent sound. Would have liked the cable to be a couple of inches longer for comfort in turning head. It gets caught on my neck or shirt and tugs a bit.
1,Don’t buy themBad battery lifeTurns off don’t know why
4,Pro: easy to pair with iphone stay in place during various workouts (running weights elliptical)Con: first pair simply quit working after 1 month but replacement sent with no issue
4,So far it works fine 🙏🙏
5,I LOVE MY POWERBEATS3 MY WIFE SONS AND I USE THIS PRODUCT AT THE GYM ALL THE TIME.MAKES WORKING OUT FUN.
5,Very comfortable good sound quality easy to answer the phone with them  great battery life.
1,These are fake! Not real beats!
4,Like it but when you where it for a long period of time they hurt your ears.
1,The sound quality sucks and is subpar
5,These work great and I love using them while I work out! Would recommend!
4,Just got this product not even a week ago and I have to say that they are reliable headphones that are designed for quality sound and they are comfortable!
4,Decent sound quality  long lasting battery somewhat uncomfortable.
1,The headphone does not work. Tried iphone and mac. Bluetooth on powerbeat undiscoverable. Do not order. Waste of time.
4,The buds keep falling out and they’re pretty uncomfortable
1,I love these.  I workout hard and like my music loud.  But this is the second pair that just stopped working.  I bought these in November.  On Friday during a marathon they broke.  Totally pissed.  I have no recourse.
4,Right item. Wrong color.
1,These headphones died after two weeks use. Will be sending back.
4,I must say that I am very happy with the Powerbeats 3for the price you can’t ask for more. Thanks for your business.
5,Love them. I got them as a gift for my boyfriend he wouldn’t shut up about how much he loved th men so I tried them and he was right. So I also got me the red pair. Point of the story is that they are really good sound is great battery life is great sound block is good color is nice.
5,Beats work like they are brand new! They are comfortable and the fit is perfect!
4,I like the Beat head phones better but if you sweat a lot while working out they will not work.
5,sound quality issue after less than a year...static
5,I really like it! They did not come in a Beats box but they were wrapped and clean. They came with different sized EarPods which is a plus. I have small ears but they fit perfectly for me. They cancel out a LOT of noise and they stay in place really well.
4,Loud & easy fit!
1,The sound is good. Music says well. When I receive or make a call the person on the line can not hear me. I can hear them only.I'm sending them back. Something is wrong.
5,he works good
2,The headphones are great for sound and quality however as someone who is an advanced athlete I don't believe the product can take the daily wear and tear that it's put through. I just broke my second pair and I'm so happy I got the Amazon warranty when I purchased them (BOTH TIMES).  I will not be buying Beats a 3rd time.
1,I bought these headphones knowing that they were renewed but hoping that they would atleast work. I opened the box they would NOT turn on and would NOT charge. I tried troubleshooting to reset and reconfigure everything in the book and nothing happened. Don’t waste your money buying this product or any renewed beats product from Amazon if you want something that will last and most importantly work PROPERLY. You’re better off going to Apple or even Walmart (which is cheaper) and buying it brand new.
5,I use these often and they perform well great sound and transmission. Very good product for the price.
3,The packackge came pretty dirty and the headphones themselves had stuff on them. I have uploaded the pictures as well. I scraped off the brown stuff on them but I don’t know what it was.
5,Wow wow wow.  Much better than I had expected.  Connecting was so easy and it was so nice to see an image pop up showing the pair you were wanting to connect.  Easy to put open easy packaging and very very comfy!
5,Good product. Excellent sound quality. Reproduces bass frequencies well. Very full sound. Comfort takes some time to get used to but once you’re used to the design they work well. That’s all for now party people.
5,Great for the restoration it’s like new but the re- packaging is a little off.Other then that it’s a good product. 💘
5,Great sound quality definitely surprised by the battery life I’ve used  everyday for a couple of months now and no issues battery still charges properly and still great sound quality definitely happy with my purchase.
3,cord grips back of sweaty neck and tries to pull earbuds out with every movement u make.
2,I recently purchased these from this seller. Received them in the mail on Friday. By Sunday which was yesterday they will no longer work. I’ve tried charging and holding the volume down button to reset. I’ve turned my phone on/off resetting my Bluetooth and nothing seems to work. The light indicator just blinks red/clear. This is annoying to say the very least.
2,Sound is very poor and little or no bass.  I compared them to the Flex and the difference is DISTINCT.
5,Bought them for my  my wife and she loves them after trying about 10 other brands with bad sound quality and didn't fit right she loves these no complaints
5,These are beats! High quality happy with purchase
5,Bought these to replace my original apple bought Powerbeats after I clearly crossed the line on their water resistance as I was washing my windows.  So far so great you just can’t beat the sound and the comfortability
4,There really loud I use them for work
5,These are a great pair of work out ear budsthey stay in really well I just can't wait till Black Friday to pick up the powerbeats pro
5,I really like this product and I am glad I got it!
5,Perfect for my tiny ears (I cant fit any by any brand) THESE ARE THE ONLY HEADPHONES TO FIT IN ALL MY 28 years since my over the ear headphones lol no really. Perfection in a box
5,Comfortable
5,Sound quality is great!
4,Very satisfied
1,I was so excited for these to arrive & replace the same headphones I had previously lost. In the product description it said they would come with the rubber tips and a case. It arrived in a ziplock with neither. It also still has earwax from somebody else on them?? It was disgusting to receive like this.
5,Great product awesome purchase but it did come with a caring case
5,I lost my previous pair of beats and was happy to find these in the green color as it is somewhat hard to find. Great sound great quality and exactly what I was looking for!
5,Great product
1,Bluetooth sometimes hard to connect. Poor battery life. After two months not working anymore. Waste of money
5,Good
2,Less than a year and the headphones stopped charging.  When I attempt to charge the Powerbeats the red light just pulsates.  I have charged them overnight but that did not solve the problem.  Spend the extra money and buy Bose!
3,Just purchased these in February 2019. It’s now September 2019. They stopped working!🤬
2,I really wanted to love these Beats earbuds. I am so tired of spending money on poorly sounding earbuds. They have a cheap "tinny" sound. No base sound at all I have tryed the different size rubber ear tips just to ensure they are seated properly. Can not recommend them at all not sure if I can return them or not.
5,I use these at the gym on walks hiking and on my 5k's. They are so comfortable durable and the quality is amazing. Best headphones I've ever had <3
5,Great base and incredible distance!Sound was great at every point.The battery lasted me 4 times my previous earbuds.
5,The music sounds amazing with my new beats 😍 I will NEVER use anything else but beats.
1,Sound is great but will not stay connected to phone turns off on it's own and don't stay charged long at all it was a waste of my money I had to buy another set from another source
5,easy to use - great fit -
5,My wife loves her new earphones.  The sound is amazing.  Had them for over a month and still working great.
5,I thought they would have a longer battery life. Also they don’t stay connected to my phone long.
5,Love the productExcellent sound
2,Did not receive my cord bead it’s the bees it fits on the cord to keep the cord from flopping
5,👍
5,9/10
1,well... I was pleased with the item at first take... after using for about one month the battery life was awful. It would take 5 hours to charge and the charges would last only an hour. Now just under one year of owning this item it quit charging. Did some research an it’s a bad battery. Yes likely it’s an easy fix however for the price I expected this product to be a bit more durable and rugged. Naturally I’m irritated because I need music to run.
5,Great headphones I lost mine but I will definitely buy this pair again
5,I purchased these for my husband. He loves them. The battery lasts and the sound is quality.
1,I have had these for just barely over 2 months. I have only used them a handfulnof times while working out and they are already not working. When they worked i loved them. Now i am not sure if they are just not holding a charge or if they are dead. I can plug them in to charge and they light up red and eventually white but when i go to power them up they do nothing.I would not buy these refurbs again.
2,I thought I would give this a shot because of the return policy just in case I did discover an issue. Save your money because after a few weeks the device stopped charging could be a bad battery. Just purchase new.
5,Love it
5,Way better than I expected....Sounds great and very comfortable. Excellent item considerring it was refurbished.
5,I love the vibrant color and the amazing sound quality of these Beats! I highly recommend them for those perfectionists like me :)
5,Very good quality. Came as described with virtually no wear.
5,Perfect how i expected !i love it already & its so loud as well ! Im happy lol
1,Sound was terrible and it was obviously "renewed"
2,Not loud enough poor sound quality
5,That they dont fall off my ear when I move too quickly.
2,Powerbeats3 Wireless In-Ear HeadphonesThe out-of-the-box earbuds from Apple sounds way better.The Beats require that you push them into your ear canal which I can't stand.I returned these.
5,Great! Just doesn’t fit my ears too well
2,The headphones didn’t live up to the hype. There’s no bass or loud. They fit in my ear but are not comfortable. Your pretty much paying for the name and not the quality.
1,This product is a fake. I was trying to replace real beats I broke with what appeared to be (based on description) an identical pair. The quality could not be more different. The ear pieces are misshaped and they do not fit. The minute I opened the ziploc bag i knew I had been super. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Beats sound so you can't go wrong.  So far they have a long battery life.
5,Great headset worth the money. Use the daily.
3,I love my beats
5,I love my Powerbeats. I use them for my overnight shifts and they last all night
3,good
3,These sound just fair.  Its hard to get them to stay in my ear for that sealed sound quality that allows you to hear bass and good loud level.  The smallest eartips wont seal and the next size up wont stay in my ear (popping out as I am exercising).The price is too high.  I have cheaper earbuds that sound better and have more functionality.This earbud has no control to skip songs.  The only music controls are pause and the overall volume up or down.Save some money unless your just buying them for the brand name.
5,Good reliable product
1,I’d noticed Beats headphones in the gym being worn by many but couldn’t bring myself to pay the high price for headphones that had mediocre consumer reviews. I finally got a pair and within one wearing I could tell it’s all hype. Yes they look good but when it comes to comfort & sound there are many products that are MUCH better (Westone) for the same price.
5,Love these head phones can't even tell they are refurbished. Definitely will recommend
1,This product is not working I had try to connect but it doesn't work at all the worst part is that I threw away the box that came with.
5,I like how long the battery lasts and the sound
1,This refurbished product powers on but will not connect to any Bluetooth devices. Do not recommend purchasing refurbished products from this vendor. It also came without any ear pieces to attach to the headphones. Having to head to the UPS store just to get my money back.
5,Love these headphones and this is the cheapest price I could find.
3,But i'm keeping them.
1,My husband has these really likes them. He bought some for me that were reconditioned. They didn’t seem to hold a charge well.Even with the smallest rubber piece on them they would not properly fit in my ear canal. They may have better sound quality than I experienced but when something doesn’t fit you’re not gonna hear correctly.
5,multiple size air buds for the perfect fit.
5,Works perfect even though it is used
1,Do not buy from this seller. Accidentally purchased renewed headphones instead of new ones. Wish I had spent the extra $10 and bought brand new ones from someone else. These didn't last 4 months and we are stuck now. Save your money. Learn from our mistake and don't deal with this company.
1,So far they work. They were dirty like everyone has said and smelled weird. They came with nothing it says it comes with though other than adjustable ear pieces. I’m mad because I looked at the price and they refurbished used headphones cost the same amount as brand new ones with everything. Don’t buy
5,These were a gift.
5,Sounds great in great shape good condition
5,Just like when. I bout them new!
5,Just like new no complaints there pretty nice
5,Excellent product
5,Love it.. One of my favorite!!
2,Color was not what was advertised
1,It never worked.
5,I have 2 pairs of these headphones I love them.
5,Excellent... Get it if you want it...
1,Worked good for a while then stop taking a charge after about 5 months. Now I'm past the return window and have a pair of useless headphones.
5,Excellent hight sound quality
5,Great
5,Exactly as advertised. High quality headphones
5,They are amazing
5,excelente
5,A great product!
5,Great gift
1,Item doesn't work. I charged it but when I tried to connect it there was no sound indicating connection or voice prompt. Device didn't show up on bluetooth list for connection. Tried it with several phones and iPad nothing. Last time I buy Beats on Amazon.
5,Work amazing for being refurbished
5,Very easy to use
1,Very dissatisfied  they do not work I do not know how to send them back  I don't know if they are not compatible to my phone or what but I'm not happy ‼
5,Loved it
5,Works well reasonably priced
1,My 90 day warranty was up 10 days ago and these earbuds are shot.  Won't turn on or connect.  Would caution buying renewed products from anyone.  I wish I'd have listened to the other reviews.
5,Just like new
5,Husband loves them
1,Never buying a Beats product again. The sound randomly stops although it still plays on my phone. These are quite possibly the quietest in ears I've ever used as well. Glad I paid $100 just for a logo...
5,Fantastic product great price!!
5,Great love them
5,Great product
1,Lasted 5 months before the microphone stopped working. My original pair are 4 yrs old and still work great. The last 2 pair have had mic issues within 6 months. Quality is definitely slipping.
5,Good headphones
1,These Hooks are guaranteed up to 90 days. Just outside that 90 days the headset would no take a charge. This the second pair of beats power 3 that have broken back to back. I gambled and lost
1,This product is FAKE!!!! Sound quality is horrible. I use to have a pair and I combined them you can tell right off the back they are a fake product. Waiting to get my money back so I can return them.
5,Like
5,Good
5,Great sound
5,Yeahhh guy
5,Nice
5,Excelentes
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE ARE NOT REAL BEATS THEY ARE FAKE!!!
5,Excelente.
5,Great product!
5,Bueno
5,Great for that price.
5,Works good
5,Good
5,Great
1,These beats 3 have a malfunction going on. They turn off while listening to music. It seems like they get hot and turn off until they cool down then they will turn back on.
1,I loved them for 103 days. Warranty on renewed products is 90 days. At Day 104 they quit working. Good while it lasted I’ll spend the extra and buy new next time.
5,Fantastic!
1,I would never buy anything from this supplier again. The box was already opened when I received this package. The headphones don’t even turn on. I contacted this supplier and he or she never got back to me.
1,They worked for about two weeks then died on me. Still in the process of reaching out to seller to get this corrected
1,Wasn’t able to get them to pair with my phone
1,Did not last 2 days before they stopped charging and turning on when connected to computer were named “sucker’s beats” Guess im a sucker for shopping for beats on amazon
5,Great headphones
1,Absolute garbage. Stopped working after a day and no longer powers on or works with charging.  Attempting to return.
1,These headphones do not charge.  I would like a refund please.
1,I bought these renewed headphones and charged them once and then they wouldn’t hold a charge
1,My beats stopped working after a few uses. I've had this product less than a month. I will never buy from the supplier again
1,What I didn’t like about the Beats was that it came with scratches. But everything els was perfect.

3,I bought these to replace my original misplaced headphones. The sound quality is definitely lower than my newer pair and for some reason the ear loops were shaped differently. They didn’t fit the same. It was a great price but in the future I would probably go for a new pair.
2,Purchased these one year and twenty days ago. Earlier this week they stopped charging. I checked the cable and the port and both were intact.Earlier this year the microphone stopped working which wasn't a big deal since people had trouble understanding me when I used these for wireless calls.These come with a one year limited warranty which is handled through Apple support. I called them this morning and the only thing they were willing to do is charge me shipping to send them in and then charge me to repair these relatively substandard earbuds. No exceptions and it's a little suspicious that they died riiiight after the warranty expired.These were used pretty much daily for a year and the sound quality battery life and bluetooth connectivity never gave me issues. I used these both on Pixel 3 and Samsung Galaxy S8. Prior to these I used some Senseo wireless earbuds which were like 30 bucks and the biggest improvement in the $150 more Powerbeats 3 is a slightly better range on the bluetooth.So.. I wouldn't buy these if you're looking for longevity or phone calls. I use these daily and listen primarily podcasts and audiobooks and the sound quality was fine for that.The fact I shelled out $189 bucks for these and they died a year later offends my sensibilities and I won't purchase again.
2,I was excited to get my Powerbeats in the mail and initially everything worked out of the box; no connectivity issues clean packaging good sound quality. I was satisfied until they died mid workout with no dropping water damage etc. Charging them didn't even turn on the indicator and after several frustrated attempts too search the internet and to get the indicator light on I went back on Amazon and filed a return. Liked the product but died too quickly.
2,I used my Powerbeats for less than two years. They stopped working one day and could not be reset. I called Apple and was told it would cost $105 to repair them! It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. As for sound quality I would give them 6 out of 10. I'm thinking of buying the Jabra Elite 65t next time.
1,I've had these about 8 months i really only started using them heavily about 2 months ago. They turn off constantly. I finally went to the apple store and was told that they're made to turn off if they get wet and if i sweat too much they would turn off. So basically you can't wear them to workout why else would i want these. On my way to buy another brand right now.
2,Worked for 3 months but the peace fell on its own but they won’t fix it unless I pay 200 dollars so won’t get these again
1,I have went 3 pairs of these in the last couple years. I accidentally bought these ones thinking they were new. They came in a cheap box and dirty. There was dust all over the year pieces. Also they won’t turn on or even charge.
5,I love the sound quality! And they are so comfortable! I use them at the gym school and work!
3,Shipped quickly. That’s where the positives end.Product is not same model number advertised. These are NOT the same as the product shown or described. Although these sound decent I don’t think they’re worth the extra cash you shell out for Beats plus the renewed version doesn’t save too much over buy new ones. These appeared lightly soiled and they’re missing the locking bead to help keep them on. The earbud tips that came with them seem to fit the device and the case fits too but you should spend a little more to get the most current Beats so that you get authentic accessories instead of some cheap equivalent. Also these are an older model so there’s no way to register them to update the software. Buy new ones on sale so you get the full manufacturers warranty updates and don’t have to worry about receiving a device that wasn’t even factory reset. When I paired them they had some woman’s name. So much for factory renewed/refurbished. I’m all for keeping electronics out of the landfill but I’m worried these will crap out. Plus I have to order moldable ear tips since the three that came with it don’t fit quite right. Buy some cheap Skullcandy sports earbuds from your local outlet store.
