4,Quality was good and just what I was expecting
5,I never take it off when I shower or swim . It seems to be good be with water . A little hard to put on .
4,It’s okay but not the best. The band is very thin and the adjustments doesn’t seem to fit my arm.  The Face of the watch seems to be to heavy for the band itself.
4,Easy to wear
5,Love this band! Great for dressing up your watch a bit. I wear it to work every day - goes with every outfit!
5,Me gusto mucho y Esta muy cómodo ala hora de usarlo
4,I almost returned this because it squeaked constantly the first few weeks but I kept it hoping it would go away. The squeaking did get better and I don’t notice any now but the leather is already getting faded/stained maybe from sunscreen? I had a leather band for years before this that always cleaned up just fine but I have tried cleaning the band first with leather cleaner then with soap and the discoloration is still there. I do wear it everyday but never in the shower or while swimming. Doesn’t seem like it will last very long unfortunately.
5,This is my second time purchasing this band.  It’s very simple but elegant and the quality was amazing.  I know it’s not recommended but I wore my first band through multiple exercise sessions and it did not fall apart.  I did wipe it down after each workout and cleaned it often so that might have helped.  There are also so many flattering color combinations available that I will probably be purchasing this again!  Overall very satisfied!
5,Compared to the pricing of other official apple bands it’s a deal and while it’s fake leather i was surprised by the build quality and feel
5,so cute has lasted all summer still looks great.
3,I’ll keep it for how cheap it was but the rose gold clasps and adapter don’t match. The clasp is gold! I don’t know how durable it is yet so we’ll have to wait and see for that. But just know the golds don’t match!
4,This band it nice
5,This watch band is great! Easy to install and very cute!
5,It’s perfect! Even with me having wider wrist than most ladies.  It’s cute fairly priced and comfortable. Black w/ Rosegold.  :)
3,My old leather apple band started to wear out so I thought I would try a different one. This may have the appearance of leather from a distance but up close you can see it’s just an illusion. It’s plastic feeling and it makes squeaking noises as you move and it rubs against itself. Do not recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             You can dress it up or down! i love this band!
5,I love my watch band! One of the best that I’ve purchased and I have absolutely no regrets in buying it. It fits well and is very classy. Takes my simple looking watch and elevates it to such a classy looking watch.
5,Great quality and looks great with any attire.
3,I used it for my watch band for my Apple Watch
5,I honestly didn't know what to expect with this watch band. My old leather band gave out (after 2 years mind you) but it was no longer available on amazon so this was the closest that I found. I love it! I don't use the case that comes with it just the leather band. It seems even better constructed than the first band I had which I loved! I didn't notice in the picture until after I bought it that after the clasp the end of the leather is tucked under the rest of the band to stay in place. If I had realized that I likely wouldn't have bought this one because that usually bothers my wrists but I barely even notice it. It has been several months now and it is perfect! I would definitely buy again and will likely be getting this as a christmas present for my mom.UPDATE: 1 year later and it’s still in perfect condition. I have noticed that I do get less “move” and “exercise” minutes when using this band versus the Apple Sport band the watch came with which can be a little frustrating if you use it while working out but doesn’t bother me too much. I still love it and I even bought a second as a Christmas present for my mom!
3,Would not recommend
5,I really like the feel of this band and it does not make my arm sweat like the other bands nor does it leave a mark. I also like that it came with a bumper.
4,Classic look and styling of a black leather watchband.  Old style buckle makes this a bit cumbersome to fasten and it can pinch skin.  No selection of buckle metal color.  Easy to change to and from other bands.  I would recommend not getting it wet. Worth the price.
5,The Band is so comfortable  I like the closure it makes the watch feel secure.  The band quality looks really nice.  This watch band will match all my outfits.
5,Everything was fine
5,
4,N/A
5,The band is very nice quality and comfortable. I purchased the black/rose gold and it looks very sharp. Highly recommend.
5,It was a little bit thinner than I expected but its very comfortable and the metal piece matches the rose gold on the watch perfectly.
5,The band is stylish durable and great colot
5,For the price you can’t beat it and you will look so rich! Beautiful band and easy to install. At this price I can have a band to match EVERYTHING!
5,Love this band ! I purchased this one and one in brown and I love the bands . They’re super easy to install  stylish and great quality !
5,Beautiful
5,I’ve had mine for two years and it’s held up everyday all year just great!
3,It looks and feels a little on the cheaper side. I also noticed signs of wear pretty quickly after wearing it. I didn’t like it and quickly found a new band to replace it.
5,These bands look very good my wife loved it for her Apple Series 4 watch.
5,This is well worth the purchase.  It’s fashionable and durable and a great value for the cost.
3,It looks very nice. But the color is coming off from the metal on the band & I’ve only had it for about 2 weeks or so. Other than that the band & stitching is great.
5,Purchased this band as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it and sometimes wears it to work and on a regular basis.
4,I imagine that this watch band won't last too long with daily use because the material is not the best. It was difficult for me to loop the band through the last opening and it is not fully secure on my wrist (slips a bit) but it looks great!!! I will need this for some professional settings and gatherings so it fits this purpose.I did not like the case that came with it but that was more of a personal preference.
5,Love this band! Comfy and classy!!!
5,Before purchasing this product I spent a lot on other bands that looked good but were too bulky and too big for my small wrist. I was skeptical of this product because the price was so low. Well I've had the black band for nearly 2 months now and I love it! I bought the rose gold and while it's true that the buckle is not rose gold it's hardly noticeable and I don't mind. This product is truly a great value for the money. And it fits my small wrist perfectly and is not at all bulky. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Love this watch band. I have worn it everyday for 5 months and it still looks great. A little wear and tear but as to be expected. Looks like real leather and is comfortable/secure without being sweaty! Great purchase. One note the watch clasp is gold not rose god but where the band meets the Apple Watch it matches perfectly.
2,Beautiful straps but they make an annoying squeaking sound once it’s attached to the watch and you put it on. I thought maybe it’d stop making the sound but it didn’t and I had to take it off not too long after I put it on.
5,Very nice looking Exactly what it looks like in the picture and smooth leather
5,This product is extremely nice comfortable and worth the purchase. I purchased two and I am about to buy a third one. Product is as it states!
4,Comodidad!!!
5,I was looking for a leather band and it ok.. I felt it to be bit light feeling but the Rose Gold Bumper is Sooo nice like if your just looking to transform your watch with a hint of gold I would recommend getting it just for the bumper alone
5,I have had several bands for my watch each of which matched the face color. When new emojis became available for the watch I fell in love with the the little tiger face which is on a black background. My old bands were pink and maroon so I bought a black band and I love the look. It’s like having a brand new watch.
4,I absolutely love the fit and look of this band. It’s definitely worth the money. The only issue I had with it it the buckle did not match the color or the attachment. It was supposed to be black band with a rose gold buckle and attachments and it was a combination or rose gold and yellow gold. Besides that it’s perfect I highly recommend it !
2,Great price point. I got a rose gold watch so needed to match the rose but with a black everyday band so all that is awesome. However every movement of my wrist the band squeaks!!! I have been wearing it for two days and trying to get over the squeakiness but wow its annoying!
4,I like this band but it’s a little hard to tuck the strap into the underside of the band (like the actual Apple Watch bands). If I make it looser then it’s easier but then the band is too big.
5,Easy to install
5,I’ve always had an issue of eczema with the original band of the apple watch but this band is a game changer! No more itchiness! It’s comfortable even when you’re sleeping looks very professional and very good quality. Worth the buy!
3,Missing the case.
5,Very easy to to replace to my watch fits like a glove
5,I like this band; it was easy to install and is comfortable
4,Fits my extremely small wrist well. Band seems slightly wider than the original bands but sleek. My only complaint is the attachments are rose gold as ordered to match my watch. But the buckle on the back is regular gold. It's quite a big contrast. My wrist is so small that you don't really see the buckle and the watch face at the same time but it bothers me they don't match.
5,I ordered this because the rubber band that came with the watch made my skin break out. No problem with this leather one! It was easy to install and comfortable on my wrist.  Very happy!
5,so well made. very solid and great quality! I highly recommend this band.
5,Cute comfortable! It also doesn’t make your wrist smell weird after wearing it all day like the silicone band does. Seems to be well made and durable. The parts that attach to the watch match the watch really well too color wise. On some watch bands the part that links to the watch doesn’t match the color of the watch at all and so it looks bad but this one is spot on!
3,The band I have is ok. I didn't look at the way I put it on. Instead of having two loops to put the band through one has to tuck in through an opening which puts the band you would put into the loops through a hole. I have small wrist and it isn't possible to draw the band though the hold because of my wrist there. I would prefer the typical watch band where you finish attaching your band through two loops. Also the band is very stiff.
4,I think this is a pretty good watch band for my Apple Watch (40mm Rose Gold). It feels good and it’s definitely comfortable and lighter than the normal band that comes with the Apple Watch. It does not look cheap and it does not look fancy either; it looks perfect to wear anywhere.
2,It is very thin  doesn’t look the the photo . I only wear it when I’m dressed so it won’t get wet it’s not waterproof - not real leather  based on cost it’s ok.
5,It fits my wrist well sometimes I forget I even have it on.
5,It is very comfortable and easy to put on. Feels very secure.
5,Really like this watch band.  Looks great with my rose gold apple watch.  My wrists are small and I love that the strap tucks inside the band. Purchased the tan one too!
5,no dislikes
5,So far so good.  Easy to install looks great and feels comfortable.  Only have had a few days so can’t comment on durability yet.
4,Very comfortable and cute. It made a squeaking sound the first few days when I would move my wrist.
4,The fact that the buckle and connectors are 2 different shades of “gold” is a huge bummer. (Reason I docked a star). However it’s something I can live with for the price! It’s very comfortable and seems well made! It looks classy/clean.
4,The only thing that I wasn’t super satisfied on was the distance/placement of the holes on the band. I really needed a size setting that was in between what was already created. But having said that I’m happy with this product.
5,Love the way it feels
5,Really nice quality leather and comfortable. It stretched a little after wearing for about a month. Still looks brand new. The case for the watch body wore out quickly. I don’t like that look but does protect from scratches.
5,This is my 4th time purchasing an Apple Watch band on Amazon. I decided to give this brand a try and I’m glad I did. The band is very comfortable. I love it so much I’ve purchased another one in a different color! Love it!
5,I stole my wife’s older watch I wanted a nice looking band.  This worked out nicely.  Easy to install nice look and comfortable to wear.
4,Love it! Only complaint is that the buckle color doesn’t match the piece that goes into the watch but it’s on the other side so you can’t really notice.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very uncomfortable and so loud. Can’t wear this without hearing squeaking every time I move my arm or hand. The squeak is coming from the leather it connects to the Apple Watch just fine. Also I’ve only worn it for two days and already am starting to see some creases in the leather. Very disappointed.Note: it also had a very strong smell when I opened it but that went away within a few hours
5,I like my silver Apple Watch with the white band for summer but for winter I got the black leather band and rose gold case and its so cute! very professional. Comfy! definitely worth it.
5,I love the way this looks. The original pink band wasn’t my style but this makes it look so much classier. Haven’t worn it long enough yet to know the quality so this rating is on aesthetic alone
5,I am very happy with this product. Nice fit with strong construction.I wear it at work (beautician) and try not to get the band wet but sometimes it happens ... and it still looks brand new!
5,I'd ordered a black leather band for my watch before and it left black fuzzies on my wrist. I was afraid this one would do the same but no it is very nice for the price and sleek! Great quality for the price.
2,There’s really no other way to describe the noise but creaky or squeaky. I never had a watch band make noice but this one does. Absolutely annoying. Returning this today.
5,This watch band is made of nice leather and is very comfortable to wear. The metal fasteners my watch face perfectly and the band is very simple yet attractive. Great value! I would buy again.
5,Good quality. Rose gold cover and band good match to rose gold watch.
5,
2,Bought this Watch band for my wife. She loved it however it broke only after 3 months. Not worth the money in my opinion
4,I've only used it once but I liked it I do like the face protector
5,I didn't like the pink rubber band that came with the watch because it got dirty too quickly.  This band is easier to fasten and it's comfy.
5,Great quality and great price! I did see a few reviews about the gold loop being a different color than the rose gold pieces but it doesn’t really bother me.
4,Ok
1,This looks nice but it starts to stink right after water or sweat goes in it
5,I don’t recall the last time I wrote a review but this product is so nice and perfect. Makes my watch feels like brand new 🤩
5,Very nice quality
4,It’s nice for the price
5,This product is great and I like that it comes with a plastic piece for around the watch so everything matches nicely.
5,Good product for a decent price. I’ve had it for a while now and I wear it all day. No complaints.
4,I like the band and it fits comfortably but it does has a different clasp than shows on the picture.
4,Good band
5,This watch band looks really nice when I want to dress up my watch a bit. I love have the guard around the watch face for added protection
5,This is a great watch band. It’s comfortable durable and looks beautiful and all for a very affordable price.
5,Absolutely love the quality! It’s better than I thought it would be based on what I read on other reviews!
4,The band broke within 4 months of her wearing it.  Not as durable as I would have thought.
5,Definitely a great value for the money! The case didn’t work with my watch. The holes were in the wrong place but the band is great!
5,This is a great product. The matrial is great. It’s comfort on my wrist. It’s like a band from a designer mark love it🥰
5,Easy to get on the band and also easy to get on yourself afterwards
5,Very nice watch band. I looks good & feels good.
5,Great product liked the comfort and packaging. Love the design and no hanging strap. Tucks in nicely
5,Easy to install gives a classy look over the standard silicone band.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Soo Cute (: & super comfy
5,Loved it it looked amazing and elegant. The shipping was also very fast. Would buy again for other smartwatches.
5,I love this band. I have a weirdly small wrist and have a tough time finding a band that fits well and comfortably. I love this band!
3,I’m giving it a 3 star because of one small thing BUT huge to me because now that I noticed it it is bothering me. The band has two different colors. The part that it’s attached to the watch is rose gold but the loop thingy is gold. I’m pretty disappointed because I really liked the band but now it’s really bothering me. I’ll probably be returning. ☹️
2,the leather is of low quality and the metal color is gold rather than pink gold
5,i personally don’t mind the gold buckle. It’s the perfect deviation from convention that gives enough of a micro thrill to make you think you’re a rebel. it’s a good product at a great price. buy it
5,Perfecto me gusta su material ha sido una compra formidable
4,Very comfertable
5,I absolutely live this band. It looks awesome and it’s comfortable great for occasions when your going out with friends for dinner or for a drink.
3,Product says natural leather but it’s the thinnest leather band I’ve ever see. Feels cheap. It’s comfortable enough. But I wouldn’t have paid this much for a band looking. I kept it. Because I just couldn’t be bothered to return.Packaging was very nice!!
5,I want to say that I absolutely am happy with my purchase. I loved everything about this band. It really makes the apple watch look classy and she says it is very comfortable. I was also impressed with how durable it is and the material used.
5,The band has smooth material. It fits perfectly with my Apple Watch series 5. I will be purchasing other colors soon.
5,Good quality band very elegant and fancy band for the price! It feels smooth and durable. Glad that I could find a stylish band at such a reasonable price.
5,Great product!

5,Love it!  Looks expensive and is very comfortable
5,Feel great good for the price
5,This band is so durable I wear it everyday and it hasn’t started to unravel I’ve had it for two months and still looks new
3,I ordered the 38 mm for my small 5 in wrists and it was still a little loose on the very last hole. It is a good looking watch. I wish they made it for smaller wrists.
5,Cute and simple. Easy to place on watch
5,Liked it so much I bought two other colors
5,Nice
5,Very comfortable and my watch face feels secure. The band stretches a little. I gave small wrists and am close the last notch

5,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality as it was quite a value.
5,Excellent quality great product for a very reasonable price.I’m enjoying the watch band so much I’m going to order more in different colors.

5,Good fit
5,Worth it! Looks very fancy and feels secured on the wrist.
5,Very comfortable and looks great!
5,Love this band! Perfect accessory for your outfit. I use the original one to workout and this band for work/going out.
5,Absolutely love it!
5,This band works great and stays closed too.  Looks good also. I really happy with this case
5,I like to interchange bass and this is a great casual band!
5,Deserves 5 stars.
5,Really solid product they seem to be genuine leather and for the price that’s hard to beat!
5,Great watch band! I wear it all day at work and it is super comfy
5,Soft comfortable compatible.
5,Love this band! Looks like genuine leather and it’s very comfortable. Bargain for the price.
2,Ordered this product because o thought the case would cover the screen as well it doesn’t. It only covers the outer edges of the screen which would work if you had a screen protector. But I wanted something that cover the screen and the edges as well. The straps are ok I had them on for about a day and they got sweaty. Over all this is a pretty below average product.
3,This product runs very small I am in the very last hole
5,I love it! It’s light and trendy! Fits nicely around my wrist and has a flexible/comfortable  fit.
5,It is easy to use good looking and WAY better than anything I’ve seen
5,The price is good
5,I love this watch band. It was described perfectly by the seller. Will buy another one in a different color.
5,Love it!! Very comfortable!!
5,Great buy!
5,Absolutely love this band for my watch and small enough for my tiny wrist!
1,I would not advise any one to purchase this product. I did not receive the TPU Scratch Resistant flexible case nor did I receive a return packing slip or box to facilitate a return for a refund. Do not purchase this item as it is not worth the time and hassle trying to get a refund or send it back as it does not come with the ability to return it and you probably won't receive all of your items.
5,Compliments the watch so much
3,Rápido se enmoheció 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ El tono es muy pálido para mi gusto
1,Low quality
5,Comfy to wear. Love the style goes great with my watch.
3,The leather was much thinner than expected but it was comfortable.
3,Definitely does the job but doesn’t feel like the best quality. Really light weight a comfortable too.
3,Description says rose gold but it is yellow gold
5,Very cute faux leather watch band!
5,I am very satisfied with this product.
5,I love the way it fits and so comfortable.
5,Nice watch band quick delivery
5,Great for the price. I like that the extra band goes behind.
5,Got my band today. So far it looks and feels great.
3,Not very comfortable band is lighter than expected and makes an annoying squeaky noise.
5,Amazing quality and fits my small wrist! Super comfortable.
5,Quick and fast shipping. Exactly what I needed.
5,Great value for the money.  Looks nice.
5,Super cute for the price
5,Looks great and has worn well
5,Great
2,The watch face protector is too big and it makes it hard to even push the buttons on the watch. The bands stick out where they slide in. It's just poorly sized.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
2,It’s a nice looking band but the color of rose gold on the watch sliders/connectors is very different from the color of the buckle. I assumed both were the same color but the buckle is just gold. I probably would have skipped over this band if I was aware of that.
5,Great!! Looks good super comfortable.
5,Excellent! Great color and sturdy
5,Wife loves this watch band.
5,Love the band
5,I would purchase again
5,Great value. Comfortable
5,Awesome product
5,Like this
5,Nice leather
4,It’s a really nice band. It makes my watch look more elegant compared to the original band and it’s great for an everyday look but even for dressing up.I wish the design was different and you didn’t have to tuck the extra length under like with the original band because with a smaller wrist it’s kind of difficult. That’s my fault for not taking a better look before ordering. But I still like and will keep it.The band is pretty long and has lots of holes on it for fastening so it will work for a variety of wrist sizes.Can’t comment on durability yet because I only had it for a couple weeks but if I have any issues I’ll come back to update.
5,👍🏻
2,Bought the band for work and it causes my wrist to sweat. I tried to wash it and now it smells. ships fast.
1,Cheap material found other bands that were affordable and better quality
2,I wanted to love this watchband - I wanted black leather with the rose gold attachments. Got that. What I didn’t want was a GOLD hook that didn’t match at all. Guess my search continues.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED I just noticed that the buckle is gold and the pieces that attached to the the watch are rose gold. I purchased the band to give as a gift for a July birthday when I was getting ready to wrap the band I noticed the two colors. Now it is too late to return and I am stuck with a watch band that I cannot use.Karen Hillvchill81@gmail.com
1,I disliked this product! Package was incomplete! Once I opened my package the box which should have the watch band and case was already opened and dirty. The case for the watch was already chipped. It’s not even durable. Will definitely NOT purchase this again.
1,Well I am bummed. This band seems so cheaply made. It squeaks anytime I move my arm and when I’m trying to work it’s very annoying. Any time I try and move my computer mouse it just squeaks and squeaks. Seems so cheaply made and I already threw away the box and can’t return it.
2,Looks good on Amazon but the quality is terrible. I understand that you get what you pay for but I’ve paid for less and received better quality with other bands.
1,Doesn’t fit the size it states
2,The ends that attach to the watch don’t match the color of the clasp. The attachments are rose gold while the clasp is just gold.
1,Never even tried to put on. Looks so cheap.
5,I love this little band!
1,this was a total ripoff  - was shown as a band and MATCHING cover for face of watch - cover was just CLEAR plastic = not rose as pictured and described - after complaining a replacement order was sent and it was the very same = just clear plastic - will not order from party agaom
5,Excelente bands I loved easy to install.
5,Looks nice would definitely buy again
2,Just feels very cheap.
1,Did not work on the face of my watch.  The band will probably work but I need the face items.
5,Great buy!
1,This watch band is for a Apple Watch that is water production yet as soon as I started to wear it it got mildew and smelled so bad.
5,Durable easy to install
1,The metal colors don’t match: the two flat pieces that slide into the watch are “rose gold” toned but the buckle clasp is definitely “yellow gold”. I had high hopes for this band (a friend recommended it) but it’s not the right color.
2,Cheap looking
5,Great quality band. Got the back and rose gold accented one. Looks great for work and casual use. Very well made good quality. Will look to buy other colors in the future.
1,The product description states black/rosegold...The only rosegold are the pieces that connect to the watch itself. The buckle is YELLOW GOLD. It looks awful.. had the description been accurate I wouldn’t have wasted my money.
1,Did not fit!!! And I was missing a piece to the strap!!
1,Worked great new but about three months in the holes ripped out and it started leaving a residue on my wrist.
1,You claim to be a 38 mm size for the watch but it was too big
1,I will be returning this item as the coloring the buckle part is not what I expected. It was suppose to be pick gold and is more of a yellow gold!
3,the metal that slides into the watch is a different color than the metal clasp. it also squeaks every time i move my wrist. i should've known for such cheap a price the quality would be terribly
1,The magnetic part that holds band to watch face broke after second use. Would not recommend product .
5,I am really happy with the quality and comfort of this watch band so far! I have seen similar quality and styles for 5x the price. A win in my book!
4,It’s a nice watch band.
1,It’s states it’s rose gold but the buckle is gold doesn’t match my stuff haven’t used them thinking about doing a return
1,The watch band is very thin and cheap feeling. Doesn’t feel durable on my wrist.
1,Watch came with a clear face not a rose gold one like in the picture
1,The sides stick out on my 5 series. Returning
1,Very cheap qualty
5,Soft leather well made. The band tucks under itself which is weird but still comfortable.
5,
5,I wanted a nice Black Watchband for my Apple 6. This popped up as a lightening deal. I thought why not for the price-point. Was I ever surprised! This band looks very expensive. It’s a nice soft leather band;  light-weight and flexible. It has a really nice finished clasp and comes with a watch face protector. I will be purchasing several more in different colors.
5,This is a great band for the money!
1,After a month the leather split at the attachment. Leather looks cheap too. Don’t bother buying it.
5,Really nice looking.  I like the rose gold. No fading.
5,This product does not disappoint.  The quality the look and feel are great.I purchased this band and several others in various colors.I recommend it!!!
5,The band itself is very nice and easy to put on and take off. Great product for the price.
1,This band and bumper are actually awful. MyInitial review should not be posted.First of all the pictures are a lie. The watch band does not have the same loop and quick release system as shown/come on the original Apple Watch. It’s more like a regular band with the ability to tuck the tail into the band.  The band is squeeky and makes noise whenever I move. I hate that.The protector is NOT A PROTECTOR. It’s a soft bumper that goes around the face of the watch but that’s it. No screen protection. The worst part is that the bumper I received is blemished and is missing paint - were these even QC’d??I hate this band and do not recommend it.
1,Does not fit the 4 series. Similar to another review it hangs at the connecting points and looks unsightly.
5,This is a great watch band! It looks way more expensive than the photo and you can wear it everyday! However if you workout with it in on the sweat from your wrist will stain the inside of the band and leave marks. Other than that I love it and will purchase in different colors!
1,I liked it at first but I have not even had this for two months and the case has severely faded and the rose gold looks almost silver. Also the color on each corner has completely worn away to black. Not worth your money!
3,Only reason it’s getting 3 stars- it was a fight to put the ring around the Apple Watch face. Shouldn’t have been that much of a struggle to put it around. But after i was done wrestling with it it was good to go. The band is amazingly comfortable.
4,The style is very nice and the band comes with the gold watch cover so that your watch and band match. Very light-weight and doesn't make your wrist sweat like the rubber watch bands. Seems durable enough for everyday wear. I love it so much I ordered one in leopard print and plan to order a few other colors as well.
5,Bought this product for my wife. She’s likes it a lot. She’s very hard to please so if she liked it yours would too.
2,These bands have the worst description on their size. They’re tiny unless you have a child size wrist it won’t fit!
4,Nice looking enough band. Cheaper material. I don’t use the leather every day so I can’t say if it would hold up against the test of time..
5,Great classic watch band for Apple Watch. Easy to take on and off and adds a touch of class.
5,It’s perfect just as describedAnd for the people getting mad about the gold buckle it does says that the buckle is gold in the description... and it looks good
5,Looks great with my rose gold watch! It also comes with a watch cover if you don’t have a gold watch already. Great value for the cost.
5,It is perfect for my small wrist and looks really nice. It looks just like the picture.
5,I like everything about it!🥰
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Fast shipping comfortable fit stylish look. I love it
5,Me encantó llegó muy rápido a Colombia 🇨🇴 Y es magnífica!
5,I love everything about this. It smells like leather and feels really comfortable. It looks nice and was affordable as well. I’m going to buy a lot more colors.
4,Two different colors. The face plate is rose gold but the actual band is gold. Other than that good fit.
5,Love this Apple Watch band. Great quality and ash looking.
5,Stiff at first but once you wear the band it forms comfortably on your wrist.
5,Love it!  Finally found a leather band that fits.
5,Súper confortable and great quality!! I wear it everyday
5,Awesome!!!!perfect fit looks great and fast services!
5,Elegant! And good price
5,Very nice! Matches perfectly with my rose gold watch!
5,De buena calidad y bello
5,good
5,Well made leather band a steal!!!!
5,I saw this Apple Watch band recommended on Cosmopolitan and decided to give it a try. I love it! It really elevates the look of my watch. The black against the rose gold is stunning! It’s easy to attach and easy to strap on.
5,I like everything about it ! My second time buying it
5,Item was very easy to install I’m happy I bought this product. Happy with my purchase.
5,It’s a nice band easy to change and very comfortable
4,I bought this band so that I had a more business look to my Apple Watch. I get a lot of compliments on the band. But because I’m constantly washing my hands the band isn’t too great for that. If the material was a bit thicker I think it will last longer. Otherwise great watch band. Looks great on the Apple Watch.
5,Excellent quality and look. Not sure how long it will last but so far so good (no signs of fading or other).
5,Love it feels great. 💙
1,Cheap ad dull
4,It looks really nice and fits the Watch perfectly. Not súper fan of the metal been two tones but at the end is not big deal. I was hoping for it to bring the protector as the video and other reviews showed.
5,I hate the watch band that comes with the watch....I like the old fashioned watch band. This is the one!Easy to use just like the old leather bands.
5,Comfy band but after a few uses it starts to peel
5,Cute and very durable
4,love the quality and color. looks very nice with the rose gold watch but wish it was smaller for my tiny wrists lol.
5,Looks and fits great Nice to use when I need to dress up my watch a bit more
5,The sizing was perfect. I was looking for a band that wasn't sporty but worked better for if I was in the office and had a more professional feel and it's just what I was looking for.  Thank you so much!
5,It was a breeze to put on the Apple Watch. It is durable. It is a perfect color match to the watch face.
4,I like that it’s a new watch band and it’s not silicone…. It stays on unlike the traditional Apple Watch bands. They sent me a watch protector with it. Quick shipping.
5,A great product just as advertised. Highly recommend!
4,The original Apple Watch was bought at a woman’s size. I wanted my husband to wear it. It was well made quality material and the larger size. Easy to change bands. Very happy with the product.
5,Comfortable doesn’t look cheap
5,I really am happy with this watch band for the prices. It’s really classic and goes with pretty much everything!
5,Comfort easy to put on.
5,Fits great
5,I needed a great looking watch band at a good price. This one is working!!! 😊
3,It’s soft and comfortable unlike other bands I have ordered but mine is so loud! The slightest turn of my wrist makes it creek and squeak like crazy. Am I the only one noticing this? Other Than that it’s awesome
5,I purchased the watch band because I needed something to match an outfit for a funeral with plans to put my old watch band back on after the funeral. I never switched back because I love the look and feel of this band.
5,Love it
5,This was my first band purchase and it didn’t disappoint. Fits perfectly. The style is sleek. Price is great too!
5,As pictured love it
