4,THIS IS A UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS BAD REVIEW!  5/24/16My original review see below I guess caught somebodies attention at SPARRIN as the following day I received an e-mail from Cathy at customer service I'll presume. She was very apologetic about the problems I encountered while installing the screen protector. To make sure I was satisfied with the company she offered a full refund or a replacement. I like to think that the product could have been defective  so I decided the replacement the best route. Upon receiving my decision Cathy again sent another e-mail with a promotion code for the new screen protector to be used at checkout. it was ordered and delivered Prime in the 2 day program. The following is the review for the new screen.So it turns out the screen wasn't defective after all. Just horrible instructions. The first installation was only done after watching a demo on YouTube. The video was informing but didn't actually show the right screen protector. The instructions also give some different direction. To be absolutely sure the screen was going to be placed properly I decided to let the Genius at the fruit store do the work. After negotiating a price the procedure started. He opened the package and the first words out of his mouth were ' I've seen this screen many times but with different company names ". The first thing he did was throw away all the installation material and brought out his own equipment consisting of a can of air alcohol wipes a large drying sheet some tape strips white gloves and a squeegee . A squeegee ?  After thorough cleaning with the wet wipes followed by a dry clean the can of air took care of any lint or dust. He made sure the screen was clean by holding the iPad under a light source and examining till he was satisfied. After attaching 3 strips of tape on the front of the screen and placing the screen on the iPad to position properly he wrapped the remaining tape to the back of the iPad and made it like a book cover. Again he made sure the screen was lint and dust free and slowly removed the protective cover the back He stated that removing the back cover slowly cuts back any static. He then closed the screen like a book cover and gently laid it on the iPad gently. Again checking for alignment.  When he was satisfied he pressed his finger on the center of the glass and watched the thing start clinging to its new home. Every thing I did previously with the first screen. When the screen seemed to be fully attached he showed me 5 or 6 large bubbles located in the middle and around the home button. I watched him wrap a micro cloth around a small plastic squeegee and watched carefully as  he forced each bubble sideways until the bubble disappeared from under the screen. I have to tell you though I was holding my breath as I thought with the amount of pressure he was placing on the screen the iPad would surely crack. After he saw my face he advised me the iPad screen is pretty heavy duty stuff and can take a lot of pressure but not a lot of drops. Every bubble except a small one at the home button was gone. He was pretty sure with a bit of time that too would disappear. He put the iPad back in its protective case my UAG handed it back to me and then refused any payment. Nice guy or nice store policy?So my review has gone from a 1 star to a 4 star. They lose a star for the lack of good instructions and a squeegee. If people knew about bubbles and how to get rid of them I believe there would be less problems. Hope this helpedI'm a firm believer in screen protectors. I've never dropped or misused my iPad or iPhone but both are covered with protective glass. As usual the product was ordered after reading the description and reviews. I read the reviews by first going to the end of each review and seeing if the review was written after receiving the product for free or discounted. If so the review is tossed and I seek only reviews where the purchase was at full retail. The reviews I relied on were pretty good so I decided to purchase the SPARIN glass protector. I was skeptical that for the price the screen would be what the manufacturer was claiming. It arrived with a few other items I ordered using Prime and it arrived as promised. The protector comes in a brown cardboard envelope type package encased in plastic protective wrap. Once opened you'll find everything necessary for installation. You get instructions cleaning materials and 3 sticky tabs for easier installing. The instructions seen simple enough but from previous experience I learned do at least one dry run to assure an easier time. After 2 dry runs I cleaned the iPad screen using the enclosed cleaning supplies placed the screen on the iPad without removing anything and all seemed to align up. Again I cleaned the screen of the iPad placed two of the sticky tabs to make hinges on the protective screen and found I placed them backwards. This of course made the sticky tabs useless as once on they don't come off. I turned to some simple packing tape and again tried. Once again I did a dry run and again all aligned up so I started the final or I thought final installation. Once you remove the protective film from the screen you have to be extremely careful in positioning the screen properly. Now the fun began. I don't know why but my screen seemed to float above my iPad screen similar to a air hockey puck. For the life of me I couldn't position the screen. Every time I thought it was perfectly situated the damn thing moves. It took over 6 tries to finally get the screen in position and yet it wasn't perfectly seated. I gave up and basically figured that the majority of the screen was protected. I pressed the center of the screen and it started to adhere. It's fun watching the screen connect itself to the iPad screen until you see it only goes so far. I assumed it was supposed to pretty much stick to the entire screen but it failed miserably. Not only wasn't it sticking but there were more what I call bubbles than I cared for. At least a third of the screen and two edges wouldn't lay flat no matter what I did. I know you really can't position the screen once on but I couldn't let it lay as it was so I pulled the screen partially up to realign and again bubbles appeared but this time in different areas. I tried one more time without full coverage but again thought some protection is better than none. So now I have a screen protector protecting only a portion of my iPad and to boot some dust particles showing up on any white background.I'm not happy in the least. In the packaging there is a card on how to contact the company by E-mail. The same card requests you write a favorable review on Amazon. I will contact Amazon for a replacement under their guarantee program. I will E-mail SPARIN to get their opinion. At this time though it only gets one star.This review was written without any promotional benefits. No free product or discount was received. All reviews are based on full Amazon retail.
5,I originally purchased this as a replacement for the more expensive version I bought for my iPad as it had broken in several spots. The instructions on how to remove your old Screen Protector made things even simpler!! This includes everything you need to install it!!!  It took me about a total of 5 minutes to install it with NO Bubbles!! Of course that probably excites me the most. The anti-glare makes it easier to use inside or out. It automatically responded with the iPad & have had no issues using it on the touch screen that iPads are known for!
5,UPDATE:  I've added 2 stars to my original review. A few days after I posted a 3-star review complaining about an apparent quality control issue (particulate matter stuck to underside of the protector *inside* the protective sheet) I received a direct email from a company representative apologizing for the problem and offering a free replacement. I was very busy & didn't respond to the email at first so I received a 2nd email with the same offer a couple of days later. I emailed back verified my shipping address and a few days later a new package was on my front porch. I waited overnight for it to warm up to room temperature removed the defective protector from the iPad and installed the new protector after very VERY carefully inspecting it and using the installation kit to clean the iPad's screen. There were no adhesion problems very few bubbles (all of which were easily cleared in a matter of moments) and only one tiny imperfection that is literally invisible without a magnifying glass and a careful search. I am very pleased with the replacement product and happily shocked at the exemplary customer service. (To repeat the company contacted me with an apology & no-strings-attached replacement before I had the chance to contact them.) As of now I'll definitely buy from them again as needed in the future.One quick note: As mentioned in my original review there are stick-on tabs to create a "hinge" to help position the screen protector prior to installation. This time around I did not use them and found it easier to carefully position the screen protector the old-fashioned way. If you buy this product I recommend practice fitting the protector (BEFORE removing the film covering the adhesive!) with the hinges so you can tell if it would be easier for you to place it correctly with or without them -- I'm sure the choice will vary among buyers.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've used tempered glass screen protectors on a variety of devices and the reviews of this one led to high expectations. I was amazed at how well-packaged it is: a semi-rigid heavy cardboard "book" style folder with a separate "installation kit" inside along with the screen protector itself in a protective sleeve and an internal frame keeping everything in place & protected.Unlike my experience with several other similar (smaller) protectors of other brands the installation kit was complete and -- hooray! -- the "wet" wipe was actually wet. (Be careful opening the installation kit; I accidentally tore off a small part of the instruction booklet.) The first thing I noticed was more complete/complex instructions than I'd expected along with a note saying I should view an instructional video on YouTube. The video came up right where it was supposed to be but I immediately noticed that it skipped over 1 step in the printed directions (use the dry wipe after the wet wipe but before the microfiber cloth) and did not show or mention the stiff card (size of a credit card) intended to help move bubbles out from under the screen protector as the final installation step.One very helpful feature of the installation kit was "hinge" stickers that let you pre-position the protector and then swing it out of the way to thoroughly clean the iPad screen then just swing it back into place for installation already in the correct position... at least in theory. I still had to be very careful positioning the protector because the stickers still allow a bit more side-to-side wiggle than is perhaps absolutely necessary. It was when the protector was in place and beginning to adhere to the iPad screen when things went a bit sour.Before using the installation kit I had buffed the iPad with a clean microfiber cloth until it shined. I then used the installation kit's wet wipe making sure to cover every tiny bit of the surface followed by careful wiping with the kit's dry wipe. I then buffed the iPad with the microfiber cloth from the installation kit followed by the included "dust absorber" (a big sticker you lightly tap all over the screen to pull off any dust particles that somehow were missed in all the preceding steps). At every step I carefully inspected the iPad for dust fingerprints and any other kind of marking checking it at multiple angles in direct & indirect lighting. (I can be a little obsessive when it comes to screen protectors.) I checked the screen protector one more time at different angles and saw a few little spots I decided were probably dirt on the protective film. I then peeled the protective film off the back of the screen protector swung it down onto the iPad and began pressing out a few bubbles......only to find 7-8 bits of kind of particulate matter causing permanent bubbles scattered across the screen (not to mention the entire upper left 1/8 of the screen protector not sticking nearly as well as the rest of it). I peeled the protector back did some more cleaning reapplied the protector and had the same particles in the same spots. I then very gently used the "dust absorber" directly on the sticky side of the screen protector and reapplied it for a second time and was rewarded with just a few small bubbles I was able to manipulate out.As of now the upper left 1/8 of the screen protector seems to be sitting on the iPad screen and not actually adhering to it (that's 1 star off) and I'm a bit annoyed at how I had to clean particulate matter off the supposedly clean & protected *sticky* side of the screen protector (that's the 2nd star off). For the moment it seems to be staying in place & remaining clean but I'll have to think twice about another of the same brand in the future.
5,This was the easiest screen protector that I've ever installed. Looks great on my iPad and the touchscreen is as responsive as if it weren't there. Great buy.
5,I almost never write a review (I will read them but I don't write that many!) I feel compelled to do so. My son dropped the ipad I bought 3 years ago and it looked totally cracked. I took it to the Apple Store and they said would probably be a few hundred dollars to fix. As the Genius Guy was looking at it he said "You seem to have a screen protector on here. I think it's just the protector which is cracked." Of course I had forgotten I bought this 3 years ago! He peeled it off and sure enough underneath was a perfectly smooth intact screen. Just saved my $$$. I gave the genius guy a huge hug and nearly cried. Thank God for this screen protector! Better than the cost of an overpriced Starbucks latte. Buy one now and for all your friends!
5,Liked the unit you sent however you sent me two (2) . What to do with the extra unit?
5,easy to install!! And I dropped my ipad just after I install this screen protector but it is totally fine.
4,I bought this product a little too late.  Had a crack in my screen and wanted to prevent further damage.  At least I feel more protected!  🥰
5,To this day (3 years since I bought it) it serves its purpose on my iPad. No crack scratches and peeling.Highly recommends this product.
5,The quality for the price is excellent
