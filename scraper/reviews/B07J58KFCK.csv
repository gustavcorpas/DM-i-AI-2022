5,Exactly what I needed to run some extension cords in my RV.
5,Helped to make my computer cords lay flat against the wall. The white blended in with the cord and the different sizes made it so that I had options. Essay to use and they work well!
5,I love these they come in handy anytime you need to get a wire or cable off the ground and up and out of the way
5,Ordering online and not sure what size you need then get these like I did. I bought adhesive ones first and they were garbage I was done messing with my cord and got these to get the job done
5,You will need this product for your daily life to organize the wires and other stuff.  Must have. I strongly recommend having this item.
5,Good value if you need lots of these.
4,Only issue is the nails are not long enough.
4,Pretty economical method to attach out outdoor lighting.
5,These cable clips worked perfectly for our office. We bought a new desk and had to re-arrange our office moving our computers further from an outlet. I was able to use these cable clips to route a power strip cable tightly along our trim to the back of our desk. It looks clean and helps keep the cable up off the floor. I would absolutely buy these again!
4,I bought these to straighten out an HDMI cable that we were unable to thread through the wall to our TV.  It was really making the whole thing look like trash. I used these to trace the cord along the stonework and no one would even notice if I don‚Äôt point it out! Love that it came in lots of sizes since I didn‚Äôt know what size I needed.  Now I have them in my possession I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find lots of places to use them.
5,These work really well and were easy to use
2,Pro:  Huge quantityCon:  Of the 5 sizes only the 2 largest are usable.  The others are so small I can't imagine what anyone could use them for.
4,The smallest one is too small no useful.
5,Helps keep cable against/attached to the wall. Make my house look a neater and not looking like a safety hazard.
5,The plastic they are made of is slightly flexible not brittle. Installing is simple line them up and tap the nail in. I hit the clips a few times at first I thought they would break. Pleasantly surprised they took the hit with no problem. I've been installing video security wiring where I need several sizes depending on how many cables I had together in one spot.
5,It‚Äôs a great product. Love the assortment of sizes and as shown in my photo the length is not short like some other reviews says. I‚Äôm very happy with it. Will definitely buy again.
2,For the money you get a lot. But these are very cheap and quality is poor. I tried hanging my Christmas lights w these and I could not put a lot of pressure or tension w these or they would flex the line out. So I would not buy these. I would looks at higher quality ones in the future.
5,These cable clips are very good.  I used them to put up my lights and cable in my house.  Very good product.
5,Perfect for hanging up patio lights
5,If you need several different types of cable stays because you have various gauges of wire these are a great buy.
5,Work great. I saw a few reviews that nails were not long enough. Product is made to hammer in the nail further than the plastic.
4,Not sure if I will use all these during my lifetime!  Great value.
5,Better then expected. I needed these for multiple things and these helped just how i needed. They are very good quality they don't break.
5,The best park is the sizes they hold and grip well
5,nails could be little bit longer but they are ok depsite what some people sayplastic excellentexcellent value
3,I used these clips to run speaker wire to surround sound speakers.  Worked well.  Holds speaker wire close to molding and around door frames.  Can not see with white cable.  Recommended.
5,Multiple sizes are nice and there are plenty for most jobs
5,Works as intended
5,nails have yet to penetrate the plastic--units bounce around when you start nailing because full penetration of the short nails the the plastic is not first completed before use--otherwise fine
5,Having a different sizes gives a option to install different types fixtures.
5,These work great. You get a lot in multiple sizes and they're inexpensive. They helped me organize my cables and they work well to keep them out of my toddler's grasp. The nails are small so they dont leave unsightly holes everywhere.
3,Very good for the price but some of the sizes are not true.  The 8mm are the same size as the 6mm so I have 200 that are tight for RG-6 video cable (7-8mm diameter).  My most required need.
5,Great for running all cable. Various sizes make it fit almost everything. Cable management at its best.
5,Good price and a nice assortment to use for security camera wiring and Christmas Lights.
2,it kept falling off
5,I use these to hide cords all over the house
2,They don't stay in. If you won't ever bump the cord then they'll work for you. But otherwise no. I needed something that can handle bumps and tugs occasionally. They don't feel snug nail is way too short and only goes a tad way into the drywall and the drywall seems to just crumble around it. A longer nail that could go into a stud would be much better.
5,They work quite well. The price is great.
5,Several sizes and lots of them
5,Great!
5,Straight Forward Use
5,Quality clips
5,Did the job a worked great.
1,For the price I didn't really mind that the plastic was rather thin. I thought that I would space them a little closer together and be ok. However the actual nail length is shorter than they looked in the product description. Much shorter than they should be. They don't hold the cable very good. I would advise you to not buy these. I don't write many reviews but I chose these based on a few 5 star reviews. This product doesn't deserve such praise.
1,It doesn't stick well. My wires were not that heavy and it came off easy.
2,Nails were too short and didn‚Äôt stick in the wall.
5,I love these so much better than the traditional U shaped cable clips. These are rounded so they fit the shape of the cable as the traditional clips are more square shaped so it makes it harder to hammer down and make fit the cord correctly. After purchasing these I will never purchase anything else!
5,This set is such a good deal for the money. It comes with 5 different sizes 14mm (100 pieces) 10mm (100) 8mm (100) 6mm (100) and 4mm (100).Quality is pretty good. I'm satisfied with the set and I am giving it a solid 5 stars rating.
5,Very worthwhile lots of clips in all sizes
5,This item is good for mount and holding more wires
5,Super fast shipping 100 of each size works great
3,Not the strongest but you got what you pay for...
5,Nice product
5,just what i wanted
5,Good deal. Thanks
1,nail are to short wouldn't stick under weight - had to glue them to make them work
5,Worked swell
5,I use the large ones (10 mm & 14 mm) to fix power cords & power extensions in basement. It works well. I haven't found much use for the smaller ones. But the price is good quantity is plenty. When I need it it will be there.
5,I love these.  Quality product and does the job you'd expect.
5,perfect size for  led strip or any thing else. tres bon pour instaler des strip de led ou  tous autre
5,plus resistant que je pensait
5,Tutto perfetto üëåüèª
5,Ok
5,Good selection of sizes good value.
3,I got this one for my outdoor camera cord and it would be better if the pin‚Äôs quality were better. Since I bent quite a bit of them when I hammered them on the deck.
