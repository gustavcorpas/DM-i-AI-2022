4,I have to say that I am happy to buy it at this price even if it is a renew product.But after I used it for a few days it started to disconnect frequently.Maybe just my product problem.I hope everyone will still support the cause of environmental protection.
5,Fantastic product! I love using it. Works perfect! I love that it‚Äôs the same charger as my iPhone.
5,The keyboard arrived in great condition and is working perfectly so far.
5,Really like this. Easy to connect to the iPad.  Perfect size keyboard to get work done.
5,I have switched from a mechanical keyboard to magic keyboard. I LOVE ITTT. It feels so relaxing while typing. The quality of the keyboard is worth the money. Definitely I will buy more from this seller.
5,This is an amazing renewed product. Performs like new. No visible wear and tear. I've had it for a month and battery is at 80%!
5,Great keyboard for pairing up with MacBook Air
5,I was hesitant about ordering a refurb but I'm very happy with my purchase.
3,2 out of the 3 I ordered worked perfectly. The third one is giving me issues with connectivity long lags with key presses and sometimes I'll press a key and it will fire many times as if I'd held that key down for a few seconds. It's past the return window so I don't think I can do anything about it.
5,This keyboard is the best Apple keyboard out there for me. Recently there‚Äôs been an updated version out with Touch ID but I found that newer keyboard to be less ergonomic and less comfortable than this one after testing side-by-side in the Apple store. Here are some things I noticed:Actuation:The newer keyboard‚Äôs key travel is ‚Äúclickier‚Äù than this slightly older version which likens itself more to the very unpopular unreliable and provenly-worse butterfly keys on the 2017 MacBooks. On this keyboard the actuation force actually feels more evenly balanced: not mushy with the perfect amount of tactile feedback.Keycap material:On this keyboard the key caps are made out of a nice smooth plastic allowing fingers to glide easily over the keys as you type. The new version has a grippier plastic that forces you to lift your fingers up higher off the keyboard since it‚Äôs harder for slide your fingers around. This combined with the tiny key travel makes for an uncomfortable typing experience on the newer keyboard as compared to this older one.Warning:The transition to M1 in the last 2 years has caused some incompatibilities!!! Please beware that not all Apple Bluetooth keyboards work with all Apple devices (this is at least what the Apple employee told me so take it with a grain of salt). Before buying an Apple keyboard double check compatibility with your device.Unboxing experience:Keyboard came in a discrete looking cardboard box - not original packaging but product was like-new.TLDR:Dear Apple: if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. The newer version is worse!Dear customer: I recommend this keyboard over the newer one. It‚Äôs cheaper and better. Make sure to check the keyboard is compatible with your Mac.
5,I had the same Apple keyboard for a few years and for some reason the numbers wouldn't type. I tried everything nervous that it was my 2017 Mac getting tired. I connected this new keyboard with ease and everything works great. For the price you can't go wrong. Highly recommend.
5,I seriously forget this thing isn‚Äôt self sufficient it‚Äôs battery last stupid long. When it needs to be charged I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh yeah you have to plug it in every once and a while‚Äù. Auto connecting is fast as well.
5,I thought I was ordering a wireless keyboard. This one has a small coed but I like it better. Sits a little flatter and I don't have to feed it batteries. Hopefully I won't feed this one a cup of coffee like the other... Can't tell the difference between new and refurbished.
5,Before I begin this review I need every reader to know that not all renewed products are guaranteed to be in the same state as mine was but do not be afraid of it! Almost all of the time these products do end up in GREAT shape! The keyboard is ridiculously amazing to have I love the built-in Magic Keyboard on my Macbook Air and wanted to have the same experience when I'm on my iMac which was also refurbished and did not come with a Magic Keyboard unfortunately. But the packaging was SOLID it definitely protected the product itself the keyboard connected AS SOON as I plugged it into my iMac. It is guaranteed to be reliable and you could also use it as a wired keyboard with other computers including windows ALL WHILE still having it paired to the device you initially connected it to the connection will automatically restore to the primary device that was paired. I have honestly no other words to say the battery seems to be reliable as well... For $60 I think this was a really good purchase! Go for it!
5,Good value!
5,Cosmetically the top of the keyboard looks like new and the bottom has a few minor scratches. In just a few minutes of typing and testing my WPM has already improved compared to typing using my mechanical keyboard. This keyboard is silent and very comfortable (for me) to type on.
5,The second generation of the excellent magic keyboard solved the problem of using batteries. The recharge lasts for many days being much more economical and practical for not having to change the batteries.
5,Own a desktop Mac and needed a replacement magic keyboard asap for kids online courses. This renewed wireless keyboard worked right out of the box without a hitch. Fast shipping and good communication from this family owned business. Would definitely recommend. Thank you
4,I‚Äôve been using this refurbished magic keyboard for a week now. It is working great.
4,Refurbishment:  It's in mint condition.  Some minor scratches on the bottom from normal use.  Key caps and body are very clean.  Under the keys appears to be squeaky clean as well.  This unit was never used much or the refurb process is top notch.The Product:  As I've come to expect from apple products the build quality is great.  Design is visually pleasing and 'just works'.Usability:  For context I'm a long time mechanical keyboard user and pretty new to the Mac world.  Overall it's a usable keyboard but when you compare it to all the other keyboards on the market it really falls somewhere around 'above average for a laptop keyboard'.  So if you need a Mac layout and like the laptop style keyboards and demand solid build quality then this or it's big brother really seem to be the only options.'Reasonable' changes that I would make:* The function key...  I REALLY HATE the placement of this key.  The best place I think would be on the right side of the spacebar after cmd and opt or at least to move it after the control key.* The F key row is uniform and hard to navigate accurately without looking. I would widen the board a 1/4" and put some extra space between f4-f5 f8-f9 or hey who has a disc drive anymore?  get rid of that key instead.If you've decided this is the style of keyboard you want to get and are trying to decide between this and the cheaper clones.  I highly suggest getting the real deal.  Those cheap ones are flimsy and well... cheap...  Save a bit and get the refurb.
5,I was pleasantly surprised on how excellent condition this keyboard is. No complaints works great. Will definitely order another one!
5,It was great! I don't see any difference between the one on my hand and a brand new one.Glad to have it in such a low price!
5,I had gone to Apple to get this keyboard. It didnt work well. Shortcuts didnt work etc. I bought this one. And it is gorgeous!!! Everthing works well. It identified by my macbookpro. And It is not like used stuff. Clean like new. Well packaged. Half of the price.  Awesome
5,Came on time clean and works great for me.
4,Shipment was quick has a little dent on the side but works ok so far been charging it .
5,Bought this so that I can use my 2014 macbook pro as a desktop. It works really well and typing feeling is smoother than 1st gen apple keyboard. I like also because no need for AA battery anymore.I didn‚Äôt want to pay for 100 dollars for apple keyboard so I got Amazon Renewed Product and it looked like brand new and functioning normally.
5,Great keyboard‚Ä¶. It connected immediately! I am amazed how good it for being renewed! Thanks Amazon! Highly recommended!!
5,nice package like new condition good price. I use it with all my iPads and iPhones
4,Overall the product is great. I can‚Äôt say the same for the charger and the box but the keyboard on it‚Äôs own is in perfect condition. No scratches dents dirt or basically any other signs of use. It looks brand new minus the whole unboxing experience.The cable I just tossed it it looks sketchy AF. And who ties their cable like that? üòÇThe box well it‚Äôs a piece of c***! So just don‚Äôt expect anything.I also expected an authenticity card but nada.
5,I want to begin by noting that my keyboard came with an Amazon Basics lightning cable. While there seem to have been quite a few people post reviews lamenting the fact that theirs did not I chose to purchase this keyboard because I found that trend had been decreasing.As far as the keyboard is concerned I love it. My typing speed has increased to about 115WPM from around 85WPM on my other external keyboard. The response of the keys is phenomenal. It requires very little touch pressure to depress the keys. Furthermore due to the narrow nature of the keyboard--its dimensions are nearly identical to that of my 2015 15" MBP--overall finger movement is minimal.The keyboard like all Apple products looks great but I am impressed with its ability to remain in a fixed position even when aggressively typing. The keyboard is very light and only has four small rubber feet (although the bottom of the keyboard is also somewhat "sticky") but it stays in position far better than my previous keyboard.The only con that I have is that it isn't backlit. I am not quite sure why Apple has avoided doing this but then again the response of these keys is definitely superior to my MBP so perhaps a loss of key quality would be a result of having it be backlit.Regardless I am happy to save a few bucks while buying a quality keyboard. I don't care to have an unboxing experience I just want it to work and this keyboard works great and came with the only accessory that I needed in the lightning cable.
4,I love Apple but their accessories are a rip off. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to spend $100 on a keyboard. Instead I took a chance on refurbished. Still more expensive than others but seems to be working well and supports the cmd key combinations you can‚Äôt do on a Windows keyboard
5,Does what it's supposed to do and well.Recommended
4,So unfortunately the Keyboard is not in Spanish; none the less if your mac is set in Spanish the keyboard will work in that language. Other than that great product!
5,I‚Äôm so pleased with this product that I can‚Äôt contain myself. The fact that it‚Äôs a very lite item and easy to work with makes a world of difference. The battery life is what I expected.I was very pleased with the great customer service of Amazon Seller - iBlueberry. I would recommend this company to my family and friends for their great service and products.Happy Customer Ramon Padilla.Thank You
5,Have not found any reason not to give it full rating. Other keyboards pail in comparison.
3,Connects quickly and worked perfectly ....
4,This wireless bluetooth official mac keyboard works flawlessly.  I didn't know it was refurbished so it surprised when it came in a plain box and had a non-apple connection cord.  But it is in great shape and the cable seems even better quality than the apple cables.
5,I recently upgraded my laptop to the newest MacBook Pro. And instead of selling my older MacBook Pro from around 2015 I decided to turn it into a replacement desktop computer. I wanted the Apple Magic Keyboard 2 but didn‚Äôt want to spend $99.00 for a new one. I was initially hesitant to buy a ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù keyboard because at least to me it meant ‚Äúused.‚Äù But I decided to go ahead with the purchase because I could always return the item whether through help from the retailer or Amazon.The item arrived as promised and packaged well. It came with a seemingly new lightening cable for charging; yes this keyboard has rechargeable batteries and looked barely used (see pictures below). There were light scratches on the bottom but I didn‚Äôt mind because it was a reflective plastic surface that would‚Äôve gotten scuffed eventually. I haven‚Äôt turned it off for about four or five days and the battery level is still at 98%.I‚Äôm glad that I purchased a ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù keyboard because it saved me a lot of money and allowed me to buy a ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù Magic Mouse 2. I would therefore highly recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for an affordable alternative to the in-store price.
4,This keyboard is the lightest one I have ever had which makes it perfect for travel purposes. As light as it is it feels solid and I do not have any hesitation tossing this into my padded business backpack for a flight. Pairing the keyboard is a piece of cake. Plug the included USB cable into the laptop (MacBook Pro in my case) connect the Lightning connection in the keyboard and turn the keyboard on. Bluetooth pairs the device in a matter of seconds.The keyboard is a little cramped which is taking some time to get used to. Surprisingly the keyboard on the MacBook Pro is a bit more spacious than this Magic Wireless Keyboard. I wanted portability and quality so something has to be sacrificed. The keys feel okay. If you like the tactile response of Apple laptop keyboards this one is pretty much the same.Finally as with any Apple product the cost is stupid. Even the refurbished model was more than I would like to spend but I have not found a third party alternative that meets my needs. If my company were not standardized on Apple products I would not be writing this review. :)
3,It works. I had high expectations for this refurbished keyboard. I have purchased refurbished Apple products before and never had any issues. One this keyboard the N key looks repainted and sometimes gets sticky. It hasn't been enough of a problem to complain. I share only because it is noticeable. Not sure I would go this same route again. Might be easier to pay full price and have the longer warranty period.
5,Very happy with this purchase. Works well! Thank you!
5,I ordered this keyboard for my office - I also own Apple's last wireless keyboard (Third Generation (Model No. A1314) 2009 2 AA batteries). I am a long time Apple user so I knew what I was expecting out of this product but I took a chance ordered the Refurbished keyboard. I did this primarily because I like to buy recycled goods whenever possible and also to save me a little money ($79.99 vs. $99.99 new). I read several reviews and the general consensus on the Refurbished product was about 75% good / 25% not so good. My product arrived in pristine condition with a 65% charge. There were no protective decals on the surface but it did come in a sealed fitted plastic bag with an "Amazon Refurbished Product" card inside. Have been using it for about a week now and it looks and functions like brand new and shows zero signs of wear. Be aware that this product does not include all the extra stuff Apple provides with new products like a Lightning cable stickers etc. In case anyone's curious I have included photos to show you the visual differences between the old wireless model and this new Magic Keyboard. The big difference between the two is obviously that this one has a Lithium-Ion battery that's rechargeable via Lightning cable.
5,Love my keyboard beyond explanation.  I use it all day for work and couldn‚Äôt be happier!
5,The refurbished product was delivered quickly and efficiently and as of now looks feels and operates as a BRAND NEW ITEM. If I'm ever shopping for a similar item this seller will be the first one on my list to check out.
5,FANT√ÅSTICO TECLADO c√≥modo y pr√°ctico.
4,It works great and arrived early
5,Battery life is great and convenience is unmatched. Saved money by buying used/refurbished too. Love it!
4,The keyboard is a near exact copy of my present MacBook Pro so making change-over quite easy. Only shortcoming is the lack of a backlight function.
4,I've been a long-time user of the original Magic Keyboard. I love the sleek appearance and low-travel keys.This keyboard feels like an upgrade in every way. The keys have less wobble than the original keyboard. The rechargeable battery simplifies power management. The full-size function keys feel luxurious compared to the half-height keys on the original. And of course it perfectly matches the dimensions of the Magic Trackpad 2. I only wish the up/down arrow keys were full-size.The refurbished keyboard was available for about half the price of a new one. My only complaint is that mine arrived with no lightning cable for charging and a dead battery. At first I thought it was DOA but a charge with the cable from my iPhone brought it back to life.This is my new favorite keyboard and the price was excellent. I deducted one star for the missing cable.
5,I bought this as a replacement for my wired apple keyboard with numeric keypad after I spilled grapefruit juice all over it. I really enjoyed the wired keyboard and the key travel of it but this wireless keyboard is really great for a few reasons. The keys are snappier (they don't really feel spongy at all coming from my last keyboard) and I quickly acclimated to typing on it. Wireless capability keeps my workspace clearer and the battery life is superb - with the added benefit that you don't have to worry about AA batteries with the built-in battery. I don't do a lot of data processing so the loss of a numeric keypad isn't really that noticeable but if you do type numbers often I believe Apple now makes a wireless full keyboard that may be worth looking into.I read some reviews saying that this refurbished product from PrimeDeals didn't come with a USB-to-Lightning cable but mine did and everything looked brand new. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
5,I have two of these one is brand new one refurbished. Mine came with a cable and I can tell no difference in the new one and the refurbished one. I see some bad reviews but I haven't had that experience. Same deal with the older Apple BlueTooth Keyboards; the refurbished have been like new.I have had to go through a lot of keyboards spilling coffee etc. These new models you do NOT want to spill anything on. The keys are not as easy to get off and on like the old model.I did test typing on this vs the old model this one outperformed and I like that it's slimmer. There is one in my keyboard tray that has the Magic Trackpad 2 connected to it with a Twelve South MagicBridge. The other one is on top of the desk that one is for keyboard shortcuts while using my Wacom tablet editing photos.I see no reason to get a new one I'd go for the refurb.
5,I will say it is overall fine. I have the older version and a bunch of other keyboards as well. This magic keyboard has much shorter travel I think about half of the old apple wireless keyboard.  But the typing experience is not so bad. My reason of upgrading is that I have to use the keyboard in a library and this new generation is much quieter because the keyboard is no longer hollow underneath and also the shorter key travel I guess. I don't agree with a lot of people saying this new magic keyboard typing feels pretty much the same as the older version. Call me sensitive but I do advise you that this new keyboard will take some getting used to if you are moving on from the older version to this one.On a broader scale the typing experience is like a 7/10 to me. I don't understand why so many review guys call it the perfect keyboard for mac. But it does the job.
5,This works perfect didn‚Äôt come with the apple box or the apple charger. I had extras so I wasn‚Äôt worried. Customer support helped me though and I kept it and happy! Saved money not wasted buying a new one for more and has same warranty.
5,Hard to know where your fingers are without homing bumps. Too uniform too zen for that. Not lighted. The cursor keys are crowded so fast numeric entries are not going to work with this. There is no 'embedded' number field only the typewriter layout for numbers. The rechargeable part is easy and convenient. I use mine with a Mac mini a Prapberry Pi 3B+ and an iPad. It packs easily - thin. It stays on desk without sliding during use.  It will stay on a sloping desk over a bed. With velcro you can mount this on a wall.Reliable no key bounce. There are other cheaper flat keyboards but this one is excellent if the style fits your use.
5,I was scared by the conditions that might come ... but it blew me away ... it's like new :D
5,So based on some of the reviews here I thought it was going to have visible use damage. However mine appears to a brand new keyboard. In fact the box it came in even had a ‚Äúnew‚Äù label on it. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,En excelente estado y s√∫per r√°pido
4,The second version of the Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 is OK. Bought to replace a failed version 1 that came with an older iMac we still keep running in our house. THis is a well made product and functions well as a keyboard. My only complaint is that the keys have virtually no travel and are uncomfortable to type on. I am spoiled by ThinkPads and Topre desktop keyboards so typing on this feels terrible and the lack of travel will tire your fingers out. For very light typing and basic use it's fine.The refurbished unit I received worked perfectly and was in like-new condition. I'd recommend buying refurbished over spending the money for a new one.
5,Be aware! This requires a lightening cable. Those of us without iPhones might not have one and the one that Amazon throws in with the refurbished keyboards is 4" long. I hated charging this keyboard until I bought a micro USB to lightening adapter (and a bit of rubber called LightningCozy to keep from losing it). Fortunately the keyboard runs forever! I never turn it off and it's never gone dead in weeks and weeks. I've charged it twice mostly out of anxiety. And if you have a Mac you can see the battery level in the Bluetooth preferences. Typing is pretty easy not as nice as some others but I bought this for the design factor! It's gorgeous if a little sharp on the edges. Perfect pair for using my Macbook Pro via HDMI to my 4k TV. Sit back and type away!
5,works perfectly fine. just like new.
4,The keyboard overall has been a great addition to my office setup (laptop hooked up to second monitor and wireless magic keyboard). I had an issue today with the unit charging and reached out to customer service. With their help I was able to identify that it was the charging cable and not the keyboard. Very quick and courteous customer service.  Thank you TekGalaxy.  Warmly Justin
5,To start this product was $50 less than normal retail. It came in excellent time quality was great. No missing key caps or issues typing on it. I'm writing this review right now on it. A few scratches on the bottom but not a big deal since I never look at it. Very easy to connect really like the MacOS integration connects with one button and the battery life can be viewed when your mouse is over it in the Bluetooth menu. 10/10 will recommend to friends and family looking for a good keyboard at a great price.
5,Just like 100% of you I was stressing if I purchased this or not haha after you see that negative 2018 review I don't blame you! I took a risk saw good reviews more than bad ones. I said if anything I can just ask to return it. Just got here 30 minutes ago each key works perfectly and the condition is practically brand new! No scratch or smudge or use of any kind can be seen. I rarely leave reviews but after seeing it exceeded my expectations I just had to leave a review to let more people know that its a pretty great product! :)
5,The keyboard was delivered swiftly and works as expected.
4,I followed directions for this refurb apple keyboard - said to plug it in so computer would recognize it -the vendor sent a firewire usb connector -i connected it -it would not recognize the keyboard but i had the presence of mind to try a different connector -and that worked ! what was sent was faulty - i am now happy -but its those little details that need attention someone else would have returned it -
4,My only complaint with this supplier is the refurbished keyboard appears to have been shipped with a 3rd party Lighting cord. This is not a big deal to me since I have lots of spares. I just thought it would have been nice for this to be fully disclosed. Regarding the keyboard: the up/dwn arrows are half size sharing the space of a normal key. I would rather have had a two separate keys like on a laptop and a smaller space bar. Oh well.. it is what it is.  I paired this keyboard with a magic trackpad so that my Macbook Pro and mac mini had similar interfaces.
5,At first I was skeptical about buying this apple keyboard after seeing some negative reviews about it. However I decided to buy it anyways cause first there are MANY positive reviews compared to a few poor conditioned keyboards. Secondly if this product was defective for any reason I can simply return and order another magic keyboard. When I finally received this product WOW was I surprised by how beautiful and flawless it looked. IT LITERALLY LOOKS AND FEELS BRAND NEW. I then immediate connected to my computer and type every single key to ensure that my keyboard was also fully functional and it was. I am very pleased with my purchase and if you're a customer who is skeptical about buying this keyboard then don't be. Would definitely purchase again.
5,Great keyboard perfect for what I bought it for great connection as well! And good quality product I highly recommend!
5,Thos is a great apple product
4,I was planning to say that I can't comment on the battery life because I leave my plugged in but I see that it's been unplugged since my last trip out of town so I guess the battery life is actually very good.I'm picky about keyboards.  I've tossed several in the trash after a few hours but this is a nice one.
5,Great battery life. Typing feeling is quite nice.
5,Had to come leave my first amazon review because I'm really impressed and saw some negative comments here in which I didn't experience with the product.  Like others have said product is brand new status I can't find any flaws.  It came professionally packed and with an Amazon certificate saying certified refurbished and that they guarantee the product.  To my eyes the lighting cable is the official Apple one.  Also people complained about not holding a charge.  I bought this and the magic mouse on June 6th and still have not charged either!  They both came charged at around 60% and I'm still at 32%-35% for both products.  Really really happy and impressed.
5,I love this keyboard! Prior to this keyboard I used the Mac keyboard that came out right before the Magic keyboard did and I thought that was a great keyboard (which it is) but I'm able to type even faster on this with more accuracy and I love the feel of the low profile keys. It takes almost no time to get used to and I don't ever want to think about going back to a different keyboard after using this one. It's incredibly lightweight and I'm able to use it with my PC running Windows 10 with no problems by using the cord to plug it into a USB port. I'm extremely satisfied and highly recommend!
5,5 stars for design weight durability functionality and cost.The only reason I would ever consider giving it a 4.75 star rating is because if you are not used to the new Macbook's butterfly mechanism keyboard then it takes a little to get used to. The keys seem to be a tiny bit closer together or more than I am used to (15" MacBook Pro 27" iMac keyboard). However I love that with one charge this keyboard will hold it for a month of normal use. That to me is amazing and I don't have to recycle batteries all the time. I love how "green" this keyboard is. Absolutely would recommend this to any multi Mac user household. Works great with my MacBook MacBook Pro iMac and iPads.
1,Keyboard works fine but it has a lot of scratches on a backside. That‚Äôs not you are expecting when you buy item in an ‚Äúexcellent condition‚Äù
5,This keyboard is almost the same form factor as the new MBP which is great so that when I work at my standing desk I don't have to re-program my brain each time I switch between keyboards.I like:1. The tactile feel more (it presses down more than the MBP)2. It's at a slight angle which helps with ergonomics3. It's extraordinarily compact (and light) so I can bring it on work trips easily4. It's an Apple product so you know it looks good and feels solidSide note: mine did come with the charging cord so it looks like that missing item issue has been fixed as of August 2017.
5,Just got this keyboard as a replacement for the Apple Wireless Keyboard I used for close to 12 years. Was looking to get this Magic Keyboard but didn't want to spend too much on it so the refurbished option seemed logic. Just opened it paired it to my 2015 MBP and started using it right away.  Pairing was a breeze; even though it came with a 46% charge I am currently charging it with the included lighting cable as I type this review. Did not include the flyers/brochures that usually come with a OEM part but that's OK; I never have a use for those anyways. All in all pretty happy with this purchase.
1,Inaccurate product description. I received the old battery powered keyboard advertised as the lightning chargeable keyboard.
5,I use this keyboard to Bluetooth-key into a MacBook Pro connected to a monitor. Its layout and dimensions are commensurate with those of the MacBook keyboard. The MacBook also runs Windows 10 in a VM as well as two Linux VMs. The keyboard is as easy to use with Windows as with native MacOS. The Apple Command Key becomes the Windows Command Key.  I've found it to be no problem as a keyboard to those Linux VMs. Additionally I sometimes plug the Keyboard into a Raspberry PI  another Linux. That box becomes my keyboard charger although battery discharge has never been an issue.
5,It's pricey. It's nice but very pricey.
5,Really happy with this. I've been waiting to find a decently priced used keyboard for my macbook pro on Craigslist and was only finding them in the ~$80-$100 range. I decided to give Amazon a shot found this and instantly ordered. It works perfectly and even came with a lightning cable for charging (although I saw some other reviews that said they didn't get one so your results may vary). My only irk is that the keys actually have some very slightly different placements. The escape button is much larger than the laptop keyboard so it shifts all of the F keys over by about a 1/4".
1,I‚Äôm no refurbishment expert but when you refurbish a product I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to also recycle the dirt‚Ä¶The delivery was quick and arrived early the packaging was thoughtful the lightening cord was a wonderful surprise bonus the setup on my early 2011 MacBook Pro was easy and at first glance the keyboard looked squeaky clean. However a few minutes into using the keyboard for the first time I noticed that a few keys weren‚Äôt working smoothly. I brought the keyboard closer to my face for inspection and that‚Äôs when I noticed that the keyboard was FILTHY. Specifically while the top of the keys look clean in between the keys there‚Äôs an accumulation of dirt/gunk glitter and what looks like a short curly hair from a part of the human body that I will not mention. There‚Äôs also dirt gunk and glitter between a crease at the bottom of the keyboard just below the area where the serial number is displayed. I also noticed a small chip on the keyboard but that‚Äôs something I can live with. What I can‚Äôt live with is someone else‚Äôs filth and germs. It‚Äôs quite incomprehensible how anyone‚Äôs money can be taken in exchange for this literal filth. Again I am no refurbishment expert so perhaps I'm just unable to comprehend the complex and scientific role that the recycled gunk and glitter plays in holding this "CERTIFIED Refurbished" keyboard together. But perhaps...swiping the keyboard with a q-tip swab and a bit of alcohol won't compromise the recycling process and will make for an equally useful product?
5,Let‚Äôs be honest what would you expect when it comes to a keyboard that‚Äôs from Apple. This keyboard is amazing and I already enjoy this keyboard. I love how it can connect to my iPhone iPad and MacBook and just work as if I was just sitting at a regular desktop. My only complain is that the included cable is a little short (shorter than the default iPhone charger) and if my laptop was a descent distance away then that cord would not be long enough.
5,Received the keyboard on time and it worked exactly as new.
5,I just switched to one of these after years of using the older bigger wired Apple keyboards. Very impressed - it's taking some adjustment to the smaller size but I really like it. The battery use is very impressive! I've used it for a week now and the battery is down to 94%. I also needed a new lightning cord for my iphone the one that came with this works fine with my iPhone and iPad so total bonus there! (the cord alone is 20$ less than the keyboard and cord). Will definitely get another if this one gets coffee on it like my last one.
1,I read the many good reviews of this"renewed keyboard" and hoped for the best.  The keyboard was well cushioned in the shipping box and there was no visible damage to the shipping box.  Unfortunately the keyboard I received had many inoperative keys. Then when I began the process of returning it I found I had to pay the return shipping cost.  I'm now an unhappy customer.
4,The actually keyboard layout part is the size of a regular keyboard but because there is nothing else to it if feels smaller (no big plastic bezels or number pad).  You'll have to try it and see how you like it. If you don't like the new MacBook Pro keyboard then you won't like this as it is the same thing. I like it though and type faster on this than any other keyboard.
1,Mine came covered in glue and orange stains. It‚Äôs said to be cleaned and verified but that did not seem to be the case at all. Reaching out to the owners was difficult and not helpful.
2,There's 3 or 4 keys that simply do not  work I bought this for my laptop so whenever I need those keys I just use the ones on my laptop. Not ideal but that's what you get I suppose with a refurbished item.
3,Came with lots of scratches in the back side. Looked like very much used product.
5,When this keyboard arrived it looks absolutely flawless in every way. No dust no scratches not even dirty from the delicate bottom of the keybaord. I would think this was new had i not known any better. I believe what they replace on these units is the battery because i have noticed just a slight less battery life than my new magic trackpad and they should both be about the same. But i would much rather pay have the retail for this keyboard and risk the small battery life difference. GREAT KEYBOARD SO FAR!!
5,I use this keyboard everyday in my home office and have had zero problems with it. It looks and functions as if it was brand new. I love that you can use your iPhone lightning charger to recharge it and the battery holds a charge for a long time (I find myself recharging every 1.5-2 weeks). There's no point in buying the brand new keyboard when this one works just like new. I use mine as an external keyboard for my external display pairing with my 2016 Macbook Pro. I have had zero issues!
5,Like a new product!
5,Shipped in nicely bubble wrapped bag inside a plain box that was very securely packed. Great savings as I‚Äôm adding a keyboard to a new Mac Mini M1. BTW freaky fast machine.
5,This is a true Apple product as it has the Apple embedded on the back. I paid a few dollars extra for next day delivery and it was delivered within 24 hrs- WOW. I had the Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard which required the two AA batteries. This one is so much better. It arrived with a cord that hooks it up to the computer itself and immediately started working. No batteries required I did not even have to set up the blue tooth for the keyboard. Love this keyboard.
5,If you're worried about it being refurbished don't be shows up as what could pass for brand new. As for the keyboard itself it has a lot nicer key travel than the newer 2017 MBP keys. Very easy to pair small overall profile and good battery life (lightning charging is a pro since already have one set up on desk). My only downside would be no back-lit keys.I also threw on the squaretarde 4 year warranty for $0.97... tough to beat that price for peace of mind.
5,Totalmente funcional
5,Perfect right out of the box!  I accidentally spilled water on my MacBook Pro's keyboard and some of the keys stopped working so I needed a keyboard to replace it.  This keyboard fits perfectly on top of my old keyboard and is a beauty.  I can access my track pad just like I did before!  And it does come with a charging cable.  So happy with this purchase.  Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
2,The H key stopped listening to key presses and doing CMD + H doesn't work anymore. Doing SHITF + H works some of the times. Doing a lowercase h requires some warm up so I have to press the key like 5 times until it gives me an h
3,I paid less than buying it new which I was grateful for but it's not perfect. If it's not plugged into my computer via USB (it's suppose to be bluetooth) sometimes while typing it will suddenly go all CAPS and there's no way to stop it until I plug it back in again. This happens even after charging overnight. And sometimes it's as if the shift key is being pressed even when I'm not typing so if I'm trying to click on something with my mouse a block of text will suddenly be highlighted. Very strange. Either way I'm not returning it. It's refurbished it is what it is. Just be aware that yours might not be perfect as well.
5,Bought this to take to work. I hate having cables on my desk so I was looking for a bluetooth keyboard to go along with my trackpad. I have used this every day since it arrived (September) and I have not yet had to charge it. If fact it says I still have 54% life left. Also there is no delay like some bluetooth keyboards give when typing. Refurbished is just like new. Very happy!
3,It's a (renewed) item so I understood I was buying something that had been used. However I didn't expect the aluminum frame to have quite so much damage. All along the sides there are very noticeable dings and scratches. It seems to be fully functional but just know that the money you're saving over a new item will probably mean a considerable drop in quality cosmetically.
3,First off product came as described and works perfectly. I misjudged how small the keyboard layout feels compared to the one on my Macbook Pro 2013 15" model even though they are the exact same size! I've adjusted to the smaller layout a little bit in the first week of trying it out but its absolutely terrible for typing long documents. The arrow keys are terribly designed and are driving me crazy. The product works great and I would love it if it was 1-2" wider but as a guy with average sized hands I feel incredibly cramped typing for a long period on it. Great product for those traveling with their keyboards. Not ideal ergonomically for daily use.
5,I was a little nervous getting a refurbished item but when I saw that there is a 90-day warranty I said what the heck. It works so well! It looks brand new. There is a teeennny tiny scratch at the bottom but nothing obvious. You would need to really look at it to notice anything. It connects immediately with both my MacBook Pros
5,This keyboard looks brand new!  I was a bit hesitant going refurbished but couldn't beat the price when compared to new.  This keyboard looks and works great!  I bought it as a replacement to my older bluetooth Apple keyboard and couldn't be happier.This model has the lightening plug with internal battery so you don't have to swap out the batteries every few weeks.Overall I would highly recommend this keyboard.
5,WOW! I got a product that literally acts and looks brand new! The charge is VERY long considering I am on my Mac so much. I have left the keyboard on overnight for 4 nights in a row and STILL has an amazing charge.I MUST COMPLIMENT that the product looks as if it was new! Not a scratch on it.I highly recommend buying this rather than a new one because the price is fabulous too. I lucked out BIG time and you will too!
3,Product functions the included lightning cable fell apart the first time I unplugged it. The keyboard appeared to have normal wear but the "V" key was not seated properly with the others so I removed the key cap to find that the scissor mechanism was damaged and also the key cap itself was a little mangled underneath. I swapped the scissor mechanism with the one from the eject key (as I do not have a disk drive) but I had to really work with the key cap to get it to properly work. I'm somewhat worried about the longevity of the keyboard because of this.
5,Works perfectly. I was concerned that the refurbished model wouldn't work as well as new but it did. Came looking like brand new and everything works as expected. It took a little while to get used to the new keyboard mechanism that apple is using which is different than their old wireless keyboard but now I like it just fine. I also like that it's rechargeable b y lightning cord so I no longer need to replace batteries when it gets low.
5,I just received my keyboard today so maybe I'm not the best judge but it seems to be in perfect working condition!  The only thing is the setup is slightly different from my MBPro so I'm constantly hitting "=" instead of "delete" at the moment.  That's my fault though. Anyway awesome so far looks and feels brand new costed $50 less than buying it new and that's important for me as a student. :)
5,I can't stand using the keyboards on the newer 2018 MBP's.  This keyboard still has the key press style found on the 2015's but in a much smaller package.  Its nice not having to reach across the incredibly large touch pad on the laptop to use the keyboard.  Paired with a Magic Mouse 2 or a Magic Trackpad this keyboard is one of my fundamental requirements for mobile computing.
5,Nothing more to say than it does exactly what we expect it to do.  Battery life is great unlike the Magic Mouse the plug to charge it is convenient so we can use it while charging it.  Love the feel of it and connects to the MacBook Pro in in no time.  Perfect companion for your Mac computer.
5,I love it.  It's perfect. I don't know why anyone would pay full price when you can get a refurb.It has worked like new and has all of the keys you expect when using a mac book.  I'd previously tried a cheapo wireless keyboard and it was missing a few keys including "escape"!  But it was only $12.Anyway it hurts to spend this much but it's worth it if you're going to use it a lot!
5,Ergonomico
4,No es cierto que sea en espa√±ol el teclado es en ingl√©s. Funciona bien.
5,I use it for my Mac Mini. Bluetooth and rechargeable is much better than the one I have at work where I constantly have to swap the batteries out. I don't really miss the number pad; I'm not an accountant.
5,me encanta este teclado es lo mejor cuando quieres escribir con el iPad. Aparte como no esta adherido al iPad puedes mover la tablet a tu gusto donde quieras colocarla.
5,renewed quality is very good. i am using this in my home office and to bring in my backpack to projects. i have also used this as a Bluetooth key bored with my iPad.  for only around $60 it a pretty good deal.battery lasts about 2-3 weeks.
3,Knowing this was a refurbished keyboard I expected a few flaws so I cannot be too upset about the product. The keyboard side looked new but the back side did have a few scratches on it due to what looked like sliding on a desk. The keyboard does not come in Apple packaging(to be expected) and does not come with a lightning cord. I wouldn‚Äôt say this was a horrible product but not the product for someone who loves that Apple unpackaging experience and prestige Apple product. I give it 3 stars because it is nice for a refurbished item.
5,Nice
4,The keyboard came fully functional. It's a very nice keyboard and it's easy to sync it. The typing feels great and it feels just like it should.It seems like buying a certified refurbished is a sort of luck if you'll get a lightning cable or not. I didn't.
5,If you are looking for a small and light bluetooth keyboard for your apple products this will be the perfect one. Bluetooth range is long enough to move around the device so you can remote your computer from the long distance. Also the battery life is super long! I really love this keyboard because not only the function and quality it is also fit very well with my desktop setup.
4,Just received the keyboard and I like typing on this low profile keyboard. Taking one star off as I haven't received lightning cable to charge. Have to see how the charge holds before I can confirm my satisfaction with this purchase.
4,Works well with my iPad small enough for transport excellent battery life
5,I've been happy with the functionality of the product. The OS does warn you a bit late about the keyboard battery level despite lasting a long time it conks out pretty soon after the warning whereas the mouse gives you quite a bit of warning. Just a programming glitch that's unrelated to the keyboard quality itself. Good range no issues at all and works within the UEFI interfaces just fine.
5,It was time to replace the keyboard of my Mid-2010 iMac and this was the perfect solution...like-new and at a lower cost than new. I'm very pleased with it. Note this version of the keyboard is actually smaller than the original and it has built-in rechargeable batteries...with the lightning port on the back of the keyboard so it can be used while charging unlike the MagicMouse.
5,This keyboard is very very effective and efficient. The wireless feature is very useful. I would definitely recommend!
5,Works perfectly!
4,Keyboard is fine so far but was disappointed to find that there was no lightning cable included‚Äîwhich is needed to recharge the keyboard. Sure seems like a "relevant accessory" which the description says is included.Edit: Company sent an aftermarket charger and cable out after I requested one via email.
4,Keyboard works just fine like the original. Mine has an ugly scratch all the way across it but does nothing to effect the usage. For the price I'll take a little scratch.
5,This is my second item of the renew list and can be happier. save some money and got a really good keyboard. so far my experience with the renew program is A+
5,This refurbished keyboard looked brand new. I did a quality inspection and looked all over very carefully and did not find a single blemish. I've been using it daily for 3 months now without any issues. The only reason why someone would buy a new one over this refurbished one is for the unboxing experience and to add to their Apple box collection.
5,same as the one that came with my iMac.  Just got this one to use with my macbook pro
5,I have been a long time Apple keyboard user right from a Apple DeskTop Bus KB. Then This Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 is the best KB ever.Its key touch is enough and thin size is portable to use with an iPad compared to a battery driven model.
1,The thing I liked was it looked new.  The thing I hated was half the keys don't work.  Seriously.  I cannot type the letter "L" using this keyboard or the numeral "8".  This isn't my first experience with Amazon "renewed" and "refurbished" products I am ashamed to say but it is sure to be my last.  What are they thinking? Is there any such thing as quality control in the plants that crank out this crap? And if they do have quality control - and they must! these are refurbished products. for heaven's sake - I am picturing a pack of part time high school boys (girls woudn't allow this nonsense) who get into Mom's medical weed every night and smoke it on their way to work.  Come on.  THE KEYS on the KEYBOARD are non responsive!! This would work well with the refurbished MacBook Pro I bought a year ago which still hasn't processed "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of...." the first an only sentence I ever typed on it.  And wouldn't you know it? The return process on the website is down and I can't process my return.
5,Came in a plan white box but looks brand new.  It is different typing from the original wireless keyboard but it's just like my MacBook Pro with the scissors keys.  I feel pretty at home on it and can type fast and error free. Great price to get a refurb and over all it's very nice buy.
4,initially I have received a damaged keyboard and its been replaced immediately I like the service
3,I good product overall but when you receive just clean the top  and all around it. They don‚Äôt clean it for you.
4,It delivered earlier than expected and it works just fine. However there are too many scratches on its back...
5,This renewed product arrived in Like New condition. No visible signs of use or wear and it works perfectly straight out of the box.
5,I ordered the keyboard for same day delivery. I was really impressed with the condition and product. The product came as if I went to an apple store and bought a refurbished product it's resealed but they won't have a box (stickers etc.. which I just throw away) but they did include a lightning cable I'm really enjoying it as it's working perfectly as if it were new thank you!
3,Mine seems to work ok but the some of the keys show a high gloss because of prior usage.I wanted my system to be all 'Apple' but this keyboard is not my idea of the 'ultimate'.A white keyboard with light grey lettering is hard to read. Could have used darker printing on the keys.Shipping was great.
5,I am writing the review with the new keyboard and new mouse. They look just like new products! Maybe I am lucky to get them in such good condition but it's worth the time and effort to try out these refurbished items before buying new ones just from an environmental standpoint. Let's share and pass on not buy and fill in the land.
5,I'm always worried about buying refurbished products but I was pleasantly surprised by this.It was in great condition looked brand new all keys function properly and it came with a usb charger. I charged it and have had it on 24 hours a day for the last 2 weeks and the battery had only dropped to 88%!
5,Product as expected
5,A clean keyboard came with a (short) charge cable. After I charged it upto 100% 8 days ago I didn't need to recharge it yet. (I left it at home so not sure how much is left though.)I worried a little bit because of a few bad reviews but it turned out alright for me.
4,This keyboard works well. Ergonomics are kind of strange - it is small like a tablet-size laptop keyboard and it lacks stands to elevate it to any angle.
4,It works.  It seems like a cheap keyboard and I fear it will not last.  I got what I paid for and only time will tell.
5,This thing is so lightweight so easy to pick up with one hand - I just wish Apple would make a full size version as an accountant the number keypad and the Home and End keys are essential to my work every day.  This one is connected to my Mac Mini that I use to watch streaming tv shows and movies.
4,Refurbished keyboard came 60% charged and in good working condition but mine did not come with a lightning cable. I like the keyboard. It is light and portable and works well with my Ipad pro.
5,Was a little concerned about buying a refurbished product but it has worked great.  My wife paired this with no trouble to her MacBook Pro after she got tired of using a generic keyboard that didn't have the Apple specific keys.  She hasn't complained so it must be working fine.
5,This keyboard is very light. It is very responsive. It connected with my mini Mac within a second.  Battery holds up really good. Even though this is refurbished it was in a pristine condition when I received it. Delivery was very quick too. So far I have nothing negative to say.
5,I was a little nervous given some of the reviews. I received the keyboard in like-new condition packaged well with a new apple lightning cable and the amazon certified refurbished card. The keyboard came 38% charged and after topping it off it has performed perfectly.  No complaints.
5,This is my first Apple keyboard.  I use it with my new iPad Pro 12.9.  Easily pairs and disconnects.  It is amazing I don‚Äôt have to use batteries.  Loved the price getting it refurbished at half price and purchesed the 2 year protection plan for $.99.  How great is that?
3,The keyboard is light and was the standard supply for the iMac I had earlier.  The same problem exists in that in general it works well but it seems to lag response on very quick typing of repetitive text such as passwords.  I am sure this is function of the keyboard since I don't have the issue on any laptop or other keyboards.
4,The keyboard is every nice and looks brand new.  My only complaint is a lightening cable is not included.  Other than the lack of cable this keyboard is perfect and you could not tell its not new.
2,I purchase 4 of these keyboards and they all have details. If you check the pictures it's pretty obvios that the keyboards have some kind of ink in several keys and one of those have a mark in the aluminium.So I don't think that these keyboards were ever checked and "reviewed" as the publication says.I contacted support and they answered they did apologized and said that I should email the keyboards backs for a return sadly I'm traveling back to my country so there is no time.  I have to say that I regret to buy this and most likely I'm going to go to an apple store to new ones.
5,This is a great little keyboard. Mine looked for all intents and purposes like new.It functions flawlessly as a keyboard. And easily sync's with computer iPhone aniPod Touch.At less than half the price of a new one. This is the way to go!
5,The keyboard is mint. It looks brand new battery life is solid and functions perfect. Came well packaged.Only concern is this.. I ran the 17 digit serial number on the back of the keyboard to check authenticity on Apple‚Äôs website and it did not register.
2,The product arrived on time as promised. As advertised it does not come in apple packaging. When opened the first thing you will realize is it is for sure a pre-owned which anyways was expected. But the sad part is that it is not cleaned before being sold. When looked at from the side angle I could see brown stains which gets formed over a period of time upon usage. Could have been better if the seller can take care of this and also the price. May be around $40 would have been worth it.
5,This makes my iPad feel like I‚Äôm using a MacBook it‚Äôs amazing! If it were possible to overate I probably will. Build quality is great. Will buy more as gifts for my friends and families. I know you can settle for less but you will regret it.
4,It has survived
5,This is a great replacement to my original which quit working.  Its nice and compact.  It holds a charge forever.  I highly recommend you get this replacement keyboard.
4,Did not come in original box but unit itself was like new
5,Seems to work just fine and have no issues. Has signs of wear and tear but that is to be expected. The support and return policy are good.
5,The keyboard pairs easily with my little Mac Mini and works easily with instant keystrokes even for old fingers.
5,Couldn‚Äôt tell this was a refurbished keyboard at all. Not a single scratch ding or dent and functions perfectly. Three stars for ergonomics only because it‚Äôs not a full size keyboard. Excellent value for the money!
5,The battery life on this is wonderful! I charged this keyboard when I first received it and it's been months now and it hasn't needed a charge. I use it every day. I am truly impressed. In addition it's a comfortable keyboard and I am glad I purchased it.
4,Though the item did not come with the charging cable the brand new condition of the keyboard compensates for it.I love this keyboard and everything Apple.
5,This is the second one I have ordered ... .one several years ago for my iPad and this for my desktop.  The iPad one has batteries ... I like this much better.  The touch is smooth and I like using it.
5,Perfect!! Keyboard is working great using it for the last 3 or 4 weeks about 9 hours a day and still more than 80% battery!! Really a great product for a great price
5,I wish it came in a full keyboard with a keypad but I do love it! I love that it is rechargeable. I had the older version that needed batteries and I was always changing them. I've had this one for a few months and have not needed to recharge it yet!
5,Easy to setup! Received very quickly! Will look into other products from this seller :)
5,I've been using this keyboard for almost 2 weeks and it works like a charm. It came in excellent condition and If I hadn't known it was a refurbished product I would have thought it was brand new. I'm very pleased so far.
4,Uses but works find. Battery is a litter worn out but it still types sooooo I guess thats what you get.
5,Came in perfect condition. Very impressed with this keyboard in general & very happy that this refurbished keyboard works like it's brand new. Very comfortable and easy on the hands. Love the rechargeable feature because replacing batteries is incredibly inconvenient on the fly.
2,COMPR√â UN TECLADO EN ESPA√ëOL CON LA E√ëE Y RECIB√ç UN TECLADO EN INGLES SIN LA E√ëEESO NO SE HACE.TODOS SABEMOS QUE A LOS TECLADOS SE LES PUEDE HACER ESCRIBIR LA √ë PERO LO TECLADOS EN ESPA√ëOL LA TIENEN
1,I'm surprised this passed Amazon inspection. The space bar is stuck in low position which makes the keyboard useless. . I often buy refurbished products (outside of Amazon) and please with those (BestBuy Apple) I was assuming Amazon refurbished had similar quality standards.Returning this one and getting a replacement hopefully replacement will be good quality
5,Purchased refurbished and arrived in perfect condition. Came in a brown box with a thunderbolt cable. I charged it for a couple hours. It synced to my MacBook automatically and works great without any lag. Definitely worth it to save $30.
5,Very satisfied with this product. I love that I don‚Äôt have to reconnect it every time I move my laptop. I come back home and the magic keyboard is connected. Also really makes my life easier. I love it!
4,Excellent condition work great the lightning cable provided is generic and don't work. BUT! the cable is the least.
3,Disconnects from time to time and is really frustrating.
5,These keys be super fresh. I could seriously click clack on this little bad boy all day long. So could you. You should buy it. Like click that big yellow Buy button right now. You won't regret it.
5,As good as new paired easily with macbook air beautiful.
5,Excellent product looks and works like new. Save some bucks and get this one!
5,I just received my refurbished Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard. It's a much smaller keyboard for me but I like it. It's simple and functional. Most importantly my order was received same day AND it had a Lightning to USB cable included. I couldn't be happier.
5,Incredible! I've never bought any refurbished items in fear that they wouldn't be as good as a new one but like other reviewers say it works and feels good as new. Thank you for providing quality products!
5,Perfectly new condition works great.
5,It works fine. I trashed the old one with a bottle of beer. This time I got a silicone cover for it you wouldn't even notice was there.7-8 bucks well spent to keep my key board alive.Chris
4,Exactly as described no issues only a personal regret since the keyboard is not backlit. Should have bought the Logitech k811
5,Refurbished keyboard that looks like a new product and works perfectly.
1,I tried to like the Magic Keyboard 2. I really did. It's small thin lightweight and frees up a USB port. Plus it's rechargeable. But everything about using the Magic Keyboard 2 is a compromise. There is no numeric keypad for starters and no Page Up Page Down Home End or Delete keys. So I couldn't use the calculator in the notification center without great effort and I had to remap many of the common functions of InDesign to the tiny arrow keys. But the arrow keys are a useless jumble of form over function and I kept missing the up arrow. Another problem was the FN (Function) key to the left of the Control key which I use all the time and kept hitting the useless FN key by mistake. Overall the keys felt closer together and I made a lot more typing mistakes than I used to. I went back to my extended keyboard though even the original battery powered Magic Keyboard has better arrow keys than this one does.
5,So far this keyboard has worked perfectly. I cannot even tell it was refurbished at all. Took a long time to actually ship and arrive but I am not docking a star on that because the product itself is exceptional
5,I love the Magic Keyboard.  You can't even tell it wasn't brand new.  Its battery is great and it pairs with all my apple gadgets.
4,it came without charging cable.so i had to buy a usb c to lightning cable.
4,Good renewed product. But battery discharges too quickly for 5 stars.
2,This was almost perfect until I saw the damaged "c" key on the keyboard. Everything else looks fine. But for the item description "There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm‚Äôs length" this is incorrect because it was the first thing I saw while opening the box for the keyboard.
5,Works like new. A few minor scratches at the bottom but it doesn't take away from the quality of keyboard. Battery life is incredible as well. So far so good. Well worth the purchase.
4,Works like new. Came with the lightning bolt cable. (Cable is not made by Apple)
1,El teclado no me sirve porque contrario a su anuncio NO ES EN ESPA√ëOL
1,I will update this post tomorrow morning depending on how the evening goes... But received the keyboard in an envelope... which made me worried for how the keyboard was treated on its way to me because it wasn't in any type of packaging to protect it for the rough handling of being shipped. It also did not come with its original charging cord but with an Amazon Prime 4" cord. Already... super suspicious. I have hooked up the keyboard to my computer and it seems to work fine so far. However when I went to setup the Bluetooth on this... The keyboard is under a name "colette obrien"... I sincerely hope this keyboard wasn't stolen from someone. Right now the keyboard is at 0% charged even though its been plugged in to my laptop charging for about 15 minutes. Like I said... I'll update this to a positive review depending on if this keyboard holds a charge.
5,Came just like brand new! (just no fancy apple box). Very clean and functional! Also came with a 70% battery charge. This is basically a brand new product and I am very very pleased.
5,This is a really neat device. Not an Apple product that works just as well. Without the price of an apple. Durango long lasting battery I am happy
5,I love the keyboard came in a regular package (not original Apple) however it feels brand new and has no marks whatsoever. Certainly recommended to save some money over new one.
3,The keyboard itself is great however the battery which is advertised to last about a month lasts about 5 days tops. I charged this fully on Thursday and as I type this the battery is sitting at 49% 2 days later. Seems odd for a certified refurbished product
4,Shipping was very quick but there were more scratches than I had expected.
5,Excelenete el teclado ya llevo un mes con el y funciona perfectamente. Aunque es Remanufacturado la verdad no se nota. Esta en perfectas. Condiciones. Apariencia de Nuevo y funcionamiento como nuevo.
5,This works great. Responsive and never gives me any issues connecting to it like other bluetooth devices I've used. Also it holds a charge for a long time. Love this product
4,I don't like that it is so flat I have to use a binder to elevate it.
5,If you need a wireless Apple key board this is the one to get.
5,Just as good as apple brand. My oem one crapped the bed. Very happy
5,What can I say. It's an apple keyboard so you know it is good. I have had no issues and single charge lasts a long time. Couldn't be happier.
5,This is a genuine apple magic keyboard. It looked perfect when it came. It comes with an amazon charging cable that's a little too short but it works regardless. Will buy from again.
5,Delivered in one day as promised. I was skeptical about buying refurbished but the keyboard is working flawlessly and I'm glad to save a little. Immediately paired with my Mac mini.
5,I was a little nervous about purchasing a refurbished Apple item on Amazon but the Amazon guarantee sold me on it. This keyboard works perfectly! I love it so much! I just can't believe I went this long without it!
4,works with mac os seamlessly. would be better if they include a numeric keyboard.
5,I can't even tell it was refurbished amazing keyboard for the price. The arrow keys are a little smaller than my previous keyboard but I'm happy with this change. Biggest plus is the wireless which works flawlessly.
3,Charging is handy and battery life is great. Keyboard feels much worse than the previous battery powered version. That keyboard felt incredibly nice for a non mechanical keyboard but this has much less spring in the keys. Still worth it in my opinion because of the Lightning charger.
5,Super easy to use and the battery lasts for what seems like an eternity. It‚Äôs so lightweight that it seems easily breakable but this is surprisingly strong.
4,Same as new i have used Now probs...
3,After only two days of normal use the battery goes dead.  I have to hard wire it on a regular basis
5,This looks brand new and works like it too. I‚Äôve had it for a couple of months and it is still running perfectly. It was a wonderful value
5,I use this easy to use high quality key board on my iPad Pro 129 it is a perfect fit.  I plan to use it later on the Samsung S9 and Dex pad.
4,It's great. Just wonder why they don't make it wireless
5,Epic i bought this like three weeks ago and the battery is at 52% with the first charge i use this every week day for like 8 to 10 hours
5,Bought refurbished works great except for a small ding at the top portion and the down arrow is a bit less responsive
5,I‚Äôm so happy with the keyboard it‚Äôs brand new with no signs of use at all the only difference is the packing box and it came with amazon lightning cable. Recommended!
1,Half they keys didn‚Äôt work and the rest would spam numbers and letters into whatever I was trying to write.Could give zero stars if I could.
3,It isn‚Äôt have the right height. I had to put a pencil underneath ( on the top) so it has decent height to type. I return it. Caus eit seem very lights not good for typing
5,Justo
4,Seems to be working just fine. No marks. Looks new. Fast shipping. Came with power cord.
4,Pretty clean but little scratch
4,The product was great. As expected. But the cord was aftermarket. Not original Apple.
5,I got in the mail today. Looks brand new! Mine didn't come with a charge so make sure you plug right into your device for pairing
5,I use this keyboard every day and it works great. It's sleek lightweight portable and pairs effortlessly with my Macbook. I especially like that it recharges via USB.
5,Great value for the money original refurbished. A little scratches but functions well
5,Love how it‚Äôs rechargeable. Lost the old one I had. And really happy I did.
5,been using it for a few hours now can't tell its refubrished.The keyboard is by far the best one out there but thats apples review ;)
3,I have purchased an Apple MLA22LL/A Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 but I have noticed the back of keyboard(picture attached) is very different from the ones I have seen both in the store and on the internet.
5,Works so far reviews say they crap out but I got a 4 year protection plan so if it does I'm sending it right back
5,Fantastic service from start to finish. The keyboard way in excellent condition. They also inlcluded a new lightning cord for charging. The keyboard works flawlessly.
5,I use this 3-4 hours every day and it is better than the one that come with the computer originally.
5,Paired up right away. Came on time. Works great. It is not a full size keyboard so make sure you are ok with the size.
5,Love it!  It's perfect... looks new.  Connected immediately to my MacBook Pro.  Just what I wanted... without the steep price.  Thanks!
5,For a refurbished item I have no complaints. Glad to see they included the lightning cable.
5,Good looking light soft keys and a great battery.  Well worth the money.
5,Great deal and great keyboard. I wish it had a backlight but apple would have to charge an addition $109 dollars for that feature.
1,It worked for about half of the functions my original keyboard performed.  It was not worth having to stop what I was working to go to settings to turn on sound for a zoom meeting.  Reconfigure volume settings and brightness of the screen.  I felt as though it was taking twice as much energy output to complete the simplest tasks.
5,Totally exceeded my expectations. I bought a refurbished one and you really cannot tell that it isn‚Äôt brand new. Works great!
5,An Apple product for half the price? Why buy anything else? If you need keyboard upgrade this is the way to go.
5,Excellent product furnished good
5,I bought refurbished key board and I received it an excellent condition and it works as good as new.
5,Enjoying it
5,Overall great product that does exactly what it says it will
5,Used this throughout my college career with an iPad. I tried other keyboards but they were not nearly as smooth as this one.
4,Looks new & Works well
4,works great but was expecting the lightning cable to be included it was not.
5,Not flimsy as some of the knock-offs. Just buy the real deal. It is wort it.
5,Beautiful keyboard works flawlessly with my Mac. Super thin with USB charging. Great experience
5,Was expecting to get a wore down keyboard for the price I paid. Keyboard is in excellent condition and works amazing. Far exceeds my expectations for price
5,Works like a charm. I had a battery powered keyboard. This one has to be charged. It came with a charger. Thank you.
5,Keyboard looks brand new. works perfectly pared with my Mac mini with no problems. Also came with apple charger as promised. Why pay full price???
5,It's pretty nice even if it's refurbished
5,This keyboard is really well-refurbished. It looks like new and works with my MBP with no problem. Every key feels like it supposed to. No scratch no defect. Worth the money.
5,Awesome! Use it with our iPad and it connects seamlessly. Holds a charge well and would definitely recommend.
5,Looks like brand new feels like brand new received it with 57% battery. After 2 days using it no problem at all.
3,The keyboard itself is in great condition and seems to function well but the Lightning cable was NOT included in my shipment (2/28/2017).I would have thought twice about this purchase had I known this...
5,Look Like it was brought back no blemishes half the price
5,Works like a charm. Feels like a brand new and also includes charger cable which is very nice. Would never say that it is refurbished.
5,My wife loves her keyboard.
3,The keyboard is nice and clean works fine and no sign of ware.However the charging cable is not working had to use my own lighting cable.
5,Ultimate  wireless keyboard.  Just a little pricey.
5,The best keyboard. I am really happy with this product now. I will let  you know how it holds up in a few months.
3,The keyboard is not bad however you also have to buy the cables to make it work they did not come with this model
5,This is my favorite keyboard.  Feels great perfect size and good key travel. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a good keyboard
5,Works great. I bought a refurbished one and it works like new
5,Awesome keyboard. Just like new. Works amazing out of the box. Couldn't be happier. Really long battery life. Using it with a MacBook Air.
5,decided to try a refurbished‚Äã one this time around and so far so good no problems works fine
5,Arrived with zero signs of use. Although I prefer the discontinued wired Apple keyboard this keyboard is Apple's usual high quality.
4,Works well as advertised.  I dig it.
5,Keyboard worked as promised shipping fast  thanks
5,Product was exactly as advertised and works perfectly.
3,I prefer the Magic Keyboard 1 that takes AA batteries. This one you have to charge frequently. It's much easier to pop in some batteries.
4,Works perfectly
5,I received my keyboard and it connected  to my MacBook with ease! It is working perfectly!! Thank you.
5,Good quality
3,Perfectly fine keyboard but at times it is uncomfortably small.

5,I had the keyboard and the lightning. Works as it should and looks like new. I'm very happy for saving some money on this great keyboard.
5,I bought a Refurbished product but it is just like a new one.
5,This keyboard works great and in combination with wireless mouse and portable laptop stand makes for a much more comfortable and ergonomic work experience.
5,This is a great keyboard for your mac.
5,This batteryless keyboard makes me want to swap out my older Apple keyboards- it's a little smaller and flatter.
5,So far so good. Looks brand new. I've only had the keyboard a few days but works perfectly.
3,Keyboard started to fail after 3 months
2,I got this keyboard and the actual letter keys worked but everything else did not. When I hit my volume button it would open a new tab and all of my other keys did things like that. However I called the company and they were very nice and got back to me with easy instructions on how to return it and I got my money back very soon.
5,Item shipped quickly is as new great price great service!  Thank you!
5,Item as expected. It works and looks almost like a new Apple‚Äã product.I would recommend this seller.
1,Una estafa!!! Lo utilic√© para tirarlo a la basura.

5,Great keyboard extremely easy to connect battery stays charged for weeks even with daily use... best keyboard ever!
5,Great keyboard! Like the built-in battery. No need to change batteries anymore.
3,Caps lock key takes quite a hit do work...not a deal breaker for me just kind of annoying.
5,good
5,Just like brand new. Love it.
1,It arrived missing keys so not really ‚Äòrenewed‚Äô. Or if this is renewed what‚Äôs old?
5,Worked great - just as good as the original.  Lesson learned - no liquids near keyboard
5,This keyboard arrived in perfect condition. Looks great and works great!
5,Clean and works like new!
5,Great deal as for todays prices
5,Was nervous about buying refurbished but so far everything has been great!
5,So far so good.
5,Looks and works like new. It always feels good to save a bit without compromising the quality
3,For a price like this it should come with a back light. Battery lasts forever though.
5,Bought as refurbished. Looks brand new and works perfect. Can‚Äôt ask for more.
5,Small & compact. Worked 'out of the box.' Battery life not a problem.
5,Love it.  It works perfectly.  Unfortunately it is not backlit.

5,I use this for my iPad Pro. Much better than the other keyboards IMHO.
5,Works great looks great.
5,Works as advertised

5,Love it good quality Excelent
5,Just as good as new! But cheaper. So far so good.
5,Great keyboard
5,Great purchase came out the box brand new
1,The keyboard function wise was great. My issue is really with the seller. They advertised the keyboard as ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù and it was scratched and had chips in the aluminum casing. Not to mention the keyboard had filth on ALL the keys from the previous owner(s) fingers and long brown female hair trapped under several keys. I did buy the keyboard brand new from Best Buy. The keyboard is great and has great battery life.
5,Arrived as expected and performs as expected!
3,Keys are flimsy feeling.
1,First I ordered the first ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù keyboard and the ‚Äúr‚Äù key stuck. Got product support and they had to send me a new one. The next one they sent is disgusting‚Äîtotally sticky.
1,Looks beautiful but only works plugged in. The battery never worked on device. I should have known better buying a refurb but I thought it would have new components or be tested. When I contacted for a replacement I was told it was passed the warranty deadline even though it's within a year. The listing makes no clear explanation of what the warranty time is. I will gladly revise this if the situation changes.
1,I gave it to Goodwill. It also sucked because it was flat not tilted up. Not what I wanted. Not what I ordered. Not what I paid for.
2,I understand that the definition of a refurbish product repairs the defective product. and I believe that it includes replacing a defect such as scratch. There are too many scratches on this keyboard. It's just second hand. i am so disppointed.
5,So far it works without any problem nice product.
5,Looks and works like a new keyboard.
5,like brand new
1,I return it because was fake Or used
5,I like that this keyboard is rechargeable.
5,Very high quality product that performs as described. Would highly recommend.
5,As expected. Glad I purchased here and saved
5,Great keyboard! like new! shipping was fast! Thank You!
5,Item in excellent shape.  It works like new.
5,Works great no compliant.
5,Great quality no issues
5,Minimalist packaging but product every bit as good as original new from factory magic keyboard.
5,Very easy to use the keys only need a light touch.
5,Arrived with in 24 hours with the cable. Works perfectly.
5,Even refurbished it's perfect. I recommend this item!
5,Looks new and it works perfectly!
5,GREAT product fast shipping great price!  thanks for a great overall deal!
5,I‚Äôm really happy w it.
3,Did not come with lightening charging cable as promised
5,Very good unit despite refurbished. Thumbs up.
1,Received a bent keyboard and the lightning cable it came with is also scuffed up. It works but this is below the quality of what most places would deem as "like new." and charge for this price.  Returning and will be looking for a different vendor. Would not recommend this seller.
5,Excellent! One of the best thing‚Äôs to buy!
5,Definitely worth the purchase. Easily connected and no more AA‚Äôs!
5,Works great looks great good as new.
1,Works but this thing is more like a toy and not a real keyboard for professional use. It's difficult to use cuz it's ultra-flat and downright impossible to use in dark rooms cuz it's completely unlit. I bought the Logitech K811 lit keyboard instead and it's MUCH better with more weight better multi-use function keys and a more positive typing action (feel). If you don't need a lit keyboard like I do the Logitech unlit keyboards are still better than this toy.
5,Awesome works great.
3,Didn't come with charging cable.
3,Affordable. No backlight
5,Appears to be in new condition. A cable DID come with mine.
5,it"s Mac I love it
5,Everything looks good so far!
5,It is well packed and very clean
5,Its what I wanted and received it quickly
5,Fast delivery item as described.
5,Best keyboard ever!
5,Works looks and performs great. Good value.
5,The keyboard works perfectly.
5,Great Product! Shipped in 1 day with Prime!
5,I‚Äôm a fan of the new butterfly mechanism.
1,Dec√≠a Espanol y el teclado estaba en ingl√©s. Perd√≠ el tiempo y me toc√≥ regresar el producto.
1,This keyboard does a great job until it categorically stops holding a charge (for me about 6  months). I continued to use it plugged in but with Apple's decline in external ports USB inputs are at a premium. When it did work it was temperamental when connecting to the 2017 MacBook Pro.
5,Works great
1,I had ordered a refurbished keyboard before and it was great.  However with this one the J key did not work so they clearly do not test or 'refurbish' these.  I also could not believe how scratched the back was and there were small dents all over.  Really horrible product and I'd like a replacement or refund.
5,Works great
5,Genuine Apple Product. Love it!
5,Great product!
5,Perfect for my MAC
5,Thanks
5,Works great.
5,great key board
5,Works great.
1,Would not connect to my computer. The item stated it would have a lightening connector cord but it did not this is the older version. One of the letters did not work. Also not easy to return. I left a message for them as instructed and did not get a call back. Total disappointment.
5,so far is good I am writing with it!
5,Looked brand new
5,very nice... coz apple made it...!
5,Pretty satisfying to type on
5,No cable but works just fine so far. Thanks!
1,Such a shame "refurbished" product. It doesn't Hold any charge. Does not work without unplugging it. I bought it in a visit to the US and now there ir no way to return it even though I live in Spain where Amazon also operates
5,it works perfectly :)
5,Fabulous thank for speedy delivery and accuracy of item!
5,Frees up a USB port.
5,Very nice keyword.
5,works well
5,Great!
5,FAIR PRICE; KEYBOARD WORKS FINE.
5,Great product!
5,works great just like my notebook keyboard
5,Love it!
1,Always beware of refurbish stuff.  Keyboard looked great but had issues with a lot of the keys not registering properly as well as bad connection.  Got a new one works great
5,Very good keyboard.
5,Great keyboard.
1,The keyboard looks well but some key does not work when you press delete the volume get up and the kye "Q" does not work.I asked a replaced I hope have luky with the new oneRegardsMariano
5,Outstanding Apple quality.....zero signs of use.
5,Works well
1,I recently purchased this keyboard and I‚Äôm returning it. Is very flat. I wasn‚Äôt able to connect it with my computer and it only worked if it wa connected to USB- to the computer not even to wall to charge it. I‚Äôm just going to return it and buy APPLE one!!
5,working great!
5,It is a good Keyboad
2,Had issues syncing it with desktop which was odd had to return. Eventually got new apple with wireless which works fine.
1,item came defective. did not even turn on despite the cosmetic flaws. absolutely unacceptable to charge almost $90 for a broken item.
5,Works as described.
5,Perfect. No issues at all.
5,so  good
1,Placed in service on June 4 2018. Return Window closed July 4th. Now less than 3 months later keyboard discharges completely after 24 hours. Must remain plugged into USB with lightening cable to be useable. I'll by new next time. Learned my lesson wasted $70.
2,Keyboard is not in the original box. :///
5,Item came in mint condition works flawlessly.
5,Working as it should! :)
1,I had to return this. Did not hold a charge after charging for 24hrs. Only worked while plugged into the computer via lightning cable. As soon as unplugged it would go dead. Also it didn't come with a charging cable although the description says "The product ships with relevant accessories."
5,Works perfectly!
5,works fantastic
2,Arrived ok doesn't hold a charge to save your life though always dying
5,Top
1,Mine sucked. I had to return it because keys didnt work. But it was "Amazon Certified Refurbished" which makes me think that Azon runs a diagnostic to make sure that the keyboard will function for the 90 days that Amazon certifies it.
2,Product looks great; however there was no Lightning cable included even when the product description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included.
5,excelente
1,the removal of the inverted T arrow cluster is a terrible pointless anti-usability design decision. keyboard was unusable to me (lots of paging up and down in file lists and text editors) ...traded it away for the older model.
1,Not sure what happened but I got the wrong product.. I ordered an Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 and got Version 1It was scratched and the buttons didn't work.I returned it.
1,The product lasted less than 1 year. It will no longer hold a bluetooth connection. Don't waste your money buying from a 3rd party seller - just go straight to Apple.
5,Magically Apple!
5,Perfect!
1,I received the wrong item. I supposed buy apple magic keyboard 2. But I received is the first generation. It is a wrong item. There is no lightning port in this keyboard.
1,Bought this product two different times. The first time the product wasn't capable of holding a charge thus wasn't "wireless". The next time I had the exact same issue and wasn't even provided a charging cable.
1,Scratches and nasty gunk inside a couple of the keys. I‚Äôm just going to return it and pay the extra $30 for a new magic keyboard.
1,Stopped holding a charge after just one or two charges and minimal use. Was past the return window so I‚Äôm stuck with a $55 ‚Äúseller refurbished‚Äù paper weight.
1,This "refurbished" keyboard doesn't hold a charge and I have to keep it plugged in all the time.  When unplugged it holds a charge for maybe a few minutes and then stops working.
1,Said it was suppose to come with everything needed and there is no USB to charge it! I bought this to give as a gift and now there is no cord to charge it :(
1," The product ships with all relevant accessories" Nope Lightning to USB Cable was not included The cable costs $19.00 which brings the keyboard to the same cost as new. Why buy refurbished ?
1,Entire top row of keys do not work
1,It's not like new!!! It's not even close. Terrible condition for 64$.
1,The keyboard is not in Spanish
1,This device did not hold a charge at all. I will be returning this. I like the device though.
1,My keyboard did not came with a cable It was needed to buy one separated to charge it.
1,After a year it suddenly stopped working I loved this Keyboard but something was not right inside it.
1,I didn't know this was refurbished. First time using the keyboard and an up arrow key has fallen off.
1,Won‚Äôt hold a charge and has stopped working after only three months. Piece of junk!
1,The item looked great but does not charge even I have tried with different charging cables in different outlets.  Item returned.
1,I am very disappointed. the publication said keyboard and magic mouse and it is only the keyboard.
1,Purchase this for a December birthday Return date November 23. Opened to find the the power button does not work .
1,Not refurbished just used junk
1,It looked like new but it was on only if it‚Äôs connected to power. Returned.
1,Didn't work--2nd one in a row (different seller).  Gave up.
1,spent hours trying to set it up and its defectivte sure didnt check out them out very good
1,It's not even charging and won't connecting to my macbook
1,Keyboard died after one month of light use.Buyer beware.
1,There is almost NO responsiveness to this keyboard. Apple really dropped the ball on this and the trackpad. So disappointed.
1,The keyboard has blank keys (no arrow and function signs).
1,only worked for a few months and stopped working.  Wont charge
1,Does not work right side of the board won‚Äôt. Key
1,The product came without any cable to charge.
1,Some keys stoped working after 2 hours
1,This worked for two months. Waste.
1,This really wasn't worth the money ‚Äì reduced tactile feedback and critical lack of usability make this keyboard no more than a thorn in the side. Apple has never succeeded in making usable keyboards or mouses and this one cannot compare with other keyboard brands.
5,Love this keyboard. Works perfectly even though refurb.
5,I've been using the Gen 1 magic keyboard and just bought this.Amazing product. The typing feedback is really good. This came in a brand new condition with the lightning cable and without the box.At almost half the price this is a must buy.I'm super happy.
3,dirty keys scratched back
5,What a great keyboard
1,These keyboards aren't even refurbished!!  Amazon claims their refurbished products are inspected and tested to work like new and will replace any defective components but my keyboard arrived with a stuck key.  A quick visual inspection would reveal the stuck key.  They didn't even reset the freaking name it's still under "System Administrator's Keyboard".  It also arrived with a dead battery.  I should've listened to the other person complaining about glitter on their keyboard lol. I would not recommend purchasing this or any Amazon refurbished product since there testing and inspection procedures are probably held to the same standard.
2,Given as Christmas gift. Works intermittantly. As a result frustrating better if it outright did not work.
5,I wanted a wireless keyboard for my iMac  for long time. This is perfect for me. It looks just like brand new no scratches. Only not in a Apple box a generic cable. I had it for two weeks now the battery life is good. I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Works real well but I should have bought the one with the numeric keyboard.My mistake but for what it is this is an excellent product
5,I was worried about buy a used keyboard but 6 months later and it is still working perfect.
5,ExcellentGreat sizeEasy to use
5,Smooth and clean came in renewed condition boots right up
5,great
2,No es lo que se vende. Cuidado con los que necesitan teclado en espa√±ol.
5,Couldn't be happier there's no signs of wear or anything. Usually with refurbished goods you can find something but this is impeccable! Charged it up and flipped the switch and it paired right up to my MacBook!
5,I love this keyboard. It hooks up to my MacBook and even has brightness and volume adjusting and keys. That‚Äôs great because now I don‚Äôt have to reach up to my computer‚Äôs keyboard to adjust those things. No delete button tough only backspace.
5,Works like it was brand new great product.
5,Excellent renewed keyboard just like new. Have been using it for a couple of months now. Have not even had to charge it yet. So needless to say very happy with this purchase.
3,The keyboard is not refurbished but USED. It has a lot of scratches on the back like if it has been used sometime. It works good so far but I just received it 1 hour ago so I will update my comment if I find any issue. Also it is not in SPANISH but in ENGLISH.
5,Even came fully charged and everything. Kicks ass with my iPad mini.
5,It came on time and it met all my expectations
5,La calidad del producto era incre√≠ble venia muy bien cuidado
5,I bought my Apple Keyboard a few weeks ago and was a little skeptical given some of the reviews. I figured that if I got a bad keyboard I could simply send it back and then look elsewhere but this keyboard has been flawless.The keyboard came with no charge and I was able to charge it all the way in about 45 minutes. All of the keys work great and the battery life has only gone down 10% in 3 weeks.The look of the keyboard is sleek and the keys are short and easy to work with. When I got the keyboard there were a few sticky smudges on the bottom but I cleaned them off within a few minutes and I've had no other problems since. Great buy! Well worth the discounted price
5,I just got an iPad and realized the magic keyboard from Apple was a huge waste of money. It was almost $300 for no reason! I decided to get a Bluetooth keyboard off Amazon because it was so much cheaper. Because I had an iPad I knew buying Apple products would work best with it but again they are so expensive. This is a legit refurbished magic keyboard. it is literally a couple hundred dollars cheaper and works just as well as my brand new one. There were no scratches no dirt no anything! literally looks brand new and saved me a ton of money.
5,works great good value.
1,Publicidad enga√±osa:"Apple Magic Keyboard - Espa√±ol (Reacondicionado) Plateado"1-El teclado esta en Ingles lo decid√≠ comprar por que la ofertaban en Espa√±ol.Es cierto que la escritura se realiza sin ver el teclado sin embargo la tecla "Enter" es mas peque√±a que la version en espa√±ol.Algunas veces d√≠gite por error : √ß ( considero que terminare acostumbr√°ndome con los d√≠as)embargo lo adquir√≠ creyendo que era en Espa√±ol.2.Parece pr√°cticamente nuevo las teclas todas 100% limpias.Sin rayones.5 dias de uso con mas de 12 horas de trabajo diario : solo ha gastado el 7% de la bater√≠a.3- El cable de carga no es Original.recomiendo hacer un esfuerzo en suministrarlo de un color blanco.
5,Keyboard feels looks brand new the keys all function the battery has been working now for one week and is still above 50%.
5,Keyboard great price
5,I use it every day for video and photo editing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it it came with a charger it connected to my laptop no problem  and the Bluetooth work perfect
5,The keyboard connected to my Windows PC perfectly the first try and is synced well. No delay noted. Would recommend with the great price. Fast shipping too even though it is not Prime shipping.
3,Company didn‚Äôt take the time to send a product that was clean. Lazy and unprofessional. With all the attention to things being clean and disinfected they failed and sent me a visibly dirty key board.
1,"teclado en espa√±ol" En formato americano y no en espa√±ol.Todo rayado con algunas teclas √°speras y las de m√°s uso pulidas y marcadas. Como si fuese usado a√±os para luego revenderlo con sobre-uso.
5,El teclado me lleg√≥ en buen estado hasta ahora todo bien. Es la versi√≥n de USA sin √± pero es justo lo que quer√≠a porque as√≠ lo necesito. Lo recomiendo compr√© dos y ambos est√°n funcionando perfectamente.
4,Lo que no me agrado fue que la descripci√≥n del articulo dice "Teclado en espa√±ol" y en realidad esta en Ingles por todo lo dem√°s estoy muy conforme.
5,Extremely fast delivery - as per normal prime.  Keyboard came in a generic box but is in fantastic condition.  It fully works and frankly I can't tell that it was refurbished.  Makes me wonder why I ever bought a brand new keyboard.  Excellent experience and would definitely recommend both the product and seller.
5,Looks great feels great and it works as expected. It‚Äôs only a shame the UK layout was not available it‚Äôs much better than the US.
3,The caps lock light doesn't work so obviously not refurbished just flogged for cheap with a minor defect.
5,Received it quickly with no problems. The keyboard was in excellent condition and works well. Very satisfied and would recommend.
3,Keyboard works fine but the supplied cable does not work.
5,It‚Äôs as good as the original keyboard I received with my imac
5,Saved money and works like new. Very good condition.
5,Perfect - did exactly as required.
5,Excellent keyboard. As good as new.
5,Great keyboard supper light and responsive
5,Excellent value. Exactly as advertised.
5,Works perfectly with my MacBook
5,Perfect work well!
5,Great product
5,Very good
5,great keyboard
1,American keyboard so dollar rather than pound symbol. Annoying
5,Thx for this keyboard I love it.
