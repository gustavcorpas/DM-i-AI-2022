5,Product looks really very good but I drove from Las Vegas to Reno and I just went to retrieve the key box to use the spare key and the box is gone with my expensive key and fob inside. The only thing left is the to magnets on the back side of the bumper. I'm angry and disappointed. I was trying to save money by having the spare key but now I have to buy a key fob and another key box.
5,Don’t want to be locked out so I purchased this to stash a key on my old Tacoma.  Perfect ‘pelican’ case to protect and secure to a hidden metal point.  I’m not exaggerating when I say it looks “over engineered” and worth every penny.  Seller ships quickly and provides exactly what is promised.
5,Seems good so far. The magnet is amazingly strong!!
5,This is extremely durable exceptional quality.  I would absolutely recommend
5,STILL GOIN STRONG
5,Strong magnets and solid water resistant box.
5,This thing has some very strong magnets. It fits the valet key for my 2010 4Runner and seems to work quite well.
5,Heavy duty strong magnets
5,If you are looking for a key holder with a strong grip - this is your item. Extremely strong magnets!  Also a strong sturdy case.
5,This fits a key fob with no problem. The magnets are no freaking joke either. The box is rock solid. Highly recomended.
4,Great vault for keys you can also apply a security wire in case the magnets fail for what ever Reasons.
5,It's a little pricey but it's sturdily built the hasp tightly latches and the "loop" pins on both sides worked perfectly to add a strip of 1 inch wide x 1 foot long velcro strap to add a bit more security to the mounting location.The 2 x foam inserts are thin but fine. I added some folded duct tape to bulk up the padding.Overall a great product. Would buy again.
5,I scuba off shore and use this box to hide my key.  Works great
5,I got this for an elderly friend that needed to have keys available in case the ambulance was called - again (911 but had to wait 20 minutes for someone to get there with keys to get to her). That won’t happen again! She removed the foam from inside the box and 3 keys fit easily. She said that it would probably hold 5. She tried it on her refrigerator and almost couldn’t get it off. The magnets are super strong so now she’s comfortable with it outside. I had read lots of reviews before selecting this one. Great product and value for the money. And it sure beats having 911 break down a door or worse being found dead.
5,I just drove 3300 miles with this hide a key attached to the undercarriage of my car. All good. I never want to be locked out. Good security.
5,Works great. Strong magnet keeps it in place for multiple days at a time. Would definitely buy again.
5,This is very strong you have to put in some muscle to get it off
5,So far this item has continued to work as described.
4,The box itself looks decently study enough but the foam inserts are kind of trash. Replacing with thicker foam and it should be perfect.
5,My daughter needs to use a hide a key several times a year. She lost the last one we had that was a standard hide a key that I had added magnets to. I saw this thought I would give it a try. I like most things this company puts there name on this key holder is no exception. Its been on the side of her frame behind the rear tire since purchase and hasn't moved.
5,It was easy to conceal and it has stayed for 3 weeks now. Impressive
5,This is the second magnetic Box I purchased first one for my wife’s car and this one for mine. At first I was Suspicious about it falling while driving. But after several months of regular driving tests the magnetic box was still in same exact place. It is small enough to place it in a very convenient location and the magnets are sturdy enough to attach very well to any metal surface.
5,Pros:  As stated in "headline" unit is heavy-duty hard plastic secures very well to car and is waterproof.I lost my old "slide open" version with the weaker magnet going over rough terrain so wanted to try this.  I have a Honda Civic and put it on the wheel well instead of beneath the car door like I used to.  When I just checked it it was filthy/mud encrusted on the outside but the inside was clean.Cons:  Bulky which is why I chose to attach to the wheel well - you could easily see the unit when looking at the side of my car.Also it is kinda hard to open but I guess that's part of keeping things water/mud proof!I bought a separate one for my husband's Toyota Avalon and it hides just fine under the door.
5,Much more durable than the standard black hide a key box. Very strong magnets.
5,Seals watertight.  Strong magnets.  I check it during winter months due to possible snow/ice buildup.  If you take your truck to get serviced make sure you check to see if the lock box is still in the correct spot.  The mechanic pulled it off to look at it and did not put it back in same spot.  I would have had to get on the ground to access it. Also good to check to make sure it is still there.
5,This sucker is sturdy.Air/water right. Super strongLittle box the latch is extremely secure  also has these lanyard slot I use them toEnsure my box won’t open when it’s jammed full of my “legal”’contraband
5,Great box!  Super magnets!!I purchased three boxes (this and two MiniMags - The “2” and the Plus Extra Large) and tested for adhesion and water entry.  All had 2 great magnets but the clear winner is this Gorilla Box. Then I placed all three boxes in a deep sauté pan and filled pan with water over the top of the boxes and left them for two days.  The magnets held them under - all three were actually tough to get off the bottom of the pan. Opened the boxes and the Gorilla was completely dry. Check photo.  The two MiniMag’s had a thimble each of water.This was not a scientific test but...  I’m buying the Gorilla’s for my project.  I have no idea how either brand will perform at 70mph in driving rain but... again.  Anyway these were all nice boxes - sturdy as hell and the magnets on all three impressed.The Gorilla is roughly the same size and price as the MiniMag 2 - if you toss out the foam both should fit two sets of keys (2ea - key and separate fob).  Certainly would fit a couple of key/fob combos and a large Tile (BT locator).  If more space is needed you need the Plus Extra Large for $40ish.  However there is nothing “jumbo” or “extra large” about it - it won’t fit a cell phone. A flip phone sure but I’m a bit hard pressed to come up with a main stream application that the $20 guys can’t handle.Good luck.
5,I needed something for my extra key fob for my truck in case I lose my primary one while hiking and camping in the mountains. If you buy this for your key fob make sure the gorilla box is mounted far enough toward the back of the vehicle or the fob will be recognized and anyone can start your vehicle by just pushing the vehicles start button.
4,It’s a plastic box that locks tight with a couple of magnets on the back. It’s simple and it works as intended.
5,Powerful magnet very hard to pull off excellent for hiding key on my Semi truck not worried about losing this box
5,after having cheap key holders fall off my truck or rust apart i decided to buy a better product.  these things are built out of thick plastic and seal with a gasket.  the hinge and latch are rock solid.  the magnets are huge and very strong...I am condident this key holder will never fall off or corrode. well worth the difference in price versus the cheap ones.
3,I’m surprised at how incredibly strong the magnets are.  Tested on the fridge and it was all I could do to get them off.  Using it under my vehicle will update in a week.Update:I can not use this for my vehicle key as it’s too small.  I have a ford transit Nissan Titan Toyota Camry all of which are too big for this box.
4,I'd like to thank those than answered my question about whether the case would be difficult to open if covered in mud etc.  I purchased and it's a sturdy latch.  A note for old people like me... warning!  Serious magnets!.  I put it inside my rear bumper and figured out in short order that I couldn't remove it because the magnets were so strong. Had to get help from my neighbor. Then placed it in a different area of the bumper where I could "slide" it a bit to loosen it for removal.  Still isn't easy but at least possible. Hoping that if I need the key I'll be able to get it off to *get* the key.
5,Exactly as described
5,Works great powerful magnates waterproof.
5,The magnets are very strong but because you can use zip ties to tie it on to a structural part of the truck there's no way it will ever get disloged. Exactly what I needed.
5,Hide anything that will fit in the box. Works great for key fob. Take out battery first then hide it somewhere on your vehicle.
4,In ten years from now I'll know it it will last.
5,I have used some junky hide-a-keys. They always fall off. Not this one. It's here to stay.
5,it’s everything I hoped it would be for securing a second key.
5,This has a nice seal on the lid and two very strong magnets on the back. I like it and think it will be there for years to come.
3,I have a 2014 Chrysler 200. The box is not long enough to fit my key. While it does seem like a very sturdy and durable box make sure you measure your key first before ordering this!
5,Strong and perfect to hide in our Ford trucks!
5,This case is a good box to hide a key underneath my K1500. Bought two for both my trucks.
4,This thing is strong. I put it on my frame of my truck above a bracket and its not going anywhere. It is a lot wider then I initially thought which is a good thing. I can fit my 3 spare keys in it (all flat of course) I need one for each of my vehicles. This is a must have! I will update with a durability rating after winter.
5,This item performs exactly as described. I use it to secure a key in a location not easily accessible and it performs perfectly .
5,But it now
5,A nice heavy duty plastic case with 2 strong magnets. It's been on for a few weeks nowso far so good. Magnets seem pretty strong.
4,Secure box
4,The magnets  had cracked apart. Parts of the magnets were still adhered under my car.  I lost it and it had gotten run over by another car. Took an hour to find. I guess there might be some value since it stayed intact and protected a GPS meter??However the fact that the magnets didn't hold up means losing this altogether on a highway means it is useless!!!!
5,I have always been looking for something like this.  Now I’ll never have to worry about loosing my keys!
5,Its a very good product. Well worth it
5,Great for car
5,Good quality. However much small than it appears
5,Good product
5,So far the magnets are holding up to all types of weather.
4,Dismiss any negative comments written about this product it works. The box is built like a tank and has a rubber gasket to keep water out in theory. Most important it has 2 point you can tie it off to a safety leash just in case. The magnets are insanely strong when applied to the correct surface and required me to "pry" it off as It would not simply pull off.  Buy it.
5,At first my wife didn't have the hand strength to get it open but she could after I worked with her on her technique. Twist your fingertips under the latch if that makes sense. Just a suggestion if your key is a transponder key you can have a non transponder key made cheaply that will get you in the door if you lock your keys inside. Plus if someone does find it they can't drive away.LOLOL Don't do like my wife did and place it next to your exhaust pipe. That's the photo.
5,We bought 2 of these one for each of our vehicles to store extra cat keys. They are clearly very sturdy water tight (so no need to worry about damaging expensive key fobs) and the magnets (used to attach the boxes underneath the car) are very strong.  You never know when you’ll need an extra hidden key and that can be a huge factor.  After buying 2 for our trucks I bought two more as a gift for some friends.  We live in Wyoming and are often on unpaved roads using 4x4 - the boxes have remained intact and we are confident knowing we will never suffer the inconvenience of being locked out of our vehicles while being on the road.
5,Awesome  lil case heavy  built
5,Great key fob holder for underneath the car.  Large enough size for the fob.
4,Greta product but it could be a tad larger. Had to trim one of my extra keys down for it to fit in the box.
5,Just as described shipped/arrived fast.
5,Perfect Toyota Tundra key fits in it. The magnets are very strong as well as the latch. You can use zip ties if need be but I was afraid I wouldn’t have a knife or scissors on me if I got locked out of my vehicle. I had one of those rectangular key holders but with this truck there wasn’t a secure place and the magnets were getting rusty.  This gorilla box takes some effort to pull off the truck underside and more effort to open it so I’m very happy with it. I’ll update if I have any issues.
5,I wanted a way to keep an extra set of keys for our travel trailer that would be water tight secure and could be placed where it wouldn't open up or fall off.  I  checked out several options and read a lot of reviews.  Most of the magnetic key holders didn't impress nor did the ones with a keypad.  Found this and decided to give it a try.  It's large enough to hold all of our keys (7) is very sturdy the lid closes very securely and the magnets are extremely powerful.  I have no doubt it will stay in place and be weather resistant.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Highly recommend.
5,Great product! IMPORTANT: regularly check your magnets on the bottom of the box for tightness.  Vibrations from living under your vehicle will inevitably cause the screws holding theMagnets to the box to back out (loosen).  If you fail to do this you WILL LOSE THECONTENTS AND YOUR BOX…you can use epoxy (ie. JB weld) to make a more secure bond between the box and magnets.
4,It looks like a port to an electrical box very subtle for hiding the key to your door. A little pricey compared to the other models I looked at but this one seemed the easiest to hide by my home
5,I have mine “hidden” under my vehicle & it has stayed in place perfectly even through a weekly car wash and heavy storms it’s never fallen off.This was highly recommended by my locksmith who rescued me once when I locked myself out of my Jeep. I’m super glad I purchased this so I never have to worry about being locked out again!
2,Bought for spare key of Toyota Camry and key wouldn’t fit in box so be careful using this if you have an older or longer key or key fob!
5,Yeah this is a Great Size and is Durable AF.With a Great Precise snap closure rubber gasket like seal around the inner perimeter in order to deter & prevent water or any other type of liquid to seep in. And also the dull grey color could be utilized to better conceal if & when put near other objects of that sort of shade such as you most likely would find underneath the the hood of or underneath a car itself.
4,Sturdy lil thing strong magnets it snapped on my bumper it's just smaller than I expected
5,This little thing really surprised me with the build quality. I was worried about stashing a key under my car but this thing squashed those worries. It's super thick and sturdy it's pretty difficult to open (a good thing for a stash box) and it has spots for straps to further tie it down to the frame of your car (not that you'll need them this magnet is SUPER strong).I put the magnet on my fridge and when I tried to take it off it opened the fridge door. I could litterally shake the whole fridge with it. I would definitely spend the extra couple bucks again on this product. 10/10
5,Super strong magnets and latch. Have an older car with no key fab so if keys are locked in get the coat hanger. Extra stashed key can be a life saver. Have been locked out with dogs in the car. Dont have to worry about box falling off can hardly pull it off same with latch takes omf to open. Water tight easy to hide.
5,This works great  no problems.You guys should make bigger ones so we can put them anywhere that holds a magnet.  Something to think about.
5,The magnets are mondo-strong.  I park in remote locations for extended periods  when out exploring/hunting.  Best to leave keys with the vehicle just in case.
5,It's still there after 4300+ miles around the USA! The magnets holds fast it takes an appropriate amount of force to open and it protects the contents from the wet and the muck of the road. I'm very pleased with this product coming through as a small but critical piece of insurance against accidentally locking myself out of while car camping.
5,Magnet is very powerful there is no way this will fall off of a vehicle while driving. You almost have to pry it off the refrigerator to get it off. I filled the sink with water and held it under water for 1 minute and it did not let any water in enough said. I bought another brand a little smaller and the chrome plating on the magnet corroded bad because I mounted it on the front side of rear fender I think this caught alot of road salt and water. I will mount this one facing the rear which should help alot
5,I liked the design and the size was perfect for my keyfob. The magnets were quite strong and held under my truck frame . I did add a couple of zip ties as extra security to just make sure that when I do lose my fob the one in this box that I hid under the truck will be there.
5,Let me explain my Headline.  We live on an Island and I can't tell you how many times we forget to take our keys when boating to the mainland for a trip into town.  This sturdy box saves a lot of boat trips back to the cabin.  The box is tough magnets are super strong and the box is large enough to hold my key fob and several other traditional keys.  This buy ended a lot of heated "I thought you remembered the keys" discussions.
4,Good little secret stash box no doubt strong durable good lock on it it does what I wanted it to do
4,I bought this to protect my SkyRc GSM020 performance analyzer. To keep it dry in my rc boat. It is built like a tank but it is heavy. 108g without the magnets. The slots  on the bottom allow for a velcro strap for mounting to whatever. I added additional foam for more protection. The foam it comes with is very thin top and bottom.
2,Holds to car as it should but some months later when I take it off I find out the there's water in there and the keys got some of that green on the edges. I'm lucky it hasn't become full-on brown rust. Also the foam loves falling into the other half of the box it's annoying and now that I think about it might be partially why it wasn't that waterproof.
5,This magnetic key holder is a little pricey but it defiantly does the job! It seems to be pretty much water tight so far and it has some of the strongest magnets I've seen for a key holder of this type. I put it underneath my truck on the frame by my drivers side door and I'm not worried at all about it coming loose. Only 2 weeks of use now so we will see how it holds up and will edit my review if needed.
5,Excellent item for the money
4,The magnet is powerful enough to stay in place bombing down dirt roads in alaska. So far its held up keeping my spare key in place. The plastic latch seems sturdy not sure if it will stay that way at neg 40. I dont open and close it constantly so i cant speak to repeated use how it would hold up.
5,As the title says it's a very thick case with a hefty latch a silicone waterproofing ring and the magnet's are no joke. Great for hiding a spare car/house key! Just make sure that if you have a large keyfob with a non-retractable key it might not fit. My 2010 Honda CR-V Keyfob/Key just barely fits inside.
5,Anyone who rates this item less than 5 stars is pushing the competition.  This box is more than I expected.  the magnets are extremely strong the box is very tight and the seal is perfect.  As a belt and suspenders guy I look forward to tie wrapping the box to the frame of my vehicle in addition to the magnets.  The box has slots to secure a secondary point to attach.  This is great.  Exactly what I wanted.  Will order 4 more.  No brainer.
5,It is waterproof and the magnets on the back are strong as he'll and keep it in position where you put it.
5,If you need something to store a extra key or whatever this is the magnetic box to get. It has a very strong magnet that won't let go easily. I'm very impressed with it. Don't waste money on those cheap hide a key boxes.  The magnets are a lot weaker and become unglued as was the case for me.
5,I used this to hide a spare key fob on my work vehicle. It stayed exactly where I put it and kept the dirt out despite rough & muddy dirt roads and subsequent car washes. Roomy enough for a fairly large remote.
5,Good size.  Great magnet.
5,Box large enough for my Toyota Tundra 4 x 4 Key.I 1st tested box by sticking it to a kitchen pan filling it with water & let sit 24hrs. No water made it thru seal therefore I felt comfortable putting my high $ spare key within. So far it’s sticking like a champ on truck applied it few months ago.
5,Just my luck the car I bought has a known issue of locking you out even if the key is in the ignition.I had to buy a spare fob to put in a lock box and this one was perfect. The Incredibly strong magnet holds it securely in place under the rear end.
3,This product looks great strong and durable but wasnt big enough to hold my 2018 honda civic key. Probably would work great for house keys though or a small car key
5,Magnet strength is almost so strong it’s dangerous you can put this under your car and have zero worries that it is going to fall off. I have never tried it for a GPS unitBut it is perfect for other things that are similar size like a pipe or some bags that need to stay hidden out of sight. My only qualm would be I’m not sure is the box smell proof or not?
4,The interior foam lining is not glued or attached so the foam pieces fall out when the case is opened. Structurally the case is very good latches tightly and securely. Water and dirt-tight seal with very strong magnets for attaching to ferrous metals. Highly recommended.
4,It’s a little smaller than I expected but the quality is good and I will order more.
4,It is still holding up under my car through rain and mud and rocky roads!
5,Solid box with really strong magnets.
5,I can’t say enough about this hide a key box.It is bigger enough to hold my rather large key fob.Very well made and the magnets WHOW talk about sting.Also blends well with the underside of my car.You won’t regret buying this.
5,This magnet is super strong and the box is really sturdy!  I was pleasantly suprised.  I did have to add some folded up paper towels into the box because the key rattled around inside (the foam was not quite thick enough to keep it from rattling around).  However that might not bother others.
5,This is super heavy duty and perfect for stashing keys under the car. We use for the occasional drop off at the airport when someone else is retrieving our car.
5,This is my second one to buy.  Watertight .. Very Strong Magnet.  I placed an extra key for the RV and placed this on the frame  under the RV so we'll never be locked out.  Pulled the RV from Alabama to Buffalo N.Y. and back.  Key never moved even over the rough roads in upstate N.Y.
5,I bought this because the color matched best with where I wanted to have it on my car. The box is sturdy and the lock is a bit tough to open but I like it since it makes it feel more secure. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks now. The magnets are holding on strong and my spare key is still dry even with all these April showers. I’ll likely purchase this again.
5,Magnets are awesome easy to hide on my vehicle. Key fob fits easily. Looks like a secure watertight box.
5,Ordered a Gorilla Box before going on a cross country move. I put it under the chassis of my car and it was still there when I arrived at my final destination. Would definitely use for a spare key or key fob in the future. The gorilla box latches shut and seems air / water tight due to the rubber seal used by the manufacturer. 11/10 would purchase again.
5,I use this for a spare key under my car and it works great.. I've traveled over 200 miles even on bumpy roads and it doesn't budge.. highly recommend
5,This thing is awesome It works great and it’s very durable I couldn’t ask for a better product
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This box has a very sturdy case that locks very tight. It’s a little difficult to open but that’s a a good thing really. It’s a necessity for a tight seal. The two magnets are very strong and appear to be affixed tightly with screws. This would be great for placing a geocache or for hiding a key on a car.
4,Good product strong magnet just a little to small.
4,This was the only one I could find that would fit  key fob. The magnet is strong but it is very hard to open! It takes super thumbs to unlock the clamps.
1,This box is junk I used it two times and the magnet was so strong it came off and took a good chunk out of the bottom of the case. I highly advise not to buy.
5,There nothing to dislike. The perfect hide a key product.
5,I put my key fob in it when I go to the beach super strong magnets  heavy duty built
5,This is a game changer for those who don’t like keys bulking up their pockets. As an avid runner swimmer and surfer I no longer have to worry about hiding my keys in odd places so that I don’t have to worry about them jingling in my pocket while I run or while I’m in the water.
5,Great little sealed box actually used it for junction box for salt spreader only issue was getting open pretty stout latch which works well for me may break someone else's finger nails
4,Does what it’s suppose to just a little hard to open but it’s worth it!
4,Seems like a good product. As you can see I didn't take the time to measure my mustang key. Don't be me.
5,Use this Box to keep asperity for my truck Works great stuck along a frame rail magnets hold tight boxes also water Tight. What highly recommended for spare keys.
5,Best thing I've ever purchased! Magnets are incredibly strong!! Pulled a tractor out the mud in my truck and the box didn't wiggle an inch very impressed!
5,Nice strong maintenance no fear of losing it hitting a bump total confidence in this case. Rain sleet nor snow can get through the watertight seal once it locked. 100% will buy again
5,this is not falling off anytime soon. Not sure if a child or weak person could even remove it from a steel trailer.It is very tough.
5,Bought this to hide a key under our RV.  This case is SUPER STRONG! It isn't going anywhere. Needed two hands to remove. I immediately bought a second one!
5,Bought this for husband's new truck and it is awesome!  Heavy duty construction with very powerful magnets.  Did have to remove one of the interior pieces of foam to get his key and the attached fob to fit but not a problem.  He is very pleased!
5,Love this lil box!!! Great hide away for my keys!!!
5,I absolutely love how strong and durable it is
5,Great for securing hidden aromatic goodies under your vehicle! Strong magnets and good latch. 5290 mile trip no problems.
5,The Gorilla Box is a very well made and is the perfect color to blend into any car chassis. It hides really well and the strong force of the magnet secures the box to the car frame with no worries of it falling off. I got this for my wife to always have an extra set of keys wherever she drives. She loves it!
1,got it to store an extra car key under my car in case I lock my keys in the car lasted until I drove in the raincame off and lost $250 keywould not recommend
5,Perfect to hide our RV key.
5,Work better than any other key holder I have found
5,Over a thousand miles of road and the box is still in place. It does what it was designed to do...
5,I love this box for my spare key but a note of caution. I have a Audi Q5 and the remote almost doesnt fit in the box. I had to remove the foam to make it fit so if you are trying to out the whole fob in it be wary.
5,Needed a safe and secure method to mount blue tooth temperature sensor for a car that does not have a thermometer. This box hold the sensor perfectly inside the front bumper and does not interfere with the bluetooth connection to my phone. I know can monitor the temperature outside of my vehicle while driving by looking at an app on my phone.
5,Great product does the job especially for a GPS tracker
5,Very strong and secure magnet and very tight closing cover
5,Great product... I use it when I'm going shore diving and I need to hide my keys quickly... Holds pretty good and the color blends in good to the chassis
1,Magnets are great but the box sucks. Two months after buying discovered the magnets still attached to the undercarriage of my truck but the box containing my key completely broken off and gone. I suggest next time purchase a hidden key box not made of cheap plastic that and an insurance policy that covers locksmiths
5,Very good to hide your spare keys. Hide it under the back bumper and holding very well there.
5,I have the original that has been under my Daughter's car for three vehicles almost a total of three years!!! no moisture and never worried it would fall off  This thing is super strong
5,Works great wish it was a little bit larger but it works for my needs.
4,Powerful magnet tested on drive wout anything in it because didnt wanna lose keys and did some bumpy dr I'KJ ving and it stayed secure
5,This is awesome - perfect size for multiple keys and the magnet sticks like glue!!!!
5,To test it out I drove around with it under my car my for 48 hours with nothing in it and it stayed where I had put it.
5,I like this box! 2 months ago I placed a spare key inside and attached the box to the undercarriage of my vehicle. I did use adhesive to assist the magnets but after 2 months it still is locked shut and after wiggling feels solid and secure.
5,Box is very sturdy with a great rubber gasket.  The magnet is very strong. Good black color to blend in with the underside of the vehicle.
5,Waterproof and sturdy with every powerful magnets. Does exactly what you expect it to do.
5,Nice little product.  Magnet is strong and keeps the box secure.
5,Seals well good size for keys or cards. Very strong magnet. I can open it without tearing it apart.
5,I was looking for a hide a key box for a work truck.  I am glad I purchased this product.  With a water resistant box and extremely heavy duty magnets I am sure when the key is needed it will be in there.  Ordering more to outfit our work fleet with them.
5,Posted an erroneous review. I basically just misplaced it.
5,Compared to most hide-a-keys this is a tank. Has a really strong magnet and the case is really heavy hard plastic. This won't fall off even with major bouncing around like off-roading.
5,Been under my truck for six months hiding a spare key. Hellofa a magnet.
1,Very strong magnet to hold to frame. Great for a non remote key. Does not  block the radio signal to unlock car remotely. So if you're trying to lock your car and keep people from getting into it this will not work.
5,This is a good lil safe to stash stuff under the car. It was smaller than I thought though but that’s my fault.  I read the dimensions but still thought it would be bigger.  But it works very good and magnet is strong!
5,Put it in the bed of my truck and forgot about it until I needed it. It had been beaten up pretty bad but was still functional and the spare keys and fob were in great shape. It is still in use.
5,Works great and big enough for a car key/remote.
4,This is a must have for spare key hidden. Waterproof and has strong magnet.
5,So awesome it got stolen from me. someone else must have really liked it
5,This is such a great product and I feel safe keeping any valuables in it.
5,Product is super sturdy and feels like a quality product. I've been using it for over 2 weeks now and so far it's held up great. We attach them to our service cars and can securely and discreetly pass keys from one driver to another.
5,It definitely works like it’s supposed to lol.
5,Exactly as described. Magnets are ridiculously strong to the point you have to use two hands to take it off the car which is exactly what you want for an expensive investment that will be going under a moving vehicle of all places.
5,Excellent key box. It has a very strong magnet so I am confident it will hold tight underneath the car. Will check in a few weeks and see if it truly has held on! Good value.
1,I bought this hoping I could put my car key in it. That is laughable it won't even hold 1 car key. Maybe this is for Barbie car keys? Super small and shallow. Big waste of time don't buy.
5,Very sturdy and the magnet won't let go. No concern about losing the key
5,I love how secure the case closes up and how sturdy the overall construction is.  This case definitely provides value over less expensive key cases.  It's got a lot of room inside but yet's not too big.  Love it!
5,Well-designed little case. Very magnetic - I'm confident this thing will never fall off. Good quality rubber O-rings ensure a tight waterproof seal. I use it for my extra key fob that won't fit in the other cheap spare key hiders.
5,Seems pretty much comparable to all the other options on here in terms of size and form factor. The color is what attracted me. I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee and and it blends in perfectly with the undercarriage. Love it.
5,It's been sticking on the bottom of my car for months. It will save you from having to pry open your car because you locked your keys in it. It is a good product.
5,Fits my keys and the fob for my Nissan!!!
1,Bought this for keys under by car. They were there for a few weeks but when I needed the box it has already fallen off. Even with better magnets than the cheap one it still wouldn't last hanging down while driving.
5,I just got this today (I only ordered it yesterday!) and I am pleased with it. Two strong magnets keep it firmly fixed on the underside of the car out of sight. It is a handy size for keys. Recommended.
5,Works as advertised. Perfect for hiding a key.
5,Tight seal and really strong magnet
5,Strong magnets and seems to be water tight.
5,Very sturdy and super strong magnetic.
5,Solved my problem where to keep spare key.
3,Rugged and well build but the reason it gets 3 starts is because it’s very difficult to get into. The latch on it is very stiff and it’s entirely made of plastic so I’m concerned about it getting brittle cracking and breaking. You might want to get something else
5,This is perfect if you are worried about the magnet not holding.  Case is large enough to hold several keys if needed.  Highly recommend.  Takes two hands to remove!
5,Very sturdy waterproof box
5,It’s very well-made weather resistant and the magnet holds on really well.
5,Bought for my son and he said it worked perfect
5,This box is exactly what I was as looking for to hide a key on my vehicle  it's heavy duty  waterproof and has incredibly strong magnets. I highly recommend.
5,Perfect for what it does.
5,Love it! Works great! The size is a little bit small but it works like a pro.
5,Amazing magnetos feels tough
5,Strong magnets ensure secure grip to car's frame. Good seal against water. Closure is strong and tight.
5,This case is rugged and great quality. I am very satisfied.
5,The case is very study and feels like it could take the elements very well. Magnet is very strong. Overall solid purchase.
5,Extremely high quality and durable case. This thing is bomb-proof. Strong magnets (unlike similar cases I’ve purchased). Did exactly what I needed it to do.
3,It's sturdy and all but not much good as it's too small for my car key to fit in and won't even hold a credit card.  I guess I'll figure out some other use for it.
5,Sturdy hard as nails product. Magnets hold strong.
5,Husband ordered more!
5,It latches and seals very tight with a nicely padded interior. The magnets are super strong and I see many different uses.
1,
5,My big key fob fits in there perfectly and it's super sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for!
5,Very nice! Magnetics are super strong and box is super sturdy
1,This box I heard people use for there car key but its way too small for a car key. More suitable for a house key or a car key cut without the chip.
5,Quality product with a Very strong set of magnets surprised by the hold it has
5,Very strong box and the magnets grab ahold of metal like nothing I’ve seen
5,Super durable and very strong magnets. No more lock out calls. :)
5,Fast delivery great material
5,Strong magnets
5,Great magnets
5,So far so good. It stays in place.
1,This is WAY too hard to open. Extremely difficult to the point where I don't even think I'll be able to use it. Very disappointed because a friend bought something similar but I thought this looked sturdier and ordered it instead. Last photo shows the problem- the "latch" is not the correct size/shape to fit in a way that allows for easy opening. I understand we don't want this product to open too easily however this is so difficult to open and close it may as well be for something you never want to access again. It hurts to try to pry it open when that size difference makes my thumbs cry.
5,This little box is high quality. Great magnets. Highly recommended
5,Very well made with extremely strong magnets
5,Works exactly as I expected super easy to hide
2,The product feels like good quality. A little smaller then I expected. But I took a forty five min ride to run errands and when I got home my box full of cash and AirPods was no longer there. I was under the impression it won’t fall. Can you do anything about this
5,absolutely perfect 👌
1,I put this in my car under the wheel well. It lasted for about 5 minutes before it fell off on the highway.  Quick 20 buck loss. Really glad I didn't have anything in it!
5,Excellent product and quality!!
5,Works perfect so far. Really pleased.
5,Heavy duty case super strong magnets!
5,Perfect for hiding your key fob
2,This box was quite thick for placing under my car. The first time it rained the box fell off. This was definitely not something I would recommend or buy again.
1,I bought this box based on the reviews and the directions. Put an ACURA fob in the box - fit perfectly. Placed it as described on chasis. Drove between 75-80 mph on I25 from Santa Fe to Albuquerque and when i arrived at my destination - GONE. I just called Acura and the replacement fob with service will be around d $300. I could vomit. Literally sick to my stomach. What went wrong? It seemed really magnetic when i pried it off and on to test but it's nowhere to be seen except somewhere run over on I25.
1,The hinges are what will rob you of your $$$.
1,I thought it was secure it was not I was going on a road trip and it was lost somewhere during the trip I had some valuable things within and it all disappeared. I was only driving highway so I don’t know how it fell off. I thought the magnets were strong but I guess not. Anyway if you buy it good luck.
1,This product seemed great and I used the key hidden inside a couple times. But yesterday I needed a key and found the box had fallen off my car (maybe faulty magnet?). I'm super annoyed to have lost my spare key as well!
1,I didn't even have the box for less than a week and it flew off the car. Worst investment I've made in awhile.
1,I put my spare keys in and for some reason it didn’t stay lost the box and now I don’t even have a spare
5,Works great strong magnets and perfect size for my back up keys. I highly recommend
1,Hinge broke after being used for 60 days.
1,Too small for 3 of my different cars keys
1,This is a mini i needed bigger one . Anzon had jokes
1,This is not water proof
5,It holds things nice like your weed and stuff
5,Most powerful magnet in the game Sometimes takes 2 hands to pull off
5,Can't really find anything wrong with these magnets at all.... and obviously its nice to be able to put something in there and apply it some place where most would never go looking for it. Its a great place to leave your keys if you're planning on an eventful night.I enjoy putting my keys and/or money in this for safe keeping but in case you didn't know this you should never EVER put any sort of credit card or any card with a magnet black strip because the magnets are so very strong that they can and WILL easily erase the information on the card and everyone knows how annoying it is to have to wait for a new one to be delivered. The same goes for any flash drives or memory chips.... you just don't want to take any chances that it might get erased on accident
5,Nice!
5,This little case is definitely quality. They really paid attention to every detail. Perfect for stashing a spare set of keys underneath your vehicle. The magnets are super strong so it will stick and stay put on whatever metal you stick it to.
5,Sturdy strong magnet!
5,heavy duty magnets give you piece of mind knowing your keys aren't going anywhere.
5,We installed on our motorhome in the propane bay and drove 700 miles on rough roads.  It is still there.  Great product works as expected.
5,Magnets are strong! I stood on the box itself with no deflection. Holds the keys perfect. Go no worries about it falling off
5,Good quality no complaints
5,Super strong magnets it takes a bit of effort to get it off. It should stay on no matter what.
5,Definitely better than husband expected. Same color as our van stays put securely.
5,This magnetic key box is great! It will give you sense of security knowing you have an extra key if you misplace your key.  Peace of mind is priceless.
5,Great hide a key for a vehicle
5,I love it great hide away
5,Best
5,I'm using this to hide a spare key under my vehicle. Very sturdy box with strong magnets.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Cut fish filter material to stop key from rattling.
5,What can I say I'm impressed 👍
5,Very strong magnet! Great for hiding a key under your car if you get locked out!
5,Si funciona y lo recomiendo
5,Good quality. The lock on it works way better and is more secure then I thought. I'm happy with the product
5,I have yet to use it and after maybe a year I can say how it really is but it looks sturdy tough and great.
5,My husband needed to hide a key and this holds the key safely out of sight on his truck.
5,Works very well
5,An amazing little case for any small items including larger keys. I bought 2 for larger truck keys. Now I'm going to purchase a few more as I am very impressed with the quality of this case. The hasp is quite secure. In fact it may take you by surprise the first time you open it it so secure. Steel pin for hinge and steel pin for closing hasp. Amazing. The two magnets are strong enough that you best be careful when setting this case against a metal surface as it may give you a blood blister if you dont get your fingers out quick enough. Two thumbs up for this product as of march 2021. I can not comment on UV resistance as I have not exposed them to sun.
5,It’s a solid box. I put a spare key for my hitch car and roof box. It’s gone though insane days of rain rough roads you name it. It’s held up the whole time and is still hard to remove from the car. It’s a solid box. Highly recommended.
5,Yes it did met spectating
5,Got this to hide a key for my kids car. Fits the key no problem. I wrapped the key in a small baggie just to keep it from moving around inside the case there is a fair amount of space inside.  It's waterproof near as I can tell with an inset gasket.  Snaps shut very tight.  I found a good spot that it would be very hard to see and it's very secure.  Don't get your fingers between the magnets and metal it will give you a nasty pinch.
5,It sticks securely to our vehicle
5,Works great for the bigger key fobs.
5,I wanted something study and a tad bigger than the usual key holders. Car keys are more bulky these days (longer at fat at the top)…I can even put a spare key to the house in it along with the car key if needed for emergencies. It is well hidden and the magnet strength is amazing. Great for a teenager driver who has an older car and locks themselves out—saves in $$ for lock and key calls
5,Solid box with good magnets and tight seal. As always you get what you pay for...
4,The magnet box works great. It is strong and has 2 strong magnets that’ll hold up under your car no problem. I’ve had it under my car for months and it’s still locked tightly and has no wear or tear. Great product overall . I would say it wouldn’t fit a keychain with other keys and chains on it. It’s more of a one key type of box . Max 2 keys . which is why I rate 4 stars.
5,I actually hid under my truck and it blended right in so it was a task to find it… lol
5,My 2019 Ram key fob fits nicely for when we go down.
5,Be careful where you mount this because the magnets are super strong.  Need to lift from the end to remove it
5,This thing is definitely solid and secure.
5,I used this for my 2021 Jeep Wrangler key fob. The fob is big and this was the only lockbox I could find that was big enough. The magnets are really strong I had to slide it to an edge to get it loose couldn’t pull it off the frame of my Jeep. Works better than expected!
5,I can't even pulled it off my car sometimes it's that strong. I put it under the back bumper in case it ever does fall the bumper lip catches it but it hasn't moved and inch. Perfect for gas compartment too.
2,I bought quite a few Gorilla products but this is probably the first loser.  Would not trust it on my vehicle due to the weak magnets.  I like that they are screwed on the only reason why I gave 2 stars since I guess you get a star just for showing up.  Not fond of the grey color since on a black vehicle it might as well be white.  Also the tie is really difficult to open.  Anyone with weak fingers could not get this opened.  This could be good for hiding stuff at home or even as a strong fridge magnet or other uses.  I put mine in the garage on my tool box to put keys for various things.Whilst it may work for others it did not work for me; tried on a 2005 and 2018 with similar results.
5,Magnet is really strong
4,So far it works
5,great
5,It’s good
5,耐久性防水性バッチリで磁石もよく着きます。
1,接着力が思っているより弱くシャーシに貼り付けていたのですがいつの間にか落ちていました。
5,Good
