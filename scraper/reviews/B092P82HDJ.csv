5,First off I love the C-Clamp. My desk has a 2nd "shelf" built on top of the main desk surface which is where the monitor is expected to sit. The space between the desk surface and the shelf is too short a clearance for normal C-Clamp monitor mounts because the tightening bolt underneath would be too long and keep me from getting a good bite on the platform. This mount design solved that problem for me.It's also very quick to tighten or loosen. Few turns are needed to widen the jaw a reasonable length. You will not get carpel tunnel shifting to different positions as you test.The cable management is entirely tool-less. Each arm has a plastic cable clip that snaps into place nearest to the monitor and those can squeeze 3-4 cables depending on thickness (my thick DP cables were a bit tight but I rather like that they aren't going anywhere). The lower arms have a not-so-flimsy plastic plate that slide upward and out to detach. You can catch the cables you want to route through and slide them right back in. No screws needed. The backside of the base also has some routing clips plus a couple holsters for your allen wrenches! No need to throw those away or stuff them in a drawer and pray you never need them.The mounting arms have enough tension to hold both of my 34" monitors. They cannot be stacked and I haven't tested how well I could squeeze them side-by-side (may work with more of a cornered setup). For me one of the 34" screens is vertical (by design - I know it's weird sue me). Both arms seem to hold their positions very consistently and with minimal wobble from outside vibrations.The VESA brackets they used made it really easy to simply install the bracket on the monitor first then slip the monitor on the arm after maxing out the tension. Then I could make finer adjustments from there. There's no wobble or "give" in these clip-on brackets. All metal very sturdy.Overall nothing about this dual-monitor mount feels cheap. What little plastic it uses also feels like it was made with quality standards. It had all the features I could reasonably ask for and it exceeded my expectations.
5,This was the first monitor mount I've purchased although I've had dual monitors for years.  The mount was packaged very efficiently in one box.  Putting it together was 'easy' in that the physical assembly of the pieces was a snap. The flaw imo was that the instruction card was relatively small with smaller print and it didn't adequately explain that there are two ways to mount the stand.  If there is a pre-drilled hole in the desk there are different steps.  I'm a newbie here so this may be obvious for others.  I would definitely have preferred to watch a sample assembly online in conjunction with the card.  Since one monitor is fairly heavy I reassembled after drilling a hole in my new standing desk.I have two different sized monitors a beast of a dinosaur 32" and a more typical 24".  Once the base was ready adding the 24" monitor was a snap.  If you have two monitors this size I can't imagine that you'd have any trouble adjusting to any arrangement you'd like.  The 32" monitor required a good amount of tensioning and hence was harder to maneuver.  I was able to find a reasonable configuration and am completely psyched I went this route.I rated range of motion 4 stars because 2 32" monitors might get clunky.  I rated sturdiness a 4 which is being kind of picky on my part.  My two monitors are different sizes and different weights. Normal people have matching monitors and a more tradition space to have this much screen; 32" is certainly at the upper end of sizes.Bottom line would totally buy again!
5,Finally found a high quality easy to assemble flexible dual monitor stand! Not many products worked with my electric adjustable height desk but this product works and fits great. The quality of the box it comes in and how it’s wrapped speaks volumes about the thought this small business put into it. Even the quality of the assembly brochure and the extra Velcro straps for cord management make this product well worth the money. It came with TWO options on the base clamp which is exactly what I needed to fit a tight space where my standing desk lifts off the frame. It’s so sturdy easy to maneuver and I’m confident it will support my monitors for years to come. I rarely write reviews but this is one I’m super pleased with.
5,Mounted my 32” LG gaming monitor and a second 22” monitor and am very happy with this stand. My desk was too thick for the clamp option so I had to drill a hole but there’s no way it could fall unless the arms fell apart. This thing could hold two 32” monitors no problem and mine is 11.5 lbs for reference.
5,I'm glad to have found these arms.  They took about an hour to set up but the instructions were well written and included clear images.The movement reach and stability are all really solid.  It's easy to reposition everything except for tilting.It may be by-design but the tilt action requires using the hex wrench (included).
5,- There was no weight rating in the product description but I saw in the questions that these arms support virtually any monitor weight as long as the monitor is 32 inch or smaller.After opening the box the first thing which worried me was the 17.6 lb weight rating that was written on the manual. I assembled the product and connected my 21 lb 32" monitor and it holds it pretty well without any issues.- Overall the product feels like a solid product and I like the simple and modern look of the arms with a nice matte paint.- One thing to note is that the cable management system is not designed to carry many cables. I connect 6-7 cables to my monitor. I had to use the velcro straps that came with the arms to keep the cables with tidy.- I use a laptop tray on the second arm to keep my laptop next to the monitor. It was easy to reduce the spring tension to lower the arm for the weight of a laptop.- A nice little addition to the arms is a plastic holder for the allen wrenches which come with the product.
5,The unit is sturdy - much better than others I have tried. The assembly confusing - a better picture of where the unit joins together. The spring arms are holding up well and I have not noticed any issues with the monitors slowly lowering on their onw. I recommend.
5,this thing is crazy good it was ez to assemble and i didn't need to do much just put together then put the mount on the back of my screen and boom it was ready all I needed to do was put the monitor on the stand and then  is was ready to go I didn't even need to any thing u should bye
5,I had just bought a brand new desk and they were selling dual monitor arms for about $250 so I decided to try my luck somewhere else and was worried this might not fit snug... The Quarx arms fit perfectly on my desk and it took less than 5 minutes to get it out of the box and completely set up! I have two 28" monitors next to eachother and can still push them further comfortably. They are very sturdy and the organizing straps are perfect for a clean finish! Perfect product and I'll definitely buy from them again!
5,This is the first time I use the VESA computer stand. The product is generally good including the quality and workmanship. The assembly is very simple and the product manual is written in great detail. There is a screw adjustment that is very important but I don't know why it is important. After many attempts I learned that it would be better if the product manual could be improved. There is another problem. After installing it on the table the screen occupies half of the table and the space behind the screen is basically wasted. I don’t know if I need a wider width. The table still needs to be installed on the side of the table and overall it is a good experience!
5,Most desk mounted monitor arms have weak or undersized clamps or grommets. Most of them also have flimsy arm attachments and weak support springs.Not this thing. If I really needed an impromptu hammer one day I am absolutely certain that any of the parts on this thing will qualify.The desk clamp is made of solid cast aluminum with a nice powder coat finish. The clamping jaw itself appears to be about  .5"/12mm thick solid aluminum and is tightened with a 12mm stainless steel bolt. There is absolutely no wobble once the clamp is tightened down even when both arms are extended and stressed.The arms themselves come 90% assembled and all screws actually come pre installed. All an end user needs to do is drop the arm sockets over the 1"/25mm billet-aluminum struts and every joint comes pre lubed with enough grease to get the world's fattest man into a bath tub.The gas springs feel like they can each individually support a 40" television without much trouble but can be loosened to whatever rigidity you feel is best. Each joint features set screws that tighten down enough to possibly wall mount this thing.Finally the entire design is cleverly streamlined. If you have already removed your monitor VESA screws put the screwdriver away; two hex wrenches are the only tools needed to assemble this mount both are included. The wire grommet features two convenient holders for the wrenches and thumb screws are included for the VESA plates themselves. The VESA plates do not need to be screwed to the arms like typical mounts because it uses a unique snap in system that is so simple it could be called a quick changemonitor mount.I really do not have any complaints. I know this is more expensive than the typical dual articulating arm mounts but this thing is compares to a genuine Ergotron arm at half the price. If you did have any issues the business owner herself includes her email on a small card within the packaging.I highly HIGHLY recommend anyone shopping for something similar opt for this over the cheaper competitors.
4,I've worked from home for 12 years. Typically spend 50+ hours a week at my desk (raised or seated). I've used monitors with the manufacturer's static stand and I've used various monitor arms (two separate tension-knob posts etc.). I've had this Quark model in place for 15 hours. As someone who is on the short side (5'5") and wears progressive bifocals (who also has repetitive stress injuries in wrists and elbows due to computer work) a highly adjustable computer monitor is essential to finding the exact area of comfort for wrists/reading/chair & desk height. I bought this monitor arm unit based on the many positive reviews. I agree with the others - overall this seems like a very good investment and I wish I'd done it sooner. I can nuance each of my monitors depending on what's a comfortable viewing angle at the moment.The unit is well packaged and the equipment itself has a nice weight which suggests stability and longevity. While the instructions booklet is brief (a refreshing change from many pieces of equipment) the "help text" callouts can be improved to be more specific and clear. I've assembled many things from furniture to electronics and I probably spent 25 frustrating minutes too many putting this together because A) the base arm which has two receiver openings isn't marked as to which end should fit into the base and which should receive the monitor arm and B) the tension point on the monitor arm where it meets the base arm and C) when using the clamp-on method of affixing the base the protective stickers covering the corners (where the base is most likely to "bite" into a user's desk and leave marks) are useless. Mine wouldn't stay affixed and then upon setup folded over themselves. I need to un-install and affix thicker more rigid pads to protect my expensive desk.It would be great if the manufacturer would include a 45 sec-1 min video of someone assembling one monitor.Overall this is a great unit. Worth the irritation and frustration during assembly. Would buy again.
5,This is an excellent product. It's well made and the instructions are easy to follow. We're using it for our "hot desking" workstation so the monitors can adjust to different heights for different users.
5,Ok so I have a 28” Samsung 4K monitor on the left arm and a 38” Ultrawide LG monitor on the right arm. I think the description says it works with up to 34” monitor but I was beyond impressed that this worked!!! Well worth the money and the way it moves is so smoothe. You won’t regret this purchase!
4,Just received and set mine up. Easy to assemble except for getting the arms to work. One monitor is staying in a lower position but the other keeps popping up. I’ve tightened in two different spots. The place that uses the smaller tool seems to be stripped possibly. I don’t want to have to rearrange my desk again put the old monitor stands backs return this product to get a new one!  Any suggestions?
5,Bought it to mount a 34 inch Ultrawide and a 24 inch vertically mounted monitor on a 54" by 32" inch standing desk.Comes in a very smart looking packaging with a handwritten note from the small business owner! Good touch! Includes all the right parts to put the mount together and fairly intuitive instructions to follow. Except for needing a screwdriver to install the vesa mount on the monitor everything else is included. From the get go the finish feels premium. Not the usual bright gathering blacks but a matte finish. The essential parts are made out of metal and feel hefty so immediately quell any concern that it would have any issue holding the weight of the monitors.Took a little bit of elbow grease to install the mount/fine tune the mount primarily to make the adjustments to work with my configuration. Good thought went into Cable management and the housing for cables allows ample space for a power cord and a video input cord to be nicely nested in the housing.Having used it for about a week now have not experienced any sagging of the monitors and I don't anticipate that there would be any concern in the near future. The description seems quite accurate that it can easily mount two side by side configuration of 32 inches without any concerns.  For a side by side full arm extension mount in the middle you only need maybe 1-2 inches from the wall.The only dock that I can think of that certain configurations and how close/far may push the arm back into the wall so something to bear in mind while ordering or seeking clarification from the business owner. My vertical mounted monitor (based on a side mount configuration) tends jut into the wall if pushed too far back. I anticipate that most users lock it and forget it most of the time so its not an issue but just something to be aware of.All in all its a quality product that saves lot of desk space and fulfills most of the needs. At its current price point I think matches quite well and exceeds with comparative products in the market. I was considering Ergotron Amazon's dual mount (which was out of stock) Huanao but have been very impressed with the quality of the product and apart from subjective aesthetics don't anticipate any complaints as far as the functionality of the mount.Big thumbs up and a great job overall.
5,Honestly an amazing monitor stand. I got this as an alternative to my last one because this one clamps from the top. I have a desk that doesn't allow much of a lip to clamp onto (about 2 inches) and though it seems like the shape isn't intended for this use case it works perfectly. Also glad to say it holds 2 15lb 32in ultrawide gaming monitors with ease. It can definitely handle more. Only possible complaint I have is that the hex wrenches it comes with are a bit puny if you're tightening the bolts to hold a heavier monitor. Buy with confidence
5,This product was easy to put together and very sturdy.  It also came with a hand written Thank you note!  Make you feel warm and fuzzy to help out a small family business!!
5,I have a heavy Alienware Monitor that other arms could not hold. I was getting frustrated because it was hard to find one that I really liked. I paid a little extra money and got this one and I DO NOT REGRET IT! THIS IS A MUSTTT if you have heavy monitors!! Very pleased with my buy.
5,I have a two monitor set up and I'm a little OCD on aligning the monitor screens side by side perfectly.I bought this monitor arm after I tried another two options on one is the Amazon Basic monitor (which is the same as the very expensive Ergotron LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm) the other one is the Amazon choice at the moment (HUANUO Dual Monitor Stand). The problem with the Amazon basic stand is that it's very rigid there is no way I can find to make the screen tilting movement less tight. On the other hand the HUANUO is much smoother in the movement but it feels flimsy and soft - you move the monitor a little it's just the arm being flexible and bending but the joints are not actually moving which makes fine adjustment very hard. Eventually I settled on this monitor arm. It have similar build quality as the Amazon Basic monitor - all structural components are metal I can adjust the monitor to desired position much easier because of the solid build. If you are like me really want to align monitors perfectly this is a good option.
5,This is the only one I've found that you can manuever so easily. It's sturdy and was easy to set up.  I have 2 32 inch monitors on it.  Thank you for a great product!!
5,This product is a game changer for my overall desk experience. Better ergonomics less neck strain frees up desk space. But the real topper is the excellent quality. I'm very impressed with the simplicity of set-up. This monitor stand is well built and easily adjustable. Very secure mount on my desk. I bought this for home use but considering buying one for my office at work also. Highly recommend.
5,I was debating whether to get a $300 one or this one. Glad I went with this one. For less than 32 inch this is more than enough. I have a 24 and a 27. The arms are so durable and high quality. No mention the cable management. I wish I havd gotten it sonner 😅
5,Bought this unit a few weeks back it was easy to install and it did what i wanted. Makes two monitor setups with limited deskspace easy and because it is made of metal i feel safe using this without thinking one of the monitors will fall and break.
5,Easy to assemble and fits my 32" tv's with no problem.
4,I was very surprised by how sturdy and how much range of motion I got with this. I am glad to spend the extra money to get this because it really is worth it. I do wish however there was a little more explanation on the spring tension. I wasn't sure whether I need to tighten it or loosen it at times so I had to google and YouTube it. Other than that the product itself is amazing and would highly recommend this.
5,These monitor arms are a great quality product at a very affordable price compared to others I have used or seen. The only thing that I had an issue with was that for my particular monitors the screws provided bottomed out before it could secure the monitor correctly. I had to purchase a few washers to fill the gap. Not really a big deal for me. The cord control is really nice but the bottom line is that they are not build cheap they are incredibly sturdy and well made.
5,This dual monitor stand is a game changer! I love the extra room not to mention it looks really sleek! Highly recommend for anyone with two monitors and looking to update their work space. After working from home for two years my only regret is that I didn't get this sooner!
5,I have tried a number of different models and these monitor arms are just great. What I like about them most is that they can be used with a regular desk and standing desk. The low profile clamp makes it very versatile for any setup. It was also the best packaged product and very simple to assemble and install. Very pleased with this purchase.
4,The arms are solid I have a pair of Dell S2421's attached to a Fredde desk from Ikea. I needed to pickup a pack of wood shims from Home Depot to give enough surface for the clamp to attach to. But its holding on to the back of the shelf really well.
5,I don’t write a lot of reviews but this one I felt deserved one. I have had a lot of monitor stands over the years and this is by far the most sturdy and effective. It holds my 32” monitors with ease and the adjustability is unmatched. You can do almost any orientation and it holds up well. Also bonus points for it being a small business as you don’t expect that often from Amazon purchases. Last note if you purchased one and are having trouble lining things up the way you want them be sure to remember that the desk clamp does not have to be centered on your desk move it to the right or left as you see fit. Only future functionality id like to see is more height which doesn’t effect my setup but the arms do not raise high enough to mount two 32” vertically. Thankfully I didn’t need the height for my set up. Great product great quality 5/5 stars
5,Great mount for a great price sometimes have to figure out how to put the arms to get the screens a certain position but besides that very easy to install directions are clear and has been perfect so far!
5,Great product.  Highly recommended.
4,Items is great but one of the bolts was damaged and I was unable to tighten it. Still works great just slightly annoying
5,These dual mount arms are perfect. I have two ASUS 27” monitors attached via the VESA mount. The fit was a little tight but it worked. There are screws and hardware included to get everything set up. I did adjust the arm tension but that only took a few minutes. I used the clamp to attach to my desk and did not screw into the wood. It is sturdy and not going anywhere. The monitors stay out and are easy to adjust. I have the desk pulled out a couple of inches from the wall due to how the right side monitor is angled. You can get a flush wall setup going with a more straight on orientation.  All in all it took about 30 minutes to assemble and fine tune the positioning.
5,Very good quality product. I specifically was choosing the stand design with a wider base and this arm stays in place securely and doesn’t wobble. I have two large and heavy 32” monitors on it. Love this product for my work from home setup!
4,I bought this mount for a particular desk design (steel labs Mangnus) and it serves its purpose. I would say the rang of motion is so so and I hate that the height can’t be adjusted.
5,The monitor stand was easy to setup and is sturdy.  I have two 27 inch monitors attached. Clears up a lot of space on the desk.
5,The arms are great and exactly what I was looking for in my setup. They hold 2 28" monitors next to each other in a comfortable angle.
5,This product was better than expected. Compared to others I have seen in person friends family and work for more money.  Set up was easy packaged well. Spring adjustment feature was done well.  Don't be fooled with the sale of more expensive comparisons.  Very glad I took a chance on this!  Great company!
5,Very stable looks clean easy to adjust position of both monitors in every direction except up and down
5,This is a great product. Well-made and sturdy. All the parts are high quality. It looks and works exactly as described. You can probably find some low quality stuff cheaper but if you are looking for a quality well-made product at a great value this is the one. I would definitely recommend.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Overall this was much more complicated of a setup than I feel was necessary - they could have put a ton of this together and sent it with the majority of the setup complete so all you would need to do would be adjust to your preferences but rather they send all the pieces separately.I found the instructions for the clamp to be overly complicated for my usage and just did what looked to be correct. My desk is 1/2" thick maple and the clamp works perfectly using it like a standard c-clamp. I used the round sticker on the top part of the clamp that touches the desktop for protection. There's another metal circular piece I didn't use at all and have to assume this is either for thicker desks or those with a pre-drilled hole for this stand. Very confused by this part of the instructions and had my partner look too - he had no idea either. Actual text instructions might help this be more clear.Attach the pipe shaft to the clamp and the "arms" slide onto the shaft. Tighten the hex key bolt to hold the arms in place on the shaft at the desired height. Easy enough.Slide the monitors onto the top of each arm and screw at the top to secure. No problem. One of my monitors had mounting holes and the other did not so I experienced both the mounting hardware from this product and using an adapter for the other.Loosen and tighten the hex bolt for each monitor to adjust the vertical tilt and horizontal placement of the monitors. Easy in theory but in practice only the vertical bolts were doable with the tools provided. The bolts on both the left and right horizontal adjustments required a medium-sized hex key (they only provided a large and small hex key so I had to find a medium). The left bolt was actually stripped before I tried to adjust them (how does this even happen??) so I have to go buy a new bolt to replace the stripped one to actually be able to use my monitor on the left stand. Had to force it out with pliers. Pretty annoying. I'll try to find two bolts that use the large hex key because although the right one wasn't quite as stripped and was usable it's definitely getting there.The bottom half of either arm is also extremely tight after unboxing so I also found that I needed a medium hex key to loosen these and achieve a better range of motion. Again they didn't provide a medium.My other complaint is any adjustments on this stand requires a hex key - be it the overall height vertical tilt of the monitors and horizontal alignment. I bought this with the intent to use this on my desk and convert quick-ish from sitting to standing but because the shaft isn't taller the monitors aren't a good height to use for standing unless I also need to adjust the vertical tilt of both monitors. (I'm 5'4".) Then all of a sudden it's a whole process to stand up and keep working. The entire design would be better if it used push-button latches to make these adjustments rather than hex keys for EVERYTHING.As a monitor stand with the sole intention of keeping your monitors above your keyboard / laptop / desk I guess I would recommend this as long as you don't have the same luck with stripped bolts I did. As a sitting / standing desk you plan to adjust frequently I would not recommend this. Get something better designed for quick adjustments and something with more range of height.
5,The product from the packaging to the build quality functionality and sturdiness everything is just excellent. It even has a little caddy that slips into the back of the mount to store the adjustment Allen wrenches that come with it.  If you're worried about it holding a heavy monitor don't be. I have 2x 27" 4ks and they're easily 18 lbs each. With a little tightening on the tilt joints this rig holds everything perfectly in place. I couldn't be happier.
5,I got the FLYTE double arm for my two screens and to put it simply i love it. I takes two seconds to set up and it feels and looks super solid the design is sleek and minimal. I own a pretty expensive ergotron arm for my cintiq and let me say this guy doesn't pale at all in comparison. Cable management is also very good and the Independent lock system that hold the screen is clutch. Usually this assembly step nrequires two people to do it safely but this changes the game. I am glad i trusted this new brand!
5,I normally do not write reviews on  products but in this case I feel I must. I did spend a good bit of time researching prior to purchasing these. I have 2 27" monitors and felt these would be perfect and that they are. Upon arrival I was initially missing set screws for the arms so I reached out to support and received an email from Amy within minutes. I explained my situation and I was sent REPLACEMENT ARMS ! Since I didn't have the opportunity initially to complete the assembly once I received the replacement arms I started the process and started to adjust the monitors. At that point I did notice an issue with one of the two mounting points the monitor would not remain level which to be honest was frustrating. I reached back out to Amy and sent photos and after a couple of emails and suggestions Amy sent a replacement mounting point via FedEx and it arrived quickly. Not only did she send a replacement mount she was kind enough to send set screws for the monitor arms. At that point I was finally able to complete the installation and get the monitors adjusted properly.The mounting arms are absolutely perfect and I am very happy. HOWEVER what really stands out is the SERVICE after the sale. Amy went out of her way to address my concerns to be certain that I was happy and she responded quickly each time. Not only is the mount outstanding the SERVICE received is TOP NOTCH and second to NONE. I HIGHLY recommend these mounts and I would not hesitate to recommend these mounts to anyone.Amy is nothing short of amazing she went out of her way to ensure that I was satisfied.
4,Really appreciate the slim design and ease of motion when moving. Only issue is a little hard to comprehend how to adjust the arms for sturdiness but otherwise a 10/10. Thank you Amy.
5,My desk is an L-shaped corner desk with a small cut-out gap in the back corner. This made me hesitant on buying a monitor arm stand with a C-clamp as I was afraid the clamp wouldn't fit into the corner. Luckily with how Quarx designed their C-clamp it was able to fit and bite into my desk's corner lip perfectly. My desk is also very deep ranging at around 50 inches from the back corner to the front edge of my slide-out keyboard tray fully extended. The monitors extend out pretty nicely to cover some of that distance. When I game I can fully extend one of the monitors front and center up to approximately 22inches. I find this close enough for me to game and not feel too far from the monitor. Both of my monitors are curved and measure at 27inches. I haven't experienced any wobbling or sagging with the monitor arms as they seem very sturdy and can be tightened if needed. Please note that depending on your desk set up you might need some breathing room behind the desk for the arms to move back otherwise they will run into your wall. Because my desk is deep I don't have issues with this as I have my monitor arms extending forward. Also you may need to buy longer monitor display cables depending where your PC tower sits. I had to change out my 6ft display cables for 10ft cables since my PC tower sits pretty far from my monitors and the Quarx monitor arms added more distance.All in all the Quarx QX-700 Flyte Monitor Arms are really solid and were the best that I could find to cover my deep desk space and fit with the kind of desk that I have. Good range of motion and design for cable management. Makes my desk space a lot cleaner and gives me flexibility to move my monitors as needed for when I game or work on certain projects.
5,Wasn’t sure what to expect when I ordered this but I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a great product.  It came well packaged with simple to follow visual instructions.  All you need is a screw driver and the rest is included.  It seems well built very sturdy good range of motion and can adapt to fit different types of desks.  My corner desk wouldn’t allow for the standard clamping assembly but I was able to secure using the grommet method through the cord access port on my desk with a slight modification.  Once the mounting is done the rest of the installation is super easy.  They even include cord holders on the arms with additional Velcro straps to keep everything off the desk.  There is a cute little caddy that attached to the base that holds your Allen wrenches in case you need to adjust tension down the road.  I would highly recommend this to anyone running more than one monitor.
5,This dual monitor mount has greatly reduced my back pain. These monitor arms are pretty sturdy and solid. The monitor is held in the same position and it doesn't slip or moves. Setting up this monitor stand is pretty simple and easy to installed.  The double monitor stand is made entirely of premium grade metal. monitor has a one-of-a-kind secure monitor base. Computer screens and monitors will remain durable. The dual monitor arms are an excellent monitor riser for a wood plastic metal or glass office desk table. If the desk is no thicker than 3.75" the monitor clamp version will work; otherwise the grommet monitor mount version will work. The grommet monitor mount version is suitable for office and work desks up to 2.5" thick. The designed monitor arm to be easily installed on its own To easily mount the monitor the mount plate has a slide-on plate feature. Screw the monitor to the monitor stand plate first and then simply slide the clamp onto the arm bracket. The monitor stand desk mount comes with an instruction manual and a step-by-step guide as well as tools and hardware for quick assembly. The double monitor stand is compatible with the majority of monitors on the market. This monitor arms for two monitors can safely support any weight and are for monitors ranging in size from 17 to 32 inches. The dual arm is compatible with 75X75 and 100X100 mounts. It can be used universal stand is compatible with 99.9% of computer screens and monitors. We also included an extra rubber pad for under the clamp to protect y desk from scratches and dents.
5,I'm happy with this dual monitor mount. I chose it over another one because it has separate backing plates which makes it easier to mount the monitors and I think it's a more reliable setup.Although the arms are fairly short they can be articulated to your preferred configuration and they will hold the monitors in their position. It's a huge upgrade for me after years of allowing the monitor stands to take up space on my desk.The base has two options. There is the standard metal clamp which works perfectly for me or you can drill a hole in your desk and use the grommet style. The grommet style is optimal because it moves the entire stand inward and away from the edge of the desk and the wall but the clamp makes it more portable and works just fine.The only critiques I have are to be careful with the plastic covers which can be used for cable management and be slow and gentle when tightening or loosening the spring which adjusts the stiffness of the boom that raises and lowers the monitor. Everything else is much more durable but you should be gentle with the plastic and spring. Overall this product is worth it if you want a small durable dual monitor stand with articulating arms and two base options.
5,I was surprised on how sturdy and well built it was.  Very easy to assemble.  They even thought of including a wrench holder so if you need to adjust it later the wrenches are readily handy.  Works very well on the standing desk I installed it on.  I plan to purchase more for the office.
5,I spent quite some comparing all kinds of monitor arms and decided to go with Quarx FLYITE Monitor Arm.  It's been a few weeks since I set it up with my monitor and laptop and I'm very happy with it.One of the reasons why I went with Quarx is how the base/clamp is designed.  The base is much bigger than others and provides extra stability.  I tried to wiggle it and this thing didn't even budge once it's tightened.  Instead of crawling under the desk like others you can tight the clamp from the top of the base and the bottom of clamp plate that touches the desk has a protective rubber pad so it won't scratch or damage your desk.The arms appear to be made of high quality material and give you a plenty of motion range.  I wasn't sure if this would work since I was planning to use one arm for my laptop but I had no problem at all putting both monitor and laptop to the position I want.  I had to adjust tension for the arm I use for laptop since it tends to push my laptop way up but after play with it a few minutes I was able to put where it should be.Overall I'm very satisfied and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for decent stable monitor arm!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 love it. so easy to assemble
5,I have two monitors that I use for a variety of things including running a 24/7 streaming radio station. I tried several different monitor arms before I found this dual one. I'm very happy about this purchase. This is a very sturdy setup. I use a 27" Dell monitor and a 27" iMac (which isn't light). I needed a VESA adapter for the iMac mount due to Apple's configuration (have to mount to the stand). These give me the perfect arrangement for my setup.
5,It’s very nice need to return it however because how long it is. Gonna order the most expensive one to fix my issue. Other than the length it was perfect
3,I really really want to love this but there are a couple design flaws that disappointingly force me to knock the rating down. I really hope the merchant reads this because a next iteration of this design could be truly great.Here are my complaints and sadly the reasons I have no choice but to disassemble and return this product:1. The tilt joint right behind the VESA mount is awful. It's a bolt with two large convex washers to provide the friction that holds the monitor angle in place after tightening the bolt. It is a truly awful design. To be fair this is also a design flaw with many other brand monitor arms I've used in the past. No matter how tight I make the bolt (to the point of injuring my hand torquing the hex key to tighten it more) the monitor still easily tilts forward. Every time I adjust the position of the monitor the damn thing also tilts forward a little. **Extremely** frustrating. It would only take a couple pennies worth of rubber washer in the joint to increase the friction significantly to solve this deal-breaker of a problem.  Note: I went so far as to cut some rough fabric to put on either side of each washer which added about 10% more friction...barely enough to somewhat solve a problem that simply should not be.2. The minimum height of the monitor (i.e. the distance from the desktop to the bottom of the monitor) is too high. The mount on my 32" monitor is a bit lower than center so the monitor does naturally sit a few inches higher than average yet the lowest it will go is still at least 4-5" too high to be ergonomic and comfortable.I'm really sad I can't give this a higher score. Send me an updated model to review with these issues fixed and I'll enthusiastically give it 5/5 stars.
5,Easy to setup with clear instructions. I have 2 32" monitors. The gas springs make raising and lowering the monitors very easy.You do need to follow the instructions which are not complicated in order to tighten up play with the included Allen keys.
5,Great quality product easy to assemble and easy to use. This stand has full range of smooth motions depending how you want your setup to look and also has helped me with the overall presentation of my desk space by getting rid of unnecessary clutter/poorly ran wires
5,Product was easy to put together and arrived in great conditions. Now my two monitors are up and running and I've saved space on my desktop free to add more devices.
5,I was looking for a long time for the right mount and this os the one!! Ask my wife it was driving her crazy 🤣. I tried about 5 others until I found this one and solved everything I was looking for. Highly recommend!!
5,I really wanted to like this mount - It has a premium appearance to it with a wide metal base that would help ensure a more firm clamp. Indeed the clamp works very well is tight and secure but there was some give to the arms themselves as if the tension was not enough for my 27" and 30" monitor particularly for the larger one.I reached out to the seller and they sent me a replacement. The new one works MUCH better (though not "perfectly") -- both monitors now stay where they are supposed to.Overall the monitor stand works well and I must commend that customer service was good and took care of the issue with the first stand.Now on to the details:1. Installation was simple and straight-forward except for one step: do not reverse the cable organizer arm the way I did in the photo: the holes should be facing down2. Monitors stay on sturdy and tension can be adjusted easily3. Rotation of the monitors in 360 degrees was effortless4. Desk is MUCH MUCH more clean looking and organized than with monitor stands5. Clamp stays on very securely6. You need some extra space at the back of the table -- in my photos you can see a wall is behind and that limits the range of motion the arms can achieveI've updated the 4-star rating to 5 stars after a few months of use. Loving it!
5,I recently purchased a new Secret Lab Desk. For those not familiar this desk has a compartment hatch along the back of the desk to hide your cables which is great!The problem is finding monitor mounts is a little more difficult as I cannot place a monitor mount over the rear of the desk as I would lose access to the wire hiding compartment.I needed a monitor mount that I could clamp onto the actual desktop but provide enough clearance between the desk top and the compartment cover. I also needed it to allow me to secure the clamp from the top as the bottom portion of the clam would be within the cable management compartment.This monitor mount works perfectly for this desk and was significantly easier to setup than what I had initially anticipated. The arms also have clips and a spot to manage the cables prior to fitting inside my desk.If you have a secret lab desk and want a mount that will fit on the desktop and not on the cover to the cable management location then this is the one.
5,It took me 10 minutes to install this in my home office.  I have 2 32 inch curved monitors and works great.  The range of motion and configurations is amazing.  Simple instructions and very sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5,I ordered a much cheaper one first and it was terrible quality. My husband took one look at the parts and was like - that will break so I returned it. Although this was much more than the others glad I choose it. It's very sturdy has a great range of motion and everything looks very sleek. Highly recommend.
5,We have ordered a few now for our offices. What a very nice product for office use. Arms move all over like an octopus. Seems to be holding up well. We may order more as needed. This will be our "go-to".Even better the seller sends a handwritten note along with your order. (Quarx) That is much appreciated...call me old-fashioned.
4,This has made working from home a dream!!! I recommend to anyone to save stress on your neck 🙂
4,Double Monitor stand is almost near where I would like it to be.  The problem is my desk faces a wall so the angle which is the highest it will extend versus being  centered is a problem. I think it will work wonderful for those monitors that have no wall.  I prefer my monitors to be centered in the middle with each side meeting in the middle with no angle.  Right now the right side of my monitor has more of a 30 degree angle that hurts my neck.  I try to stand/ sit towards the right side so it’s not obtrusive to my view or neck.Before you buy consider where you are placing your monitor:  wall or free.  By wall make sure you have enough room.
5,Super great product very sturdy about 10 minutes to assemble and solid packaging with a friendly note from the owners. 10/10 would buy again if I needed to but I think this thing will last forever
5,This is a great space saver for my son's dorm room desk. He's got a 27 in and a 32 in computer monitor which took up his entire desk and left room for nothing other than his keyboard and mouse. With this monitor stand he now has room for his laptop and an organization unit. It's a game changer for him. The design craftsmanship and material quality is top of the line. The entire stand is made of metal so it's extremely sturdy and gives me confidence that it's not going to fall and break his monitors. The arms are easy to move and adjust so you can customize the positioning. You can adjust everything from the height to the width to the rotation. The height adjustment is huge for him. Now he can have the monitors positioned up above his laptop screen which makes it a million times easier to study. The instructions made it simple to mount onto his desk. Once it was installed it was solid and didn't wobble no matter how much he messed around with them. I'm impressed with how solid of a product this is. It's definitely a 5 star product that I'd recommend.
4,I have mine on a desk that is next to a wall and there wasn't a way to adjust enough without the arms hitting the wall. I ended up buying a keyboard tray so I could put more distance between my eyes and the monitors.
5,I got this dual monitor stand last month and I could not be more pleased with it or with this company who makes it.  It was extremely easy to install and the quality is excellent!The tension of one of the arms was not working the way it should regardless of the adjusting I was doing but I did not want to send it back because I really really liked it.  I emailed Amy from I believe their customer service and submitted a short video of what I was talking about to see if it was me that was doing something wrong and they responded back the next day and said nope you got a faulty arm we will send you a new one.  They fed ex'd me another tension arm and I got it right away and now my dual arm monitor stand works BEAUTIFULLY!  I definitely recommend this product to all of my family and friends!!
5,extremely satisfied with the quality of the mount.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This dual monitor stand is not the typical pole with two arms type of stand.  This stand has a large C type clamp that is longer and "bites" more of the desk to provide a sturdy base.  Then I just place each arm on top of the round post with an additional step of tightening a tiny hidden nut if I want to keep the arms from spinning.Then I used the included plates and screws to attach to the back of the monitors using the VESA holes and place on the ends of the arm.  A pull tab has quite a bit of tension and locks the plate to the arm.Then I adjust the tension with the included L shaped hex wrench and I was completed with the installation!The instructions are very simple to follow but the quality of the construction and ease of installation is what sets this dual monitor arm from the rest.
5,Top quality parts easy to put together. It has great range of motion. I would recommend this product to everyone looking for dual monitor stand.
5,This product meets or exceeds form and function. I have bought two sets and they saved me space on my work desk as well as my desk at home.
4,The arms are holding a fairly heavy 32" curved monitor just fine.The pivot bracket at the end of the arm that the VESA mount attaches to needs to be grooved to hold the monitor from tilting down.See my picture... I used a file to scar the washers of the pivot mount to add grip when compressed then re-assembled that mount and loosen/tighten it as needed.This monitor is pretty much fixed and not being moved around regularly so this works just fine for me but if you are pulling your monitor around and tilting it a lot this is probably not the mount for you due to the abrasion that would occur after doing what I did to make it work.At this price for a dual arm mount you cant go wrong.hope that helps.
5,Gorgeous. Feels strong. Took just a few minutes to install.
5,Im a Software Developer and wanted to give some room to my desk I reviewed several options and went for this one.I could not have made a better choice I love the materials the instructions are clear well packaged the movement to reposition  my monitors feel strong.I recommend it 100% to anyone who wants a high quality product
5,This stand feels super sturdy and setting it up was pretty easy. I was worried about the quality due to other reviews for a similar stand at a similar price point but this feels really nice. Just make sure to tighten the joints with the small allen wrench so you get the stiffness you want.
5,First off this monitor stand is not cheap. So if you're looking for a more budget option I'm sure there are solid ones for a little cheaper price point. With that being said however I really love this monitor stand a lot and the build quality is great. The whole thing is made out of a solid metal. The range of motion is exactly what I need and the actual mount for your desk is great. Even on my thin desk it holds up my two 27 in monitors perfectly. There is virtually no type of wiggle once you adjust and tighten everything. I have one vertical and one horizontal monitor and it has held up great so far. Extremely satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality dual monitor stand!
5,I needed to make some space on my desk so replacing the stands on my monitors with arms was a no brainer.That said I had to be very careful as one of my monitors is a 1st generation predator x34 ultra wide monitor (meaning it's heavy). The mantis arms are the only ones I've found that can support the weight of the monitor (and my other monitor which is a standard 27 inch). For that reason alone it's worth the extra price.It's also pretty easy to assemble AND it's easy to swap the monitors out if ever you need to.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Took me less than 30 minutes to install the mount to my desk and set up my monitors. Cable management is a lot easier with this stand and the range of motion is amazing. The installation is super easy and the instructions were really simple too. Easily one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon.
5,This Company nailed it for design functionality and easy assembly! The clamp mechanism is world class and very ideal for a Varidesk.  I have Varidesk laptop and monitor stand combo now but I don't want to have to pay $250 to replace it.  Can't return after 30 days! Went looking for alternatives and all of them have those ugly bottom clamps that take up space and are eye sores.  This product has a superb design and clamps on neatly and easily.  The arms articulate nearly any way you can imagine.  Was simple to assemble and had excellent installation manual! Hats off to this Company! You've won my respect and my recommendations to my friends.  Thanks.Bryan F.Spring Hill TN
5,The product data/pictures for this item painted the picture that this stand offered a heavy duty answer to a large (32” x 2) dual monitor setup problem.  To this end it has amply delivered.  The subtle adjustability of each of its joints allows for easy balancing of movement and sturdiness.  Interchangeability between the included dual screw clamping base and fixed plate mount ensured rigid stability in both configurations and simple migration throughout a recent desk upgrade.  Stands out as one of those ‘better purchases’.Additionally their customer service is top tier.  The one minor fitment issue encountered was resolved post haste and with class.  Full marks.
5,I am a fairly tall person 6' 3" with about even leg and torso length. Makes it really difficult to shop for desks. This stand has a wide range of hight and mothion to make it fit me perfectly. Highly recomended
5,Great product and easy to assemble also the seller left a cute note in the package :) would definitely recommend.
5,I will say this is one of the better desktop monitor stands the only problem is that it will only fasten to monitors that have a four screw hold mount on the back of the monitor I unfortunately have a stand on my monitors and there wasn't any kind of adapter for that type of monitor.  This item was sooooo good I almost contemplated getting new monitors.  Highly recommend if you have the proper connection on your monitor.
4,I enjoy this product very much if you're looking for dual monitors this is a great purchase. Only thing is that don't adjust up or down which I thought they did but still great I was just confused
5,I switched from 3 monitors to 2 and this was the perfect option for me!
5,This is worth the price. Support small businesses they don't cheap out on their parts :)
5,Easy to follow instructions quality material adjustable mount for my glass desktop.I had a concern for the height of the mount as it is not noted in the product description; the middle of the mount in a dual screen configuration of the Mantis can be about 23 inches or 57cm high which worked for me.Recommended.
4,The stand/mount is super easy to set up comes borderline pre assembled.  Love that.  The difficult part comes when you need to adjust things to just the right way that you're needing.  There is a spring mechanism to keep the monitor in place both swivel and on the arm that was very touchy at times and got VERY difficult to tighten after a certain point but isn't necessarily a knock on the product just the reality of it.  Overall really enjoy the stand just had those small issues setting it up.
5,Definitely recommend. Price is reasonable. The quality of the components is there. I like the cable management and how easy it is to move the monitors. The spring capability is nice as well. Set the spring and the monitor will move back to the set location.
5,Great product! As described and they were fast to arrive. Thank you!
5,After some concern of this actually holding the weight of my 32” monitors. Set up was a breeze and took me about 10 minutes or so to set up. I love the tension and individual screws for the arms. Placed my 32” monitors on the arms and there was no tilt at all. Easily able to adjust and get the perfect angle. Love the fact you can move them around and have them separated. Totally recommend.I am using the LG 32” Ultragear monitors
5,I searched a lot before purchasing this item and all I can say is that it met all my expectations and more! Excellent quality and fair price !
4,The stand is very sturdy and is able to hold two 21" monitors with 1 having a webcam on top of it with no issues. The feature I like the most is how you can feed the cables through part of the arm so that way you don't have wires dangling everywhere. The instructions could have been written better which is why I took off one star.
5,Will hold Apple Studio monitors! Love them they do all the angles and adjustments we need.Easy 10 minute install. Looks great and sturdy!
5,Wanted to wait a bit before writing a review. I have had this stand for about a week. It was easy to assemble for myself but then again i do like putting things together. as for quality and performance. Quality it good for the most part everything is metal and a few bits are plastic. most or the plastic parts are aesthetic. its every sturdy and holds up both my 27 inch monitors no problem. You many need to tighten the spring to have it hold where you want it to as the setting out of the box was not able to keep my monitors up in the position i wanted without sagging. Over all I am happy with my purchase as i did buy a different brand before and did not preformed as intended.
5,Great Product! Does exactly what it needed to do kept my monitors up right and were easily adjustable!
5,This mount:-Looks nice/as advertised.-Is packaged nicely with all the tools necessary for installation included.-Is easy to install.-Is easy to adjust tension/height/tilt/etc...-Feels very sturdy even with my cheap 3/4" fiberboard/particleboard desk.I would note that for the full range of adjustment on the arms it requires about 8 inches of room between the back of your desk and the wall.Really haven't found any negatives so far... I'd definitely recommend this mount for anyone looking for a good quality dual monitor mount.
5,This stand meets all of my needs supports dual BenQ 27" monitors with no sagging.  Spring arms move easily and make leveling the monitors side by side simple.
5,There are lots of these on Amazon. I chose this one based on reviews and the the reviewers are right. The tabletop clamp extremely secure. This mount goes together very easily and is very sturdy. The arms are well balanced and hold position after adjustment. Just what I was looking for.
5,This Dual Stand Monitor is FANTASTIC it holds my 27 inches Monitors and the cable management in the arm is really great. However it doesn't fit 2 thick together (But that is not an issue). The base itself is really something great ( I mounted my monitors and I was moving the desk around the room and even the monitors haven't moved it was still in place).It's easy to install and the instructions are very clear.
5,Quality product family owned business. I’ll purchase as many of their products as I can.  Easy to install!!
5,I am legally blind so I need to be able to move the monitors closer and further with ease I didn’t like that I couldn’t move the extensions up and down but I love how it came together I would definitely recommend these
5,I think the headline says it all.  Solid product all the way around.  I absolutely love it!  Would definitely buy again!
5,Not only was it easy to install but over all it feels so solid and reliable.  Will definitely recommend this product to anyone !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Everything about these arms from initial installation to putting up my 2 32” and 27” monitors was a breeze. the quick release brackets made for an easy install and the integrated cable runners in the arms as well as the included velcro made cable management super easy as well. i appreciate the time and thought they put into their product as i can really feel the quality in the arms. if you’re looking for something that looks professional and has all the mobility you could need in monitor arms look no further!
5,Super easy to assemble very sturdy for my 24" monitors. Fit easily on our Ikea desk and are the perfect height. Very satisfied with this order.
5,Very nice product. Fits 32-inch Samsung monitors perfectly. Movability is perfect. Excellent support of the monitors.
4,The only thing I do not like is there is slight movement in the joint of where the screen attaches. The lock is secure but has too much wiggle room.
5,it is very easy to assemble a very stable product and a great customer service from the seller
3,The clamp doesn't truly hole the weight of the monitors unless you're willing to drill a hole in your desk. It is NOT specified that this setup requires a hole in the product description. Also the manual is in the IKEA style that doesn't provide any meaningful information besides pictures. I'm returning the product.Update: after a few modifications it seems like the monitors are held up okay as long as the angle is adjusted. It was still quite challenging to assemble the setup. Will keep you posted after using the stand for a month or two.
5,Initially one of the arms that I received for the product was faulty. After customer service contacted me ( once they learned about my issue) they quickly sent me a new arm that worked great! I appreciate the fact that they worked diligently to correct the problem.
3,I think the arms are fairly quality but they don't move the ways I expected. If you have a desk that is against the wall the monitors have to protrude forward in order to be side by side without a gap. I thought the arms could move up and down at the 'elbow' but that is really just two positions dictated by the spring - high and low. Lastly the mount at the monitors is almost like a knee joint that faces outward. So you cannot turn the monitors to point screen to screen for instance - something that wouldn't be needed but they do need to be able to point somewhat closer to one another to be concave toward the user.Quality and assembly are good - just not as flexible as I would like - and to position them the way I need them the monitors are 1.5' toward the middle of my desk.
5,I love this product. Very easy to assemble. Very sturdy and so functional. Exactly what I wanted. Both arms are very easy to maneuver to the position I need to either stand or sit and work.
5,Love the range of motion. The arms have to support some rather heavy 28 inch Asus monitors so I had to tighten the tilt about as much as I could to get then to stay. My only complaint is that i wish there was more space for the cable management. I use monitors with dual HDMI ports and use both ports to connect to two different laptops. There is not enough room for the power cable and the two display cables.
5,This dual monitor stand is well built and sturdy. Installation was easy. Holds 27 inch samsung curved monitor well. Absolutely 💯 recommend 👌 it. Added bottom table support additionally just to be sure.
5,still standing.
5,Literally nothing I could say bad about this bad boy (these bad boys?). Real clamp holds the table VERY well.. Awesome range of motion supportive easy to install. I'd rate 6 stars if I could
5,This is a great quality dual monitor stand with articulating arms.  The range of position is excellent.  I have 2 32" monitors set up on facing me directly and the other off to the left at a slight angle.  Took less than 20 minutes to assemble and perhaps another 15 minutes to get everything "dialed" in and tightened up.  Highly recommend.
5,The fastest delivery of any other thing that I have purchased. Ordered it on a Sunday night and had it by 2pm the very next day. That was with the free shipping. Very easy to assemble. Clears up a lot of space on the desk. I would highly recommend this mount to anyone who is looking to purchase one. The note on the back of the card that Amy puts into the box is very  nice touch.
5,After a week of using these monitor arms I CAN'T believe I didn't think to do these sooner.It comfortably fits my 32" Samsung Odyssey G7 along with my HP Omen 25" side by side.The option to adjust on the fly is great if someone may need or want to.Would 100% recommend to anyone. The ease and affordability for what you get and the huge amount of desk space you get and just a clean look is easily worth it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just finished setting up my new QUARX top of the line MANTIS dual monitor arm. I'm really excited to have them installed it went really quick and the detailed instructions really got the steps out clearly. They are super quality durable and sturdy and all metal (except for the cable management parts). All said and done here are the Pro's and Con'sPRO's:- Tall pole lifts the arms really high.- Ergonomically designed- Easy to set up- Adjusts in all directions. Forward backward side to side up down.- Worth the price- Hardware Included.CON'sNONE!!!!!
5,Took about 15 minutes to fully set up my two monitors. Instructions are simple and clear the the quality is top notch. Couldn’t recommend these more and it’s a small family run business so it’s the best of both worlds. Thanks Amy!
5,The flexibility the monitor stand provides in positioning both monitors is the most appealing. The entire stand is very high quality I would definitely purchase this again.
5,Does what its supposed to.  Easy to assemble.  Zero complaints.  If I move up to 4 monitors I’ll definitely buy another dual stand from this company.
5,This monitor stand is amazing !! I am an electrical engineer and I needed a monitor stand so I decided to give this unit a try. This unit is very amazing ! I have 2 27" monitors and the range of motions is crazy amazing ! This monitor stand was easy to set up and it is crazy smooth. The stand feels like its doing yoga. You do not need to put so much effort into moving and it moves. I am so happy I BOUGHT it
5,It's a nice stand with quality components but could have had better setup instructions.  I think I'm pleased.  Will update later.I absolutely LOVE this.  I am handicapped and have to move.  This is perfect for me.
5,Mounted two 32 inch  and it feel very smooth and the mount solid and easy to put together. I had a small hickup when installing that I was able to troubleshoot quickly.
5,This was an easy dual monitor stand to setup and is very sturdy.  The range of motion the arms provide allowed me to get the monitors exactly how I wanted them to be.  Would definitely recommend this.
5,This is the second monitor stand that I have ordered from this Supplier.  It arrived on-time and in good shape.  It is a very well-built and strong monitor stand.  The person using it loves the way the arms articulate and adjust to any position they need.  It is not the least expensive model on the market but it is well worth the money to my Corporate users.
5,Great mount great price
5,Very pleased with this product -- sturdy construction easy to install and works great.
5,easy to assemble sturdy and looks good i am very happy i bought this one
5,This is my first ever dual arm mount and I find it to be very sturdy! Its also extremely easy to change positions if you dont like the current setup the clamps on the back of the monitors make it effortless to pop off and move everything around.10/10
5,Great monitor stand! Putting the stand together is fairly easy. As you can see from my photo the stand has endless possibilities in terms of range in motion. I used the grommet clamp for my desk and the stand is extremely sturdy!
5,Works exactly as described. Holding up two 24" monitors on a cheap desk. Makes the desk top much cleaner.
5,ReviewThe monitor stand went up to the height that I was looking for and adjusted very easily the installation only took 6 minutes and I was able to do it myself without any help because they have a special clamping mount all the hardware was included so I didn't have to make a trip to the hardware store thanks Quarx for another great product!
5,Easy to assemble and works as advertised.
5,Sturdy and reliable.
5,Very easy to install. Super clean setup. I'm very satisfied!
5,
5,Works great!
5,This product is sturdy and made from quality material! The arms are easy to move around! Quality buy
5,Great product - easy install - sturdy no issues. Exactly what I was hoping for. Would purchase again. Bought this for my office and one of my direct reports. Will be purchasing for every new employee!
5,it's a very good and steady
5,Does what it says it does. Easy to assemble. Includes tools for assembly and adjustment. Even has a little holder for the adjustment tools built in. Great product. The end.
5,They fit very well had to move my desk out a bit to fit them but oh wellkinda sucks they dont go higher but I still love them
1,19 Jan 2022 UPDATE: The tension on the part that controls vertical tension or the part that determines whether it's facing up/down/straight at me (I keep it straight at me/slightly up as the instructions say not to face it down) has started to give out on its 7th month of use. Will probably have to use the original monitor stand in in another month or so or find a different mount. I cannot recommend as this is very disappointing. The tensioner is giving out on a 27 inch 1440p Lenovo monitor. I use the other arm on a 24 inch monitor that's portrait facing (the tensioner is giving out on that too).For sturdiness and reliability it's been really good for the past 6 months. I do wish there was more rage of motion as my 2nd monitor I need to have it at a certain angle as I have it verticle. the angle is annoying but other than that it does and should do side by side for 2 24inch monitors or one 24inch and one 27 inch im not sure about 2 27 inches but it probably could. I really only bought for its all metal parts and didnt think about range of motion as this is the first dual monitor arm mount/stand that I own
5,Easy to assemble and strong holding.
1,It's hard to adjust the angle of the stand. You have to push it hard to make it to the angle you want. Make sure you have a thick monitor or you will break it just like how it happened to my hp 27 inch new monitor :(
2,I will be keeping this product as it is a good monitor stand at its core. However there is a fatal flaw. The monitor stand height is held in place by a clamp based system. The weight of the stand and your monitors needs to be held up by how much tension you can put on the clamp with the provided Allen keys. I applied enough pressure to bend the thick Allen key while tightening the clamp but the monitor stand will not stay at the hight I need without dropping to the bottom of the stand bar.
5,It is easy to assemble and range of motion/ sturdiness/ durability is great
5,Robusto Fácil de Instalar y Ángulos de Rotación sin Comparación... Recomendado al 100%
5,It's very easy to put together and I can move them wherever I want super easily. Great product!
5,I’ve been using monitor racks like this for years and this is by far the most stable and easy to assemble that I’ve ever used.
5,Easy to put together.
2,Every time I come back into the room one of the monitors has either sunk to table level or is 3-5 inches above the other monitor.  After over a week I am at the point that I have even tried 1/8 - 1/4 turns on the adjustment screws using the supplied tools and I either get a slow rise or a slow sink can not get them to lock in place.  This is probably going to be returned very soon.
5,Holds my monitors very well. Seems very sturdy. Was very easy to set up and assemble. Will update if anything changes.
5,
2,Will not hold 28 inch Sony monitors solidly in place.  If you are using 24 inch or something like that I bet they would be great.  Yes yes yes  I tightened the screws as tight as possible.  These monitors are just big and heavy and arms won't stay solidly in place.  I am returning for a refund.
5,I have a small desk and they work perfectly.
5,Very easy to assemble high-quality materials and with enough height and movement to let me use my sit/stand desk with ease. I love it - it makes work so much easier!
5,Its a really sturdy stand and super easy to assemble I had everything up in minutes.
5,Incredible!
5,Easy to assemble and mount.  Easy to adjust.  Just an overall great product and shipped very quickly.
1,One arm had no tension at all.The other worked but it's really hard to control the vertical position.
5,Great
5,Fácil de instalar
1,I have a 32 inch ultra wide Alienware monitor and the mount doesn't support it. I've tried tightening the bolts but it slouches to the point to where the monitor is facing the desk. Wish I would've known this prior to purchasing.
1,If you use a monitor larger than a 24 inch or move either of the arms out from stand the wobble not the desk the mount.......even and especially when I type. For this kind of money it shouldnt do that. Im sending it back
1,I bought this because of the reviews.  Though it was easy to assemble I could not for the life of my not have my 27" monitors to not flop down.  I tightened all the tension areas per the instructions until my hand hurt tried to researching written instructions with not result.  Pretty disappointed as I was hopeful.  Will be returning product.
1,This product absolutely does not work. I tried to use it with two 27 inch monitors and the arms just couldn’t hold the weight. Also the little flimsy tension screws striped when I tried to tighten it still didn’t hold the monitors and then I could not take the thing apart to get it back in the box to ship it back. So please don’t waste your time or money on this item. P S The only reason I gave this 1 star is because the system don’t allow 0 Stars. I would have given this a  -10 stars if l could have
1,Garbage.  The height adjustment doesn't work- it won't hold a fixed position It's got some sort of gas or air shock and rises to the full height when I let go of it and the tensioners don't work on that particular adjustment.  Plus the so-called 'desk safe' clamp damaged my desk.
1,No idea how well this things works since the instructions were missing…
1,the part that the monitor hangs on started to tilt on one side and then it just completely went loose and the monitor tilted forward at a 45 degree angle making it useless. I'd need a whole new head that the monitor attaches to as i couldn't tighten the bolt it was completely frozen. i'll be sending back don't buy this there's better products on the market with higher quality standards
2,I need the screens... it did not come with the package
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 One if the arms simply does not work. Can't support a light 7 pound monitor... awful. Just flops down whenever I mount it. Customer service is awful as well. Don't buy
1,1 monitor sits an inch lower than the other with no way to fix.
1,The lower arm does not adjust up and down it only rotates.
5,Love the hidden compartment slots under the arms packaged great! Overall solid purchase
5,It is sturdy and very easy to install! So much room on my desk now!
5,I liked how the arms freed up space on my desk and the price was exceptional too.  On one monitor (ViewSonic) it only took a couple of minutes however the other monitor (Sceptre) had a stand bracket on the back which stuck out at least 1/2 inch.  We had to remove the back off of the monitor in order to remove the bracket.  Once that was done it went on just as quick as the first monitor.I would recommend this product.  It is exactly as described and sturdier than I expected.  Thank you for making a quality product.  It was well worth it.
5,Was looking for a pair of monitor arms for a while. Did a bunch of research and these seemed like they will get the job done right. I can't begin to explain how QUARX has nailed this! I'm so excited with my new FLYTE model monitor arms. The arms are really great quality and ALL metal. Setup was a breeze I got it done all by myself there is a detailed step by step manual showing how to get it setup right.One thing to make sure while setting it up - In order to get the arms to be at the right height there is a special ArmAdjust feature and you need to take care to adjust it correctly to get the desired height and position (can always be adjusted later if needed).All said and done THANK YOU QUARX TEAM FOR A SUPERB PRODUCT!!!!
5,AMAZING Dual monitor mount!I really love my new set of QUARX dual monitor arms. They came in a modern sleek packaging. It took no time at all to get it up and running the instructions said it all. The tension spring works really nice. It lets me decide at what height I want to keep the monitor mount stand positioned. I got help from the QUARX CS rep to get the positioning correctly done.Summary: I'm really happy with my purchase of the FLYTE double monitor mount + Great Customer Service!
5,I used it for one monitor that was 35 inches and the second one was 27 inches and it worked perfectly I have a vesa plate of 75 x 75mm diamond shaped and it still worked because I was able to rotate the arms. Also the height is amazing cause I sometimes like to use it while standing and it comes up all the way to my full height.
5,This dual monitor mount really saves me from back pains I am a different person since I purchased this monitor stand and the amazing thing is that it adjusts very easily and doesn't tilt and goes up to a very high position worked for my vesa mount 100 x 100.
5,I recently switched my desk to a standing desk and also got a dual monitor stand to save some desk space but it wasn't very versatile as far as how I can adjust and move the monitors.  My biggest problem with my previous monitor stand was that while it can it move side to side and forward and backwards they couldn't move up and down.  When I went to my friend's house few weeks ago I saw him using dual monitor stand which was this model and I was so impressed with its infinite adjustable position with both monitors I decided to buy it for myself to replace my previous dual monitor stand.I have two 24" monitors and they worked perfectly with this stand.  The tension was perfect where I can easily adjust and move the arm and it stayed where I left them without sagging or anything until I was ready to adjust and move them again.I constantly have to adjust and move the monitors and its arms because I stand and sit while working through out the day using the stand up desk and I also have a need to turn the monitor to the side to show it to my family what's on the screen.  This dual monitor stand was able to provide all difference maneuver for both of my monitors any way I wanted.It also looks great because it takes up very little space on the desk not to mention it frees up the entire desk space under the monitors.  5 out of 5 stars.  I highly recommend this professional dual monitor stand for ultimate flexibility and range of motions!
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy this 2-monitor stand was when I unboxed it.  I opted for the direct mount (see photo) drilling one 3/8" hole in the table surface. Super easy from there. A single long hex screw holds the entire mount in place on the desk surface (or you can use the clamp they provide in the box but the lip on the back of my desk wasn't large enough for that).  Using hex screws you can tighten up the articulating arms and make is so that things don't move around more than you want them to but still loose enough to adjust as needed.  You can tighten as much as you need to hold in place.  Good cable management options.  Very pleased with this set-up!  Thank you!
4,The standard is nice and heavy.  good quality overall.the negative is because my deck and mointor setup.That with 24" duel monitor  the monitor won't setup side by side... there is a 3" gap.  especially your deck is push against the wall.  while it is not ideal  I got use to it after a day...overall it is a nice product.
5,I really like this product. Assembly takes about 5 mins to complete and it is solid built. Range of each arm is fantastic very easy to move left and right or tilt monitor up and down. There is one minor flaw which is it is a little bit difficult to move the arm up and down. It can be done but not as easy as moving it left and right. Otherwise very satisfy with this product!
5,Love it! It’s study & easy to maneuver if needed. Recommend
5,I loved this product it took like 20 mins to assemble and that's because I had to assemble an adapter for one of my monitors to hook up to VESA. Without that it would have been done in 10 minutes maximum. There is an excellent range of motion. I literally cannot say how much I love this.
5,Super easy to assemble and has excellent range of motion.
5,No complaints. Work great! Support my 2x32" monitors.
5,Good product
5,I bought this for her office and it did the job it's supposed to do. I'm planning on getting her a chair as well. Ssshhhh! Don't say anything. LoL.  Thank you.
5,This monitor stand is built well and easily adjustable. The wide top is great for clamping onto desks with non-square edges: mine has an angled trim that means the top surface is about 3/4" in from the edge of the bottom and it is solid as a rock. I ended up having to shift it several times to get the positioning right with my setup and it was easy to do so.Highly recommended.
5,Each screen can be adjusted pretty far. It's super easy to assemble and I was able to do it alone for my kids schooling. It's very sturdy and can hold 2 monitors. It's heavy duty and the metal seems pretty thick. It's slightly heavy but if it was super light it wouldn't be thick and would bend or break easy where this is thicker and doesn't break or bend easy
4,This dual monitor stand seems to work fine but there were no instructions included and none available anywhere online. I have so many nuts and bolts left over that I am a little scared
5,Solid metal is a major plus.Being able to make a small hole in a desk to mount with no chnage of it falling over is great.This is being used for a gaming monitor and a drawing tablet monitor which allows me to angle as I need for drawing and return to a stand distance away when not drawing. Over all a extremely well made product.
5,Great product just wished one of them could go higher (Directly above the other )
5,Very easy to assemble. The vesa 100 snaps right on no issues. Cable management is perfect no cables shown. Make sure you tighten all the screws so it's extra tight.I'm using this with two 27in Asus monitors.
5,This is a quality item and is very easy to put together. Definitely worth the buy!
5,I am using two 27" 4k monitors that weight 18.5 lbs each. It was difficult to find monitor arms that could support this weight (most arms seem to cap out around 17.5 lbs). This stand holds the monitors steady and the joints can all be locked in place to prevent accidental displacement. The springs are all adjustable as well. It has only been a few days so far but I am quite happy with this stand.
5,The best part of their customer service was that I did not need any.  It took me maybe 45 minutes to meticulously unpack; study the instructions; assemble the unit; install the monitors and make some final adjustments.  Thus far it seems to be very high quality and exceeds my expectations.  Good value for the money even though I cannot imagine what more I could get for a more expensive unit.  If it doesn’t break or implode in the next few months I would have to rate this as my best value investment from Amazon for 2021.  Very happy to actually receive what I paid for.  Wishing this company well and appreciate the personalized note included in the packaging.
5,I purchased this for my 27inch acer predators (17lbs) caused two other less expensive mounts to sag.This model had such great reviews I decided to Invest. 3 weeks in use and holding strong!  Articulation is smooth and the monitors don't move even a mm once they are set in the desired location.Good range motion that requires zero effort to adjust.Install is very simple and straightforward. No instructions needed.The Solid build quality is terrific and the cable management is a nice added bonus.Totally worth the price!
5,Very solid great packaging and very easy to assemble.  100% recommend!
5,This dual monitor stand is amazing. At first I was skeptical that my BenQ 31.5" won't hold up since it is 17lbs but it did. I had to adjust the bolt and tighten it which was the hardest part of the set up but overall my monitor now does not tilt forward which was my biggest issue for the last stand I bought.PS: The only small issue I had was one of the bolts for the (arm to swing less or more) base broke when I was tightening it now it's stuck and I can't screw it out with the allen wrench.. If possible I might need a new base and not tighten the arm swing too much. So do not tighten the swing arm bolts excessively.
5,If you’re looking for dual arms for your monitors… don’t make a mistake buying the high dollar brands (Ergotron vari-desk etc.). These are just as sturdy and easier setup without the hassle of the setup or other brands.
5,muy buen producto llego muy bien.
5,I'm very happy with this monitor arm set. It's sturdy and was very simple to put together. I couldn't find this quality at a better price point.
5,Easy setup and I just got it today so I will update after a month. I spent more time trying to get my bracket off so I could mount them.  It does give me my desk back which is cool.
5,This product is exectly what I've needed and I love it. The service was also great. Arrived fast.
5,Very happy with this purchase. I've tried other brands prior to selecting QUARX and the monitor arms are extremely sturdy stable and the entire setup is so much faster than with other brands I've tried. I highly recommend this product.This product seemed to have been designed with the customer in mind!!! It does everything I want it to do.Update: 12/04/2021While I was attempting to adjust the tilt angle on 1 arm I inadvertently over tightened and stripped the screw (operator error). The day prior to Thanksgiving I reached out to the seller via their seller’s page and on Thanksgiving Day I received an email requesting my order number and demographics.Once I sent them the information they had requested the following Monday (11/29/2021) they emailed my the FedEx tracking #.  A couple of days later I received the new part and with great joy my QUARX Dual Monitor Arms are exceeding all my expectations.The product the customer service and the attention to detail of QUARX is top notch.You’ll be happy with the purchase!Nick
5,I have two Dell S3222HN 32-inch Curved Monitors. I was worried because this monitor weight's ‎20.7 pounds. The stand looks great and works really good. I might end up purchasing this stand for home too!
5,Mounting is strong and functional. If the D racket is little bong and more screw holes would be great so that it will fit for wider tables. Mounting is great and loved it.
5,I was kind of worried about some reviews about it but I still bought the product to my surprise it was better than I thought great quality and easy install I will update my review if anything else changes..
5,I bought this dual monitor arm for an office setup I am designing for an RV. I needed the style that can clamp to the surface but needed one that is low profile from the underside. This one fits the bill and is super stout! So glad I went with this one.For the setup I'm designing I'm running two laptops and each has a monitor extension via USB-C. The two monitors attached to the arms are only 16" monitors but I have NO doubt that you could easily configure any two monitors together that you wanted (so long as they aren't outdated and weigh a ton)). The beauty of these arms are the tension adjustments. They arrive with really high tension for bigger monitors. Once I dialed down the tension to accommodate the lesser weight of my monitors the arms will simply glide and adjust (and stay) anywhere you want them.This thing is impressive and the handwritten note from the owner upon delivery was a nice touch. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
5,After reading multiple reviews decided on this monitor mount.  When it arrived I was concerned it would be difficult to install.  I had it installed and using it in less than 30 minutes.  Love the range of motion of this mount.  Able to have 2 laptops on my desk because the mount has freed up so much space.  Definitely would recommend.Update to review:  The customer service is AWESOME.  I had an issue with the tilt mechanism on one monitor arm.  I sent an email to the company they responded right away.  They sent a part out immediately I replaced the part and viola!  all was good.  Amy even followed up to make sure everything was good with the new part.  Definitely would recommend working with this company.
5,Product was easy to assemble and install. Works great.
5,I purchased the 32 inch dual monitor arm and mount for an electrical rising desk.  The instructions and assembly were very easy and I was able to quickly get it secured and set up.  It is light weight but sturdy and the range in motion is excellent for two monitors.  Most important my wife is very happy that she can now adjust both of her monitors and work comfortably.  Before the installation of the arm and mount the set up was not ernonimically correct. The customer service from the seller is excellent as well. A card from QUARX with contact info for assistance and ties to secure cords were included which was a nice surprise.  I recommend this product for anyone looking for dual monitor arm and mount.
5,Assembly was a breeze and now I have a surprisingly sturdy stand for my monitors. There's even an out of sight place to store the included hex keys so they're never far away if you have everything tightened down want to make adjustments on the fly. The base is nice and wide so it will clamp securely to your desk without damaging it. If your desk is right up against the wall it'll take some tweaking to get your monitors where you want them but for the convenience and desk space I cleared up I'd do it again in a heart beat.
5,These two monitors aren't the lightest thing in the world and I've had major sag issues with other brands of arms. These arms easily support the 32" monitors and there's no bounce of the monitors when I'm typing and standing. Anyone with a standing desk will know what I'm talking about when your monitor giggles up and down as you type quickly this stand doesn't do that for me. I should've picked this up a long time ago.
5,This mount is amazing. It adjusts pretty much any way you need it to. It has an amazing range of motion. Super easy to setup and use. Very sturdy and holds my 21" monitors with ease. Amazing price and I love the rounded look because it's less likely to cause injuries and get more comments and likes then my not rounded set
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he is so pleased with how it works and moves .
5,This opened up so much space on my desk easy to put together it took about 30 minutes. The range of motion is amazing very smooth. I'm very happy with this and you will be too.
5,For a dual monitor setup this is the one.That’s it period. I’ve tried so many “affordable and sturdy” stands and they either sag or don’t have enough range. This one does it all. I hardly ever write reviews I just had to with this one. It’s so easy to set up too I barely needed that allen wrench. So quick.Don’t waste ur time (literally) on other products.
5,I ordered 2 sets of these monitor arms for my home office upgrade.These monitor arms hold my monitors and graphics tablet. With easy access to grab and pull graphics tablet close to draw on.Easy to adjust well built and sturdy. I can tell these will last me years.The built in cable management was a nice surprise.The end result really cleaned up the my desks area by freeing up a lot of space under the monitors.A must have for your next office upgrade.
5,Its great strong got a big 32 and a 24 on it. Goes left right up n down great. You can adjust the weight ratio with the hex wrench it comes with for bigger or smaller screens. Only didnt like that it didnt move down farter than it did but it works great though.
5,I like compatible it was with my varidesk. Other mounts I had rearrange my varidesk moving parts but this mount made it easier to not remove anything. Easy to assemble and sturdy product.
5,Worth purchasing it and it is very steady. I wish they sell it in different colors like White and Stainless Steel to match the other accessories.
5,Awesome product. If your on the fence about it just get it . You will not be disappointed .
5,I love these stands. Before my monitor stands took up so much space barely moved and were overall just ugly when they sat on my desk. I decided to just go for it and buy this monitor stand in the hopes that maybe it'd work well. I was surprised these things are awesome. It's pretty easy you just slide base on tighten it slide the first 2 arms into the base and slide the other 2 arms connect the monitors tighten and adjust it and they just stay there without an issue! also contains velcro strips to secure wires and there's a wire cabinet in one of the arms but I couldn't figure out how to take it off I feel like I'll break it. Apart from that solid and easy to understand took like 10 minutes to set up. Very awesome product and it looks super sleek on my desk saved so much room. I have two 27" dell monitors and it fits them perfectly :)
5,Great product. Took no time at all to install with 2 monitors. Very happy with this product.
5,Easy to setup. Easiest I have ever used. Packing was simple to open and get out of box. Thank you AMY - Zach
5,The ease of assembly couldn’t be better. The arms are very sturdy and the range of motion perfect.
5,Installing my monitors was a piece of cake. These are well made and seller has excellent communication
5,Overall great product! Sturdy and well built. They hold my monitor arms without a hitch. Just careful not to loose the set screws as there are no replacements!
5,This is a very good mountPut two 32" wide screens on it and very nice
5,The stand went together easily. It holds a pretty heavy 32 inch LG monitor and 28" Asus monitor right where I want them. It's easy to move the monitors around. The springs are good and strong if you tighten them up. You'll be surprised how much effort it take to move them. Be sure to snug down the small allen head screws on the back of the VESA mounting plates. There are (2) of them on each plate.  If you don't your monitors will be really wobbly in the vertical / horizontal screen axis. Don't crank it down because you may strip the screw. It felt like it may be easy to strip so proceed with attention. ​The cable management is similar to other monitor arms.  As long as your cables are long enough to route the way you want them and make it to the computer you'll be good to go.My main criticism is with the method of adjusting the horizontal / vertical axis of the monitor once it is mounted to the arm. It is very easy to change the axis however you want it.  I think that is a good feature but there is no way to secure the monitor's horizontal axis should you want to. What happens is I sometimes find myself having to level a monitor because I touched it in some way.  It does not take a lot of effort to tilt it. I use my monitors in the normal horizontal position. It's an annoyance but not a deal breaker for me. All and all I still give this 5 stars.
5,The package it came in was great there was a hand written thank you letter everything came with great instructions and was very easy to understand and assemble. It looks awesome im really satisfied with the product I definitely recommend.
5,Would like to start this review out by saying WOW! I am very satisfied with the purchase the assembly was straight forward and honestly it was so easy it made you wonder if it was going to hold and it is with no problem. Very sturdy looked at a lot of monitor stands and decided to go with this one and everything holds together very well. Non of the materials with wobbly as some other monitor stands and it helps free up a lot of space. All of the cords hide away very nicely (though you see two cords hanging it is the power cables to the monitor waiting on a power strip to put behind). It is a small family owned business so they definitely spent their time with care making this product to ensure it’s quality. Would highly recommend the purchase to everyone looking for a nice quality dual monitor stand!
4,I used this to mount two 32” monitors didn’t like the way the monitor Mount attached to the monitor too much play
5,Added to my standing desk. It allowed me to put two 27” monitors side by side with them angled in.It also added some extra distance and pulled the monitors further away from me (you could reverse to bring closer if desired)
5,This dual monitor mount is very well built.I have 2 27" monitors attached and at first the big allen on the swivel head was slightly loose for the tension and allowed the monitor to angle down. I tightened it up and it is now extremely tight and allows for precise angles and movements for setup.Everything is made out of metal minus the cable covers and the whole mechanism from table clamp to attachment point was super easy to put together. The arms are very beefy along with the adjustable tension this product is a solid 5/5
5,This double monitor arm is strong easy to assemble and a great value. Holds my 2 32" monitors with room to spare.
5,Extremely well made professional stand with an extra wide base. Underestimated just how much space having one of these will give your desktop.
5,Easy to install looks great.  Gives me so much more desk workspace.
5,Great high quality mounts. No complaints
5,I’ve tried several stands this year and I have to say this is the best one I have tried. First I like that the clamp that attaches to the desk isn’t too big. It can be adapted to fit a thick desk which I’m guessing is convenient if you have a thicker desk. For me I have mine installed on a short shelf (maybe 4 inches) above my desk. The clamp being small meant I could keep my current shelf instead of having to get 2 smaller shelves. The arms were easy to move to the position I wanted to have them. Assembly was incredibly easy. The aspect I like most about this stand is that piece holding the arms is level. The other mounts I have tried have the arms attach at different heights on the main post which made it difficult for me to get my monitors to be level with each other. I could get them close but they’d consistently find their way out of alignment which I found frustrating. I’d get distracted thinking that if I just fiddled with it a little more I could get them the way that I wanted and before long I had wasted another 30 minutes. I hope you find it as easy to setup and use as I did.
5,BEST STAND!!!! LOVE IT!!
5,Bon support pour 2 moniteurs 32"bon et efficace pour le travail.
5,it took me a while to find a working dual monitor stand that can handle the weight of my 32 inch curved monitor. 10/10 purchase. 10/10 product.
5,Very sturdy..holds my two 32" monitors with ease!  Gives me a ton more room on my desk for other things.  Took really no effort to put it together you should be finished in about 15 minutes and that includes attaching the monitors.
4,Only issue is the set screws for locking the arms in place are of low quality and strip out before they lock the arms in place.
5,Great solution when working on a small work space .
4,Fairly easy to assemble instruction book could have used some verbiage in it otherwise doable!Motion is good however I think this may be on me but I think I tightened the screws a little too much however I do not have any of the drifting or sagging issues from other reviews whatsoever!This easily supports both my monitors with no sign of droopage.An excellent find and a steal for it's price!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Buy it or ur hair will fall offTomorrow. U have been warned.
5,Very well built and easy to install and adjust.
5,I have a 32 and 27" 4k monitor mounted on the stand; each of which I can have oriented vertically or horizontally depending on my need.  The stand is easy to assemble sturdy and of high quality - well worth the money.
5,i little expensive but wanted to buy something that last. these guys thought about everything. you won’t regret it
5,Works as described. Very robust.
5,Super bon service à clientèle et produit. Rai robuste bien fait wow
5,I purchased the dual arm product about three weeks ago. It was very easy to setup and works well to position the monitors into place as you need. I'm using it for 2x 24 inch monitors but it works for bigger monitors as well. The tension is adjustable if you have bigger monitors that weigh more. I'm very happy with the product and it looks good on my new desk too.
5,Solid and functional well made.
5,Holds my 2 screen perfectly and is sturdy.
5,Very well made and easy to assemble. We used the grommet style mount and it provides a solid support for the arms. We would buy from this vendor again and recommend it to others.
5,Everything about the product is perfect no complaints what so ever!
5,So overall the arm is really good I only have one real complaint and that is the right arm is really stiff and is really hard to micromanage and when I try to move it it moves the entire thing but overall really good. I would recommend this product.
