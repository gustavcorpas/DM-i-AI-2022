4,It glows in the dark very well! Also helps from sliding out of my hand. I also like that I could tie it to something so I don’t lose it all of the time. The only flaw is it doesn’t fit very well on the remote it is very loose and I feel like it could fall off.
5,My original remote for my tv broke and would not work. So I heard I could just replace it and when I looked into amazon there it was. It was not expensive and as soon as I took it out of the plastic it worked right away. Didn't have to enter any codes or pair it up. It works great and I would recommend it.
5,Our Roku Tv's remote had been dropped so many times that the battery cover would not stay on. I couldn't find just the cover to purchase. I found this cover...it protects the whole remote & holds the battery cover in place. Great purchase!
4,Too big for remote so it’s floppy. Otherwise pretty cool
5,The back to our remote kept falling off and this holds it together but also makes it extremely easy to find the remote when it gets lost
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             the remote covering is cute however not as bright as the image. it does glow in the dark but remember to hold it near light first . it’s a little loose but it does help when looking for the remote. lol if you have a roku remote you know it has legs and tends to walk away . but overall not bad 7/10
5,This remote cover is decent. It serves its purpose but is slightly big for the remote. I put an unrolled cotton ball in the bottom and it fits great now. It barely glows but it's bright enough that I can find it in the dark.
4,Doesn't glow but I can easily find my remote with this color!
4,Fits good but needs a strong light to make the glow work
4,I can find the remote and it doesn’t slip out of my handBut I’m not sure how long the cover will last at the section at the volume controls on the side
4,I really like this case but it is a little loose but for the price I am not really complaining  that loudly.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Fits my remote like a glove and it makes it a lot easier to find the remote but the only flaw it has or at least the one I got it doesn't glow which is a bummer but it is still easy to find.
4,Working great.
5,They glow and are inexpensive way to help with locating yvremote
5,Cute little cover my mom loves the color green so she loves it.
5,I love this controller. It glows in the dark.
5,Fit perfectly no longer searching for the remote constantly. Only thing is it doesn’t seem to glow
5,This is just what I wanted for our remote. Love the light purple color and it makes it  so much easier to find the remote. It is not incredibly glow in the dark to where you could find the remote in the dark but there is a very faint glow to it if you look really close. It has a good texture that makes gripping the remote easier as well. And you can't beat the price.
5,Easy to find in the middle of the night
5,I love that it fits perfectly not to lose just right on my remote control
5,It's great on my remote and makes it easier to hold supper soft. I love the color it makes it easy to find if I drop it and it glows a bit at night. Shipping was fast.
4,I bought this so my youngest stops taking the back off and takes batteries out. This makes it a little more difficult to do. Since it is not really a snug fit he can still take it off and do it just takes a little longer.
5,Excelente
4,This is misleading cause it definitely does not glow. Not even a little bit. I will keep it for protection from dropping my remote.
3,The cover serves the purpose for me as in distinguishing between my TV remote and adjustable bed remote. I tell the difference by the feel when I'm groping in the dark.  Can't do it by sight because it does not glow. My main peeve is that it feels very loose on the control. Thought they would fit snuggly like a thin second skin over the control. Got the lavender which is lavender not purplish at all.
5,Exactly what I ordered
5,I have only seen it glow in the dark maybe twice. But its good for you if your like me always dropping your remote control. You don't have to worry about your batteries coming out after dropping it. Its convenient.
5,The colors are cool
5,I've lost track of the amount of remotes we've lost over the years from my small son (who is now 9) knocking the remote off the couch and breaking it beyond repair.Since everything in life has gone up in price and we recently had to purchase the more expensive voice recognition remote I was looking for ways to keep our precious remote safe. I have no idea why I didn't think to research this years ago!While the night fluorescence is a cool idea we've never used it. The remote cover basically makes it easy to grab and hold plus most importantly cushion a fall.Worth it.
3,I only bought this because it said it glow in the dark and I am always losing my remote but it doesn’t actually glow and the case is pretty loose.
4,Over all this product is as expected. However my TCL remote is rounded on the sides toward the back of the remote. So the case is gapping where the volume buttons are on the side. It's not as good as my other Roku cover which is also designed for the square body style remote.
5,Love it
3,I lose the remote a lot. It falls down between the cushions and under the couch. I wanted a simple feature.. IT MUST GLOW IN THE DARK! That way i can look under the couch and if nothing is glowing then we look elsewhere. I held this under my high intensity LED commercial kitchen lights for 5 minutes and took it into the bathroom and cut off the light. Its so faint.. I mean technically yes but NOTHING like the pictures! It would have to be COMPLETELY PITCH BLACK and none of us keep our living rooms that dark. I could have gotten one for less. Its only $6 but just sick sellers lying to us about products. Its also not NEARLY as bright in daylight as the pictures show. As a photographer myself... I find it ironic that the photographers Amazon products use can't use enough common sense to place a white product on a dark background (white product on white background = solid white picture) but they can alter and falsely represent a $6 remote?  Do better.UPDATE: Its been overcast lately. On a bright sunny day I left it under some grow lights and in THAT situation YES it does glow in the dark and not that bad honestly. The problem is this is an indoor item. It really shouldn't have to be left under THIS MUCH LIGHT to make it glow. And no its not nearly as bright as the pics by any stretch of the imagination. But Ive dropped the remote at least a dozen times since my initial review and it works for protecting it from drops.
5,Nice!! Love it helps me find remote
4,Glows bright. remote fits but not snug. sort of a sloppy fit. gel like rubber.Made in China so probably toxic as hell.
3,I don't know that the item description is completely accurate. My remote was listed but the cover I got didn't exactly match the shape of my remote. Even though the side buttons don't exactly measure up it still does its job. I only bought this cause the back broke on my remote and this holds the back on and keeps the batteries in.
5,Nothing it cool
5,We kept losing our remotes and so I purchased this case and we now can found it always!!
5,Works great and does put out a lite glow
3,While the concept is great the fit isn’t. Of course we just deal with it but it could definitely be more form fitting!
3,It’s hardly what i would consider glow in the dark. but it does protect TCL roku remotes. this product fit two very similar remotes for the same TV wildly different so don’t expect a snug fit.
4,Good cover however it does not glow in the dark.Ordered the blue.
5,This is perfect. Now when the remote hits the floor the back and batterries don't go flying all over the place. This lil thing is genius. Easy to install and works great. Nothing is in your way
4,I like having a sleeve to put the remote from the play room in so the kids are more detoured from taking the batteries out. It also helps absorb the shock from being dropped. Also the color is easier to see than just a black remote when it is miss placed. My only complaint is that it's about a quarter inch TOO BIG for the remote it's not a nice snug fit I was hoping for.
3,It fits my roku remote for the most part. I just wanted it for a bumper for when the remote falls off the couch and hits the tile floor. It doesn't glow in the dark. I didn't purchase for the glow but it would've been nice if it had worked. It was a better price than other similar products.
5,I love it! For some reason I feel like it’s a lot easy to find my remote since I got it lol definitely worth it
3,Easy to use cover for a Roku remote doesn’t really glow in the dark. Still cute
3,It’s a case never see it glow and it’s a bit loose for my small basic roku remote but it stays on and keeps my batteries inside since I lost the backing to my control so it works in that manner.
3,Doesn’t fit as snug as I had hoped. It could actually stand to be a little thinner rubber and you could stretch it to fit tighter. I’m not throwing it across the room so I don’t need that much protection. I was honestly just looking for an inexpensive way to keep the battery cover secure.
5,This fits snugly on the remote it just didn't fit the remote in my room (which is what I ordered it for) but it fit another tv control
5,Just what the kids need to keep up with the remotes
4,It fits perfectly the only thing is I haven't noticed it glow in the dark. But that doesn't bother me at all
5,My kids end up playing with the remote covers so this is actually the 3rd time buying one and this one I'm going to be guarding a lot more since it's my favorite color and glows in the dark to easily find it at night.
5,Good
4,I like the case it keeps the remote from sliding but it doesn't glow and it's a little big for the remote. It is worth the price.
4,Fits good but doesnt glow much
5,El color es bastante brillante y el material es de calidad protege bastante
4,Bought a second remote and a second case in a different color. Now one remote is for my 5 year old and the other doesn't get dropped or buttons broken as easy because it's put up just for adults. Wonderful case for roku remote
5,Packaged well easy to use and glows in the dark
3,other than not glowing at all the “lilac glow” remote cover fits comfortably on the controller and works well. i just wish it would glow in the dark like it says in the description for our movie and late nights.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The case fits perfectly on my new remote
5,Someone knew we were losing this remote all the time...great buy!
3,Too loose for remote.
3,The remote is perfect. Hence the 5 stars. However the cover is not tight and had to be removed because is moves while using it.
3,I must have a really old Roku cause this case doesn't fit the remote well. Also it does not glow in the dark hardly at all.
3,some heats flimsy and not very tight on the remote
3,Cover works okay but it is very large on the remote. There are large areas of gapping around the front of the case. Will make due as it's not worth the hassle to return but would not order again.
3,This cover is nice it helps us keep up with this tiny roku remote. But please note if you're expecting glow in the dark it doesn't glow. I ordered it in teal.
3,Simple product not my favorite fit like my other one where the whole thing was covered. It does NOT glow under any circumstance and it’s a very light purple
3,I bought this specifically for the glow in the dark. I had to buy another one because mine stated it glowed and it didn’t. I would just like a refund for my first one.
3,He likes to drop the remote 100x a week … this saves my remote. Good purchase but doesn’t glow in the dark like it says. Points deducted. Overall good buy - husband approved.
4,Great product. Helps you find the remote easily especially in the dark! Easier to hold on to as well. Slightly too big for my model but still able to use it.
3,Became loose and falls off. Can't change channel if it's on.
4,It’s a sturdy case and fits nicely but you can barely see it in the dark
5,Excelente!!! Me encanto!!
5,Perfect for finding the remote and it glows in the dark. So cute and nice quay
5,Everyone kept dropping remote so bought this and it worked out great. Fit perfectly. Remote hasn’t broke so it’s doing it’s job.
5,I lost my remote therefore I bought the cover the glow-in-the-dark of course in the event that I lost this new remote. I am extremely happy with my purchase if I had additional remotes I would definitely purchase them again.
4,One problem I had with my roku remote was it sliding out of my hand and off of the side of my bed ALOT! I got this to help bulk it up a little and help grip the remote. That it does flawlessly.. however the “glow” aspect of this remote cover lacks.. it is just a light glow and doesn’t hold charge for very long. This is a wonderful product and would buy again if the need arises!
3,Bulky over remote doesn’t glow in the dark.
4,I purchased this item to be able to find my remote control a little bit easier. It definitely did the job when it came to that but the fit was not perfect. The cover was a little bit loose and floppy.
5,Glow in the dark helps me find the remote in the bed. Cool idea.
4,Easy to place on remote. Fit not perfect but after rereading the listing its because it's meant to fit multiple styles of remote. For my remote the cover is a little long but doesn't slipslide or come off. Glow factor doesnt really work but the color is nice. Not recommended for someone that will play with case since the temptation is real.
4,Great cover easy to put on & easy to find the remote however it does not glow in the dark.
5,I've purchased a few covers over the years and haven't been impressed. We've just gotten used to having to rearrange the remote and cover every time we used it along with dealing with constant rips. This cover actually fits my remote! No more remote  slipping around inside the case! Also this cover seems more durable and not as thin. My one and only complaint (which is easily remidied) is that it didn't come with a string/wristband. I like this one enough that I just ordered more to fit our other remotes!
3,So far it isn't glowing
5,This silicone cover helps to easily grasp the small remote. It is less likely to slip out of your hand. Also easier to find in the dark.
3,I bought for my daughters room hoping it would help find her remote easier. Description said the purple one glows but it doesn’t. That’s the only thing I didn’t like. Otherwise would have been a great product.
3,It is easy to use but it DOSE NOT Glow in the dark..
5,Easy to use with it on. Not too pricey for the product and overall I think it’s worth it. I would recommend
3,Thought it would fit more snug.
3,Feels floppy despite being right for my remote.
4,Fits great on my Roku remote the backside of the cover does not glow only the siding visible on the front glows I thought the entire case would glow otherwise it’s perfect.
3,Doesn’t really fit so it’s kind of loose but the product is good.
3,Is too big it fits loose
5,This is the second time I’ve ordered and they are great.  Only reason for getting another is because my dog chewed if right off the remote.  At least it saved the remote from the dog and from busting open when it constantly gets knocked off the arm of the couch.
4,Doesn't glow in the dark at all.  You have to charge it in the bright light like a LED light. They should put that in the instructions
5,I like the feel.  I like that it doesn't slip off my lap or under cushions.  I like that it is easy to find in a world full of little black plastic things.
3,I might try the boiling method to see if I can shrink this thing! Doesn't really glow. Put mine in the bowl type lamp (like the standing kind) for a few hours once. Barely glowed for about 30 min. Otherwise it helps me from breaking my remote which I drop on a daily basis. So there's that!
5,The back of this thing WOULD NOT STAY ON! We was worried we would have to end up tapping the back on! It fell off just picking it up! Then I came across the covers on Amazon!!!! Heaven sent!!!!!! And the fact it glows in the dark! Bonus!!!
3,I got the lilac cover. It fits well and is soft but it doesn't glow at all when the description says it should
5,Love it. Worth the cost. Easy to find remote. Will buy again
3,It’s very nice and has a bit of glow in the dark but it is super loose. It also blocks the infrared. The hole is too small compared to the remote.
3,Basic remote case. Fit my roku remote well. Does not glow in the dark. I ordered 3 different colors and none of them glow in the dark. Just fyi.
3,....but does not glow in the dark at all. Kind of redundant because that's the reason I bought it. Adds some protection but other than that....nothing else cool about it.
3,It fits the remote well but it doesn’t glow super bright hardly at all actually but the remote blended in with our dark couch so it was nice to be able to see it- even though it doesn’t glow.
3,i got purple and it doesn’t glow in the dark :( it does help me find it better because of the bright color though!
3,I thought it would fit. It a tad bit too big and have a hard time getting it to glow. Have to sit it right near a light bulb but I still use this it's easier to find in the light of the TV when I lose the remote
3,Very flimsy
3,Not for the right Roku remote control
4,Works ok. Only negative I have is that its not a super snug fit which is the purpose to keep shock absorb from damaging the remote. Other than that it is bright and easy to charge the glow in the dark.
4,Fits great.
5,My remote is black and these help keep the remote visible.
2,If you’re buying this cover for the glowing feature then  save your money. Is impossible to find in a dark room. If placed under a bright light it glows for about 30 seconds. I bought it so I can easily find my remote in the dark….but  It doesn’t glow.
5,So I bought it because my kid kept dropping the remote. I figured I would buy something bright so maybe it would make finding the remote easier. But although the fit is loose. Two things happened. The remote gets lost a lot less because it doesn't fall in to the couch anymore and two it's much easier to spot. So although I bought it for protection which it does although it fits a bit loose the best part is not losing the remote.
3,Easy to put on the remote but it doesn't fit snuggly. It's a little loose but keeps my kid's dirty fingerprints off of it. It also doesn't glow in the dark like I thought it would based on the pictures. It was cheap and works for what it is but I may choose differently in the future.
3,It’s cute but it doesn’t glow and the quality is weird
3,This cover fits the roku replacement remote I bought from Amazon but it is not a perfect fit. The fit is sloppy and not snug. All the openings for the controls are properly placed but not precise. The opening for the signal is large and not shaped to the remote.Will this work? Yes.  Because of the sloppy fit not sure we will use it long term.  A toddler will have no problem removing the cover.
3,It's a little big.  I think it interferes with the remote's function because the remote hasn't been working as well since we put the cover on.  It does keep the remote from slipping off the table.
2,This wasn’t tight enough around the remote it moves all over the place like it’s stretched out I was expecting it to hold the back of my roku remote on too because it won’t stay on but this is to loose to do anything to help that problem at all I was really hoping it would work.
5,Me gusto todo
5,Love the flowers in the dark feature and give a better grip on the remote.
2,I like this remote case. However I marked it down for the following reasons.Doesn't come with a tether.Does not glow in the dark. Tried holding up to the light for 10 minutes then shutting all lights off and nope.
3,Super cute but does not glow in the dark.
5,Helps keep batteries in place.
2,Good fit protects remote but the receiver gets obstructed.  If you want to control your TV / Roku you need to remove the cover.  Defeats the whole purpose of the cover.
2,The sleeve really dont fit the remote well. Its very loose and moves around. It tends to block the single to the tv so it doesn't always respond properly if at all. It does make it easy to find but that it.
4,Great cover but doesn’t glow in the dark
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Color and design is cool and it does glow in the dark but fits really loose. It’s very easy for it to come out or my kids to take it out would’ve given it more stars if it had a tighter fit.
2,Got this to help us find the remote easy because my kids always losing it. The color and the feel is great. I would say it is a little lose around the remote. But other then that it’s works for what I need it for.
2,Don’t buy if your hoping will glow in the dark because it won’t!
2,Fell apart and stretched so it would fall off. Threw it away.
5,It works well and fit well. I've had it for a month
5,Exactly what I was looking for a purple cover but it also glows like a bight mint green super pretty definitely needs to be charged by some light but it stays light for a while.
3,It fits the remote fine but it does not glow in the dark which is why I bought it. My daughter kept losing it in her bed so I thought this would help.
5,Love how easy it is to find and the perfect fit.
5,This fits our remote perfectly. It’s saved us from losing it several times already! Much easier to spot a bright blue remote buried in blankets than a black one.
4,Really like how it makes my Roku remote look and feel but it doesn’t “glow” as much as I thought it would. I even left it under light for awhile I thought that would help but it really doesn’t light up that much. Still a cute cover anyway and good for protection if you have a hubby or kids who drop the remote constantly lol.
5,Fits just like it should. It’s very grippy. It glows in the dark which is convenient since our remote likes to dive into the couch lol.
5,This is well-made and fits the Roku remote snugly - And it's really comfortable in my hand - I'm really pleased with it - C
3,It’s nice but doesn’t exactly fit the remote as snug as hoped for but hey I don’t have to worry about the Battery cover popping off anymore for that reason it’s definitely a good buy
3,Love the case it just doesn’t glow in the dark.
3,I have a 50” TCL Smart Roku Tv and the case is definitely too big. My remote swims in it.
5,Perfect openings for the remote and an even more perfect color to make it visible when you 'lose'  the remote while taking a nap on the sofa. It even glows I the dark so that it feels like your uncovering some ancient magical treasure from between the cushions which makes the crumbs and year old Cheeto seem a lot less gross.
2,The case had poor fit and was very basic. I suggest you find another inexpensive alternative because this one isn’t worth the little money I did spend.
5,Bought for my tcl roku tv.  The fit is a little looser than I would like but still does the job of keeping it on arm of leather couch
2,En realidad no se ajusta al tamaño del control la funda más grande que éste.
4,While it does not glow in the dark as bright as I had hoped it does provide lots of protection for my remote when I accidentally drop it on the concrete floor.
5,My dog thinks that these are her treats so we are constantly purchasing them.  I love the texture and the fact that they glow in the dark.
3,Doesn't fit properly. Does not glow.
5,The remote control cover makes it easier to find.
5,Happy with my purchase  happy I came across these ..  purchase one for each TV no more accidentally dropping and the backs coming off remotes... great price as well..
3,It made a portion of the remote purple which was my daughter's goal but it changes the feel and the size of the remote.
3,Bought this and I’d a little to big for the remote. Doesn’t fall off but isn’t snug. Also doesn’t glow in the dark at all
3,Needed something like this bc we lose our remote all the time. The green is supper bright and since we started using it we haven’t lost the remote as much haha . Not sure if it really glows in the dark tho.
5,Perfect remote cover beautiful fit and it actually glows in the dark ! You can’t beat the value for the price! Would definitely purchase again
3,I have 3 Roku remotes and bought three of these covers. They fit on the remotes but they are not snug. Sometimes the case will block the signal to tv. They work but I wouldn’t buy again.
2,It fits good but it doesn’t glow at all. I literally returned one already because they didn’t glow and now this one doesn’t either…
5,My Granddaughter wanted to put something over her remote because of her baby brother. She loves purple so I surprised her with it. She absolutely loves it.
2,I’m disappointed in how loosely this fits and how little glow there is. 👎🏼
2,The case does not fit snugly. Because it’s loose the case blocks the sensor.
5,As described fits perfectly well and is a nice pop of color.
3,The cover is very loose on the remote it easily slides out
2,It does not glow in the dark but the bright colors make it easier to find when it's lost.
5,I did buy the one that is a little big on the remote but it still serves its purpose very well.
5,Fits great over remote and easier to find now we love it!
2,The remote cover fit perfectly and was very easy to put on and comfortable. However only 2stars because the entire reason I got it was because it was supposed to glow in the dark and it doesn't even not even a little bit! When its dark and we're trying to find the remote glowing would help but this case does not glow at all people. So if you're getting it for that reason don't bother because it doesn't glow at all!
5,Muy bueno
3,The fit is perfect but it doesn't glow in the dark much at all. We even left it sitting in the window for direct sunlight still didn't glow much.
5,I think this is one of the coolest inventions ever!
5,I have hardwood floors. Remotes getting dropped on hard floors is damaging. Not anymore with these great rubber covers. I love them!  So worth the purchase. I wish they made them the size & brand of my TV remotes.
5,Makes it easier to find the lost remote that happens on the regular
5,The back of my remote broke when I was trying to take it off to change the batteries and  this cover saves me from have to buy a whole new remote!! I am able to put the back on the remote and it stays on because the case keeps it in place. The bonus was that I also “misplace” the remote often but since this glows it’s easy to find the remote at night.
5,It’s good it’s fits good I feels nice it pretty good
5,This is the best purchase ever. Love it. Works amazing it’s great. My controller lives on the floor always. Great buy!
2,You get what you pay for. Doesn’t glow like in picture. But easy to put on bit big but it works!
5,Remote
2,The product is very loose fitting on the remote
4,But does the job.
5,I can finally find our remote!!  I never have been able to keep track of our remote because it’s black and it fades into the black hole for remotes!  This skin makes it easy to spot.  Don’t know why I waited so long to buy one!
5,The bright color makes looking for the remote so much easier! Great price!
4,Does not glow in the dark
3,It fits great but i had to trim out the mute button. The sleeve covered half the mute button and every time i turned the volume down it would mute.
5,Great fitting Roku remote skins!
5,Fits great no weird smell.
3,Bright colors
5,Looks and fits perfect. Great price n fast delivery. This one was the best deal I found n again its perfect
2,They do not glow in the dark.
5,It has a tight fit and remote works well inside of case
5,I like the texture this case provides.the buttons are very easily accessible.  The glowing feature I do wish it retained the light a little bit longer before I have to reput it near the light in order for it to glow. But I would say if I had a second remote I may consider buying one for it but I’m just not sure. Maybe on sale?
5,It’s perfect FINELY able to keep up and always find my remote! Works perfectly with my tv and is glow in the dark so easy to spot…wish I had bought sooner
2,It’s cute and comfy for the remote but does not glow in the dark
3,It's nice to be able to find your remote in low light but it's a little difficult to use the volume buttons with the case on the remote
5,I love it….I can find my remote so easily
2,Needs to be a tad more snug. Or i have a small remote. It seem to have nice stretching so smaller design can still work.  Im no scientist tho. Good product idea tho.
2,I purchased the bright blue one and put it out in the sunlight for about five hours and It  glowed in the dark for about 30 minutes. GARBAGE!!!  Does NOT glow in the dark!
3,I bought 2 covers from same company both different colors and were supposed to glow bit neither did.
5,Love it and easy to find in dark
5,I washed my remote on accident and this I swear saved me !!!!
5,i only bought it bc it was purple i didn’t know it was supposed to glow in the dark but it doesn’t
5,They are toddler proof best investment i made
3,Fits the remote great keeps it from sliding in between the couch pillows. Definitely does not glow in the dark though. Great purchase for $5 other than that.
5,Not as Brite as advertised in the dark dropped several times and it was fine still worked great
2,I’ve tried leaving this next to a light for a long time. It doesn’t glow. The whole reason I bought it was to find it easier in the dark.
3,This is a misleading product.If you leave it out in sunlight for a couple hours it was below for about 30 minutes.. if you want to take a load continuously you have to leave it in light three times more then actually using it. Very crappy product and cheaply made
2,I purchased this to use on a remote style identical to the one pictured but the case is too large. It goes on but doesn’t fit snugly. My photos aren’t great but there’s at least finger width gaps between the remote and inside of the case on the sides and top.
3,It makes it easier to keep up with but does not glow in the dark.
1,So disappointed this doesn't glow in the dark as stated. I always lose my roku tv remote in bed and I purchased this specifically so I could find my remote in the dark. It fits well but other than that it's useless. A total waste of money
4,So easy to use we don't keep dropping the control now.
3,It’s as described except it doesn’t glow in the dark as advertised.
5,Does the job just fine. Doesnt really glow but prevennts it from falling into the cushions.
2,This Product Doesn't Glow In The Dark At All.
2,The product fits great but doesn’t glow in the dark like it says
3,The silicone case is slightly too large for the Roku remote that came with my TCL brand Roku TV. It's ok enough not to return but I am not very satisfied. The silicone itself seems good quality. The green color glows.
3,It’s a great product to use to locate your remote but it doesn’t glow in the dark.
5,I was always grabbing the remote and changing things. What is worse then being in the middle of a movie and kicking myself out. Now I no longer do such disrupting grabs.Who even knew there was such a thing. Go for it you will be happy you did so.
2,The case fits perfectly and serves its purpose. I was just a bit disappointed that it doesn't glow considering I have a tendency to constantly lose mine.
2,This product is a great idea but it’s just okay in real life. It does not fit the remote particularly well so it slides around and slips off. Still useable but too loose.
3,Just kinda wraps around remote. It's loose not tight fitting
2,This is the worst silicone cover I have purchased yet. Very sloppy loose fit. Try a different one!
3,Not glow in the dark but it’s cute. Easy to hold but I doesn’t quite have a tight fit on the remote. It still has some space to come out.
2,It barely glows in the dark so if that’s the feature you’re hoping for find something else
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love the texture. Wish it would fit a bit tighter so remote dont move around at all.
5,Fits perfectly. Makes the remote easier to handle and easier to find in a dark room.
1,This product is advertised as a bright glow-in-the-dark cover.  It barely glows in the dark.  It is very loose.  It does help with not slipping off the table or couch.  It is an overall lousy product.  Just use a little glow-in-the-dark paint medium for the desired effect.
5,Perfect fit. The red Stands out so it’s easier to find the remote
5,
2,does not glow in the dark
5,Nice cover for the money
5,
1,It's so loose the remote slips right out. I checked the model and verified b4 purchasing. A little disappointed  but it was on a couple of dollars. I'll try elsewhere.
5,I was iffy on this glow in the dark cover. I didn’t think it would work but it does. The one I received worked really well.
2,If you are buying it for the glow feature i would not buy. It glows but it does not last long at all..
3,It didn't really glow in the dark.
5,Love the smooth rubbery feel love the color and love that it is glow in the dark!
5,Perfect grip for Roku remote although does not glow in the dark very well.
3,The material it’s good only thing control it’s very loose  will work for what you need for
2,The picture was taken using my phone's night vision feature in pitch black darkness. It's just barely visible and that's exactly how to describe it. I bought it so I could find it at night since it keeps falling under the bed and I don't want to turn on the lights but instead it just serves as a grip for the remote. The cutouts lineup well however so it wasn't a complete waste of money. Don't buy it if your intent is to find it easily in the dark. Do buy it if you have butterfingers and keep dropping the remote.
5,Easy to flip onto remote. Fits perfectly on remote leaving access to all controls.
1,Didn’t fit the remote for Ruku with earplugs. Didn’t bother about sending it back. Can use it but have to take cover off to use for earplugsOther than that would have love it.
5,Easy to put on and find
3,I took stars off because the cover is kinda loose fitting and is not snug on the remote. Also it doesn’t really glow in the dark?
5,It came so fast! Love my Roku remote case!!
5,Shipping was super fast! The material made it easy to stretch over my remote and still had a snug fit! I love that it glows in the dark which makes it easy to locate the remote in the dark!
1,I thought this would be a great item seeing how my kids always lose the remote.  It is not as bright as the picture shows. It is not a snug fit to the remote so it kinda feels weird.
5,It works
5,I bought the cover for my roku controller and it's good for that but the glow in the dark no the glow don't last very long the cover is ok but not the glow.
2,Perhaps this was limited to the remote style I used (although I’ve never seen more than one) the remote fit very poorly on the remote. Cool idea but bad execution.
1,The reason for purchase was glow in the dark which it does not do. But does not slip off the table. Could have used my hot glue stick and put little lines on the back
5,love it now we can find the remote at night lol
2,Bought this to take care of a loose battery cover and the silicon sleeve/ case is too big. Kinda defeats the purpose but does the job
5,Nice. Good protection for my remote
3,Protects the remote but has never “glowed in the dark.”
2,I read where people said it was loss but thought ok.  Well it if very loss.  Not gonna return it because it was only 6.00 but not what I was hoping for.  Also it has holes for the string but did not come with one.
2,Does not "fit snuggly". Very loose on my TCL Roku remote. And definitely doesn't glow in the dark after being in the light for a few hours prior to. (Sky Blue color) Has a spot for a lanyard but doesn't come with one...
1,Product is cheap slip over cover loose does not allow fingers to access volume control and biggest selling point is that it is glow in the dark I will tell you this thing does not glow in the dark you can hold a high-powered flashlight to it it will glow for under two seconds very dimly
2,Do not buy if your looking for the item to do exactly as it says. It does not glow in the dark
5,I bought on for me and gave my daughter one. She loves it.
1,Need more information on it cuz it’s WAY to big for my roko remote
2,Fits well but I have to keep pulling down the cover to use the remote there is a whole at the top of it and you would think it's perfect but no...
3,Larger than expected and doesn’t fit snuggly
2,You have to really look hard to see if it’s actually glow in the dark certainly not what is shown.
5,Easy to keep up with remote now.
5,It really glows and is soft gel al the way around. Its perfect. I thought only cell phones made covers lol. But its eazy to find at night
1,Roku’s remotes always seemed a little weird as far as where they put the buttons but I thought I could help with a grippy case. I have to push every button at least 3 times for it to register waste of money…
5,Really good fit on my remote.  Exactly what I wanted.
5,Is a very nice cover and I don’t lose my tiny remote now
5,Recomendado
2,This was purchased for a Roku Ultra LT remote but the case was too small. (Purple case in pic)Also tried on a TCL Roku tv remote and the case was a tad too big.Will be returning.
1,Bought this to keep my kids from losing the remote.  Turn off the lights. Find the remote .  1. The blue does not glow bright …. AT ALLL!  2 under a 1000000 watt pure white spotlight for 10 minutes within inches. Of silicone. It only lasts maybe 7 minutes. Note barely glowing after 3. Completely defeating the purpose of it being a glow in the dark.  Green one . Lasts longer and is brighter for longer but. After maybe 15-18 minutes. Both are not findable in complete darkness  Also the sleeves do not fit properly.  Very very loose  easy to accidentally fall off remote. This resulting in lento only a lost remote but now a lost remote sleeve
3,Does not glow in the dark.
5,great value. ordered for replacement remote for my son. ordered green but received blue. oh well
3,Does not glow in the dark
5,Kids have dropped and broken so many remotes-this helps!
2,Too big easily falls off
2,I bought it ONLY as it was said to glow in the dark. No way! Its going back or in the garbage. False advertising! I WISH it was like the pictures they show!!!
1,The only reason I bought this was because I needed something I could see in my room at night. So very misleading NOT SATISFIED
1,This doesn’t glow in the dark even in the slightest. Super disappointing. The cover is also too big but at least I won’t lose it as often since it’s purple.
5,Works Great! Perfect fit. Glows bright enough to find in the dark.
1,It doesn’t glow in the dark at all waste of money!
1,Didn’t fit even though it said it would
2,I got this to fit my 2019 Roku Ultra remote. It's just a little too small. It fits but it's too stretched and as such it moves around the remote a little. I'm sure it's ok for other remotes. Also if you have the Ultra remote you'll need to cut your own hole for the studio audio jack.
5,Fits a little loose  works
5,Lo protege de las caídas causadas por el uso de los niños
5,Just perfect fit protect the remote and easy access to bottoms
5,Love this cover. My child is very fidgety/nervous and plays with the battery cover. Bought this to stop him. Works wonders.
5,The glow is nice for finding the remote at night.
2,My kids keep dropping the remote leading to the battery cover starting to split down the middle.  This cover prevents further damage but it’s a little too loose and moves around a bit.  The signal is often prevented from getting to the TV because the loose cover has drifted over the transmitter.
5,We purchased bright blue. The color makes it easier to find.
2,But a different one. It's not a good fit compared to others I have bought.
2,Don't waste your money. They don't light up and stretch out of shape easily.
2,It definitely doesn’t glow in the dark at all. It’s a nice case and looks and feels great but I bought it because it was supposed to be glow in the dark.
2,I have not seen the remote cover glow in the dark at all based on what is advertised.
2,This case fits the remote fairly well but absolutely does not glow for more than 30 seconds even when exposed to very bright light.
5,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend! He loved it ! Works great.
5,No more lost or broken or lost battery covers !
5,These fit like a glove and really help protect your Roku remote when you drop it. I love it.
2,Fits fine but doesn’t glow. Even buried in or under the couch
5,Fast shipping product fits like a glove (for the Roku TV). Thank you!
2,Does not glow in the DARK and fitting is loose
1,This cover doesn’t fit the remote like another brand I have does. I was very disappointed because this is so pretty. My remote slides around in the cover and the sides slide right off the remote.
1,
5,
5,The case is sturdy and bright. Just what I wanted. I am very pleased. Thank you!
2,Picture is super Misleading! The colors look bright neon or glow in the dark! Neither is true. The plastic is slippery. Not non-skid so not sure what they are good for other than looks. Read before you buy.
2,The seller advertises that the cover glows but it does not glow. The cover does feel comfortable in hand and all of the buttons are accessible.
2,The cover fits on my remote but not well it is loose. It also has unfinished edges that make it look sloppy.
1,This sleeve is too big for the remote. I ended up taking it off bc the remote would slide down in sleeve causing the sleeve to cover up the sensor so the remote wouldn't work when pointed at the TV until we straightened the sleeve.
1,It wasn’t like it said it would be. I need it to glow
2,Case fit and function are ok but the glow in the dark is awful does glow at all
5,Love the case remote is easy to find.
1,Too big for the remote it’s listed for and no lanyard included. I should of listened to the reviews
2,Does not glow
1,
1,Doesn’t glow in the dark so not really helpful
5,Todo bien
1,Does not fit well. The cover is a bit oversized on the remote. And doesn’t glow well.Returning this item.Also customer service is terrible. I returned this item weeks ago. The item was finally marked received on 03/01/22 and it was noted that it could take 2-3 days to process and then 2-3 days for a refund to show in my account. It’s been 2 weeks (today 03/15/22) and it still just shows item received.
5,Great customer service and exactly what I wanted!!
1,the cover was too big my remote keeps falling out - and it’s not even glow in the dark!
5,Perfect fit
1,Does not glow in the dark!
1,Does not flow but it’s comfortable on the remote.
1,Absolutely does not glow in the dark the entire reason for purchasing this was the glow in the dark aspect so that my daughter can see it at night. It does not glow even the slightest I should’ve saved my money because now I have a disappointed kid and just a plain blue remote cover.
2,I got this because I'm allways losing my controller. I thought with the bright green it would make it easier to find but it is not true to color. It glows in the dark but is not the bright green color it is in the picture!
1,The review is in the title. Thats all folks. Doesn't glow one bit.
1,Doesn’t glow which is why I bought it because I lose my remote all the time. The cover itself is over sized and doesn’t fit properly. This may be fine for some people but when you have fidgety people in your household it will stretch out way too fast.
1,i really wanted to use this with my tv remote but unfortunately like others said it doesn’t fit right. it is very loose and it could probably slip right off. sadly i will probably be returning
1,The case does not glow a big disappointment
5,Nitido
1,Doesn’t even glow in the dark.
2,Difficult to use size didn’t fit right
1,It seems to big for the remote
1,What a disappointment.
1,It didn’t look like the pics and it doesn’t fit the roku remotes it falls right off.
1,Does not glow in the dark at all. Loose case.
1,False advertisement DOESNT glow in the dark.Only reason why I bought it because I thought it didn’t since it says it doesn’t.Waste of money
1,The entire reason I purchased this remote cover is for one reason. That reason is to make it more noticeable and glow in the dark. Since I bought this it has yet to glow in the dark. As a side note it is a very flimsy piece of rubber. It doesn't protect the remote much at all. Nor does it provide much extra grip. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,Didn’t fit my remote. It has to be the longer roku remotes
1,Does not glow in the dark we have tried leaving it in the sun  under a light bulb for days nothing happened
1,Waste of money does not glow in the dark at all
1,All and all it’s a nice cover. Mine came with a rip in it though which is disappointing. Due to the fact you already pay $12 for one cheap cover but for it to come ripped I’m pretty annoyed because now it’s just going to tear worse so great waste of money thanks Amazon
1,Just came from the kitchen after holding the case and remote under the range hood 60-watt equivalent bulb for 30 seconds. What little glow existed had already faded by the time I walked the 10 steps into the living room sat down and took this pic.The case is somewhat slippery too not the grippy silicone-feel I expected from the description.I'm very disappointed.
1,I bought both the sky glow and lilac glow. Neither of them glow in the dark like they say. The case does for on the remote well. However I got these to be able to find the remote in the dark so it’s pointless.
1,Don’t fit any of the remotes
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The whole river was to loose for a standard roku remote so it doesn’t even sit right and it doesn’t even glow in the dark not even a littler but it’s poorly advertised and made
1,This does not glow at all. Not even a little bit. Definitely false advertising if you ask me.
1,It fit a little loose for what I had seems hit or miss.
1,This only glows slightly when held up to the light for a few mins. Otherwise this does not glow in the dark
1,Received firestick remote cover twice instead of roku both was clearly marked for firestick....returned both wont order from again.
1,
1,This got returned it does not glow at all
1,Barley glowed in the dark and ripped 3 days after using it. Just cheaply made.
2,Remote is worth purchasing
1,Infact does not glow In the dark what so ever. BUT it is semi easier to fine because the green is so bright. Any other color probably wouldn’t be as good. So it is sorta useless. You can see in the photo it’s not glow in the dark just bright bright green.
1,It’s too big for the remote
1,Sitting 3" under a light bulb for 10 minutes gave it scattered speckles of dim alien-green pinpoints and only under that spot. Truly disappointed.
2,This case fits very loose
1,It falls of my Roku remote and it doesn't glow in the dark at all
1,This “glow in the dark” cover does not glow in the dark whatsoever. You are better off purchasing the same cover but a different cover.
1,Too big
1,Assumed this would be a tight fit over the remote but it is actually quite loose. Not really pleased.
1,Dise es floresente y no lo es  es verde nada más  desilusionada
1,Super disappointed. This item does NOT glow and it’s NOT easy to find in the dark. It’s the only reason I bought it and it just sucks. This is false advertising because it’s not what the picture indicates at all.
1,glad i only bought 1...will attempt to return it
1,According to the advertisement this cover should have fit but you can see it does not
1,Came clean and fit good on the remote bright in color but does not glow.
2,Loose fit
1,does not even fit the remotes they have listed
1,It's too big !
1,Remote moves around inside case and it does not glow in the dark. Also feels slippery in your hand.
1,It covers the on/off sensor button on my remote
1,Lucky is green you can find it but if you want to glow in the dark it will not
1,Will be returning.
1,I bought this product specifically because it is supposed to glow in the dark and it doesn’t. It’s plain blue plastic. I am very disappointed.
1,Does not stay on remote
1,Does not glow. Cannot return. Waste of money.
1,Very loose on controller also not what I ordered. I’m sure I could return but I don’t have time or energy for that process.... 😞
1,Don’t waste your money it doesn’t glow
1,It does not glow. Had it sit under a lamp for awhile and no glow. My kids are disappointed.
1,Does not glow in the dark 🙄 that was the whole reason why I purchased this for my remote.
1,There is no cutout for the headphone jack or voice control switch button. It also doesn’t have a cutout for the USB port..
1,Ordered green case received blue. Also not glow in the dark. Does fit the remote so 1 star. I’ll still use the product.
1,Does not glow in the dark
1,That’s it
1,Le queda grande al control se mueve y se sale..
1,I even left it in the sun. It is nothing more than just a purple cover.
1,Case was too big. Very loose around remote. Blocked signal
1,It doesn’t glow In the dark 😔
1,Bought this because it said it glowed. Which is doesn't at all. Just a blue rubber case no glow
1,Super sloppy fit feels like the remote is going to fall out of the case.
1,The silicone is actually slick and it doesn’t glow like it is stated.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONTY.!!!!
1,NOT glow in the dark.
1,Like other reviewers I thought it would glow in the dark but it does not).
1,Lip of cover doesn't fit over long side of remote.
1,It does not glow.
1,Does not glow in the dark at all. Very disappointed
1,Way to big for the Ruku remote.
1,Didn’t glow
1,Does not glow!
1,
1,I received the cover and it doesn't match what the picture shows.  The one I got covers the lower bottom buttons and I had to cut it.  It doesn't glow in the dark either what a lie.
4,i like that its easier to find and grip but it advertised that it glows in the dark and it absolutely doesn't. I've held it under lighteven laid it in the sun for 3 hours. It doesn't glow in the least but it was a good price
5,This product does not glow but it does protect your Roku remote
3,It’s ok.  I’m enjoying using it but the picture looks like it is glow in the Dark which it isn’t.
5,I do like it.  It makes the remote easier to see.  I do wish it was a bit more snug but it serves its purpose!
5,I kept losing my remote until I got this! Now I never lose it with the blue color. Super comfortable to hold with the silicone material too
5,Love it. Makes it so much easier to find. Actually purchasing more of different colors for different televisions.
5,I like the remote cover. I don’t know how much it really “glows”. However the bright color and the silicon material have been key in helping me not constantly lose the remote by misplacing or sliding down into the couch cushions. Would recommend.
5,
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The other covers I own are very tight on the remotes. This one is not.
5,Is easy to find remote. Sometimes difficult to operate remote because cover is slightly oversized. DIES NOT HLIW IN DARK AS ADVERTISED
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I Love the cushiony feel of the protective case. The volume buttons are easily accessible as is the front window to connect with the Roku TV. If the remote falls to the floor the battery case stays closed.
5,This is great. It fits the remote well and is much easier to find with it on. Does have a slight glow in the dark.
5,I have these for all the remotes in the house. I love that they glow in the dark.
5,It’s a good cover but very loose and does not glow as much as it says it does. But at least it keeps the grandkids from takin the back off the remote that is until they figured out how to take the cover off too.
5,it serves its purpose of protecting the cheap control no complaints there how ever i have left it out in the direct sun 2 days and all i got it to “glow” was a week blue hue
4,Awesome
4,Covers good
5,Super good! The black remotes are so hard to find it’s like my couch is a black hole. But now we always can find it quick!
5,Remote cover
4,Seems like it will fit any Roku remote.
5,No I sure. Just as expected. I got it because I don’t understand or know why this remote out of remotes in the century keep getting lost. The glow in the dark will definitely help.
5,I love that glows in the dark and the color is what I wanted!
2,Does not fit as tightly as expected.  Had to boil it in water twice to get it to shrink to fit better.
1,I left them in the light the sun the indoor light.. they never would glow in the dark..Maybe they sent me the wrong cases.. I dunno.. but they are good sleeves just for grip.So not all bad. I just have a hard time in the middle of the night when I wake up to try and find them.
4,Haven't used the glow in the dark yet. Hopes are high.
5,Case came in today put it under a light for one hour .And This Does Glow.
5,No obstaculiza los botones suave al tacto. Producto recomendado.
1,It doesn't fit my roku remote. Stretched and stretched but to no avail. Very disappointed.
5,I liked that it glows really well like you do not have to actually br in the dark
5,I couldn’t find a case for my LG soundbar remote so I measured it and found out that this model Roku remote is the same size. It makes me happy how well it worked out.
4,The product is nice as the color is easy to spot. After reading many reviews about the product does not fit tightly and it fails to glow in the dark.  So I did some research and found out that the cover will glow after placing it under a bright light for about 2 hours. Which I did the experiment and it worked.  Now I'm not sure how long the case will glow but it does glow. I believe many have received the case that glows immediately.  Otherwise this product  could be a better fit on your remote as it should fit like a glove.
4,Fits but doesn't glow in the dark
5,It’s a little big for the remote but nothing a little piece of two sided tape on the back of the remote didn’t take care of. Thanks!
5,I love this remote cover. Wish they had more colors
5,Doesn’t come off the remote have protected it just fine but it is a bit lose side buttons sometimes gets a little covered
4,Does not glow ..at all
5,I have two one for my TCL Roku remote and one for my ONN Roku remote they fit great and they do glow! Makes it a lot easier to find when the remote falls in the couch or under the bed.
5,This would be great if it did not make my dog think the remote is a chew toy. Not their fault.
5,I ordered the lilac and it is as described. I do wish it was a little tighter of a fit so it would come off with more force but overall i like it. Makes it easier to find as well.
4,I mean what can I say.. does the job well. Not super duty material but dropped my remote a few times and still good!! Should’ve gotten it before my battery cover cracked but now I can make sure the remote is covered
5,It glows in the dark .. uhhh it’s cute and it’s different colors as well like purple in the day time and blue in the dark it’s cute !! & it fits my ruku remote very well
2,It says it’s for the Roku version remote that I have but it’s too big. It kinda flops around on it. Makes it hard to use the remote.
5,Highly recommend
5,Really worth it I can now find my remote easily
5,Good product at a great price
5,I can never lose the remote because it’s a bright color
5,It doesn't cover the whole remote just the back
5,My kids keep breaking my remote great u can order from amazon always does the job
3,This is just okay. It doesn't fit the Roku remote quite right it's a little too loose. It doesn't glow in the dark as it appears in the photo but it does help from getting lost!
5,Works great if it gets lost turn on the lights then turn them off and you can locate it.
3,Fits just like a silicone glove for game controllers.  It starts that's the bright blue-green color was glow in the dark.  I have low vision and need the gitd to see when laying on dark objects.  Made slip proof but disappointed
5,I was always losing my remote.  Now I can find it with out the hassle
5,It fits perfectly. The color is great now we find the remote a whole lot easier.
5,Product came as listed and there were no flaws.
1,I ordered the blue glow in the dark cover. It doesn’t fit the remote snug at all. It also doesn’t glow AT ALL. It’s just blue.
5,Like it fits fit remote
5,Works just like the original very few difference in the make up
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I really like that the case is a bright color I also like that it glows in the dark so you never have a problem finding it. And I just think it makes your remote control much better.
3,It doe's not glow that much in the dark
3,It slips off the remote easily even though it’s made for this remote. Not sure I would purchase again.
5,Works great. Has a great feel to it. Not to big or bulky.
5,This is a very good buy. I only wish it fit a little more snug.
5,Soft grip. Easy to use.  Great protection. It actually flows in the dark which is nice
5,This tiny remote notoriously gets lost in or under the couch at our house. The silicone cover provides nice traction so it doesn't slip away. The color seems as pictured in the listing and it is somewhat glow-in-the-dark which would probably be helpful on movie night if you are mid-movie trying to pause. It was a bit snug when putting it on but I feel like this one won't come off so easily as some of my prior silicone covers have. Overall the small investment is worth my time to not have to look for my remote. Would buy again.
5,We purchased this Remote Case because we lost the remote in our sheets when we stripped the bed and it went through the wash cycle. We had to replace it and determined we would never lose it (the replacement) again so this model Remote Cover seemed to be the brightest and hardest to blend in. And...after a few nights we noticed it actually did glow in the dark! Fits the remote well easy to put on and lines perfectly with the remote functions.
3,This was a little loose on my remote and wouldn't have stayed on. That might be because our remote was a roku replacement from another brand I'm not sure.
5,Love that it glows in the dark and makes it easy to locate!
5,Fit perfectly adds a tiny bit of weight to the remote which is actually a good thing since roku remotes are so light which contributed to me constantly dropping it or it slipping off the table. I've never dropped a remote more than I have this roku remote. It was extremely frustrating. Now it's decently weighted and best of all not slippery anymore. I love it.
5,Glows in the dark it’s easy to find it on movie night & it’s protects the remote
5,Great price. Easy to install. Saves the hassle of loseing in the dark
3,Bulky & easy to find the remote. However it does NOT glow in the dark.
5,Random purchase that I’m so happy with. It doesn’t really glow in the dark for us. But the rubber cover makes it harder to slip into the cushions of the couch. So we tend to not lose it as much.
4,It works is as advertised. It is a bit roomy on the remote though. It would be better if it was smaller.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             It’s way too loose. It slips around and falls off. The glow in the dark is barely visible. I’m really disappointed. I wish I hadn’t wasted my money on this.
5,Great product as advertised fit my remote perfectly
2,Looks just as image shows and does the job but it does not in fact glow in the dark
3,Was very loose fitting.... did I get the right one?  returned item refunded no problem
