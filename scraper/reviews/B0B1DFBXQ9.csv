5,I have my 3.3 cu ft mini fridge 49in led tv cable box ryobi fan wireless charging device on one usb port and two tablets connected to the other ports. So far so good. Though I've had to wiggle two of the usb ports so they can connect to devices. I shook item and nothing sounds loose. Might disassemble to further investigate issue.
5,This is awesome for travel. I have a CPAP machine and it great for powering all of my equipment and charging phones.
5,It’s small enough to hide but it’s can fit so much different plugs at once and I love that I can plug in my phone charger with out the base . Whether you use the fast charging cable or the regular it has both accessible
5,My daughter uses this in her room for all the cords and plugs. Work great.

5,Great value
5,Would be nice if it had longer cord but otherwise nice.
3,Everything was great except the plug is fixed at an angle which happened to be turned the wrong way. I know many cords are made this way but usually you can switch which side it turns to not this one.
1,Upon arrival I heard something rattling inside when I shook the device. Assuming it was just a piece of plastic I decided to open the device up and found a loose piece of METAL floating around inside. You can see it in the photo just below the power unit. It clearly came from one of the wires being clipped after soldering. This is a MAJOR FIRE HAZARD as it could have shorted out the conductors within. I am very lucky I decided to open it up and look inside versus assume it was a piece of plastic and plug it into the wall.After I removed the metal piece and inspected the product I used it and am very satisfied with the product. Just make sure if you shake the hell out it and if you hear anything rattling inside return it.
1,The USB ports don't work and after contacting the manufacturer for the warrenty they asked for a video and then never got in contact again.Would not recommend.
1,This was sold as a 10ft cord. It’s only 5ft long including the box. The tiles in the picture are 1ftx1ft.
5,I'm using this surge protector in the greenhouse.  With so many small appliances like fans that use a USB connection this is a real improvement from my previous um construction.  It's mounted up off the floor. Now I can water with a little more confidence and a little less worry of electrocuting myself or wrecking something as I putter away.
5,10Ft Long Surge Protector Power Strip Extension Cord with 8 AC Outlets and 4 USB Ports(1 USB C) 3-Side Outlet Extender Strip Flat Plug Wall Mount Dorm Home Office Essential ETL ListedI feel we can never have too many extension cords/power strips so I got this one to use in my tiny office in the corner of my home where there isn’t a good number of plugs. This has been a lifesaver for me. I can plug in so many things including USB devices. This has been working great and I might even by more (don’t need any yet). Highly recommend.
5,Works as it should. Good cord length. Portable or permanent. Good overall quality and value.
5,We have a lot of family and friend get togethers and of course food is always involved. This is a great little device to have around for all the crockpots that show up. Having the USB connection is also great. You know there will be at least 1 person who is always needing to charge their phone. This is well made the outlets are spaced well and the cord is sturdy and a decent length.
5,The long but not bulky extension cord comes in quite handy for hotel rooms that like to hide electrical outlets in out of the way obscure places.  The 10-foot length means it will reach just about anywhere you need it to go.The electrical outlets are staggered just enough so that large power convertors do not take up the entire power strip.  Yeah!The USB ports on the sides are helpful and placed so that other electrical plugs do not block them.This is a well thought out and executed surge protector power strip.  It should have no problem keeping all of my electronics charged when travelling.Excellent!
1,Only the cord is UL listed. Manufacturer claims that the device itself is ETL listed but no device can be found when you search the ETL site. Stay far far away from this. It's not worth burning down your house just to save a few bucks.
5,How do they even fit that many outlets in such a small place?  This is a great cord that I'm using for a portable around my house right now.  It would be great for travel too.
5,This charger is great for electrical appliances and charging your iPhone or iPad. Love it!
5,I had to return it because I found something cheaper. I actually like this one better because it can fit into smaller corners in my apartment.
5,No more under the table clutter and stepping on the outlet clutter. If I knew I could do this I would’ve done it a long while ago. I like it.
4,I really only have one very minor issue. The plug is slanted to the right. So if I have the block set up to the left of the outlet it has to bend weirdly. See the picture.
1,I have been using it for a while and the product smoked and caught fire I will return this product please be aware
5,It does what it is supposed to do.
5,I wanted an outlet near my garage door for my compressor and things and this made it easy to plug in over my workbench around behind the HVAC duct and screw to the HVAC base.
5,Love this. It’s perfect.
