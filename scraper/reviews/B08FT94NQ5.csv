5,This is a great set of earphones and much higher quality than you might expect at this price point.  ANC is solid paring is fast and easy and the charge lasts much longer than I'm likely to have them in my ears.  And then it's back in the case for a top off.  Also this might be the first (ever) set of earphones I've used that don't feel like they're about to fall out of my ear.  Other sets I've used have me constantly reaching up to ensure they're not falling out.  These fit comfortably and securely in the ear.  Push in twist and they're not going anywhere.  One small nit: the same control movement on the left ear (X1) is used to Play/Pause as well as cycle through ANC/Transparency.  This becomes a problem if I'm listening to an audio book and stop to speak to someone. I'd like to stop the book AND switch to transparency mode but when I tap once I pause the book and if I tap again to cancel ANC the book restarts.  Makes it hard to be social if someone stops you.  But that's a MINOR annoyance that in no way detracts from my satisfaction with this set of earphones.
4,Opening the box and pulling the earbud case out and it felt solid a nice weight to it feels like quality. The lid holds securely via magnet and pulling the earbuds out of quick and simple. No problems pairing with my Google Pixel 6 Pro. I was disappointed that the Tozo app doesn't support these but I downloaded another equalizer app which works great. The buds fit securely after selecting the right earpiece (I put them in and shook my head violently and they didn't budge). The touch controls take a little getting used to but seem to work as needed. The sound is great especially for the price paid. Very balanced crisp highs tight lows (not boomy) and the mids are clear. Another feature I love is that I can use both buds in stereo or I can use each one independently without doing anything extra. The only complaint I have is when it comes to phone calls people say it sounds like I'm far away so I guess the mic leaves a little too be desired.
5,The Good: This is an improvement on the already great Tozo NC9 ANC earbuds. I was disappointed that the original NC9s did not have a wireless charging case. Well not only did Tozo bring it they brought it big time with a nice large battery it'll keep you NC9 earbuds charged for days of use! These things would be great for long trips. I can literally swap out my original NC9 earbuds now with these new ones and keep the tunes and podcast going. The fit on the NC9 earbuds for me is superb. I put the smallest earbud tips on and they stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing. I've gone on runs mowed the lawn worked on my SUV trips to the store and many other chores all while listening on my NC9 earbuds. It's super easy to adjust the volume and is intuitive just push and hold the right to increase the volume and yep you guessed it push and hold the left to decrease the volume. The volume get plenty loud too but not too loud but please be sure not to damage your hearing. It's also super easy to switch between songs with a simple double tap of the right to go to the next or double tap the left to go back to the previous or beginning of a song. And switching between ANC and Transparent mode with a single tap of the left earbud. Then last to power them down just tap and hold each earbud until it says "power off" and tap and hold again to power them on. I find these controls very intuitive some earbud require a series of different taps but not these Tozo NC9 earbuds. Oh and the case for the NC9 Plus is now wireless charging plus has some number indicators on the inside to let you know how charged the case's battery is and 2 smaller indicators for the earbuds. This is a great improved feature from the non-wireless charging case. This alone was worth it to me. I slap them on my Tozo wireless charger and that's it no more plugging in the USB Type C. But that is an option if you want to charge them that way in a pinch. I believe you can also charge other devices like a friends pair of earbuds with a micro usb charging cord. I have not tested that but the port is there when you remove the rubber protector strip. And last the sound. The NC9s are overall a nice sounding sound stage a little heavy on the bass end and the highs are about right. Just keep in mind they are budget earbuds. They will fit the bill for most people not wanting to pay $150+ for a quality pair. (Almost forgot the battery life. With transparent mode I get about 6-7 hours and with ANC I get about 3-4 hours. )The Bad: And now for the bad things. I honestly don't have too many bad things about the Tozo NC9 earbuds themselves other than it's pretty easy to pick them up off a surface and accidently cause them to switch between ANC and Transparent mode but that's an easy fix by just tapping again. It's also easy to accidently cause your media to start playing in the same fashion. But this is an issue with all tap control earbuds so not really a way to fix that issue except for using sensors that are aware of when they are in the ear canal. The ANC is not the best but works for me while mowing and vacuuming reducing the sounds considerably but for the price point they are great!The Ugly: Last is the ugly things. The only three drawbacks on these is the case it's large it's heavy and the lid snaps shut too easy. The lid needs a spring like mechanism that keeps it open better. But don't let this deter you from purchasing them as they still fit in your pocket just don't wear tight pants if you're a guy. LOLFinal Note: Overall I highly recommend these Tozo NC9 Plus earbuds with wireless charging case if you are looking for a budget pair of ANC earbuds. I now have 2 pairs the originals and now these. I've had a few other pairs and these just can't be beat for the price. Go ahead and give them a try and I think you'll agree they fit the budget True Wireless Earbuds perfect!
4,Very impressed with the sound of these. The highs are clear lows are punchy and the kids do not overpower.  The variety of ear cushions makes fitting them very customizable. I ended up using different sizes in each ear to get the best fit. CONS: I don’t find there to be much difference with ANC on or off or transparent mode. The right bud occasionally distorts but that could be the particular music track. Strange it’s only the right side. I’m still evaluating that. And I find it’s really easy to inadvertently change modes pause etc. by just brushing the earbuds lightly. Also wish these were compatible with the app.
5,I love these earbuds. I can use them in transparent mode or noise cancelling mode (a pleasant little voice tells me what I’ve just tapped them into). I’m still trying to figure out how to raise and lower the volume and I also haven’t solved the mystery of why when I’m using them to watch TV and accidentally hit the wrong button on my remote I suddenly have loud music from my Apple Music playlist in my ear. I have to make sure the songs are ones I actually like.The noise cancellation is excellent. I can’t hear the microwave beep when I’m standing right next to it or water running in the kitchen sink. I can barely hear my dog barking.The battery lasts a very long time. I’ve only had to recharge it once and it shows me what percentage of the battery remains when I open the case.All in all I definitely recommend these earbuds. You can’t beat the price. I do suggest that you carefully follow the instructions for inserting them and make sure you use the tip size that suits you best.  And practice inserting them until you get it right.
5,One of my ear buds became quieter and would squeal when I selected the anc mode.I reached out to tozo customer service. First they assisted with initial trouble shooting and within 3 days we came to the conclusion that a replacement would be required. They are currently shipping me a new one and do not require the defective product back. They were incredibly helpful and weren't coming up with reasons to not do their job.Plus the battery life on these things are incredible. Sound is great I work on the flightline hangar and in office space and the different modes allow a wide range of capabilities that I enjoy.
5,Very easy to pair with my phone. Easy to charge on the wireless charger that came with my phone. These sound great and do a very good job of canceling noise. Very comfortable. Thanks for a great product!
5,I purchased these to help with noise from an HVAC system and road traffic that has been disrupting my sleep. These work better than an over the year Sony active noise canceling headset!Customer service has also been excellent.
5,I received the Tozo NC9 Plus earbuds a few days ago and had time to play around with them. I have to say: these are the best earbuds with ANC I have seen so far.Over the past months I had the chance to test several ANC earbuds including Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 both in the $200 range.The Tozo earbuds in terms of build quality and appearance are absolutely comparable if not better than the much higher priced earbuds. When I unpacked them the case had a very solid feel the lid fits tightly appearance is elegant there is a nice display on the inside showing charging status of the earbuds as well as %age charge of the case. The case provides wireless charging and works very well even with my very old Qi charging pad.The buds themselves fit extremely well. I found the right rubber tip easily and the design is great and fits my ears perfectly. I am a fan of the fit of the very first Galaxy earbuds (Gear IconX) which are still the best fitting earbuds I have ever tried but these come very close. Don't stick out a lot while sitting very tight and don't move or fall out even when I move a lot. The touch controls are great perfect responsiveness.Sound quality is really good. I have seen in another review that someone thought they are heavy on the bass. I agree they have a really good bass but I changed it with the equalizer settings. The sound is really great helped by the awesome fit. Much better than what I experienced with the more expensive Sony and Samsung earbuds.I was very positively surprised by the quality of the ANC. I know I could not expect the same type of noise suppression as over-ear headphones provide and with the experience from other earbuds I did not expect too much. But I was very positively surprised. The ANC successfully filters out background noises at least as good if not better than all other ANC earbuds I have tried. When I first started trying these settings with true wireless earbuds I didn't have high expectations but was still very disappointed by what Sony and Samsung delivered. I was not willing to pay in that price range for a slight muffling of background noises which did not even block out some traffic noise. The Tozo NC9 Plus are doing a better job than the higher priced earbuds blocking background noises really well and voices directly around me are suppressed relatively well as well. The only caveat is that you can only switch between ANC and transparent mode. It would be nice to have a 3rd setting with ANC and transparency mode turned off so there is no interference when you want to listen to music and enjoy the great sound quality of these earbuds. No problem inside but when you're outside some wind noises are amplified even with ANC on.Overall: great earbuds really good ANC (better than much higher priced earbuds) great sound quality and unbeatable value-for-money. For around $60 (when I bought them there were some discounts on Amazon) these are by far the best earbuds you can pick up.
5,I bought these to replace some dying Airpod pros and they have exceeded my expectations. While the case is a little bit bigger the ability to use it as a portable charger makes it plenty worth it. The battery life is unmatched as well. While I would constantly have to stop my music to charge airpods I still have yet to have them die on me while listening. The customer service is also amazing! They were extremely quick to respond and were able to fully fix my issue. I highly recommend and will continue to use this brand. I hope that helps someone :)
4,Seems as though all the other models are supported by the TOZO mobile yet the NC9 Plus model isn’t why not?
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I will be short. I have used many Bluetooth earbuds including the very popular Samsung Galaxy Buds+ True Wireless Earbuds. And now TOZO NC9 Plus Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds. Here is what I think between Samsung Bud+ and Tozo NC9 Plus in scale of 10:1. Charging Case quality:Samsung is built with very high quality plastic and appearance no sharp edges very compact yet easily to get scratched. Tozo NC9 Plus is very sturdy but big and has sharp edges all the way around the lid when you use your finger to open and it is a bit hard to open. I think I will have to use a sand paper to sand down the sharp edge a bit - not a bit deal.- Samsung: 10- Tozo: 82. Case functions and battery capacity:Samsung case is 600mAh Tozo is 2500mAh. Samsung has USB-C port Tozo has USB 2.0 and USB-C port.- Samsung: 6- Tozo: 103. Bluetooth range:Both are excellent. I have great experience with both. They hold up to 30-50feet range start loosing signal if there is a wall or you go up or down a level.- Samsung: 10- Tozo: 104. Sound quality and experience:I was expecting Samsung win this contest but Tozo has impressed me with its sound quality. Very rounded overall balance. They both have great Treble control Tozo has a better bass control in my opinion (could be due to bigger in size). They both have great level of details.Samsung: 9Tozo: 105. Earbuds quality:They both look very decent and durable. Samsung however looks very luxurious while Tozo looks like the one that you could toss it around.Samsung: 10Tozo: 96. Convenience and comfort:Samsung earpieces are smaller. I have many time touched the control by mistake. Tozo is bigger so no problem. Samsung is lighter. I think they both winner but I think it will be up to what you like. I prefer the lighter earbudsSamsung: 10Tozo: 107. Active Noise CancellationThey are both excellent. I could not hear my water heater's fan running in a room 30feet away from me it is very loud without Active Noise Cancellation. But I still hear my kid yelling though. I think they are as good as Bose QC35-II I have or better.8. Battery lifeOn theory spec Samsung wins I dont know for sure have not used continuously 8-10hours to know the different. I have used Tozo about 2 hours last night go to bed not put them in the case in the morning they have about 60% on one and 50% on the other. Tozo charging case however has bigger capacity of juice. I think you will be happy with both.9. Price price priceTozo win. 60$ vs 150$ MSRP10. DurabilityDont know for sure time will tell-------------------------Conclusion: I would choose TOZO NC9 Plus Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds over Samsung Bud+ due to their well rounded detail sound quality and price.
4,Everything was fine. I have three pairs of these headphones. Then my charging case stopped charging one of the earbuds to full charge its always red. Then one day after charging the case for the first time it will not stop "charging." The lights are full on the case like its plugged in and charged up but nothing is happening. I cannot charge the case anymore and it will not charge other items like advertised. Its only a matter of time before I cannot charge my earbuds now that I cannot charge my case. I guess I will have to use one of the other cases and throw one out. What a waste of money.EDIT: Started a waranty claim with TOZO and they are sending a new charging case no questions asked. This is great tech support. Very happy with this. I will hopefully make it through more than one charge with the charging case. They last so long and the battery capacity is so large that it takes a while for me to run out the charging case.
5,El bajo es excelente
5,I probably have close to 1000 Amazon purchases and very few reviews let alone a review with a picture just to validate the review. That means they’re either horrible or exceptional. These are EXCEPTIONAL! *for their price point*. I paid around $70.What I like:- BATTERY BATTERY BATTERY!! I’ve had them about 2 months not certain and it’s still on the original charge! That’s bananas. Granted I don’t use them often maybe 4-6 hrs a week but they last longer than my Apple Airbuds. The case is still at 61%!- The fit is the best I’ve had in wireless buds. I have Airbuds ( they shouldn’t even be called Airbuds something more like Apple Floorbuds) and Bose noise cancelling buds (I don’t know what model I think I paid about $225+). Neither of those fit as well as these. I was constantly messing with the Bose which don’t fit in my ear canal as well and they seem heavier. These come with so many ear pieces you should be able to find the perfect fit.*I’ve not done a workout with them so I can’t speak to that but based on the way they fit I would be surprised if you had a problem*- Sound quality is really “good”. But when you consider the price I would rate the quality as “great”. I use mostly use Napster and it has Earprint which allows me to bring down the bass frequencies. Out of the box they’re heavy in the 64hz - 120hz range. Bringing that down removes some muddy bass. If you have reasonable expectations for this price you’ll be more than happy. - Signal reception is “very good”. They’re better than the Bose and about equal to the Airpods.Eh:- The touch feature for noise cancelling and pause/play can be a little finicky. The Airbuds do win that category but these are “okay”.- Noise cancelling expectations should be tempered. I’d describe it as more of an added muffle. The Bose win this category but unless that feature is most important the price of the Bose aren’t worth the upgrade.Overall - Just buy them! I’d be surprised if you’re disappointed. If you are I suppose you’re wanting a Mercedes at a Toyota price.I’m giving it 5 stars because the total package at $70 is just too good to deduct a star for noise cancellation. I’m buying a second set just to have on-hand. These would be a good high school graduation gift or a birthday present.*I have no connection to this company and certainly haven’t received any incentive for this review… BUT I’d be happy if they sent me a pair!*
5,Music
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Tozo NC9 Plus is my latest earbud purchase and I find it to be an excellent product for a very reasonable price.The earbuds and case are a combination of black matte and shiny plastic which is very visually appealing. The earbuds are larger than average this comes down to a design that both manages to hold a large battery life and achieve comfort. The earbuds can last 10 hours without the active noise cancellation.The comfort of earbuds is top-notch I previously had other earbuds which I would keep in my ears while listening to music and laying down or have my ear press against something else this resulted in discomfort and headaches without me realizing what the cause was however I’ve been able to wear these earbuds in complete comfort. Additionally it is very stable within your ear if the shape of the earbuds matches your ear which it does for me then as a result it will be extremely stable and there is a little worry of dislodging it during activities such as exercise.I’ve compared this earbud to Tozo NC2 and I have found that the active noise cancellation is just as effective however the transparency mode does not amplify the surrounding environment as dramatically. This may sound like a negative however I suspect that many will find that it really isn’t necessary to have the buzzing of their refrigerator or the sound of leaves outside rustling amplified to such a large degree instead they are simply looking for a way to maintain partial awareness of their environment.The case for the earbud is quite large however it is comparable to other cases for earbuds. The interesting thing about the case is that it has the dual function of being an external battery pack it is designed with the battery capacity to charge the earbuds with 160 hours of music worth of power. It has a port to insert a USB plug that can be used to charge your phone or other devices. This is a great way to add functionality to the case that would otherwise just be taking up space.The sound is good. I am not a audiophile I’m not talented in telling whether the bass or tremble is being accurately depicted by an earbud. However I will say that this is superior to the majority of headphones or earbuds I’ve used in my life I enjoy the sound and think that most people will be satisfied by it. I use these earbuds to listen to music audiobooks YouTube clips and video games and it suits my purpose in all of these cases.In conclusion I recommend Tozo NC9 Plus as a wonderful product.
4,Everything is great except others have trouble hearing me talk. It keeps cutting out for them. I can usually hear them just fine. Good sound quality and battery life. I like that I can charge another device in pinch. Not sure if the “cutting out” has something to do with any background noise on my end or what? Even in a quiet setting it still gives the caller problems. Other than that I’m happy with it.
5,Worth the price
5,Excelentes auticulares la cancelación de ruido hace lo que promete el producto. La sincronización es muy fácil
5,If you are looking for a quality set of earbuds at a great price odds are Tozo has the pair for you. But they make a lot of models and it can be hard to know which is best. I’m hoping I can help narrow it down a little.I had a pair of T12s that I loved but I lost. (Don’t worry I later found them). So I bought the NC9s as a replacement. They were very different. The Form factor is different and didn’t stay as firmly in my ear as the T12s.  It the ANC was really good on the NC9s. So good I couldn’t hear my wife talking sitting next to me on the couch (score!😋). But they are also reaaaaaly bassy which isn’t really my thing.So now enter these new NC2 Plus. NC for noise canceling and plus for the extra large battery size. The ANC in these is not nearly as strong as the NC9s. But good enough. But the sound is so much better for my taste. The base is not as thick as the 9s but still bigger and more robust than the T12s.Also they brought the things I love a ours the T12s case- wireless charging and a digital readout of the battery charge level. And the battery life on this thing is phenomenal. So much that it can double as a power bank for your phone if you are in a pinch. But that does come at a cost. The case is larger and substantially heavier than the others. But not so heavy that I can’t carry it in my pocket.I’m including a photo of this case (far right) next to the NC9 case next to Apple AirPod case for reference.Even though the price is a little higher on these I think it’s worth it. The sound is perfect for what I want. I love the form factor of the buds and they fit securely in my ear. I can’t go back to the other two now that I have used these. And the monster battery life is just bonus.Edit: one item I wanted to add is that I wish the NC2 pluses didn’t have the voice telling you when it’s in ANC or transparent mode. For one the voice doesn’t match the voice that alerts of pairing connections and the pronunciation of “transparent” is clearly from  a non-English speaker. It makes the interface seem thrown together.update: after 6 months of use these are still my favorite earbuds. The battery life is outstanding. I think I only charge the case about once a month of that much. It just keeps going and going. My go to grocery store buds!
3,I have these and the T12 (not noise cancelling). Can't really tell the difference and these are much more expensive. The ANC doesn't do much. Transparent mode just sounds like they add a bit of fuzz in the background doesn't really amplify the ambient noise. And between ANC on and ANC off I can't tell the difference at all they both sound like the T12 regardless of how much ambient noise there is.
5,These are excellent earbuds!Tozo is a quality brand with outstanding customer service. I have multiple versions of their earbuds. All are slightly different. These are the most advanced & I really love them.1) Very easy to pair-just take out of the case (they turn on automatically when removed) turn on blue tooth pairing on your device select NC9. That's it! (One note my left bud wouldn't pair at first. I realized it wasn't charged so I charged it fully. Then they both paired instantly)2) Excellent sound quality3) Easy to use features. Easy to adjust while in ears.•Right earbud: Press once to turn off. Press & hold 3 seconds to turn volume up.•Left earbud: Press once to turn on transparency mode. (This is so you can listen to music but still hear noise around you i.e. talking door opening etc.) Press again to turn on ANC. (Automatic Noise Canceling works great & you won't be disturbed by surrounding noises unless they are loud.) It even says which mode you are selecting in case you aren't sure. Press and hold 3 seconds to turn the volume down.3) Great for talking on the phone. Sound is good; the caller can hear you well & not the background noises.4) The case shows what percentage they're charged. Plus it shows bars for each bud that blink while they charge. (Just like on a phone more bars for a fuller charge) That way you can tell if there are currently charging & how full each one is. If you don't have one in the case correctly you can tell by the bars.)5) The case itself has dots along the front that light up to show when it's charging & how full the charge is.6) They fit securely & don't fall out. They also come with a range of tips to fit any ear securely.The only downside for me is that the buds themselves are a tiny bit large for my small female ears. The fit on the inside is good but I would prefer the rest of the bud to be a little smaller for a more comfortable fit. Maybe I'm just used to smaller earbuds. But the shape is good & I forget about them being in quickly.
4,I have owned several TOZO earbuds. I have T6 T12 NC2 & now these NC9Plus. These are by far the best ones so far. I have been happy with all of them however they are all a bit different. My 2nd favorite ones were the T12's because of their sound quality but I ordered several replacements and they all had issues with phone call quality and ultimately someone stole them so I no longer have them. I am hopeful that this issue will eventually be resolved. The NC2's sound good however they always feel like they are going to fall out of my ears and sometimes do. These NC9Plus are the best solution overall so far. They sit in my ear snug so they never feel as if they will fall out. The sound quality is supreme. The noise cancelling is subtle but effective. The noisec cancelling on the NC2's were far more noticeable. The call quality is best on the NC2's so far but the NC9Plus have adequate phone call quality as well. I use my earbuds consistently during the day and put them away in the charging case when I'm not using them so I don't know anytime about the listed superior battery life. This feature also is the reason why I think the charging case is larger and heavier than any of the others but that is no issue to me since I don't carry that case around but I do keep it nearby so I can put the earbuds away when I'm not using them. The charging case is attractive and simple. The charging case also has 2 USB type ports for use as a power bank which could come in handy in a jam. No other TOZO earbuds offer this feature to my knowledge. Wireless charging is also a nice feature to have when I don't have access to a USB-C port.TOZO products just keep getting better and better so I'm always l👀ing forward to their next product release to see current improvements and added features.
5,I went and lost my beloved NC9s  which I absolutely adored and I upgraded to the NC9plus! I was wary that I wouldn’t like them as much because I was so attached to my originals! But they are really good! I love the new case! The new case you can even charge your phone with it in a pinch! I love how they automatically connect when you open the case and they will disconnect when you put them back in the case and close the lid as well. (My NC9s couldn’t do that and I had to usually turn my Bluetooth off and back on when I wanted to stop using them.) The day after the NC9plus came in the mail naturally I found my old NC9! I had assumed when this happened the pluses would become my backups but they’ve actually become my go to and my NC9 are my back up LOL
5,I've bought TOZO earbuds years ago to have something to use for work. They worked well were a great price but were just okay.This is completely different level and it's clear they've made big strides. I recently accidentally ruined one of my Jabra earbuds and went a couple months without a replacement. I came across these earbuds and found they had very similar features to the Jabras. The price is very competitive especially with the coupon available. I was blown away by the performance. The sound quality is very nice and clear and the ANC/Transparency modes work about as well as other name brands I've tried. Pairing was easy and the charging case is pretty awesome. Gives you battery levels of each bud and also a % value for the case charge level so you know exactly how much battery is left. The fit is nice they're not overly large for all the features and quality packed into them.Battery life was decent maybe slightly less than my Jabras. I'm not sure which mode would consume less battery - ANC mode sounds like it would use more battery but I know Transparency mode utilizes the mic input. But it was good enough to where it wasn't really an issue. Calls came through clear on both ends.The controls are capacitive touch on each earbud. Fairly intuitive and I think I prefer it to having actual buttons to press (no more having to push your earbud into your ear to change volume/song). Sometimes when I go to adjust the earbud I'll accidentally touch the pad but I prefer that to having to press. The way the controls are setup an accidental press just results in pausing your song or going from ANC to Transparency mode. No big deal - it's not like it'll skip your song.Overall I was very impressed by these earbuds and would highly recommend them. I don't think there's enough of a jump in any facet to warrant spending >$100 on a name brand unless you're a serious audiophile when these offer just as good sound quality for far less.
4,The Tozo NC9Plus arrived via Amazon Prime on time and in undamaged condition. As I've come to expect from Tozo the headphones were professionally packaged. Instructions include both a quick start guide and users manual in 6 different languages (English Chinese German French Italian and Spanish).The case seems solid and contains a display of the current headphone charge level of both the case and both left and right earbuds. The case charges via wireless (wireless charging base isn't included but you probably already have one of those) or using a USB type-C connection (cable included) in the front.Pairing with both my iPhone Apple Watch was seamless.The key feature of these earbuds is noise cancellation. The earbuds operate in Tozo's "ANC Mode" (Active Noise Cancellation) and "Transparency Mode". I can't speak to use of these in an environment containing production machinery they were great next to a busy road.When compared to my pair of Sony WH-1000X M3 was the noise cancellation feature as significant? No...but comparing over-ear headphone vs earbuds at 1/3 the price and for my use (primarily outdoor fitness activities) it's a worthwhile tradeoff.Fidelity was good with a good range of bass (if perhaps a little on the hot side) treble and highs. I found them more than suitable for my training runs on paved trails off-road mountain runs and sidewalks near busy roads.According to the documentation the earbuds also support communication with various voice assistants. Though I can't speak to integration with Android or Google-based devices they worked okay with Siri on my iPhone. But I do have one minor complaint: I couldn't get the triple-tap assistant activation on the left earbud to work (it kept flipping back and forth between ANC and Transparency mode). It worked fine on the right earbud. Your mileage may vary.
5,I didn't know what to expect with these headphones.  They look great on paper but the relatively unknown brand (I do own a pair of the cheaper Tozo T6) and much lower price compared to comparable earbuds made me somewhat skeptical.  So far however nearly the entire experience has been superb.  The sound quality is quite good the active noise cancelling works well and they fit in my ears reasonably comfortably.  They pair to my devices immediately and so far the battery life seems very good.  My only complaint is that I had an issue with wind noise the first time using them; the ANC seemed to amplify the noise to the point where I couldn't hear my podcast.  I tried to switch them to "transparent" mode but that didn't seem to help.  However I haven't had that issue since that first time so I'm not convinced it's an ongoing problem.  Other notes: I haven't had the chance to test out the active noise cancellation in environments where I really care about it (on airplanes specifically) and I can't yet speak to longevity.I can compare these to two other sets of headphones: the Tozo T6 and Bose QuietComfort II.  Those span the full spectrum from ultralight wireless buds to full over ear with active noise cancellation.  As you might expect these land right in the middle.  They seem more refined than the T6 and actually seem to fit my ears better despite their larger size.  They connect faster sound better and their microphone seems clearer as well.  To zeroth order the NC9s ANC seems pretty similar to the Bose QCII.  However I'd have to do a side-by-side in an airplane or while mowing the lawn to really make that determination.  I still use the Bose for all day comfort but I think I could probably wear these if I didn't already have the Bose.Overall the performance is quite good and the low price means the value is exceptional.
5,When I bought these ear buds I was honestly not expecting much due to the price point. I am absolutely flabbergasted.I work in a large manufacturing facility and mostly bought these for the advertised ASC mode (noise cancellation) which works exceptionally well. A lot of the guys who have worked here for years have hearing damage even when wearing your typical in-the-ear rubber ear plugs. The only way to come close to the effectiveness of these ear buds is to have an ear-plug in with ear-muffs over the top. They work that well.Transparent mode is useful for going between the office and the shop and still offers some noise cancellation. I can carry on a conversation without straining to hear while still not being inundated with noise.The audio quality is superb. By far the best audio quality out of any ear buds I've ever used. These earbuds blow the big bulky over-the-ear gaming headphones I have out of the water. The sound is well-balanced; bass is responsive and deep but doesn't have the "boosted" (washed poorly equalized) sound I've come to expect from earbuds. The highs are crystal clear. It isn't EQ'd to a "Powerful" profile like many cheap ear buds I've used.Bluetooth coverage/range is much better than I expected as well. I've had no random disconnects and no stuttering.Battery life is outstanding as well. I've used them for 8 hours in ASC mode after which the battery did finally die. They charge quickly and the portable battery charger/pack has recharged the earbuds daily for over a week before needing another charge.If you're looking for a good set of earbuds go no further. Definitely recommended. Will buy again (for my wife and kids) and probably as Christmas gifts for my farming family.I can't praise these enough.
3,These seem to get rave reviews and they are good soundwise. However I have normal size ears but these things are really bulky and I find them hard to keep in regardless of tip used.  They should be about 10-20% less circumference wise and about 30% less deep of a body.Update: tozo seem to know this.  NC7 are exactly the same except 20% smaller. And they are newerbthsn these despite their strange numbering system.  Yes nc7 is newer than nc9 and they don't have nearly as many reviews. But get the 7s.  Splurge for the nc7 pro if you want to get app compatibility and periodic firmware upgrades.
3,Just got them but my first impression that these are really nice. Seem to be great quality. The ANC to me works very well. Transparency isnt as good as airpods but works fine. Sound quality is great. Ill definitely put them through their paces. I plan to use them working my cars air tools cutting and grinding. Update: So far they are fantastic talking on the phone hands free im told i come in clear but they can hear background noise of what ever is going on clear too but its not bad at all. The transparency mode will noise cancel really loud noise and the anc works very well. Sound clarity is fantastic. I spent the day cutting metal with an angle grinder and welding. Could barely hear the grinder especially with music playing.  They fit well under my welding helmets and i get 10hrs of play time with these! I looked at tons of different earbuds and these fit every check point. Just buy them!!!!Update 5/11/212 complaints. Sometimes they cut out and have to be reconnected but its rare. My other issue using them during a call. Sometimes i can be heard completely fine Sometimes the background noise switches to extra loud to the other person can not hear anything but the background. Unfortunately this happens more often than not. And there is never a time where the background noise isn't heard in hd. That being said i noticed that the transparency mode isnt even close to what a person on the other line can hear either so that seems very backwards.Other than those issues i am still fairly satisfied. Hopefully tozo nails it on the next ones.6/8/21 update. And so it begins. Ive put them through there paces. Talking on the phone is impossible. Randomly cuts your voice off and concentrates the other person on all your background noise only. Im more pissed about it because its a feature i didnt know i wanted lol. But the big issue here battery life...i was getting around 9-10hrs. Its slowly getting lower and lower im getting 5hrs now. Yesterday after charging for 4hrs i got only 30min out of them.... using them for an hr this morning so no idea what happened yesterday. But either way im only getting 5hrs now so they are on their way out. Sent Tozo an email so ill see what happens next.
5,A recent patch on our phones decided to no longer play nice with a different brand of ear buds bluetooth so it seemed like a good time to upgrade.The NC9 plus hybrid have surprisingly good sound quality to go with the noise cancellation feature.The case also lights up and shows you not only that it's charging but the percentage left.If your ear bud isn't seated properly or how I found out if you forget to take off the little plastic tape covering the charge connection on the earbuds the case will beep at you to let you know. Very handy to always know what you think you're charging is doing it flawlessly.I would like to see some foam offerings for the ear pieces as well but this pair had a large selection of water resistant tips to find an easy fit.MORE THOROUGH UPDATE:The sound quality and noise cancellation are the highlights for sure. The sound quality of these to my ears is far better than I would have expected for the price point. This is definitely a shining point.I'd like to make a point again though that while these will absolutely stay in your ears well using the wide selction of included tips they can get a little uncomfortable after extended use. I am someone that prefers foam tips though so keep that in mind. These will definitely be more of an aggressive hold but also provide a more dynamic sound so keep in mind the trade offs.I have been using these mostly while hiking often in relatively windy hilly terrain and they have been perfect for worry free use.Oh the feedback from the controls is a little too overpowered in your ear. Slight gripe and maybe I can find out if there's a way to reduce it. If there is a way I'll try to remember to add an edit in about it.
5,Price
5,As a return customer of TOZO I am again very satisfied with a great pair of earbuds. These earbuds are very sleek and stylish functional and has great quality.The first thing I noticed about these earbuds is the improved charging case. Although it has an increase in size it is for the benefit. The compact charging case packs an impressive 2500mAh. It allows me to continuously charge my earbuds and not have to worry about running out of battery.The most impressive point about the charging case is that I can use it as a PORTABLE CHARGER. There is a type-c outlet along with a USB outlet on the charging case. Since the case can hold so much charge I can easily charge my phone along with my earbuds at my convenience. This is not listed in the description of the earbuds so I don't know it is was also meant to be used like this but it works.I also really enjoy the sound quality of these earbuds. They are the best you are going to get at this price range and they are very comfortable as well. I can wear these earbuds for hours on end and still not be uncomfortable. The earbuds have a good amount of bass and has good noise canceling. There is also a transparent mode which allows you to hear your surroundings. I enjoy using a mixture of both to be aware in my setting or to space myself out if I want to.Ultimately these are a great pair of earbuds that have great sound quality and its strong suit is in its battery life. Personally I would put these earbuds at my desk or use while driving around since the charging pack has such a vast capacity. These are also good for on the go since the charging pack can also be used as a portable charger for my cell phone.
5,The headphones are packaged very well. Opening the box you can feel the quality of the packaging. The contents include extra headphone sizes a large battery case and a short charging cord. Initial pairing was so easy by just going to Bluetooth settings and the range of the headphones are outstanding. The size of the headphones are slightly larger than some but they fit into your ear very nicely and do not fall out of your ear as easy as other headphones I’ve tried in the past. The noise canceling is really good however I have other TOZO products that have AMAZING noise canceling and I’m comparing against another model I bought for my son. The star features of these headphones are the sound quality and the large battery case. The battery life is very long and if that is what you were looking for these are the headphones for you. The storage case feels quality and the lid closes nicely almost feeling like it’s magnetic. I have used these headphones when doing worked outside in the yard and while exercising. As I said the ear buds stay in your ears snuggly without falling out and I like them very much compared to other well known ear buds I have used. The wireless case is a little larger than some but you get the outstanding battery charging case. The battery case will be great to travel with because it has such a strong battery life. The headphones pair consistently every time I take them out of the case with my iPhone. They have a dual microphone that is handy for making calls. I really like TOZO and I find myself purchasing their products because of the consistent quality and value for the money. The 18-month warranty is great and is easily activated through a QR code scan. They also work on a Qi charger which is important to me. These headphones are recommended.
4,The Tozo NC9 Plus is an upgraded version of the NC9 which is decent in its own right. The buds are a worthy contender but do they hold up to their price point?Lets’s talk sound quality NC quality and battery life. First these sound pretty good for buds. I typically prefer cans but the driver size on the NC9 elevates it above other buds at this price point. The bass is punchy and the range while limited handles genres that need it like classical well.  Because of the driver size though the fit is a little bulky. Sound quality 4/5NC is average. You will not hear much around you when listening to music but this is in tandem with the NC and the seal created by the bud. The NC on its own is average and can start to function little weird in windy conditions. However it does seem to be better in the NC9 Plus vs. the NC9.  NC Quality 3/5.Battery life: This was already good with the NC9 but the Plus improves upon it more. You can go a while without charging them depending on your usage. The case is better than the previous one and has a higher wattage. Battery life is very important when it comes to wireless buds. I give these 5/5 stars.Overall a step above the NC9. I would say spend the extra money and get this version if you are stuck between the two. If already have the NC9 I don’t think it’s worth the upgrade.
4,These earbuds sound great are comfortable and have great battery life.Unfortunately these earbuds do not allow you to raise or lower volume during calls. You also won’t have the ability to switch between ANC or Transparency mode during calls; whatever setting is enabled before a call is the feature that would be used before a call.This was confirmed to me by email from the support team.By today’s standards these are extremely crucial features to have during calls and it can be interpret as misleading on the seller’s part to not mention this lack on the product page.Furthermore when I emailed support they did not seem to care. Thankfully Amazon refunded me.Update (18/03/22): I continued to use these earbuds and I must say that they have held up. I still miss being able to switch transparency mode on and off during a call but I’ve learnt to live without it. I just respect that these have lasted as long as they have.
4,I have loads of high quality and premium audio gear great headphones iem's and dacs. Now don't expect the kind of quality you would get from a good dac and a pair of premium headphones but damn it's convenient. No wires heavy gear throw in a little ANC good call quality and long run time this is what I need when I'm on the go. Now don't get me wrong the audio quality is pretty good and from what I've experienced way better than other brands that cost much more.It's pretty light and very comfortable. It's larger than what I expected but not by much really don't notice them after a while. Passive mode works great and ANC is just ok. Audio lag is there and I've tested on multiple devices but hey I knew there would be there's no AptX or LDAC or similar codecs that would help reduce latency. I found that disabling Dolby Atmos and any digital processing on the audio signal helps with this. Listening to music is of course no problem. The audio quality is very good bass mids and high have good separation. Slightly warm and enjoyable.The case is on the larger side but still pocketable. The magnets are strong and the buds work independently. Visual battery indicators are a plus but most devices show you the battery level of the buds anyway. The case is a bit hard to open but it's more than manageable. You won't be disappointed with these and for the price it's a pretty good deal.
5,I've bought more than 15 different pairs of wireless earbuds ranging from $50 - $150. But this is the first time that I was more than surprised by $80 earbuds. There were barely any cons and so many pros so I'm going to list them out:Cons:- there is some static noise when you turn on the "Transparency Mode"- the case is pretty big- when you use 2 earbuds at the same time you can't play/pause using the left earbud ONLY right earbudthat's all there is for the cons and now for the prosPros:- the case doesn't feel cheap- the LED lights add to the design and tell you when the case is low on charge- the inside of the case has a percentage of battery for both the case and earbuds- the case magnet and earbud magnet are standard- the entire case and earbuds have a battery life of about 120 hours- the design of the earbuds make it comfortable to keep in my ear for multiple hours- the earbuds don't get loose or fall out of my ear- touch pad has normal functions- "Noise Cancellation Mode"  keeps out about 80% of all surrounding noise (I compared the latest "Beats" noise cancellation headphones to these earbuds and the noise cancellation on these earbuds are much better)- fast pairing and connection- Transparency mode is neat and works really well- I compared the audio and mic to the original airpods and these earbuds are ALMOST better than themI covered everything I could think of and once again these earbuds are my favorite and would most likely be in the top 10 of the best BUDGET earbuds.
5,I've been using the Tozo NC9 Plus earbuds for about a week now and let me say wow!  These are not what most people would call cheap but they are a tremendous value.  The sound is balanced well with bright highs and lows that are surprisingly deep.  The midrange seems to be scooped but not too much.  I am kind of a headphone nut as I own Bose QC35's. Apple AirPods 1 2 and Pro plus several studio grade headphones that I use for work (music recording).  The noise cancellation works well I was able to mow with very little sound penetration.  They also have a transparency mode much like the AirPods Pro although it doesn't work quite as well.  The touch controls work well and even has the ability to adjust volume that is handy when your phone is across the room and a louder song comes on.  I haven't flown with them yet so I can't comment on how well they deal with pressure change.  The case is a bit larger form factor than any of the AirPods so I would probably only carry them if I was traveling and had a backpack but that brings up a positive feature these have the ability to charge your phone from the case that could be handy on a long day of flying.  For the price range these are in they most definitely compete with higher end offerings and I would put them in the same grouping as AirPods Pro.  They are definitely better than AirPods 2 in my opinion.  So if you are thinking of buying those you should at least give these some consideration.
5,My usual earbuds are a pair of Apple Airpod Pros. I thought I'd try out the TOZO NC9 Plus as possible backup earbuds.  I was prepared to only use them if absolutely necessary. I was pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is good. They are comfortable in my ears. They hold a charge for a heck of a long time.The microphone seems to be decent. I made a few calls to my wife with both the Tozo and my Airpods to see how they compared. I can't say the Tozo was quite as clear as the Airpods but considering how much they cost it was amazingly close.  I have tried a few other cheap earbuds and that was their downfall.  My friends and the associates often couldn't make out what I was saying.I do find it a little easier to use the controls on the AirPods. I'm accustomed to the tactile sensation of pinching the stems. However I think the more I use the Tozos the more I'll get used to that tapping motion.  I've already learned that they respond better to a slower firm tap instead of a quick bounce.All in all I think they are a great value and I'm glad I decided to give them a try. I did try out the Sony WF-1000XM4 (yeah… $275). The ANC was pretty good but after 30 minutes they hurt my ears. I returned them. I actually prefer the Tozo.Time will tell how well they hold up but at this point I give them an enthusiastic five stars.
3,Upgrade from a pair of Tozo ear buds that I wore out. I sleep with these so comfort is as important as quality. Very comfortable great sound but the left ear piece quit working in less than a month. Sent back for replacement which should be here soon.  Hoping the new ones last much longer.
5,I purchased this new Tozo NC9 to replace my older Tozo earbuds.  I wanted to have a noise cancelling earbuds since it’s more discreet and easier to travel with than an over the ear type headphone.  After two weeks of using them I feel the NC9 is a vast improvement over the T10 in both comfort and sound.  I can wear the NC9 earbuds for hours without experiencing any discomfort in my ears like I used to have with the T10.  I can also run and jump around without having to worry about the earbuds falling off.  These seem to fit much better in my ear.The connections work flawlessly with the buds quickly connecting to each other and pairing to my phone after removing them from the case.When it comes to battery life I’ve been able to use them continuously for 6 hours so far. I don’t doubt it can last the claimed 10+ hrs playtime on one charge.  With the charging case this can handle all my long international flights.The noise cancelling feature works fine although probably not as good as an over the ear headphones.  In any case I'm happy with the trade off between noise cancelling and comfort and convenience of in-ear buds. There are two listening modes - active noise cancelling and transparency mode (you can hear some ambient sounds) and you can switch between modes by tapping the left bud once.  I find the transparency mode useful at the airport so I can hear some announcements without removing the earbuds.
5,They fit perfectly and work better than earbuds five times their price. Plus having the digital battery life on the case is very useful.
4,This is another great all-around product from TOZO. I have been using them for almost 2 months now and I am getting great quality out of them still. The noise cancellation does a great job of cutting out loud background noises while listening to music or podcasts. The battery life is good as well. Getting an average of 9-10 hours of use off of a full charge. They are also quite robust. I accidentally dropped them a few times but they don't show any signs of wear.My only issue would be that their connection cuts off randomly sometimes. You have to wait a couple seconds before they connect again automatically. Can be a annoying. If not for this issue then I would have given it five stars.
4,Overall these are pretty great I like that the case tells you exactly how much battery you have left (and the battery lasts a loooong time) the sound quality is comparable with much more expensive buds and they stay securely in my ears without fussing about the fit. The package comes with everything you need to get a good fit including 6 different tip sizes (flat and round) a nice little usb-c to usb charging cable and the case+buds of course.The only two critiques I have are:1) The case is pretty big not super pocketable but easy enough to toss in a bag or purse. This is a trade-off since it allows for a lot more battery life but just keep it in mind.2) One-bud use is a little bit tricky. There's no way to switch between the active noise-cancellation and transparency mode unless you have both in. I also wish there was a third option to turn off the noise assistance and just use the buds' isolation but that's a minor gripe.
5,I have been looking for a fairly priced wireless earbuds without sacrificing sound quality and comfort. I have practically bought at least ten different kinds of earbuds and was not totally satisfied. I finally succumb to the overpriced Apple AirPod Pro because I thought that was the answer. But when I got it I still was not totally satisfied. For one thing it was two inconvenient to adjust the volume of the airpod pro and then it still falls out of my ear. When I found the TOZO NC9Plus there was not too many reviews and I never heard of the Brand before but based on the description I decided to give it a try and boy I'm so glad I tried it. MY TOZO NC9Plus came fully charged. I paired it right away with my phone and listened to music and watch videos.  What a pleasant surprise.... I thought wowww... I think I finally found the wireless earbud that I'm looking for. The TOZO NC9Plus sounds GREAT the deep bass the sound clarity the perfect fit in my ear does not fall out of my ear and the battery life is very impressive.After two weeks of using my TOZO NC9Plus I can now say that I have finally found the right wireless earbud for me.  I am totally happy with my purchase and I will surely recommend this earbuds to my friends. It is much better than the Apple Airpod Pro that I have.
5,These are wonderful earbuds. The sound quality is on par with TOZO'z other earbuds all of which are phenomenal. Rich bass and clear sound. They paired very easily and the Bluetooth connection persisted even when I left the room. I can walk around the whole house and can still listen to music from my computer. I was initially worried that they wouldn't fit my ears because they seemed quite big but they come with a ton of different ear tip sizes so you can pick the one that fits your ear the best. They have great breathability while in your ear if you want to use them while working out or for extended periods of time.The battery easily lasts all day. and the case carries enough charge to refuel 2-3 times. I went a whole week without having the charge once. I also like the fact that the case has a USB output too so you can use it to charge up your phone in an emergency. Very versatile. The case shows the battery percentage of each earbud separately as they charge. This also serves as a clear indication that the earbuds are indeed charging making it impossible to accidentally put them back incorrectly and end up with uncharged earbuds. I usually just charge using the included cable but the case does support wireless charging as well.
5,I own several earbud sets including Anker Soundcore and Samsung Galaxy Buds +. Until now the Galaxy Buds + were by far my favorites and reference point. After receiving Tozos NC9s I may choose them instead. First of all the sound quality is superior to other earbuds I own. The bass is a bit heavier than on Buds+ which I like. The sound resolution depth and isolation are much better on Tozos. Tozos are heavier but more comfortable in my ears. They are rated at IP6 whereas Samsungs have no waterproofing of significance. Tozos have digital battery level display which is very nice. They finally have a surprisingly well working ANC function that Buds+ do not have. The downside of the Tozo product may be the size and heaviness of the case. I may easily slip the Samsung case in my jeans pocket and carry it comfortably.. Doing the same with Tozo case may be a bit problematic. Tozos do not have dedicated app which does not really bother me as the sound equalization may be performed on the phone without dedicated app. They do not have ability to control the volume on the earbuds which Buds+ do have but I find it difficult to operate anyway. The battery life is very good although not as good as Buds+. The wireless charging function works well. Overall extremely good earbuds.
5,amazing
2,They seemed great at first! I liked the option of having either one in and the different AMC modes.Then the left ear bud started going out about a month in. It was having a weird white noise when it was in AMC mode. I took them out and put back in case to reset and it seemed OK the next time. Then a couples weeks later it did it again all of the sudden in the middle of mowing. Went inside to check and it still made that white noise. I've tried emailing the manufacturer but haven't heard back. 😕I had the panosomi brand before and it worked for years until I accidentally sent them through the wash....
5,These are great comfortable and stay in the ear even when running. Sound is great and love how long the charge lasts!
5,This is my 4th pair of Tozo earbuds (T10 T12 NC9 NC9+) and these are by far the best ones that I own! (impressive new battery capacity compared to the NC9') I've used these for mowing the lawn/tending to the yard vacuuming the house taking phone calls and working at my computer. I can certainly say that for the price these are the best earbuds that I currently own. I was quite impressed by the noise cancelling feature of these they do a fantastic job blocking out external sounds when sound is coming through so that I can focus on my music or phone call. Transparency mode is a great feature as well and is extremely easy to activate/deactivate by simply tapping the outside of the left earbud. I was blown away by how much external noise gets blocked out by the noise cancelling feature. When working at my desk during these hot Summer months I have several fans running but once I put these earbuds in and start listening to some music the other sounds melt away and I can immerse myself in the music effortlessly. I absolutely love these earbuds and the overall packaging/design of these is sleek/clean as well. I would definitely recommend these to anyone in the market for a new set of bluetooth earbuds!
5,These are great earbuds for what I need (day to day normal life listening)!See some of the points I noted:- Easy pairing process: take them out the case turn on bluetooth pairing on your device select NC9 and they are ready to go- Satisfying sound quality - comfortable in my ears for everyday use.- There are many features that make your life easier:• Right: Press once to turn off. Press & hold 3 seconds to turn volume up.• Left: Press once to turn on transparency mode. Press again to turn on ANC (Automatic Noise Canceling) which works great & you won't be disturbed by surrounding noises unless they are loud)- Great for talking quality during the phone call. For everyday use and my work/conference calls.- The case shows what percentage they're charged. Plus it shows bars for each bud that blink while they are charging.- The case itself has LED lights along the front that light up to show when it's charging & how full the charge is.- They also come with a range of tips to fit any ear securely. They fit securely & don't fall out.Tozo is a quality tech brand - I have multiple products from them and all are good quality.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These earbuds despite their low cost have really good active noise cancellation. I have a few decently high quality headphones / ear buds and I have to say the ANC on these ear buds is basically on par with those ones from my untrained ear.The sound quality is also surprisingly good given the price ($63 after coupon). The bass is a little light but that's how I prefer my sound anyways. The battery life seemed good I have only had these for about a week and store them in the case and haven't ran out of charge yet! The case is charged wirelessly which I was surprised by (I guess I didn't read the description well enough so that was an unexpected benefit. The Bluetooth range on these is on the low side compared to other ones but still good enough unless you are walking in different rooms than the audio source.Having both USB-A and USB-C was kind of strange but I'd rather have too many ports than too few so I can't knock them for that. Just caught me off guard. Not sure how often I'll use this to charge other devices since the battery is probably small (given the size) but it doesn't hurt at least!
5,I bought a pair of these because of the "transparency" feature which is opposite of the noise cancellation feature.  My son has a pair of the T12s which are nice too but don't have this feature.  I tested these out and the sound is really good with a solid bass.  The phone feature works well as I can be listening to a playlist and then take a call and I'm heard perfectly well through the built-in mic that's in the earbuds.  This mic apparently also works to let in external sounds so that you can both listen to music as well as hear what's going on around you.  You would still have to turn your sound down from full volume to have a conversation but it makes sense that you'd have to do that anyway.  And if something is reasonably loud you'll hear it instead of having the sounds around you completely blocked out (which I don't like).  So if you're looking for some earbuds that have noise cancellation as well as the ability to let sound in and that you can also use to talk on your phone these may be for you.
5,Very happy with these earbuds.  I have always found Tozo to offer a very good value proposition with regards to price/quality and these continue the trajectory of getting better and better with each new update.  The charging/storage box is solid and quality made with a good display of battery.  Another important consideration I was happy with was the size.  It is easy to get the buds in and out which can be a nuisance with smaller boxes.  The buds also fit very nicely in the ear and feel not only comfortable but also stable so you don't have the feeling they are going to fall out if you move your head too quickly (an important feature for an active/exercise focused product).  The sound quality is very nice with plenty of bass as well as clarity in the mid and higher tones.  Finally I liked that the controls are not too finicky.  On some models just trying to reposition in the ear can turn them on and off change volume etc.  These are well-thought out and easy to send a command when you actually intend to do so.  Overall I think a very good option in a competitive market.
5,tienen sonido claro y buen bajola cancelación del ruido le falta un poco pero está bien y la bateria dura bastante
5,Before having the TOZO NC9 Plus I have owned two other TOZO earbuds which I already liked very much. But this new pair is simply the best. The case and earbuds are both built with high quality. I have used Apple Airpod I can say TOZO actually gives you a feel of higher quality than Apple's. The earbuds fit ear tight with their advance design. You can easily sit them in your ears without worrying about losing them.The case itself is heavier than regular cases. It has a big battery that can charge not only the earbuds but also your phone when you on the road. Nice feature. I don't need to carry another battery bank with me anymore.The earbuds can be easily paired with my phone with the first shot. The sound quality is excellent with deep bass which I never got from any other earbuds or even headsets. Noise cancellation is on par with other earbuds that have the noise cancellation feature. I am not expecting the noise cancellation function would beat those big brothers - around ear noise cancellation headphones. But those big guys cannot be put in your pocket either. So I am happy with my highly portable and carriable TOZO NC9 Plus.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This review is for the Tozo NC9 Plus earbuds. I've owned a few pair of different models of Tozo earbuds and quite honestly all of them have been fantastic. This one is no exception and I feel has become my favorite. The sounds quality and bass are excellent. I honestly can't imagine the sound being any better it's crystal clear and the bass seems just right. They fit in the ear great and seem like they will stay in fine for running (I like to run with bluetooth earbuds paired to my galaxy watch). To pair you simply open the lid of the case and then scan with your phone. There are plastic coverings on the earbud metal connectors to recharge in the case that you should remove and place back in the case first before doing pairing for the first time. The case came fully charged at 100% which surprised me and the earbuds at 90%. These earbuds seem to be a higher end model of the Tozo earbuds so if you're looking for a higher end model these might be the right pair for you. They are a definite recommend from me.
5,Wow!!  First the packaging was great.  It definitely felt like I was about to open up a pair high quality earbuds.  My husband and I have been separately looking for the perfect earbuds for working out and I could immediately sense a hint of jealousy as I started opening and playing with mine!  That was the first time I knew these were worth buying.It comes with a charging case and multiple sizes to make sure these bad boys will fit any and all ear sizes.  The ones already installed work perfectly for me.When I first tried them on and played music I listened to Lizzo and the sound quality was AMAZING!!  It even had the perfect amount of base.  The second time I realized these were the earbuds for me was when I literally could not hear a single word my husband was saying to me while I was listening to music.  He was two feet away!  If the noise cancelling scares you there’s also a transparency mode.  Perfect for runners!Bottom line.  These are well worth every penny!  Happy listening!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I like that the charging case has a USB port to charge devices such as your cell phone… That’s a feature that many companies have not thought of. Pairing the earphones was super easy as well. The sound quality really surprised me. For the price point of these earphones I believe the quality is superb! I have Apple AirPod Pros and I think that these earphones go head to head with them. I’m excited to see with the battery life for these is like. It is supposed to be very very good so I’m hoping I can use them at the gym numerous times before I have to charge them. If I HAD to critique one thing I would say that the headphones feel extremely light. They just don’t give you the sense that they’re made of material that will last long. That being said…… I wrote “if I had to critique”… I’m not saying anything is wrong with them being light weight. All in all my impression of them is they’re definitely worth the money and you’ll get hours of great quality sound from them. Definitely would recommend!
4,Better battery life better battery case good not great noise cancelation.  Like the way they fit in the ears and provide a number of different buds for just the right comfortable fit.  I like to wear these to bed and listen to audiobooks the NC9+s do not dig in or hurt my ears when I roll on my side.  Also if you like audiobooks you can easily go the whole day using a first one bud then the other.  I do not have a charging base but use a USB charging hub.  What I discovered was that the new battery cased demanded a little more power than the hub provided as I watched the overnight charging result go from 91% down to 73% over about 5 nights.  Used  a stronger usb charger and it quickly restored to 100%.
5,This is an all around good product and cost less than some of the other competitors.  The sound quality is good and it's nice because they have the noise canceling mode and a mode that lets sound in if someone starts talking to you. This is great when I am out on a run because I want to be able to hear cars and other sudden noises while still hearing my music most of the time.  Also these stay in my ears very well they never fall out which is key.  The only downside is I am told for phone calls when I tested them out with a few people the other person says they don't hear me that well.  They say it sounds like I am in talking through a glass box and rated it at a 6/10.  I can hear them perfectly though.  I like how they pair very easily with bluetooth and work without any problems when I have just one in unlike some of the other models.  Overall I would 100% recommend these for everything except talking on the phone.
4,I used these to do yard work. I wanted to truly test the capability of these headphones and they did excellent. I can cut grass & don't have the damaging noise of the mower & can clearly hear my music. These also do well while gardening & don't fall out of your ears. Very comfortable for those with sensitive ears - if you're like me then some headphones aren't even a consideration because they are too painful to wear with these you'll forget they're there. The only issue I have with these is that if you want to only wear one you still have to pull both out to pair to your device then you can put the one you aren't going to use back in the case. Other than that these are great.
5,Completely blown away by the quality and tech of these buds. Not only do they sound great but they offer things buds THREE times as much don't. The fact that these last 160 hrs (I tested this) by itself is insane. The fact that the CASE will charge your phone is insane. And lastly the fact that these stay securely in your wars without any extra hooks or accessories is great as well. Now on to the sound quality.... I have compared these to the Airpod pros Sony WH1003 and my gym beats pro. These NC9+ keep pace with the high end brands in sound quality phone call mic quality and noise cancelation. If they're trailing behind it's only slightly. These are the best buds you can buy under the $200 mark. And the fact that these offer a case that is good for 160hrs and ALSO charges your phone makes these a win over the high end buds. I HIGHLY recommend them. They have replaced my gym buds- beats pro as well as my airpods pro. These are an absolute game changer and I can't recommend them enough!
5,These are probably the best sounding earbuds yet that I own. They fit in my ear perfectly and are comfortable. If the inserts don't fit your ear they come with a lot of extras. One set is bound to fit your ear shape. They also come with directions and a charging cable. Its all boxed very nicely and looks professional.  It has a backdrop style LED in the case showing the left and right earbud energy bars and an overall percentage.  A very nice addition to this case. The quality is crisp and clear with deep base. My favorite features for these is the transparency mode. These have the clearest transparency mode I have experienced. This mode is super nice when you want to work yet leave them in your ear for calls. I also use these running and like to leave this mode on when cars are coming for safety. The case is bigger than others and heavier but holds a very long lasting battery.
5,These are my 3rd pair of Tozo Earbuds. And they are just as great as the others!The noise cancellation and noise filtering is on par with the more expensive brands of earbuds. I’ve used it while mowing my yard and the sound of the mower is greatly reduced. It will cancel out conversation level noise. But things louder than a yell will be greatly reduced in volume.The sound quality is great as well. If you like your bass these buds will deliver. The highs aren’t super defined but are still great. I’m just a little picky. The battery life is amazing on these guys. You can go a whole day and still have battery left. I also really love the fit of these earbuds! They fit nice and snug. I prefer this fit over the AirPod style earbuds.If you’re looking for an amazing pair of wireless earbuds get these Tozo’s!!! The function and quality of these guys are on par with the top brand products out there.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             These are really good as in my favorite pair of earbuds I own. The sound is full lots of bass but keeping crisp highs and miss that are clear. Battery life is from another planet I listen to podcast and music a little over 90 minutes a day and I have owned them for 4 months and charged them new then only once after that and still are at 60%. The case has wireless charging as well as USB-C. This case ALSO has USB-A for charging your phone!! They pair quickly and painlessly and are just easy to pop in. Noise cancelling is superb and transparency mode is gold. I really am happy with these I have recommended these to many people. One last note they stay in your ear without making it sore sounds silly but very important.

I got these for myself as a birthday gift and they are the BEST. Impeccable noise cancellation! My girlfriend had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention. Their water drop-shaped design blows the airpods out the water and shiny piano-black texture sets these apart from the previous T6 model. The bass on these sleek little earbuds are impressive. Really puts you into the concert hall especially when listening to rave or metal. I think these fit into my ear better than the T6 (even though T6 had no issue on this front). I also immediately noticed that they have a way cooler charging box that shows you the battery level (though this box is slightly heavier than T6s).Overall these earbuds are a total steal at this price. You will not regret your purchase I can promise you that!
5,This is a great set of wireless headphones that is perfect for travel or to use at the gym. I liked that the case displays the battery life of the case as well as the individual ear piece. The case also charges wirelessly which is an added bonus. The ear pieces fits snuggly in my ear and does not fall out even during workouts. I also like the option to switch between noise cancellation and transparent  mode easily by tapping on the left ear bud just once. It comes in handy when you want to hear someone speak. The pairing process is also super easy to set up via Bluetooth and connects automatically when the case is opened. The sound quality is also nice and the volume is easy to control with a simple tap and hold. Overall this is a great product for the most discerning of users. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,This is a great improvement to the already impressive NC9 that I purchased a few months back.  The sound is richer bass is fuller but not too heavy to a point it distorts.  The ear buds fit snuggly and I can jog with them without any concerns.The case on the right as seen in the attached photo is larger than the one for NC9 on the left.  It has an additional USB B connector which I will explore later.  The new case also houses a bigger battery so I can travel with it without worrying about running out of juice.Overall with 20% coupon I feel this is a set of very practical wireless earbuds that I can wear for jogging working in the yards not to mention that I also use them for YouTubing and teleconferencing.I would highly recommend this improved version to NC9.
5,I have a little story. I was on vacation and this guy walks up to me and ask me if I wanted to buy a brand new pair of ear buds. I really didn't want to buy them so I did to help the guy out this was years ago. They where Tozo T10s never heard of them in my life. I was just going to throw them in a drawer at home. Had no interest in trying them. Well on the trip back I pop them in and was amazed. They sounded better than a 200 dollar pair. So no I just ordered the NC9 I hope they sound as good as the T10. I'll let you guys know my opinion.
5,The regular NC9 is what I use at work every day and I love them. These have some really good added features though. The case is very solid and has some good weight to it due to the bigger battery - hence extended battery life and the fact you can use it as a power bank for USB powered devices. That is a big plus for me. Also there is an LCD readout of the battery percentage of the case and each earbud on the inside of the case. The functionality is the same as the old NC9's and I like that i can pair them without having to put them in the case. So overall these are a very good upgrade. The only downside to these is that the noise cancellation is decent but they're still earbuds so it doesn't cancel all background noise but they're still good.
5,What's not to like about the ToZo Nc9 plus?  This is my second pair of ToZo earbuds I also have the T10 model with wireless charger which are still in excellent condition.  I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres of music and the Tozo Nc9 plus can deal easily with the varying bass levels and voice pitches throughout. They are very comfortable in ear more ergonomic than the T10’s and other market leader brands . Can't fault them so far and if the reliability of the T10’s is anything to go by the Nc9 plus should do well.Can't fault them as a brand they are excellent and less expensive than other brands . You probably could get cheaper but sound quality definitely would suffer  but at this price the Tozo Nc9 are good value and superb quality.
2,The microphone in this wireless earbuds kit sounds as though you're speaking through a tunnel and is horrible for use in any setting. Incoming audio overall comfort and battery life are fine for the price point but the size of the charging case coupled with the horrible outgoing audio quality is generally unacceptable.
5,Let me start with this: I had Tozo T6's and they were incredible but I lost one of the ear buds. So what does Tozo do? They friggin send me a pair of NC9 Plus' for free! What a power move that's beyond awesome. They have great customer service they get you taken care of. Now the Tozo NC9's are wonderful. They take a little time to break in (it can make your ears a bit sore) and there is a bit of a whining pitch when transparency mode is active and you have nothing playing in your ear buds but that's kind of par for the course when it comes to transparency in headphones. They sound great they work super well. The noise cancelling freaks me out sometimes by how much i don't hear (which is a good thing). I love them!
4,Great sound quality and blocks out background noise with ANC. However when making calls the background noise can be overwhelming for the caller.
4,Sound quality is quite good. These are miles above the old wired pair of Bluetooth earbuds I had. ANC is not bad but the "Transparency Mode" is fantastic at work. If someone comes into my cubicle I don't have to take my earbuds out just mute my music and we can have a normal conversation. Charging case feels solidly built and charges on my phone's wireless charger. I like being able to see the % charged. I was considering other more mainstream true wireless earbuds with ANC but at less than half the price I don't think you can beat these!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have been pleasantly by these Ear buds. They have great sound quality comfortable fit and super long battery life! The active bid cancellation is worth a 4/5 but for the price I think they’re the best out there.The comfortable fit is adorned with 6 different options for size and shape of the Ear piece. The way it’s design the thing starts in your ear buds Very well.Battery life is incredible and I love being able to steal some juice for my phone once in a while.The active noise cancellation is good. Not quite as good as Apple air pods pros. But those are 3 times more expensive. With the snug fit and noise cancellation you’ll be able to ignore your surroundings and focus better. I know I did.
5,This is my first foray into wireless as I've always liked the sounds quality of wired in-ear headphones. After reading all the reviews decided to try them given all the annoyances with wired  especially when working out. The instructions are very easy... open box power- on one of the buds pair with phone. Took all of a minute and all set. I was lucky in that the earpiece that came on it fit perfectly. I put on Winter Stayed by Armin Van Buuren and was astounded at the sound especially the bass. I listed to most of the song in shock at the quality of the sound. Tried some Def Leppard Snoop Dogg Indian classical and jazz. All sound amazing. Just buy it!!!
2,the charger only works with USB-C or regular USB not the lightning charger that your iphone or android that no longer has a port to plug in wired headphones. so the phones that drove you to buy a wireless headset has a lightning charger but this wired headphone option doesn't charge that way. fun!noise canceling is good. other functions are clunky unless you have fingers the size of a child.
5,Received product this morning. Love the charging case and size of earbuds. I had some issues getting the buds to pair on the first go but gave it a few tries and now all good. The main reason I purchased these is to listen to my TV. I'm 88% deaf in my right ear.  Dialogue clarity is very difficult for me especially when there is any kind of background noises (ex. Hubby cooking or doing tasks in kitchen). So far these are working great for phn use and easy peasy switch over to use with TV. Only issue so far is the connection to my LG tv is a lil iffy. They have lost connection multiple times with tv but most of the time they immediately reconnect.
2,The audio sound is fantastic but when calls come it they can’t hear me.  Absolutely the best if just listening to music!
5,This is my second set from Tomo. I had NC2 for a while though I really liked I wanted earbuds not sticking out from my ears.NC9 fits very well within my ears so they meets the purpose. Much hidden compare to NC2. However what I didn’t expect was the size and weight of the charger box. NC9 is much bigger than NC2 I carry it while I bike so the size matters and if you also do I suggest to get NC2.As for the sound NC9 sounds lot clear but lighter and wider they are weighted on higher frequency side. NC2 provides much deeper and narrower weights on base. They both sound good so I need to test for more which one to keep. (Another set goes to my family)
5,Wow.Wow.Wow. I bought the regular Tozo NC9 ears buds and LOVED and then lost them. I found this new version and noticed it had the LED for the case that better shows the battery power. I decided to pay the extra $20 to get that feature and this extra battery life. I am serious; these are better than the Airpods I used to have. The noise cancellation really works even when I am not listening to anything! I am able to tune out the TV when I want. I have not yet found a silicone case with carabiner but I am hoping to find one soon once these have been out for longer. As soon as these come in different colors I know what I am getting several family members for Christmas.
5,I've been a DJ for 10 years and know a few things about the quality of the sound from different devices.The basses of NC9 Plus are very deep and soft. The Trembles are high but not pitchy and the voice middles are very clear. No plasticky feeling in the spectrum from 20-20000MHz. I tried them on different musicians from hard rock to soft jazz and they performed flawlessly clearly reproducing all musical instruments that have been used. They sit in ears tight and very comfortably even when you are working out. Contemporary design and water resistance are great adds-on to already excellent  features. The battery life is even more than declared. In short: Get NC9 Plus and use them anywhere - it'll be your reliable friend.
3,These are a huge step up from my last pair of wireless headphones. Incredibly long lasting battery life is a major plus with these. The noise cancellation feature functions very well. I've had no issues with connectivity and it takes much much less time to connect these than any other headphones I've owned. The only downside is in sound quality. These headphones are definitely not very loud at all. They've been making their products quieter and quieter with each model and with this one in particular I find myself having to put it on the highest setting every time I use them. I know there is a doctor recommended db level and all that but if I'm paying 80 dollars for a pair of headphones they should be able to be very loud if I so choose they shouldn't have eliminated that as an option. For that reason alone I most likely won't be getting another pair of Tozo's but im still fairly satisfied with them in the meantime.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My old wireless earbuds finally went was looking on Amazon and remembered TOZO so I searched up for one of their newer ones and found these. I'm happy I found these cause they blow my old wireless earbuds out of the water. They have really good clear audio and the bass is amazing especially for the price the mic is also good. The noise cancelation works really well also the transparency mode too. Going from a low range earbud to these is night and day would recommend to anyone on a budget. Also some other plusses Wireless charging long battery life actually shows what percentage the case and earbuds are can use the case to charge my phone.
5,I already own a T6 which is a quality earbuds for the price. This one definitely sounds superior and has a rich sound and feel compared to T6. Pairing with my phone was a breeze. While listening to music I could distinctly hear all the instruments and was pleasantly surprised with the overall sourround sound experience sounds and feels like a high end more expensive earbuds. Very powerful bass. Satisfied with call quality as well. Have been using it for wfh meetings and audio is crystal clear and didnot have any connectivity issues. Noise cancellation works really well. Charging case also looks and feels like an upgrade with a digital display showing the battery life. Overall very happy with my purchase. Can't get better quality for the price.
4,Not sure how they’d be in a plane with the lower frequency noises but they do seem to take the edge off strret and appliance noise.. They’re pretty comfortable and they sound really good. Nice quality at a low price.
5,These upgrade TOZO NC9 Plus headphones are a good pair of earbuds.  The fit comfortably and it is easy to use the finger-touch controls.  Sound quality is very good.  The Noise-Cancellation mode is extremely effective to block out ambient background sounds.  Or you can turn on the ambient noise and the external speakers pick up sounds better than your own ears.The charging case I give a 4/5 stars as it is noticeably larger than it's predecessor's case the NC9.  But with the added size of the case you gain an extra large battery that holds a charge longer so you don't need to recharge the case as often.I would buy these earbuds again before buying a pair over $100.
4,I've had Tozo products before and really liked them.  I'm waiting for the earbuds to charge but looking forward to the noise canceling option as I'm going to be on a plane soon.  My only negative so far is that the instructions have such small print that I have to use a magnifying glass to read them and I am wearing my reading glasses.  I'll search online and see if I can find them there when I can actually read them.
4,These earbuds were easy to pair. It will take some practice to get use to the touch functions they offer. The sound is clear but not loud enough even on highest volume. The ANC feature is good for the price of the product. You will observe the ANC in action but it will not block off everything that's happening around you. I have just used it for a few hours so will give 3/5. Will update the ratings if I observe good results over long-term use.
5,Simply Blown Away!!  I was skeptical when I saw the reviews and price point as I'm very critical of my audio playback.  I don't own earbuds because I can never any that properly fit in my ear.  Having a set of studio beats I can't always use them during exercises.  These buds not only fit... They sound AMAZING!!!!!!  THE LOWS ARE ACCURATELY REPRODUCED AND HIGHS ARE CRISP!!!  I am so impressed I signed up for the extended warranty and ordered a 2nd pair.  These will stand toe 2 tow with Airpods and Samsung buds...and the Active Noise Canceling and transparency mode actually work flawless.  Do yourself a favor and buy them... YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!
5,I got these as part of a promotion and gave them to my step-brother for his birthday slick box made for a nice present.He said he uses them all day long and for taking on the phone while working with his hands.  The microphone works ok for phone calls.  The person he was calling said it sounded like he was in a fishbowl but to be fair the microphone is far from your mouth in earbuds.  So a functional mic is about the best you should expect.You can use one at a time and keep alternating one in ear and one in the case though they have pretty good battery life
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These headphones are perfect TOZO is probably the most bang for your buck you can get when it comes to their products. It features multiple instances where it shows you your charge one the case and each ear bud. Case feels nice and sturdy it is larger but that's due to the powerful charging and large battery. Sound quality is great nice and bassy and sound cancelation is definitely fantastic. These little things connect to my phone faster than my galaxy buds and I have a galaxy phone. These headphones are great I cant really give any valid criticism for them so far. I haven't had a single issue.
5,These TOZO earbuds are very high in quality. They pair very easily to my phone and iPad. The sound is excellent just as good as AirPod Pros – in my opinion. I really love the rich bass sound. The controls seem to be very intuitive and easy to remember. The noise cancellation is great even when using them outdoors. They are very comfortable in my ears. They look really cool when you wear them. Also the case is well made and contains a display of the current headphone charge levels! The battery life is incredible. So if you are looking for a quality set of earbuds at a great price Tozo TOZO NC9 earbuds are for you.
5,These earbuds are by far the best I have ever owned. One of my favorite features is the built in power bank. This little power bank gives you so much battery life. I have owned these buds for over 4 months and I have only needed to charge them about 3 times.Battery lasts forever as long as you place the buds in the cradle o ce you are done of course.Sound quality is great!! Much better than the older TOZO products I think.The fit is perfect  in your ear. As usual they provide you with different sizes for your ears.
5,This is my 3rd pair of TOZO ear buds. The sound quality has always been quite good but they've made some nice design improvements in this version. Again the sound quality is great and the noise canceling feature works very well. The case feels more substantial and I love the digital readout inside the case telling you the battery level. Speaking of battery  these buds really last a long time and then quickly charge in the charging case so they're ready for you next time you need them. These fit comfortably in my ears and stay in pretty well considering there's no physical attachment to your ear. I'm really enjoying these buds. Great job TOZO!
5,The earbuds are surprisingly good!! The packaging comes with the earbuds charging cable charging case spare ear tips and documentation. Packaging is neat and easier to unpack. Instructions are easy to follow and was able to pair the earbuds right out of the box. Ease of use is good too. It has many features to control the buds with a tap or hold. It has 2 modes - ANC and Transparency similar to the ear buds out there.Audio quality is good and easily blocks off white noise in ANC mode. The transparency mode is decent too and can be accessed with a long touch on the left ear bud. Overall a nice pair for the price.
5,These headphones are great. I love the fit. The battery life is so good. It is nice to be able to use these headphones when I want and not have to charge them up every night. The sound quality is really good. TOZO has not been a disappointing brand and this is no different. These headphones deliver everything you can find in higher-priced headphones without the hit to your wallet. My only complaint which isn’t a big one is that the transparent mode is not as good as some others I have tried. It is definitely something I can deal with though because of all the other great things these headphones offer. Definitely recommend.
5,I have had these a little over a week and really like the fit and noise cancellation.  They fit really secure and I use them when jogging without worrying they will fall out.  The automatic noise cancellation works great but I also like the fact I can disable the ANC so if I am jogging I can hear oncoming traffic.  The case is a little larger than most but I like that because it is easier to remove the earbuds.  The earbuds are clearly marked with a L and R so it is easy to place them in the case correctly.  They appear to be well constructed.
5,I’m very impressed with all of my Tozo products. You can’t beat the value…great products that are actually affordable. These headphones sound great and the ‘noise cancellation’ works great! I was a little worried the earbuds looked a little big in the pictures online but they actually fit perfectly and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Oh and battery lasts a long time and they quickly charge when you put them back in the case. They’re good for wearing around the house or using while on the lawn mower. No complaints I recommend? …worth the money. I’m buying a couple more to give as gifts to kids.
5,I have tried several pairs of wireless earbuds. I have been trying to find that perfect balance of clarity highs bass (without being distorted). I also have been looking for a sturdy case that can handle being in my jeans pocket all day. Well...look not further. I received these a few days ago and I have been very satisfied. I have only had to charge once (original charge) and I have been listening to a lot of music and pod casts since. I work from home so I have taken many calls as well and so far these have been awesome. I highly recommend these buds. Hope you enjoy them as much as am.
4,The smallest ear buds provide we still too large for my ears.  It makes my ears sore when wearing them
5,This TOZO NC9 plus has excellent sound quality which provides powerful bass mellow midrange and clear treble. The active noise cancelling function is impressive! Whenever I opened the bedroom air conditioning air-conditioning noise always makes me feel annoyed. But then put on these earbuds and turn on active noise cancelling function the noise is gone replaced by a clear high-quality music this is great! When someone is talking to me you can easily switch to transparent mode without affecting the communication at all. This product provides different sizes of soft silicon ear tips making it suitable for everyone in my family.
3,I bought the regular NC9 last year.  They still work but upgrated to NC9 Plus hybrid for one reason- battery life.  I find the NC9 Plus uncomfortable in my ears and it is more Bass than I prefer.  If the battery life stays strong I may be a bit happier.  The NC9 are so comfortable and great sound quality but lasts about 2 1/2 hours.  Can barely listen to 1 movie.  So it is a tradeoff.  Just beware women with smaller ears even with all the size options they are bulkier and uncomfortable compared to regular NC9.
4,So this is kinda the same thing as the NC9 just slightly better. The ANC mode is the same as the NC9 but on "transparent" it still has the whole static noise so no change from the NC9. It has a longer battery life but the case is larger (honestly better looking than the NC9) Honestly they are still a great value earbud. I'm happy with the product at the end of the day!
4,These are some great quality headphones for the money. They sync to my phone quickly and are easy to use. The sound is amazing but I wish they had a bit more bass to them. Also you can’t hear the voice that tells you if noise cancellation is on or not. All in all a great product that I’m glad to own.
5,I’ve had a few different sets of Tozo EarPods and these are far and away the best I’ve used. They are a bit bigger than the NC7 (2nd pic size comparison) but they fit in my ears way better. I love the battery % indicator on the case. The noise cancelling works really well. Only minor thing is that they have a hard time filtering out wind noise while on a phone call but that’s a minor thing that even the competitors struggle with. These are a great value and will be my new go-to ear buds for every day use.
5,I have tried several different brands of Earbuds and keep going back to Tozo as the brand of choice. I upgraded to this model for its 10.5-hour battery life.  These fit in my ear perfectly and stay I my ear. Walking exercising biking they stay put. The sound quality is outstanding with just enough bass. They are superb for phone calls with no complaints. Further they are wireless. (I do not understand how wireless charging is not a must-have feature for Earbuds). Factor in the very reasonable cost and there are no other options. These Earbuds are highly recommended.
5,My husband and I own two other sets of Tozo headphones – The T6 and the NC2. Of the three these are our favorite because they bring together the active noise cancellation of the NC2 with the touch controls of the T6. Like the other models these come with a helpful range of ear tips for a custom fit and a sleek charging case. The sound quality is excellent and rich. We appreciate the noise cancellation especially in the city so that we can listen to our own music without distraction in noisy urban settings. No need for the big brand price tag!
5,These are terrific. Just got them this morning and already did one workout with them. The sound is great and compares to headphones that are far more expensive. I also love how the carrying case acts as a charger and also shows the percentage of charge remaining (see pic). Also cool that they send 5 pairs of extra ear bud covers which is great because I always tend to eventually lose one of them. I still have another TOZO set of wireless headphones which has continued to be awesome but after a couple of years of use decided an upgrade was in order.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             As I said in the video the sound quality is amazing very easy to set up they stay in my ear very well. They are also very comfortable and have a long lasting battery life- it is also a bonus that I can charge the case on my wireless charger! The only this is that they fall out while I am asleep. However I have a unique ear shape and move around in my sleep so that can not be helped which is why I still say 5 stars.
4,We have been using few of Tozo products and they all seems to be good products.I'm impressed with the active noise cancelling with it on I can't seem to hear my wife talking ;-)seems like the battery is lasting pretty long too. But only time will tell if the product quality changes I'll updated.
5,When I got the TOZO NC9 I was surprised how the power box was bigger compared to NC7 but when I start using it I was nicely surprised. NC9 are not as touchy/sensitive as the NC7 they have good sound quality and amazing battery life. I took them fully charged on a two-week vacation used them almost every day for an hour or two came back home and they still had 23% battery left. Great product to buy. The pictures compare them to the other model (NC7.)Pictures: NC7 on the left NC9 on the right
4,Watching movies and hearing music sound amazing on the TOZO NC9 Plus Hybrid. I was also surprised on how comfortable they are. The default earbuds fit in my ear perfectly the first time and I didn't want to take them off. The pairing process was also really easy and I enjoy using the touch functions on the earpiece.
5,I just got these new ear buds I am really impressed with this brand is excellent quality for reasonable price. I am happy with my purchase it sounds great too It has noise canceling. It basically has everything I was looking for in an earbud. Range is good i went up to the the attic from my living room and it didn't disconnect. I'm certain it will still stay connected if i left the phone in the basement and went up four floors to the attic it will still stay connected. I do recommend  these
4,I have had several pairs of various TOZO earbuds ( I lose then offten) and these are absolutly going to be my new travel earbuds. The battery life and the larger battery in the charging case make a huge diffenance when your on the go.  And i love that I can use the case to keep my phone going in a pinch.
3,When it was working properly it was great. It's not noise canceling but it did the best it could and the sound was clear. But the left side died in a few months and beyond when we coils return it for a new one.
5,The TOZO NC9 are great!  The sound is clear and the range is fantastic. My phone was plugged up in another room and I could walk freely around the house and still hear everything. I could hear clearly when I made phone calls with the earbud in.  I also have the TOZO T10 and the NC9 are so much better.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars is because it really is not noise cancelling.  Otherwise it is a great product and I highly recommend these earbuds.
4,I loved everything about these.  Battery is superb quality is good but once you step outside a bit of wind will be highly disruptive.
4,These earbuds have an amazing transparency mode. This is perfect for work. You can hear ur surroundings while jamming out. The ANC mode is nice as well but its more noticable while playing music. The bass is nice as you feel the pump of each bass hit. Overall amazing earbuds
5,These TOZO NC9plus earbuds are the best earbuds I have ever owned. The battery life on them is amazing. The sound quality is super clear and not muffled at all unlike some other ones I have from a different brand. I'll never buy any other brand of earbuds other than TOZO so I hope they keep making earbuds like these because I am a customer for life! If you are wondering if you should get these or not just get these and I promise you won't regret it. Seriously these rock 🤘
5,Can charge either with Usb-C or Wireless. With the other USB you can actually charge your mobile.I like this with my galaxy phone very much as I can use my phone wireless powershare to chare this. It shows the battery indication for both buds and also the case.Easily paired out of the box does voice prompts to say if it is in ANC or Transparency mode.Fits perfectly in the ear and come with extra bud caps to fit the right size.Audio call clarity was also really good.
5,I have other earbuds including Apple and I find the NC9 as good as and more comfortable than the others.The sound is cristal clear. The noise cancelling feature works wonderfully.These earbuds stay in your ears and do not fall out. Apple buds constantly fall out at least in my ears.The charge lasts about 7 hours which is sufficient. There is also an LED in the cast showing charge percentage.Overall I recommend the NC9 strongly and for the price point they rock
5,I'm not sure but they did. These earbuds are great. The sound and fit is amazing. Really enjoying the extra charge capacity and the longevity of each charge. The noise cancelling feature works well too. I am not the heaviest user of noise cancelling but having it is definitely a benefit.Overall I couldn't recommend these earbuds more. They are fantastic and for the price can't be beat. These can compete with earbuds that cost twice as much. Tozo knows how to do things right.
5,The best earbuds of this type I've tried.The sound quality is really good and the bass quality is exceptional for me.I always had problems to find a earbud that fits well in my ears but this one fit's very well and also isolates from external noise. Btw the noise canceling is good (no A/C or any minor disturbance can be heard) and if you wanna hear the environment the transparent mode is perfect for that.Definitely it worth the money.
3,Good sound but after less year battery doesn’t last
4,Solid construction like the weight of the case. Sound could be louder touch controls are responsive. Noise canceling to me isn’t the tozo earbud. When all phone call all outside noise can be heard by party on the other line.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Being that I have a small ears it hard to find earpiece that will fit in my ears. This product fits comfortably in my ears. It doesn’t fall off when you have them on. The active noise concealing works great. Overall I give this product a rating of 5 out of 5. Excellent product!!!
2,One side got a short and stopped working after 6 weeks
5,How do they DO that? Crazy BUT IN A GOOD WAY! Great fit easy paring noise cancellation but even more..TARGETED noise cancellation huge battery life & storage meticulous craftsmanship.  What else is there to possibly want? Oh yeah almost forgot HA!: GREAT SOUND! Could the sound be better? Well I suppose so if I was IN the concert hall sitting IN the orchestra...then maybe. But these are earbuds (wayy cheaper BTW than concert tickets) and earbuds don't get better than this! Enjoy!
5,As a loyal Tozo product user I’ve had a chance to sample a number of their great products. With the addition of NC9 plus series to the Tozo Earbud line I realize why I only use their products. With each advancement in the Tozo product  they’ve managed to hone their design to create one of the most secure earbuds to date. In addition the security is only matched by the NC9 plus comfort. These earbuds fit perfectly when worn. Thanks Tozo for another great product.
5,I was upgraded to these headphones after having problems with the NC9. These headphones are amazing!! The sound is great the transparency mode is perfect for my workplace so I can hear people when they have questions and the battery life can't be beat!! I have been using them for a whole week 8 hours a day and the charging case is only at 60% and it has recharged the earbuds each day !! Definitely a great buy!
5,The battery life is exactly what it claims. The charging case has a very big battery.  I dont have to charge the case but once a week and I use them constantly. Milage may vary though. If your looking for budget high quality ear buds this is definitely worth the money. The bass is heavy but not to the point of sacrificing the high notes.
1,They were amazing for a good solid month. Sound was clear anc mode worked perfectly transparency mode work fine then I was in the middle of a 6k when a loud sharp beeping noise was coming from the left ear bud. The volume of my headphones started to fade. The battery life is great but other than this invest in a different pair. I had an older version of the Tozos and they worked amazingly! However I left them in a hotel room and never got them back. Which is why I purchased these and totally regret it!
5,Got these earbuds to wear at work. Great battery life and the case is handy because it double as a portable battery charger for your phone. The digital notification on battery life is helpful too. All in all great for the price. Cheaper than some of the other major brands without sacrificing sound quality.
2,I really loved these especially how you can put them in the case and they turn off take them out and they power on. However the audio skips. I first ordered the NC9 (not plus) and the noise cancelation was phenomenal. Unfortunately the audio skipped sometimes even when next to the device. Returned them and noticed the NC9 Plus so thought I'd upgrade hoping the previous one was just a bad unit. The noise cancelation isn't nearly as good as the NC9 I originally bought and I had the same skipping audio issue. I have a set of Avantree Audition headphones that are over 3 years old and they have no problems so it's not my devices that are the problem. I returned the NC9 plus. Very disappointed in this product. It would have been perfect if it actually worked right 😞 Maybe I just got two bad units but I don't want to play the replacement game until I get one that works like it's supposed to. Oh well. I'll stick with the Avantree
5,Charged out the box is amazing! Only had it for an hour so far and it’s just as good as all the other reviews I’ve read on it the active noise cancellation is awesome my husband couldn’t hear a word I was saying and I couldn’t hear the kids screaming it’s great I haven’t use the enhancement feature yet.  The sound Fidelity is amazing and the bass is out of this world!!!!  10/10*******
5,Excellent sound quality earbuds from TOZO.  This this the second pair of earbuds I have from TOZO.  This is the most advanced one and the quality is great. Easy to use and bluetooth connects without any issues. Music sounds great and clear to hear someone when using your phone to talk.  The earbuds fit perfectly and long battery life.  Overall very happy and I definitely recommend this pair of earbuds.
3,These were great the first month or two but then the sound quality for those on the other end of the call I told is garbled or robotic.  The other issue is one of the earbuds will only charge to 75%.  Hopefully TOZO's warranty has a resolution.
2,Replacing my Sony headphones and these do not keep up. Returning and spending the extra $30 for Sony.
5,These are great earbuds! Have great base and fit well in ear! The active noise canceling is better than the NC 7 in my opinion! Great for music! However the NC 7 has a great built in mic that is really nice. Also if you take the NC 7 out of your ear then it stops playing! That was a nice feature. However the NC 7 definitely has the best sound!
5,This is another new TOZO earbud style for me (my third TOZO!) and it’s my new favorite. It paired right out of the box fits nicely and the sound is great. The ANC definitely does a nice job drowning out background sounds but the best part is the improvement to the battery life. I don’t care that the case is a little larger to accommodate a larger battery but some might.
5,These are the 4th pair of Tozo earbuds that I have purchased. Two pair I gave as gifts for special occasions. They are by far the  best ear buds I have heard at any price. This model is the best of all of them. Clear sound no background noise at all. ANC really works. I'm a loyal follower.The gift buds were a hit. Loved by the recipients.
4,Sound quality construction and ease of use are all very good. Noise canceling could be better which is why I did not give it a 5 rating.
5,This is the top earbuds TOZO ever produced.It has everything you can ever hope for noise cancelling  great soundsand more importantly very long battery life.I have been using this product for more than 2 weeks now and the battery is still more than 80%;Yes a digital display let you see the remaining battery life very neat feature....Overall a highly recommended product...
5,I have now purchased my 4th pair of buds from Tozo.  They keep on innovating amazing products. This is my fav pair yet. The price is incredible the quality of how they are designed is top notch. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie the sound is perfect. And now with the ability to turn on and off sound deadening. These are incredible.
5,I have almost all tozo earbuds they are all good but this one is the best among them. The sound quality is amazing u can hear evey little things. Also there seem to be no small hissing or white noise when i pause content In between two songs etc so thats great. The case is also chunky and heavy. Overall its the best one with
5,I'm really impressed by the battery life on these. I've had them for about 10 days and the power dock is only down to 85%. I also like that it shows you the percent battery life remaining. I also like that it uses a USB-C charger instead on micro USB that way it's the same as my phone. So far a great product!
1,Durability at 1*. Noise cancellation actually amplified the noise damaging the speakers and hurting my ears. The BT distance is terrible and I get skipping with my phone in my pocket. At times one side will go out and won't reconnect until I put both back into the charging case. Magnet polarity reversed in the left side at about a week and a half causing the earbud to push against the lid and keep from charging at times. Left earbud popped open yesterday and won't snap back together
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have several TOZO products and I have come to expect the highest quality fo the best price which means huge value.  These earbuds do not disappoint!  Awesome sound quality and active noise suppression.  The battery in the case is beefy!  I also love the display inside the case.  I think you'll love these earbuds!
5,Fast shipment! Perfect packaging! Build materials comparable to higher end products for half of the cost! 99% charged when I received it earlier today! Superb battery life per charge! I’ve been wearing it for the past 7 hours for Amazon music and still have 44% battery life remaining! It sounded even better than my Bose Sport. Would definitely recommend it! Great product! Will buy again!
5,the battery on these earbuds are crazy! they last so long and the case isn't even that heavy. they are super comfortable and I can wear these for a long time. the ANC mode isn't as strong as some of the other buds from TOZO but overall really happy
5,I am a fan of TOZO overall!  I have the T10 buds but I have also bought a wireless charging plate from them as well as two portable battery charges. All of the above exceed expectations in terms of the quality and performance given the price point. They will continue to be a 1st choice for me in this market.
5,These headphones are wonderful. The sound quality is amazing and the ambience mode is great for when you're outside. I charged these headphones once and it's been over a week without needing it to charge. The case has the battery percentage as well as how much life the headphones have as well. I had another pair of Tozo headphones and they never dissapoint.
5,These earbuds are fantastic! They do an excellent job at blocking out sounds and the sound quality is great! The ear tap controls are very responsive...sometimes too responsive until you get used to them. Also they stay in your ears while you're sleeping...major bonusThe only negative comment I have is they didn't come with a size variety rubber ear cover.
3,This set of earbuds is very touchy...takes a very light touch to distinguish between advance play and nothing at all.  Also dropped connections several times during workouts walks etc.  One last item; does not connect to more than one device at a time.  Have to disconnect first and then connect to second.  Comfort is meeeh...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m surprised at how far Tozo products have come. I’ve tried a few of their products and this is easily the best so far. They fit my ears well and sound good. They’re heavy on the bass side. From what I can tell the battery life is good and I’ll continue to use and test them.
5,This is the 2nd TOZO headphones I've order and they are absolutely wonderful. They have a lot of features they I haven't even used yet. They have great sound quality and the noise canceling works very well although I don't use that feature much. For the price they are very well made and work just as good as any 200 dollar pair.
5,I LOVE these earbuds!  The noise canceling is awesome.  The sounds quality is great.  I use them for meetings all the time.  Even better than my original NC9s which is saying a lot!
5,In my opinion the NC model earbuds that Tozo offers are the best sounding earbuds of their lineup.  If you need the longest battery life and want a wireless charging case then go with these (NC9 Plus).  If you don't mind shorter battery life and no wireless charging case then go with the cheaper NC2.  They both sound fantastic.
5,I love these earbuds. These earbuds are awesome. The battery life is great and the range of the earbuds was surprising. I was able to be a good 20 feet from the earbuds (one charging) and phone with the music still working without any skips. They are also very comfortable to wear. This would be the pair I would recommend to anyone
5,I like that these headphones can reach really far before disconnecting. These have Bluetooth 5.0 which let's them transmit 800 feet with a line of sight. Mine still transmit through a cinder block wall but not if too much metal is in the way. The buttons on this model are much better than the T12.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've been a huge fan of tozo and have used the NC9 almost dayly so I was very excited for the NC9 plus however this is day two and one of the headphones has died and will not recharge I've tested the charging port with my NC9 headph which immediately lit up so the charger is phone it was just the headphone that dird
5,I like the sound and long battery life. Noise cancellation is exceptional. And it last a long time with the battery. I have bought 4 different sets and models for my children. These are perfect to connect with Bluetooth while working from home.
5,Incredible sound. Perfect pitch. Not too much bass not too much treble. Crisp sound perfectly balanced. Battery life is excellent. In fact you can use the case to charge your phone in an emergency. Noice cancellation is very good. I also love the digital display indicating how much power remains in the case.
5,I gave my other set of Tozo ear buds to a family member so I had an excuse to buy these.Man they are nice. I am surprised how they keep getting better.I love the upgrade for charging. No need to find a usb c. Can charge wireless usb or usb c.
5,These headphones connect very easily. The battery life is better than a lot of other headphones the noise cancelling does an ok job. The bass and sound depth is the best feature of these and really why you buy headphones.
5,I became a major fan of TOZO. All their products are of the highest quality. This new earpiece has crystal clear sound. And the extra battery is an additional plus. I also enjoy the waterproof feature as it really works and I use them in my shower. Thanks TOZO for making another amazing product
5,My husband really wanted to have noise cancellation earbuds. I have one made by TOZO. So he was jealous about it. Now he has NC9. He loves those amazing quality earbuds. It’s just simple tap then you can switch on or off noise cancellation. Thank you TOZO for making my husband happy 😃
4,Another great product from tozo.  Sound quality is great.
5,These updated earbuds are great. I had the original tozo buds and loved them. These new tozos have an updated charging case with a visual indicator of battery life remaining. The different sized ear canal rubbers are great for all sized ears. Sound is phenomenal and the noise canceling helps alot. Highly recommend.
1,Excelente Bateria todo iba bien hasta que hace 2 días el auricular de la derecha se comenzó a escuchar bajito como si hiciera un falso contacto apenas tengo un mes con ellos😭 esto nunca me paso con los T10 y los use más de un año.
5,Oh my goodness these are amazing! The fit is so comfortable the best I have used! The sound quality is impeccable. I have to tell my family when I have them in because I can't hear them talking to me. Music is my outlet and these earbuds make me so happy!
5,I love my wireless headphones so much this is my favorite brand. I'm on my second pair.  My first one even went through the laundry wash and still worked after!The battery is long lasting they feel great in your ears for hours at a time and they sound crystal clear!
5,These headphones are wonderful quality as far as sound comfort & ease of use! The sound quality is incredible & they instantly ramp up anything you’re listening to. The noise cancellation feature is so helpful & makes the listening experience unique. Would recommend!
5,I've had these for a week or so and I've got to say the sound quality is excellent.  The ANC also works fantastic.  I've had some Jabra earbuds that cost twice as much and these sound almost as good without the balance issue the Jabras have.
5,I bought the Tozo NC9 Plus after must consideration and research and came to the conclusion that these are possibly THE best earbuds I’ve ever purchased in my entire life. Great sound quality for calls and music punchy bass and noise cancellation makes the outside world sound almost non-existent.
5,I like the active noise cancelation. It blocks noise out really well. AND I can turn off the noise cancelation mode and still hear what I'm listening to but it also kind of magnifies what people are saying to me so they don't have to yell to get my attention.
5,Another super Tozo earbuds product. Not only is the noise canceling feature awesome but the water proofing is a great plus. Packaging is always a professional aspect of the Tozo line of products. The fit is perfect and pairings is quick and easy. I am totally impressed. Good investment.
5,This is my 4th pair of wireless ear buds and these are my favorite so far. The sound great fit snuggly in my ears and the battery lasts a while.  The charging case is especially great gives you visual information.  Little too bulky for the pants pocket.
5,Love the new case for the nc9 plus. I can use it as a powerbank or enjoy more recharge cycles on the earphones. The earphones themselves also have the same comfort and features I've come to love from the older nc9. The new nc9 plus are a welcome upgrade.
5,These wireless headphones are just great. They have a mic that’s good for phone calls or Zoom meetings. Long battery life and they sound great too. Noise canceling is a nice feature. The case acts as a charger so you’ll know these are always charged.
3,Preferred over Echo Buds (no Alexa required) but would not keep up with my 19 HP riding mower
5,El sonido realmente es bueno los bajos son nítidos la cancelación de ruido funciona!.  La caja es algo pesada por la batería extendida incorporada que permite tener una autonomía mayor respecto a los modelos anteriores.  Vale la pena excelente calidad para el costo!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Wow! These earphones pack a ton of bass! Outside of great sound quality and noise cancellation  the case gives it a premium feel. It's very sturdy and have a cool display to show the power levels of each earbud.
5,My cousin recommended these and I’m so glad he did.  I find the sound to be crystal clear and the noise cancellation feature highly effective.  I love music and listen with these ear pods all the time.  Great purchase!
5,Been using tozo for 2 years now starting with the T6. Great headphones then went with the NC9’s. But these nc9 plus take it up a notch and are even better than their predecessors. Did not disappoint and looking forward to their next new product!
5,The TOZO NC9 is the real deal. This is a winner!!! Don't look for expensive earbuds this is the best deal for your money.PROS:1. Great Sound Quality for music2. Excellent Bass3. Easy pairing4. Clear conversationsCONSnone
5,Like everything about them so far; fit feel sound pairing and connecting convenience of a case that carries charge and permits charging in the case. Not crazy about the ANC but I expect to get used to it. Once I do it will be fine.
5,I don’t know how but TOZO has accomplished yet again another amazing feat.The product may be the more costly option in their lineup but it sure is worth it.The ergonomics sound quality charging case and design are superior to others in the market.
5,I mostly use earbuds while bike riding and need transparency mode to stay aware of traffic.  Good fit.  Case is a perhaps twice the size of my previous Tozo earbuds.  Great battery life.  Good product.  Bluetooth paring simple.
5,Actually a really good sounding high quality set of earbuds tozo can be hit and miss (like their watch is a no go and their black airpods looking wireless headphones also a no go) but this is actually a really decent pair of earbuds.
5,Outstanding sound quality with prolonged battery life and easily fits securely in ear without sacrificing comfort or performanceBy far away TOZO’s best earbuds introduced into marketplace ahead of all their competitors in terms of pricing and listening ease w fingertip functionalityBut these!
4,Great sound and great size!
5,Tozo is a great company with a great product. Earbud fit perfectly and sound great
2,I relly wanted to like these but i just couldn't. I guess I got spoiled by my powerbeats. The Tozo's sound quality ha a lot to be desired. It has great bass but little to no mid-range and highs. I also didn't like the fact that there's a low limit on how high you can turn the volume  (which wasn't high enough). The noise cancelling worked well enough and they fit comfortably. I also experienced cut out a few times with the right side and they appear to have a very limited range as at about 20-25 feet both sides experienced cut-out. Like I said I wanted to like them but I just couldn't overlook the aforementioned flaws.
5,Great upgrade from previous versions. The magnets work great at keeping the earbuds charging so they don’t run and end up draining the batteries. Sound quality is good and ANC/ Transparency are a plus. Solid earbuds for the price.
5,I am super impressed with the quality and comfort of these earbuds. The quality is great and the sound is superb. The battery life was longer than I expected and lasted all day and then some. I recommend this product.
5,I started using these for my workouts to try and minimize the noise from the radio and weights clinking in the background and they're absolutely amazing due to the NC! They stay in really well compared to my older bluetooth headphones.
2,Great fit.  Outstanding sound. L and R are marked clearly on outside a definite plus.  The charging case is substantially heavier than any other Tozos.  Could be a good thing because I know when this case is in my pocket. Bluetooth range is outstanding can leave my phone in the basement and can listen all the way up to the 2nd floor.  Have used in shower and worked flawlessly. Battery life as of this review. 7 hours and still going. Update. 1 year later battery life is outstanding however the volume on 1 side has dropped off if the settings were 1 to 10 with 10 being the loudest it sounds like a 2. so sad. I really wanted to love these.
5,I am happy to share Tozo earbuds. Nice price and high quality. I purchased multiple products for my family. All of my family satisfied the earbuds. I recommend Tozo if you find reasonable price and high quality than others!!
5,I think these are awesome for the price.  They sound great and the fit in my ears are fine.
5,Pros: battery life sound quality touch controls Noise cancelling is great for this price point. It comes close to air pods pro price
5,These are some of the best quality Bluetooth headphones I've ever experienced. For the price the sound and battery life cannot be beat. They're very easy to use and intuitive. The ANC feature works flawlessly.
5,These earbuds are of great quality. The sounds is clear. On my calls people hear me clearly. The fit is great in my ear and easy to put in and take out under my hijab.
5,I like these a lot. For the price very good quality
5,Solid construction and sound pretty good (having the different ear plugs is a must for myself). Haven’t tried them at the gym yet (or hitting the heavy bag) but I’m sure they’ll work just fine. Grade: A.
5,I have the original NC9s and they fit me the best. Snug in my ears and the noise canceling is noticeable. I am excited for these with a longer battery life and and better quality noise canceling.
5,Compared to the older NC9 headphones the NC9 Plus has much improved battery life and transparent mode. The sound was already great in the NC9 but the NC9 Plus manages to improve the sound quality also.
5,I’m not sure where to start. This earbuds are AMAZING. Replaced them with my iPhone earbuds. They last so much longer with so much more clarity. TOZO keeps getting better and better. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TOZO!!!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great value and sound quality. I have many tozo products and always love them. I like this case and in the video you can see the comparison to the nc9.
5,Easily connected via Bluetooth to my S21 Ultra. Great sound quality. Works as described in product description!
5,Great earphones!  I have 3-4 sets of Tozo earphones for my kids and my son likes these the best because of the charge meter in the case. Highly recommend.
5,Pretty decent sound need to tweak eq. Got nc9 upgraded for my wife and plus for myself i like mine more. Both feels like expensive top of the line buds. Love 18 month warranty
5,Great deal for the sound quality and noise cancellation feature. It was comparable to my AirPod pro and it fit my war better than the AirPod. Easy to connect and superb battery life. Would recommend!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is awesome.  Super great power supply.  Huge backup lots of power.  Great noise canceling.  And yes it does wireless charging!  Great sound.
3,I love that I don't have to charge the case every other day. It can last me 10 days! Sound quality is the same as Tozo NC9. The sound sometimes drops off from one ear though. Hopefully that goes away.
3,ANC has issued as after 2hr use right earbud produces static until reset by putting back in case. Have tried two different times with same result so this is issue with product and manufacturer states just replace
3,Started out great for the first week now the battery isn't lasting more than about 3 hours before one needs charged
5,Awesome sound quality deeper base than the nc2. Put these through a rigorous gym session and the held up better than all other ear buds I've had. Noise canceling is great. Definitely recommend these.
5,Great wireless ANC Earbuds. Didn’t so much like the subtle white noise for noise cancelling and the sound would dampen occasionally. Other than these things the sound battery and ANC are very good
1,Stopped working within 2 weeks. Have been troubleshooting for a while now through the website with little help.
5,The headphones fit very well in the ear and have different adapter sizes included. The headphones are very high quality and have a great sound. For the price the headphones are highly recommended!
5,The digital battery display is cool but the sound quality and noise canceling are the best!
2,Left side noise canceling sounds like wind noise. Works ok but doesn’t function properly. Fits in ear well and battery life is great
1,Todo bien  pero uno de ellos se daño muy rápido y la garantía lo cambio
5,I love using these headphones when I’m working out or even just walking around at the store - the sound and fit are great! You’ll love these!
5,These have great sound quality and so far really good battery life. I really enjoy the noise cancellation abilities and have been very pleased whit them so far!
5,I've enjoyed tozo headphones for awhile now and these are no different. I genuinely like them and the noise cancellation works fairly well too.
5,I recently received the NC9 Earbuds and they sound great.  The active noise cancellation makes a big difference in blocking outside noise.Good buy for the money
5,Works well with clear sound and noise canceling really works. Also the display shows the battery level when you first open the case which is very nice. Would recommend.
5,TOZO produces some great headphones! I have a few pairs and these are another great pair! Battery is good and the sound quality is even better. No complaints!
5,Very easy to pair up to your device with no cutting in and out they sound great and they stay regardless of what you're doing it would recommend.
5,These headphones are great! They fit really well right inside your ears and don’t stick out funny like my bose ones. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great! Love them!
5,Love the sound quality for the money. Used everything from apple jabra pros mpowSony to other generic brands and so far price for function these seem to be my favorite.
5,Great battery life. As a drummer the noise cancelation is priceless. I have no idea how noise cancelation works but IT DOES and it works well.
5,Fit and comfort seems good. Came with 6 sets of ear buds and they fit securely in my ear and didn't fall out while playing basketball.
5,Great product and super easy to use.  I unpacked and used these right away. They made doing yard work much more enjoyable and the price was right.
5,I love this brand of earbuds with the ASC mode. You can hear really well on phone calls
5,I really like the fit of these earbuds the capacitive touch control and especially the battery life of both the buds and the charging case.
5,The most comfortable earbuds i have tried extremely light and soft on the ear. I Will never go back to a earbud without anc mode again
5,They are solidly built easy to use stylish comfortable.  Battery life is huge.  This is a win - just buy them now.
5,Best noise canceling earphones.This package was refined offering a case that can charge digital power display and earphones I find amazing. 👍
5,Awesome solution for on the go Bluetooth noise canceling and good alternative to airpods. This is the Best bang for the buck!
5,I bought the first version of the nc9 and I love this improvement so much better. And the LED display is so cute.
5,Very nice quality solid case that charges them for you battery lasts forever.  I choose these over any other headphones I have.
5,I am amazed with these ear buds! Another great product from TOZO. Very good sound quality. Battery is great last longer ANC works ok!
5,These are fantastic! For earbuds in this price range the sound and quality can’t be beat. I highly recommend these and the bass is incredible.
5,These earbuds are amazing. The fit is so comfortable and the sound is superior. The battery life is also a huge plus for me.
5,These earbuds are great! The sound quality was awesome and the sound cancelling truly worked wonders! I would recommend these!
5,Active noise canceling works great! Pairing the headphones is easy and fast. Sound quality is very good. These are worth the money!
5,Excellent buds for the price.  The battery just won't quit.
5,They are great they fit comfortably and the ANC and Transparency work great I will be buy more of them.
5,I just received these  but based on how satisfied I am with their other products I expect them to be superb!

5,They have amazing sound and battery life!

5,Decent price easy to sync with phone comfortable and solid sound for the price point.  Highly recommended.
5,The noise cancellation works great I had some bose headphones and these are equal and 150 dollars cheaper
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Been a fan of tozo for awhile. These have great sound quality in such a small package!
5,This series is the best value for the money hands down. The new upgraded models are greatly improved!
5,Just like all the others very nice and clear sound Battery stays for long time Fits great in ear
5,Great quality product long lasting charge and comes fully charged ready to go out of the box.
5,Battery lasts all day. The case only needs to be charged maybe once a week. Plus they charge wirelessly
5,Sound quality and comfortable to wear. I like the digital display of a more accurate battery life.
5,I liked the og NC9 so I got the plus and gave the old ones to my brother
5,I loved it. The most important is that will not follow off my ears
5,Another great product from Tozo.  These wireless earbuds are great and they they last forever!!!!
3,Great sound fir music.  Horrible for conversations
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             New charging case is a big upgrade; digital reading of battery percentage.Great sound quality!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The sound is great and very punchy bass and the noise canceling is also very good.
5,Very comfortable and sound is good and they connect very fast...
5,Love using these earbuds.  Great sound and the Noice Cancelling works very well.
2,Updated review after 2 months:Unfortunately my charger case was broken after 2 months of usage.  The earbuds are still good and sound great but the charger case was a malfunction.  The 2 dot lights are on all the time and they can drop from 4 dot lights to 1 dot light in 5 minutes.  Besides that I'd say the earbuds were great.
5,Headphones are extremely comfortable. For being in ear headphones the noise canceling technology is very good.
5,Excellent ear buds. Very long battery life. Good bass and potent noise cancelling.
5,I love the sound quality and functionality of the earbuds. And they fit perfect!
5,I really like these earbuds. Very sleek design and I was very pleased overall.
5,Great product excellent sound. Very satisfied. Recommended. Would buy again.
5,Great headphones and a good upgrade from the previous version!
1,I use these ear buds for listening to Spanish podcasts and telephone conversations…
5,Excellent product & excellent customer service & support!
2,The earbuds are fine with one big exception one bud will not charge up fully. I’ve contacted help with no positive result. I will try a different brand
5,Great fit and sound! Love the new case.
5,So happy with all of their earbuds!
5,These sound great and paired easily.
5,Wonderful earbuds love them. Quality is perfect.
5,Very sleek and percentage of battery is displayed
2,Sounds good but on ANC mode music all the way up gets way way distorted but on the bright side I haven't charged the case in 2 weeks almost. Transparent mode is pretty much ANC
5,Best yet I'm a tozo fan
5,Great sound easy to use
5,pretty nice quality of sound
5,Great battery life.
5,Great sound and battery life.
2,I was able to pair the ears buds with my ipad but not with my iPhone or iPod (I still use one!). Just says they need to be on (check) in range (check) and ready to pair (check).  A waste of money.
5,Very good so far
5,Great Product.
1,Update:  The pairing is getting worse.  I literally spend two minutes and 5 attempts to pair every time I remove them from the case.  Look elsewhereThe sound of these is fine but the "noise canceling" is very weak.  Don't expect to operate your mower or a power tool and be able to hear your music.  The most annoying thing to me is the inconsistency ib connecting to my iPhone.  Connects automatically maybe 50% of the time.  When it doesn't I need to go to setting and connect manually usually taking 3 trys.
2,Listening music the quality is really good but when I do a phone call has a lot of interference.
5,very goo
2,Good: sound good for podcasts and audio books wireless charging and battery life are good.Bad: call quality is very poor music with any bass sounds terrible even with equalizer keep falling out of my ear.
5,Great product
2,As soon as I started using these they started dropping calls. Sound quality was pretty good except for the low volume but had to return them due to the phone issue.
2,Battery life is awful an hour or less on a full nights charge.
1,Battery life is outstanding quality is pretty good although I wish it went louder. However it frequently has pairing issues and disconnects from Bluetooth. Sound quality and battery life ultimately don't matter if you're constantly losing connection. One side will play for a few seconds then the other side then both for a few seconds it's incredibly frustrating. This is not acceptable and especially not at this price point.
1,After one month the left ear bud started randomly disconnecting.  Then the charging case stopped working with the wireless charger and always displayed "100".  There's no way to reset the case.Sadly these earbuds just have very poor quality.  Buy Air Pods you'll be happier in the long run.
1,Audio was good but my main purpose for these earbuds was the active noise cancelling ability.Enabling the ANC made zero difference whether on a plane beach or at home.  I could hear the device state that it was in either transparency mode or ANC and toggling between them made no difference.ughh wanted it to workReturned them.
1,I bought these for work for zoom calls and meetings on my computer. Unfortunately these don’t work. I am told I’m either cutting out or I sound as if I’m in a tunnel. I never had this issue with my Bose that finally died after years of use.
2,So far so good!**update: the case loses charge when you don’t even touch the earbuds such a shame!!**
1,The battery life wasn’t very good. I couldn’t tell the difference with the noise canceling and whom ever I was talking to couldn’t hear me clearly. The signal would fade in and out to my phone. I gave up trying to save money and got the Powerbeats Pro and absolutely love them.
1,I loved these until yesterday. I ordered them on May 6 2021. Yesterday was. Nov. 17 and the last time they worked properly. I tried to email the company for help but to no avail. They were good for 6 months.
1,Terrible. Everything fell apart. Not sure if i was given defective by mistake but the glue isnt even holding. Bought as a gift. Was embarassed to hear about it. Esp for the price.
5,I received the NC9+ as a replacement of the original NC9 and have been using it almost daily for the last a couple of weeks.Overall the NC9+ is much better than the original NC9 which had some connection and volume issues.  So far NC9+ has no problem with the volume.  Bluetooth pairing was easy and the connection is stable.  I haven't used the noise cancelling much yet and so far so good in the environment I am using it (mowing the lawn).The NC9+ is heavy and had a USB A port for charging other devices which I'd rather have it lighter.  The size is bigger due to battery size.  It did have connection issue one time when I left the case on my desk and went to get a coffee about 50 or so feet away the earpiece keeps disconnecting and connecting not sure why it does that.  however when the case is in my pocket it never had connection issue.
1,I'll update the review depending on my replacement but the right bud was completely dead and dysfunctional on arrival.Canceled my replacement on delivery day. Going to have to stick with one star.
1,In a two hour window watching a movie it disconnected approximately thriteen  times at least. Bad product with wonderful reviews.
5,I originally purchased the Tozo T12 earbuds.  They were bad.  I sent them back and got a replacement pair.  Still bad.  The fit wasn't right and the sound quality faded after a few minutes such that they were hard to hear.  The noise cancelling did not work.  This was the same for both the original and replacement set.  So I left a negative review on Amazon and wrote off the earbuds.A month or so later Tozo reached out to me and offered me a choice of two different styles of earbuds.  I chose the NC9Plus because it was most similar to the T12.  What a difference.  The fit is excellent.  They are comfortable to wear for extended periods.  The sound quality is excellent.  The noise cancelling and transparency modes work well.  To only drawback is that the NC9Plus is only rated IPX6 rather than IPX8 which is why I chose the T12 originally.  But if you don't need a waterproof earbud I highly recommend the NC9Plus.
1,The batteries won't stay charge anymore. I'll have them sitting here and out of nowhere they will go from 100% to 0% instantly.
5,So this is the 6th pair if Tozo wireless ear buds I have bought. I like these the most for many reason! The power station is great can charge ear buds several times without recharging the power station. Tech support is amazing!  I asked for the 18 month warranty and Alisa gave it to me right away! Thanks Tozo I'm sure I will be back for my 7th pair soon enough. By the way all 6 pairs are all still working just fine!ThanksJeff
5,The best buy in years as far as earphones
5,I've been using these earbuds for a couple of months now and they are great.  They have 2 levels of noise cancelling (active noise cancellation and then passive noise cancellation) which is convenient in different situations/environments.  The sound for music is excellent and I have no complaints at all it has deep and rich bass and I was very impressed.  Battery life is great as well.  The customer service is excellent I contacted them about a previous pair I had purchased many months ago that seemed to be becoming defective and a great rep Sarah was always so kind and responsive and even sent me a replacement pair to ensure customer satisfaction!  Would recommend Tozo and their products based on my experiences.
1,No just no. Sounds like some old on ear headphones from the 90's.
3,Can't take the heat if you are out in sun or listening is gym suana it will shut off
5,Easily the best fit and function for me. Feels more secure when I am active and even though I didn't realize I would use the switch function between ANC transparency mode and ANC off mode it turns out those are very useful. Great for my goals.
1,Bad quality
4,These earbuds are great for running. Battery life is long I haven’t charged them still after 3 weeks of use.I’m an audiophile so I can’t give this 5 stars. The bass is a little light compared to other noise cancelling earphones. The Klipsch R6 (wired) sound better maybe because they go into my ear deeper.
5,I have two other Tozo earbuds (NC 2 and NC9) and this one NC9 Plus is the best.  The fit and comfort are great.  The sound is great they stay in and easy to sleep with all night since they have a flat design.  noise canceling is very good (not as good as Bose)  The value is fantastic and as a bonus you can charge your iPhone with the case which is great
5,I had purchased a prior version of these headphones that I absolutely love. They always stay in my ear. It would take a pretty hard shake to knock them out. The sound was great.Well a little less than a year into owning those one of the earbuds stopped responding suddenly. I worked with TOZO's customer service and we tried all of the steps for trying to get the earbud working. Unfortunately we were not able to get that one bud working so they are thankfully sending me a newer version.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've owned a different pair of headphones from the same manufacturer and loved them so I sprung for the upgraded model. The sounds quality is great the noise cancelation works well and they stay tight in my ear even during runs. Awesome buds!
4,I just upgraded my phone a Samsung S21 Ultra which means no more headphone jack.  So I had no choice but to go to a bluetooth ANC solution.  I can't stand full size headphones because my ears just get too hot!  I researched many different shapes and sizes of earbuds.  This pair had great reviews for sound ease of use and noise cancelling abilities.  I will mainly use these on airplanes so the ANC is very important to me.Here are my initial impressions:1. Very nice packaging.  Solid box with a slide out tray containing the buds manual a case with five different sized tips and a charging cable.2. The case:  Other reviews made it seem like the storage/charging case was much larger than it actually is.  I am pleasantly surprised at the very compact size and simple display.  I always travel with a backpack and this case which is about the size of of a credit card and as thick as a common kitchen sponge.  I know...weird things to compare to but that's all I could think of.  5 stars.2. Setup:  this could not be any easier.  These buds paired to my phone as soon as I removed them from their case.  I will need to study the controls but initial usage is easy!  5 stars.3. Sound quality:  As others have noted these are very bass heavy.  I like this aspect because A) I like more bass and B) With my phone I can adjust the bass with the built in equalizer to an optimal level.  A bit weak on mids and it is hard to elevate them even with the equalizer on my phone.  4 stars.4. The Active Noise cancelling on these is Outstanding!  I have not been on a plane with them yet but I have driven with them and I have been totally isolated in these situations.  Definitely 5 stars here!5. Even with the ANC on the sound quality is very good.  Not excellent but very good.  This is where many noise cancelling earphones and earbuds fail.  Impressed for the price!  4 Stars6. Battery life is excellent.  I was listening to them for a about 6 hours yesterday with ANC on and they still had about 20% battery life left.  After a full recharge the case only used 8% of its capacity (went from 100% down to 92%).  I am glad I got the Plus version of these buds with extra battery life because when traveling there is no telling when I will be able to re-charge the case.  Definitely 5 stars here!7. Comfort:  I have never had this type of all-in-one earbud before.  They did feel a bit large for my ear when I initially put them on and it felt like they would eventually start to hurt.  However to my surprise my ear conformed to them and they never hurt.  They still feel like a tight fit but no pain so all good!  I wish they would "disappear" in my ear meaning I would forget they were there and only hear whatever is playing and forget I have buds in but that never happened.  4 stars8. Durability:  I just received these so can't give an honest assessment of long term durability.  But...it feels like Ike I can do ANYTHING with these in and they will not fall out.Summary: For the price I would definitely buy these again!I will follow up in the future as needed.
5,I was excited to receive this set of earbuds. My older ones which I’ve had for two years was starting to cut in and out in the left ear bud. First impression was it came nicely packaged as other TOZO ones I’ve purchased before. It came fully charged with the case at 99% which was nice so I can use it right away. The case was a bit heavier than I expected but I think it’s because it can recharge for 160 hours according to the description. The controls are touch based rather than click based which my old buds were so it’ll take me a bit to get used to that. It also came with 5 additional ear tips of varying sizes. I typically switch out the default tip with the second largest tip as I feel the better/tighter fit gives me better sound quality and block out the outside noise. I’ve only used it indoors so I can only tell the ANC blocks out some white noise but I can still hear people speaking in the background when the volume isn’t turned up high. When the volume is turned up I can barely hear people speaking. With my other pair of over-the-ear headphones I can’t hear people speaking at all. But I think that’s to be expected with differences in headphones vs earbuds. Of course headphones are bulkier and put more pressure on the ears so it’s a preference thing as to which you use for what situation. Perhaps the ANC would be more evident if I was somewhere nosier like on a plane or outdoors on a busy street. When switching from transparent to ANC mode and vice versa a voice tells you which mode you’ve switched to which I appreciate rather than just a beep. Quality of the sound is very good with a nice bass and the fit is comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the case can act as a power bank for other devices as it has a USB port (guess I didn’t read the description too closely when I first ordered it). The one thing I think could’ve been designed better is the opening to the charging portal. You have to hold the plastic down to access the wire charging portal. I have a wireless charger but I recently read that wireless charging may degrade your battery faster but not sure if that is because people may have tendency to keep charging their device when full or near full due to ease of wireless charging (which is not good for device) or other reasons. Overall I like these new earbuds and look forward to using them outdoors.
5,The nc9 plus are really great! The noise cancellation is good battery life of the earbuds is pretty good and the case for them carries about an infinite charge. Sound quality is great bass is noticeable but not overpowering.The case has a usb plug so I think you can also use it as a power bank for your phone but haven’t tried it.My one complaint is that occasionally the noise cancelation gets a little confused and then music gets a little funky but it usually figures itself out pretty quick.
5,I have owned several tozo products and have generally been really happy.  These are no different.  Sounds quality is solid.  Battery life solid.  Features solid and easy to use.  Really like the active noise canceling but also the ability to use the pass through mode or whatever its called.  Case is nice as well!
5,Took them out of the case. Pairing was easy. Sound quality was as good as my girlfriend's Samsung earbud's. Bass was great and sound is crystal clear.The noise canceling seems to be very good as I couldn't hear anything when they were in my ears. They come with 7 different sizes of tips instead of the usual 3. The case was very sturdy and heavy(due to big battery). I will update this rating in month after I have expensively used them.
4,not able to use with iPhone even enabling Bluetooth. doesn't help.request suggestions.
5,I’ve had an earlier model of these earbuds without the noise cancellation. These work perfectly! They are great not just for the price. Completely Satisfied!
5,Loving them so far. The fit right out of the box was perfect and the included tips are a nice plus. The bass is impressive I tested them down to 20HZ and they were very smooth. The ANC mode is the main feature and it is awesome along with the 10 hour battery life and the waterproof capabilities.  Overall these are the whole deal other brands sacrifice a lot of features the NC9+ has at a higher price.
4,I like they way they fit and they way they look but it does not really have noise cancellation and the battery life is great
5,The sound quality is great.  I like how you can see the battery life.
5,Great gift for my wife. Great sound quality with Hybrid noise cancellation. Really good earphone with a great battery life.
5,Superb sound quality on these ear buds. Great battery life. The charging case has a visual numeric battery meter so you actually know the battery percentage. They fit perfectly in my ear and they were easy to pair. Came fully charged so I was able to use them straight out of the box.
5,I especially like the dual digital battery readout on the case for both the earbuds and the case. Excellent noise cancelling. Snug & secure fit. Also has a heavy duty battery built into the earbud case with USB outlet so you could also use to charge your phone - awesome!
5,These are the best ones so far. Sound amazing and pair seemlessly.I like that the charging box is already at 100% but the earpods need to have the strip taken off to start charging. So you'll get the best battery life possible.Not sure whatelese I could say or they could do better.. These are amazing! Probably be buying another pair for my daughter..
5,These earbuds are great quality for the price! Easy to setup and use. The ANC and transparency modes are awesome and sound quality is on point at any level. The wireless charging feature is an added bonus!
5,Tozo!!!! what can I say  Excellent sound quality connectivity & exceptional range.......the finest set of Bluetooth earbuds  I've owned to date.....Awesome company that stands behind there products thanks again Tozo for the quality at a reasonable price!.......
5,I bought these for my husband who listens to a ton of podcasts. He loves them and thinks they are the best ones he has ever had. They are comfortable in his ears and also stay in place. The battery life is super long too.
5,Tozo really nailed this one! Back is wireless charging and a really nice ear fit. This has a more detailed sound with great bass. Pretty amazed with this Bluetooth pair. Sound quality is WAY beyond airport and the detail retrieval is beyond any previous Tozo set as well. I couldn't ask for more! ANC isn't overly aggressive and is comfortable. Mics are clear. Very impressive!
5,Amazing product I love tozo earbuds nc9 plus I love the sound quality it keeps their charge almost full work day the box charger is great
5,Finally finally finally. Earbuds that stay in my ears. I always had issues with earbuds falling out during walks workouts or any activity for that matter other than sitting.The noise canceling properties are excellent the transparent mode is also quite nifty on my daily walks. This way I can listen for oncoming cars or other vehicles. The battery life is also pretty darn impressive. I use the earbuds daily sometimes for an hour or two and other times for several hours. (Yard work relaxing etc…)The case for the earbuds is quite robust. Has a good weight to it and displays the battery percentage clearly when opened. It works fantastic with my wireless charger as well.I’m very happy with this purchase and would absolutely recommend anyone and everyone to get a pair of their own.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These earbud have great quality with 8 house battery life and 24 hours with case.  Great design and quality! Absolutely love these.  Usb C and wireless charging.
5,The best part about these is that the case is wireless charging capable. It makes them completely wire free and the case also has both a USB A and USB C port in case you do not have a wireless charger handy or want to charge them on the go. These have an excellent battery life and unlike other headphones this case has a screen inside the tells you the battery life of the case and each headphone as well. Overall these are an excellent pair of headphones and have amazing bass and sound quality.
5,First of all the build quality is excellent. The case has a built-in screen to tell the battery remaining in the case as well as each earbud. The bass is really deep and the highs are very clear. Best part being the noise cancellation mode. It really cuts off the surrounding sound and with a quick touch you can disable this feature. Very impressed with the purchase.
5,These have been great so far. They pair automatically with my phone and the battery only goes down about 5% during a 2 hour workout.
5,Excelente sonido. La caja algo pesada al comparar con otros similares pero por el sonido y precio vale la pena.
5,This is the... 6th time I buy this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie and make a lot of purchases. About months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones (Tozo T10 and T12) and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy  my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last both in battery power insound an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging this newest version has an incredibly strong making. They did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I don't knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life and I gladly say it again.
5,These earbuds have two settings; transparent mode and active cancellation mode. The active cancellation mode does a pretty good job with wind noise. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Awesome!! Like what more can I say? These ear buds are amazing. They come charged and ready to go. Easy pairing  and they go a long distance. They have great bass and the noise canceling is def on point!  The battery lasts a for days as I haven't charged yet since I got them about a week ago. However I did throw them on a wireless charger to make sure they connect and they do. You can use them as a pair or single and they  are worth every penny I promise you won't regret  this purchase!
5,Excellent product. Battery life and sound quality is good. Noise cancel feature is good.
5,Love the sound.  They were easy to pair right out of the box. Really comfortable I forgot I had them in with the pass through on. So far no issue with them falling out like the Apple ones do with me.  The case is bigger and heavier than my TOXO 7 but will be easier to find in my purse. The wireless charging is a big plus and it shows how much charge is in each ear bud when you open the case - very handy especially since I often only wear one at a time.  Only con is the controls are different for each earbud and if I only have one in....
5,This is my second pair of TOZO earbuds these are insanely simple to pair open the case and make sure the device you're pairing to is scanning and within seconds you're paired. with a twist into the ear they fit snug and into the ear as to not get in the way. They're also well balanced.Battery life is outstanding and lasts over 8 hoursCharging is a breeze being wireless I just place them in my wireless charging base for my phone and you can keep track of the battery level by the 4 LED's while the case is closed or via the digital gauge on the interior with percentage.They come with 7 pairs of ear tips to fit just about any ear canal.I upgraded mine with some Comply Premium Tips TRUEGRIP PRO TW-200-C ear tips which are memory foam and have a much more snug fit as well it helps the sound isolation properties. While they have excellent bass I use the EQ with my phone music player app which allows me to tweak it to the sweet spot.The case has a USB C female and Standard USBANC or Transparency modes allow you to easily change the setting via one touch so you can isolate while watching a movie and then go to transparency mode to hear the announcements or stewardess during a flightA generous 18 month warrantyExcellent multi language instructionsThe controls for L and R differ slightly so once you get past that learning curve you can master the other one which are super simple touch or multi touch. I found these touch controls to be much more accurate than previous earbuds I've had before.If you want some earbuds with Deluxe sound great bass simple operation cool case and easy wireless charging then don't look further these new TOZO NC9 Plus series are top notch
5,These are the best yet by TOZO. They are comfortable and sound great. The NC is good and better than expected.  I wear these at work and they are perfect because they fit really good in my ears and don't fall out. I have been wearing them for a two weeks now and can say without a doubt they are an excellent buy especially for the price. I really can't  think of any thing I could say is a con for these. Battery life is pretty good and has not been an issue at all. Overall a great set of ear phones.
5,I have the T10s so at first these earbuds took a little getting used to given they are fitted to left/right ears (the T10s could be used in either ear). But when I got used to the fit they are much better in terms of not falling out and sound bc of the better fit.The button takes a little getting used to as well - as it’s just a touch button rather than a physical/mechanical button. But ultimately it’s better as the T10 button is much more likely to wear out.The one potential negative I could say about these is the charging cord is a USB-C. It comes with one but unless you have other USB-C cords - which I don’t - make sure you hang on to the one it comes with.
5,I have small ears for an adult.  These do not hurt my ears.  The sound it spectacular and very strong.  Easy to connect to my phone too
5,These earbuds have a solid fit in your ear so it will not fall out. Very good for running and working out especially with the improved transparency mode. The audio quality is very crisp. The extended battery life is awesome. Almost twice as much compared to most other true wireless headphones. Would highly recommend!!
5,Really comfortable and the sound is so crisp. I love the T6 earbuds but these are worth the extra money.
5,Best pair I have owned. Sound is clear and fullSize is good not too large.Definitely worth the extra cost
2,Always been worried about getting wireless earbuds simply for the fact if one falls out you could lose it. Products hurt my ear sometimes so be careful when use it
5,To know that this product beat some new $100+ shocks me  beautiful bass & clarity & long battery life with good warranty !!!!!! I don't regret purchase(:
5,The NC9 plus is a really nice improvement over the NC9s that I purchased a few months ago (which in themselves were excellent). The NC9 Plus model has a much longer battery life and if you like high volume and very deep bass these have it in spades! The mids and highs are also nicely balanced out. The bass is very deep but doesn't muddy up the midrange and treble. Noise cancellation is excellent - I have the TOZO NC2s also which has a little better noise cancellation in my opinion but you can't go wrong with either! Great job TOZO!
5,Thank you for the superb product TOZO  Its a pure joy to listen music on these buds  the first use turned out to be a enjoyable fun and loving experience  it exceeded my expectations .after continuos usage.it is  light and easy n happy feeling on ears..believing is everything here on this. for a music head this could be the apt choice  ANC can be further improved to take them to the top tier in that category. but it was good in blocking noise.Case is large which is ok to nd help power other devices Its a personal choice.
5,I felt in love with TOZO NC9 long time ago❤ - Noise cancelation/ Transparency mode is AWESOMENESS👍🏽- quality sound - small and light yet great quality. Then I found out about TOZO NC9 Plus...😯WOW! Works just as great with even MORE great features - Even LONGER battery life WATERPROOF & WIRELESS CHARGING!(wire charging if prefer included) ❤❤❤⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Must Have!
4,First the good…. And I mean really good!!! These sound almost as good as…. But absolutely have GREATER noise canceling then my $400 BOSE top-of-the-line headphones.And now the bad. Period. And I mean really bad. Yesterday when I got them I charge them all the way for a few hours. And they didn’t last four hours I don’t think they lasted as long as I charge them. So I charge them some more and then left them by the bed on on the nightstand not charging got up this morning and they had lost their charge 100%. Then I charge them again and as you can see by the photos they are not charging properly. These photos were taken in the 5 to 10 minutes that it took me to actually type this with the exception of bouncing back-and-forth actually take the photos. But we’ll see how they work and I will update you later.UPDATE: I fully charge them again wait until they were both blue light and they didn’t last four hours. They lasted maybe 2 1/2 to 3. So there’s obviously something wrong with the batteries in the actual earpieces. The case battery is excellent I charge it fully and plugged it up to my iPhone and it charged it to just at 50% which is pretty good for a portable charger.UPDATE: Customer service is going to replace them. They are very responsive and professional and they let me keep the malfunctioning pair. Once then new pair arrive I will update again.UPDATE: Customer service sent me a new pair and they work great. They can still be a little quirky software wise. But they work really well. And the sound is unmatched. I like these more than I like my Bose 700. I think the noise canceling is better than the boat over the ear headphones and the sound is superb.PLUS: They are going to allow me to try their newest earphone when they are ready and I will do a video review of the on YouTube and Amazon.TOZO is a good company with a great product. Would highly recommend.
5,The earbuds themselves are built so well sometimes I'll have transparency mode on and think they were in ANC mode because they are built thick lol. if you just want to chill at the skatepark and be alone like me  these are definitely a buy. battery life is so huge I can stay all day and they'll just recharge to full when I put them in the case.* Edit: I also forgot to mention there's a usb port unlike the original Tozo NC9 so you could charge your phone or something else too!!
5,Got these for my wife for going to the gym and working around the house.  She loves them.  They cancel all the noise from the kids yelling which she is really happy about!  The sound quality is great too and she like the way they fit her ears.  The battery % meter on the case is a nice touch too.  Very sturdy case and earbuds.  The wide selection of ear pads is also nice.
5,Tozo makes excellent headphones. I've owned several and given some to friends. I think the T6 is one of the best buys on the planet and I was impressed by almost everything in Tozo's first noise-cancelling earbuds. But my first NC9s were plagued by a tendency to stay on while in the charging case running the battery down.  I am very happy to say that Tozo has solved that problem with their NC9 Plus. Not only solved it but apparently built an entirely new charging system including an elegant digital LED display and a giant 2500 mAh battery. Out of the box I used my earbuds for a week and never had to charge the case which by the way accepts both USB-C and wireless charging. As for sound the NC9 Plus earbuds have a very crisp clean sound that leans slightly toward the bass. The noise cancelling (with transparent mode available at a touch) is effective in an office setting but I was unable to try it on a plane or on the street. If you're looking for a good-looking good-sounding set of NC earbuds at a very reasonable price Tozo's NC9 Plus should definitely be on your short list.
5,I am very pleased with these ear buds I am very demanding when it comes to wanting good sound when I listen to music and these certainly pass all the tests for sure.
5,I have been looking for a decent priced wireless earbuds without sacrificing sound quality and comfort. I have practically bought at least ten different kinds of earbuds and was not totally satisfied. I finally succumb to the overpriced Samsung Earbuds Pro because I thought that was the answer. But when I got it I still was not totally satisfied. I think I finally found the wireless earbud that I'm looking. The TOZO NC9Plus sounds GREAT the deep bass the sound clarity the perfect fit in my ear does not fall out of my ear and the battery life is very impressive.
5,I bought these because they have active noise canceling and transparency modes. So far they have not disappointed. The battery life had been great. I've only had to charge the case once in 10 days. It's right at 50% charge now. They have been comfortable enough to wear non stop through my 12 hour shifts at work.
5,This earbuds come with amazing battery life from charging case (therefore charging case is heavier than previous model) which can last around 160 hours as described by manufacturer. Another function attracted me is transparent mode which i can lock or hear outside sound with a single touch. I am so happy with this purchase. I recommend
5,They actually fit my ear well. The sound is good and I really like the carrying case.
5,I've tried other wireless ear buds and always feel like they are going to fall out during my workouts. These stay put and are comfortable to wear. I was really impressed by the battery life hours and hours of use and they are still at over 90%
5,The case is solid. The battery actually lasts 11 hours for just single charge!! The noise canceling is awesome. The sound and bass are great. Once you charge the case it lasts TWO WEEKS without charging the case.Tozo NC9 plus beats AirPods pro for every aspect!
5,My first impression was the carry case is heavier than usual (I could also say "the product is beautifully crafted" but I own other TOZO models so I am taking the product quality for granted now). Then I discovered it has two ports: 1 USB-C port for charging and another USB output port.  With the latter you can use the case as a charger to charge other USB devices.  And this explains why it is a bit heavier: it has a high capacity (2500mAH) charging battery.  Isn't this cool? It would be great for a day trip: just bring the earbuds and case and leave the phone power bank at home.Now down to the more serious features: pairing is super easy and the sound quality is excellent and well balanced.  The active noise cancellation works as advertised; with that the music is super clear.  Well you dont have to play music.  If you don't want to be bothered by the surrounding noise put on the earbuds and turn on ANC.I also tried using it to make phone calls. The folks on the other end of the line found my voice was loud and clear.All in all this is a wonderful and powerful product.
5,Great product great price. Earbuds sound great & good ANC.
5,I really like the Tozo NC9  so when the new one come I wanted to try and test these out. The  NC9 Plus earbuds are slightly bigger than the previous. The sound quality is still really good for the price and last a long time too. The case for the new NC9 is a bit heavier and larger than the old one but has a lot more power. I used it for a week but couldn't kill the battery. Highly recommend.
5,Love this company.  I’ve bought their products several times for myself and as presents. Comes with 6 different sized ear plugs 18 mo warranty usb charger and 3” case. Sound is excellent.  Great value
5,I had the original NC9 earbuds they worked well but would on occasion not fully shut off when seated back in their charging case.  The NC9 plus model here does not have that issue and has the bonus of being dual purpose with a larger battery in the charging case that can also be used to charge the phone when needed. The sound quality on these is great and I've been using these as my primary ear buds for several weeks now. Noise cancellation seems a little better than the original NC9 models and works pretty well. Very happy with my purchase.
5,I have used and reviewed multiple TOZO earbuds before these and I've always been happy with the brand. That trend is strong as ever here. Some things are familiar such as the premium design of the packaging. Other things are improved beyond what was already pretty great like the sound quality and fit. The biggest leap forward here is probably the case. It checks all the boxes: wireless charging charge percentage visibility USB-C and added perks such as having a large battery capacity and the ability to charge other devices via USB. The earbuds themselves are solid too. The fit and size are good (I stuck with the tips already on them and as with before other tip sizes are included) and the ANC and pass-through work nicely. I appreciate how easy it is to switch between the two; simply tap the left earbud once. TOZO continues to be a value brand you can count on.
5,Amazing headphones. The noise cancelling is like no other headphones. Battery life is a whole other thing because even tho the case is small for the headphones the battery life is amazing and unexpected. They fit in all kinds of ears. Would definitely buy again.
5,With the price like this..What can you ask for more?When looking for earbuds I first check out the comfort bass and connectivity.I was very happy that this pair passed my test and more surprisingly with much higher rating.Here are some reasons that I love about TOZO's NC9 Plus:1. Comfort: The box comes with multiple sizes of tips. My ears are quite small so I was pleased to see the smallest size was available.2. Bass: They are packed with decent bass that I've been looking for in this price range of earbuds. What's more I was still able to enjoy clear high and mid-range.3. Connectivity: Initial pairing-Open the case cover then find TOZO NC9 in your bluetooth list. Done! I was able to talk on the phone clearly in my bedroom with my iPhone in the living room charging (about 7-8m away.)4. Case: Wireless Charging Case! Superb! Plus it comes with USB-C in for charging the case and USB out for charging your phone! It's earbuds + power bank 2 in 1! Number indicator in the case is quite useful. You don't need to guess. Although it's bigger than other cases like Apple's AirPods I don't mind at all for the power bank capability. Also I don't like to put any case in my pockets anyways.Overall I would recommend TOZO NC9 Plus anyone who's looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds (+ power bank).
5,These earbuds are quite the deal! I really enjoy the ANC mode especially when working at home with a baby :)Earbuds fit quite nicely in my ears and the sounds is quite clear. Tozo have outdone themselves with this one!
5,I'm very happy with the new NC9 Plus earbuds. The sound is very clear with a nice deep bass sound. The clarity is way better than the more expensive Samsung earbuds that I was using before. The noise cancellation feature works as advertised and they fit comfortably. The battery life in the charging case lasts a long time. I highly recommend these earbuds over the other comparable earbuds on the market.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 TOZO makes the most amazing and convenient technology and these NC9 Plus Earbuds are no exception! The many features including exceptional noise-canceling technology easy pairing long battery life and the charging case being a valuable power source in itself are only some of the exciting features. I love these earbuds. They're comfortable and highly effective for the range of activities personally and professionally. Bravo again TOZO!
5,Tozo earbuds much like the others I have purchased in this brand are high quality and actually stay in my ear compared to others. Would definitely recommend.
5,I love the Tozo brand and their products just keep getting better and better. This set of headphones is no different! Great headphones at and unbeatable price!
5,EXCELLENT EAR BUDS
5,These earbuds by Tozo are a lil' bit more expensive than most their other earbuds but the enhanced battery life makes up for it.  I've never had any real issues with Tozo products.  This pair of earbuds in particular has awesome sound quality and awesome battery life.  You can not beat Tozo's warranty which is one of the best electronics warranties around.  They are super reasonable in what they charge for their products.  So if you want to spend a lil' bit more you get what you pay for.  Why spend triple to quadruple the price for Apple products when you can get a quality product without over spending.
5,I keep coming back to this brand and have bought a pair of every earbud they make so far and everyone in the family loves them.My kids bugged me for months to get a different pair from the “fruit” company but after using these they are hooked and couldn’t care less about the others anymore.I’m a customer for life and will continue to buy anything they come out with.
5,I just got these today and I’m already in love with them. First of they fit perfect in my ear the first ones I really like but sometimes have to adjust but these I took for a five mile run and just stayed in my ear comfortably. I’ve had my first one for years and I’m pretty sure these will last longer. The noise cancelling was on point and gave me a good pace since all I was focused on was running and my music. Lastly I used it for a call and was pretty awesome the first one I used to just work out since mic was just okay but this is so much better. The call was clear and no drop and the connection to my phone was smooth. Also comes with a C charger which is awesome and the charging station tells you the percentage of the battery that it has left. I super recommend this one better than the expensive ones that I have.
5,They just work It's wonderful to have such a seamless experience with wireless earbuds. There charge indicator for the earbuds the fact that it's a power bank to boot  The auto connecting when you open the lid. The sound quality is very well balanced with the lower end being the weak point. It's really the first pair of earbuds I've used that rival my headphones in sound fidelity.
5,I have used different wireless earphones in the past and always had issue with their battery life..However i am amazed by the amount of battery life these have. These wireless earphones last for the entire day. Plus their design is very attractive to eyes and it fits your ear perfectly..I usually love to dance and jog and I was skeptic whether these earphones will come out while dancing or jogging but their design structure is quite effective to keep these earphones stay at place. Even at night its comfortable to watch movies with these while laying on bed.  I have been using them since they got delivered and loving them. Some of the plus points I have noticed:1. Good battery life and affordable price they also have a battery display to tell you in advance about the remaining battery which is a plus point for me since i ususlaly forget when to charge my earphones2. Comfortable design and soft earbuds: they have very soft earbuds which gives comfort when using for longer hours and design which fits my ears perfectly3. Vey lightweight: I have used Bose wireless earphones before which were very bulky however these feels very lightweight and can be used for long hours at ease4. Their Noise cancellation is very powerful once you put them on you dont realize outside noise even when you are not playing any music.5. Attractive and catchy design and lighweight which makes them easy to take anywhere you go!!6. Great customer service: I am kind of relived that TOZO provides 18 months of warranty and great support sonce I have used their products in the pastI would strongly recommend these earphones to everyone!! Great BUY and you wont regret it!
5,These ear buds are nothing short of amazing!!!  The sound quality is incredible and these also have transparency mode!!!  Simply amazing!!!  Love all of the products that TOZO puts out!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             FirstI did not expect the weight of the case. It's not heavy but any means but you can totally feel it. I really enjoy the sound quality of the NC9 plus compared to the previous. NC9. The battery life on these earbuds is great. It can also charge other devices as a mini power pack as a small bonus. It has a very generous amount of features for it's price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             These earphones is a definite upgrade from its predecessor NC9. The sound quality is a bit better with a deeper bass. The noise cancelling is great and just as good as the NC9. The game changer for these earphones is that it is much easier to handle and it also fits in the ear much better. The case feels high quality and sturdy. One unique feature of these earphones is that the case also acts as a charger for other devices!
5,Things I Like* Long battery life* Case charging display* Noise canceling works but not as strong as a previous model* WaterproofFor the price they are a good set of wireless earbuds that can compete with others in the same range.
5,This set of buds have the best noise canceling technology of any I  have ever tried.  Longer lasting battery is a plus to any electronic item and this one is a winner.  Comfort is also important and the NC 9 plus delivers.  Great product.
5,This is the first pair of wireless earbuds I have ever had. I have a pair of Bone Conduction Open-ear headphones but these beat them by 200%. I also have a good set of wired earbuds that came with my phone and there is no comparison. The sound is so good I have recommended them to several of my friends.  I like a lot of of bass and these definitely fit the bill. I wear over the ear hearing aids and these even fit in the ear canal with the aids I was surprised they fit so well of course they are even better without the aids.  I have been using these about 5-6 hours a day and never even get close to running them down by the end of the day.  I charged them up the night I got them about 5 days ago and the case still has 82% battery level. I read comments saying that the case is heavy I was expecting lots more weight than it actually is it is very comfortable to carry in my pocket. One reviewer on here suggested buying foam tips which I did and am extremely happy with the fit and sound.  The noise cancellation isn’t as strong as I thought it would be but it is better than anything I have ever had.  I read reviews from several different models from Tozo and I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely recommend them to all.
5,I purchased these earbuds for travel and daily walks.  I am not disappointed.  They connect fast sound great and have a really good battery life.  Exactly what I wanted for travel.
5,Trifecta - good sound quality noise cancellation and battery life!
5,The sound quality on these is SOOO good! I think it's the noise cancellation that works really well. I own several pairs of TOZO earbuds (one for the gym one for running one for home one as backup in my bag...you know how it works;) and I love all of them -- but this model is my favorite so far.
5,These buds have a smooth and sleek feel which makes it nice to the touch. There are also interactive touch buttons on the buds which let you control functions like pause and playback. The buds are able to minimize external noise so that you can enjoy the music without hearing too much of noise from outside. The battery holds for a long time and I did not have to charge it all day. Compared to other buds I have this is simply amazing.
5,As always tozo products are packaged very nicely and securely. I was impressed with the nice hefty high quality weight and feel the ear buds case felt like and the they were fully charged as well which was a nice surprise. I easily turned them on and connected them too my Android phone. The noise cancellation worked great and the sound quality was amazing. Definitely will be using this on trips can't recommend them enough
5,I found these earbuds surprisingly comfortable with a large selection of cushions to fit.  The noise canceling shuts outside noises barely noticeable.  These earbuds were a great purchase for the quality.
5,These earbuds are awsome!  They have great sound and the bass is really defined.  I love the ANC mode when it is on it is like your wearing earplugs and totally drowned out all outside noise.  They are great to mow the lawn with you cant hear the mower only your music without having to have the music really loud!
5,Update:After using the earbuds for a number of calls I've found that they pick up a lot of background noise. They work fine if in a quiet place but if there is much background noise at all they don't work well as the person on the other end of the call gets all of the background. Still work great for listening during workouts but I've moved to Pixel buds for phone calls.Original:I have been using these earbuds for about 2 weeks now and overall I've been very pleased. They always connect to my phone immediately when removed from the case. I can connect left or right independently or both together. Battery life seems good though I haven't tested it to failure.  I think the sound quality is very good certainly better than the earbuds I replaced with these Tozo buds. ANC blocks out a noticeable amount of ambient noise though it's not perfect.I have worked out with them a handful of times and have not had any issues keeping them in place. I switched out the tips for another set (about 5 extra sets of tips are included) that fit me better and I've had no issues. This is one of the main reasons I got them so I'm very pleased that they stay put while lifting running and jumping.I have used them for several phone calls and they've always worked well with one exception. I had one call where the person on the other end couldn't hear me. It has only happened the one time so hopefully that was just a bad connection or something. Overall I am extremely pleased with these earbuds especially for the price.
5,I purchased the Tozo NC9 Plus as an upgrade to my MPow M12s and I am very happy with my purchase.  The sound quality is excellent.  I mostly use them for listening to audio books and for hands free phone use in the car.  The design allows you to easily insert the earbuds without accidentally fast forwarding.  They fit perfectly in my ear and remain comfortable.  The ANC works great I use it for hands free driving in a truck with a good deal of wind noise.  The noise is unnoticeable to those on the other end of the call.The case is larger than the MPow but still fits in a pocket and the ability to use as a phone charger is worth the size increase.  I haven't pushed the run time to a full 10 hours but it easily lasted a 6 hour trip.  The wireless charging also works flawlessly.
5,Great headphones. Best sound quality of any I've had so far. I go through a lot because I keep losing them. The noise cancellation and transparent mode work pretty well. The case and headphones have a high quality feel to them.
5,This is a great noise canceling headset by tozo.  Audio quality is amazing.  With multiple ear adapters it is easy to find the right fit.  I am a larger man but tend to like smaller ear adapters.  Most of the time they are slightly too large and don't sit well or tend to put too much pressure.  These fit just right with little pressure but stay firmly in place.  Battery life is amazing.  With the built-in charging case these last me all day even if I have to wear one at a time.  I am a huge fan of touch control for fast seemless transitions without having to go to my phone or remote.  The touch control is very easy and responsive.  I do not have any issues with them doing the wrong command.  I also love the ability to convert to outside audio so I don't have to remove them.  They kind of work like hearing aids I assume.  This is just another feature that shows how tozo is thinking outside the box and bringing a great well rounded product at an amazing price point.  I will buy several of these before I ever consider the pods.
5,Good quality
5,These are great quality quality and value compared to Apple air pods! Highly recommend based on the sound quality and battery life.
5,Of the many earbuds I have tried these are by far my favorite. They have a long battery life multi size tips for a perfect snug your fit with great sound quality.
5,The noise cancellation is rather good for the money. I don’t even use my other headphones anymore really. The transparent mode is a must have for runners and anyone else who wants to be listening to music and be aware. The TOZO nc9 is also very ergonomic in the ear. Other buds have fallen out but these don’t easily. I used to have to use a sweatband or hat to hold in my buds but with these I don’t. Having the ability to access the phone’s personal assistant from the buds is a big plus.  In case you wonder the upgrade between the nc9 plus and the nc9 is the battery. There is significantly more power in both the buds and the case. The buds last longer and the case lasts longer.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 A very sleek design high quality wireless ear buds that just perfectly fits into my ears. The audio quality and noise reduction features are excellent which  I’ve been looking for very long time.  I recommend this product
4,So I already had the t10 and t12 earbuds and like them for different reasons. These nc9 are nice too! Another win still getting used to them but I like the noice cancellation it’s subtle but works well in average noise environments like being in the living room with someone watching the tv with moderate volume it becomes nearly inaudible. With noise cancellation on you do lose some fidelity; not enough to hate them. Sound quality with the cancelation off is pretty good. On par with the t10 not as full as the t12. Haven’t found a use for the transparent mode. Just makes the music messy and distant.
5,I think these are my favorite anc earbuds now. The sound is great and they're completely comfortable. They stay in my ears when I'm exercising. Lastly I'm really excited that it comes with a battery that can be used to charge my phone as well. It just feels like a wonderful extra benefit.
5,work great stays in place
5,These earbuds are AWESOME! They Pair effortlessly to my Phone the sound quality is remarkable. The design is sleek and easy to use. A good value!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very long battery life. Sound quality and noise cancellation are fine!
5,I also have the model NC9. The NC9+ are even better. These last a lot longer battery wise which is great for really long trips. The sound is more clear with a more full base sound. You can't go wrong TOZO. They're brand of earphones are on par with high dollar earphones.
5,Got these for my teenage son. He really likes them. Easy to use. Hold a charge for a long time and comfortable in his ears.
5,Amazing portable headphones with powerful battery case.
5,These wireless headphones are AWESOME!! I especially love the compact case with a meter that reads how much power is left.  No more guessing how charged it is. Also love the range and noise canceling.
4,Very comfortable. Sounds quality is great. It comes with a bunch of extra pairs of plugs for your ears. I have bought many tozo products over the years an no problem with any of them.
5,Another good tozo product bass and treble are almost perfect right out of the box. bonus feature  the charging case is also a power bank.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             These are great the best TOZO earbuds yet!Pros:- wireless charging supported- tons of battery life with the earbuds and the case- has a USB-C and USB-A port on the case which can make the case work as a battery pack to charge other devices- most comfortable fit yet- great sound quality- USB-A to USB-C cable includedCons:- touch controls are a little awkward to get used to- case is a bit bulky but not bad and still totally worth it for the extra battery life- a bit more expensive than other budget earbuds. but it does seem worth the extra money for the extra benefits and still not as expensive as the alternatives
5,Great sound. The battery is unending and they fit comfortably.  I like the extra feature of charging my phone.  They pair instantly and everything works as it should. It took a little practice to memorize how to access each function but it’s not complicated. Overall I’m very satisfied with these earbuds I hope they last a long time.
5,The TOZO NC9+ earbuds are an upgrade to the original ones. The old ones fell off easier when I ran but this combined with the noise cancelling leaves my runs a great experience. Plus they're water proof so that's a plus since I get pretty sweaty. As someone that runs 5 times a week I recommend this.
5,These earbuds are very lightweight fit snuggly into the ear but do not feel too tight. The noise cancellation is a great feature. I like that the earbuds are CLEARLY labeled "R" and "L". I've had prior earbuds where it was a guessing game until you put them in your ear. I noticed the charging dock is rather heavy so I would carry with me on a run or even in my purse. I like the feature inside the dock where the % charged is clearly lit up! There are also battery life lights on the outside of the dock. Finally someone put a RUBBER section next to the opening of the dock. Usually my hand slips repeatedly trying to open the dock.
5,First of all I am very impressed with the packaging. They came in a very nice box with foam in extra protection during shipping. When I opened them I was impressed with the amount of ear silicone pieces to fit many ear sizes. They came fully charged in Sinking them to my phone was really easy. I like how you can just open the case pulled them out and they automatically connect to your phone. You do not have to play with power buttons or anything like that. Now to the sound they were very clear and precise Bass. I am very pleased with these earbuds. This is my second set. I was very upset when I lost the last pair. But this new model is much much better.
5,I ordered the tozo nc9 earbuds two months after owning them my right earbud speaker blow I contacted customer service they where on it very quickly and very professionally they replaced the earbud for free which I find uncommon theses days there customer service is great and so are there products!
5,TOZO always has great audio products especially when it comes to wireless earbuds. These earbuds give loud clear sounds with powerful bass. The case displays battery life and it has enough juice to help charge your phone as well. The case feels solid and premium. I would recommend these earbuds.
5,I have been using TOZO NC9 Plus for some time now and am so satisfied with it . The quality of sound is unmatched  noise cancellation works perfect and the controls are so easy . I love the extended battery life of the case which kind of gives me peace of mind not to worry about charging often. Earbuds are so light but are of high quality and are easy on ears. I would with no doubt rate them one of the best in the market.
5,I love a company that works to improve its products. TOZO did it once again with the NC9 Plus earbuds! An improvement over the original NC9 earbuds these fit sound and overall work better. They even feel better to the touch. The case is smoother and easier to use albeit a little larger. The lights on the side of the case and the interior charging display take the guessing game out of charging. Hopefully these will become available again because I’d buy these again if I needed another pair or a gift.
4,Great battery life and ANC. Controls are a little sensitive and I wish it had automatic pausing when one removes the headphones. Nevertheless for the price it's a great deal!
5,I uses different brands of EarPods ranging from Bose to Apple to Tozo.  When my daughter asked me to get pair my previous experiences told me to consider Tozo for its value.  NC9 Plus provide good sound for the price.  my daughter loves it.
5,I have a couple pairs of Tozo ear buds and these are even better than my other pair.  Sound is great charge quickly and holds for a long time many different ear pads included for different size ears.  They actually stay in my ears!  Would never buy the more expensive brand again.  Don't hesitate you won't be disappointed.
1,One ear phone blown after 6 months; bad quality sound distortion and barely makes a sound.Charging was always an issue.Earbuds automatically turn on when charging is finished attempting to take over sound in any paired devices when in range.Larger in ear than the t6 more charging issues than the t6 and more expensive.
5,Great earbuds from a great company. Sound quality is excellent for my ears. The cost is fantastic for the quality of the earbuds and the charging caseI would highly recommend it.
2,Earbuds pair to laptop but have to re-pair if I change from watching shows to playing games for some reason.  Both earbuds work fine in "transparent" mode (plays surrounding noises through earbuds so you can leave them in at work or etc) - Left earbud does not work well for "ASC/ANC" mode it crackles and plays echoes of whatever media is being played when switched to that mode.  Returning product for refund due to this.
5,I already really like my NC9 so the fact that this one has an expanded battery is a big plus. I can definitely see it being great for long travel scenarios as it will let me save my power bank for my phone rather than my headphones.
5,First off - Money was no option! I was desperately searching for the best sound/functions as an alternative to my Apple AirPod Pros that consitently fall out of my ears and I read many reviews before I purchased a pair of TOZO NC9 Plus earbud and the sound is amazing! Bass Mids and Treble are all there and engineered to total perfection! Love not having the AirPod stems and I also love being able to tap for volume up (right) and volume down (left) without having to ask that Siri lady to do it for me! The ANC is amazing and I was shocked that the Transparent is delightful! AirPod Pros seem to punish you with an unpleasant listening experience when not in ANC mode but these NC9s handle transperant mode masterfully without rendering an amplified verision of your surroundings like Apple does.I listen to a wide range of music but I have been stuck on the retro sound of Grace Jones lately and when I played her on the TOZO NC9s I actually heard instruments and studio sounds that I DID NOT HEAR on my Apple AirPod Pros! Amazing Grace!!!!Get ready for this! I paired the TOZO NC9 in seconds with my Apple Watch and I am now one truly happy camper! The sound quality is so incredible I think theye will be my primary listening devices based on Sound Quality Functionality Comfort! They feel amazing and I have had them in for several hours!I may be listening to far more music due to the sound and comfort of the TOZO NC9!!!!  (UPDATE!) Had to return and replace because the Charging Case lights stayed on! Could be it does not like being on wireless charging overnight... We will see! Got replacement super fast and I have not used my AirPods since!
5,I've been using my new TOZO NC9 Plus earbuds as my primary earbuds for the last couple of days. I've listened to both music and audio books and the sound quality is really good. They fit really well and are very comfortable. There are extra tips included in a variety of sizes so you'll be sure to be able to get a really good fit. The noise cancellation feature works really well. You can easily switch between ANC and transparent modes by touching the left earbud. The battery life for the earbuds themselves is good - it seems like they could last for quite a few hours without having to go back in the case. I haven't seen them get anywhere close to running out since it's so easy to just put them back in the case to charge when I'm done listening. I've never tried the original NC9 earbuds so I don't have them as a point of comparison. But these are definitely on par with my other TOZO earbuds which are also very good.I've noticed a couple of things that are very unique to these earbuds. First - the case has several battery displays. On the outside there are 4 dots that light up to show the charge level. Inside the case there's a more detailed display that shows you the exact percentage charge remaining in the case. Also there's a display for each individual earbud that has 4 bars that light up to show the charge level. Another thing which I didn't notice in the product info or in other reviews is that the charging case also doubles as a mini power bank. To use this feature there's a cover on the case that you can open to expose two charging ports. One of the ports is a USB-A that you can connect to your phone or other device to charge it from your earbud case. Since the case doubles as a power bank it's quite a bit bigger than other earbuds. It's not necessarily a bad thing just something to be aware of. It fits in a small pocket but a larger pocket or in a bag/backpack would probably the preferred way to carry them for extended periods. But with all the extra battery the case has you won't have to recharge the case for a very very long time. So these will be great for situations where you might not be able to charge that frequently (long flights camping...).Overall I'm super excited about these new earbuds and I highly recommend them. Thanks TOZO!
5,The TOZO NC9 Plus ANC Wireless Headphones are definitely one of my top favorite pairs of wireless headphones in my collection. The sound quality has a perfect balance of highs mids and bass for all music genres. The sound is crisp the bass is deep and not too heavy. I paired these with my IPhone XR without any issues. These headphones have a long battery life which is perfect for those long workouts. The charging case appears to be of high quality and even has a digital meter to give you a better idea of how much juice you have left. The sound volume does not get too loud but the ANC definitely does a good job of blocking out outside noise so you can enjoy your music without any distractions.
4,I reviewed the NC9s a few months ago and said they were a good deal for the price. For not much more this newer version has a couple of significant improvements the biggest one being the charger. Unlike the earlier version this one shows both the charge level of the headphones as well as the charge level of the battery pack. It takes a lot of use to get that down much below 70%. I only use these for a few hours each day and have found that it takes less than 10% of the charger power to bring them back up to full.The documentation doesn't mention it but on the front of the battery case is a small door which when popped open reveals both a USB-C port (to charge the battery pack) and a standard USB-A port which can in a pinch be used to charge anything else. I say "in a pinch" because getting even a 50% charge on my iPhone7 drained the battery completely. A device that required less power would presumably drain your battery less. Still it's nice to have something which can double as an emergency power brick.The battery pack can also charge wirelessly but my experience is that it will charge more quickly with a fast-charge USB charger like the Anker Powerport.Sound quality while not a match for headphones costing three or four times as much is still quite impressive and this newer model seems to have more bass than the original.  ANC mode is OK although (again) no match for much more expensive earbuds. These are lightweight enough to wear in bed and their "in the ear" design makes them more comfortable for sleeping although they're not quite comfortable enough for a side sleeper (I have yet to find earbuds that are).Speaking of earbuds: although Tozo offers seven different sizes and shapes of tips I still got better results by replacing their originals with a set of memory foam tips from Comply. Best results though came with the SpinFit CP360 XL ear tips. They keep the earbuds firmly in place and substantially improve bass response and ANC. If you have bigger ears I strongly recommend the SpinFit tips as a companion purchase. They're cheap and comfortable.The 8-hour battery life seems about right. I have fallen asleep with these a couple of times and they seem to last nearly all night.Overall these are for the price a very good deal. They are *almost* as good as (say) the Apple AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XMs for a fraction of the price and would appear to have better battery life than either of them. BlueTooth range doesn't seem to be as good as the those more pricey phones but I think you'd be hard put to find a set of earbuds at this price point that are as good as these.
5,The quality of sound is impeccable to be honest. The bass is great the battery life is fantastic! And they definitely cancel out noise definitely a great buy!
5,These headphones are so sleek and as an audiophile they’re way out of their league in price. I absolutely recommend these to anyone who cares about sound quality and battery life. I would say their comfort is average as most buds are. Love these things overall.
5,These are the third pair of Tozo earbuds I've bought and I have to say these are the best ones so far. They do a good job of blocking out noises and the sound quality is great especially considering the price. I mostly listen to metal and these allow me to hear things I normally don't hear with my nice surround sound speakers.
5,This is my 5th pair of TOZO wireless ear buds and probably my favorite pair they are by far the best fitting the noise cancellation feature is nice and being able to switch to transparent mode so you don’t have to take out your earbud to hear is awesome. The battery life on these is great like 6 to 8hrs which is insane given their size. Good heavy duty case with multiple charges so you don’t have to charge the case but every couple of days or even just once a week. Would highly recommend
5,I love these TOZO NC9 Plus Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds.  I do not hand out 5 Stars for many items.  The sound quality is great - the highs are high and the lows are low.  There are many interchangeable tips to fix any ear.  There are voice confirmations when connecting pairing and ANC mode changes.  This seems better than just a few beeps for some folks who can't remember what each tone means.  I do have an older set of TOZO earbuds and these are a great improvement in the design battery life and sound quality.  On top of that if I happen to find one lost it is far from an expense to replace it.
5,I have been using these almost every day for either music audiobooks or talking on the phone. The NC is great - my husband used them while he was working on his car and it drowned out the sound of the engine. The new silicone tips are MUCH more comfortable because they are flat on the end. The sound is crystal clear and the microphone is clear when I’m on the phone. And even though I’ve been using them for hours a day the battery life in the case is still at 98%!
5,My right earphone stopped working on my Tozo NC9.  Customer service was great and they sent me the. NC9 PLUS.  Wow!  Absolutely spend a little more for the NC9 Plus.  Sound quality is A-MAZING.  Also noise canceling is on another level.  You can't go wrong.
3,Transparent mode isn't effective its difficult to hear people speak.The earphones randonly made this incredible whistling sound when I had them together in my hand almost like interference? Manufacturing fault?Sound quality is good the noise cancellation works.Battery life is very good.Visual digital display for battery is very helpful and clear.The way they sit in your ears take a while to get comfortable with.The touch sensitivity is either too sensitive and you switch between 3 modes whilst taking them off or you have to make multiple attempts to execute commands.Case feels flimsy the bottom part which has the battery and where the earphones insert is solid the top part not so much feels a lot more fragile like it will crsck under a little pressure. With the airpod case as a comparison it feels like a uniform shell.Obviously this costs a fraction of the airpod.I've sent an email enquiring if my issues are manufacturing ones or batch issue etc - if I don't update this it means they're not.
5,I took a risk buying these as I hadn't heard of the manufacturer before but I am happy to say the risk paid off. You just don't find good quality sound and bass in such a small form factor at this price point. The noise cancellation is good but could be better maybe if I changed the silicon buds I'd get a more powerful ANC but I'm happy with the normal size. Apart from that I can't fault them at all. Charging case doubles up as a portable battery pack to charge any number of devices. I can charge my phone to at least 60% when the case is at 100% so I'm never left lacking for juice. Highly recommended!!
5,Funcionan estupendamente.El brillo con que aparece en la foto la capacidad de carga es muy inferior.El control de volumen funciona dejando el táctil pulsado pero es muy lento.
5,Simply cannot be beatenTrue Bass and clarity of soundNot fully tested phone functions but I have very high hopes it’s function will match the build quality and simple controlsOne word of caution is that the connectors are covered with a plastic protective film that you need to take off otherwise it will not chargeOtherwise outstanding value and brilliantly constructed
4,Noise cancellation is noticeable but doesn't block all external noise but is slightly better than passive earbuds I've had previously. The pass through is good though as you can clearly hear voices and external noise increase when in use. Sound volume is adjusted via the connected device but quality is good good range for both audio books and music. Call quality also good
5,Bien en general...de momento
5,This earbuds are so good and the case it’s also very beautiful the sound it’s fantastic the base it’s very rich and pleasant all round sound it’s very good.You can hear all the sounds very clearly and very crisp and very loud.Battery life it’s very good I’m very pleased with these earbuds I’ve got nothing to complain about very easy to pair and connected I have no issues at allI’ve got another 3 pair one of them it’s more expensive than these but these are the best so far they are waterproof as well I like the transparent mode because when I listen to my music  I can listen to outside sounds like cars crossing the road the wife talking to me etc plus ANC mode  witch it’s quite good  I can listen to my music without any noises from outside. In all I’m really very pleased and I would recommend it and gave 5 stars because for that price are the best value for money in my opinion note I have been using these TOZO earbuds for two weeks now and I have NO issues at all to complain about all I can say they are brilliant earbuds plus the case best sound best battery life best case you have got everything you can ask for an earbuds
4,Lovely EarPods but they require the volume control to be higher.
2,I'd bought this brand before and was really impressed. With this one though the noise cancellation was poor as I kept hearing whistling sounds. And the device told me the battery level was over 80% then it would switch itself off after telling me battery level was low
5,Best sound  .got both very high tones. And every good full Rich low Bass sound.  I Got.  Two  sets.
1,Item arrived followed instructions.  This item held the charge for only one hour.  Poor defective product stay clear.  So shocked.
1,La batteria non carica neanche in 24 ore e quando lo fa dura pochissimo . Li restituisco
1,Buoni auricolari….con bassi abbastanza equilibrati …..alti un po’ da perfezionare….il dispositivo di annullamento del rumore è abbastanza valido…
1,The ANC is terrible even without anc it feels like they blot in and out of sound cancelling to transparency mode whenever they want.Ridiculous bought them as an upgrade to my NC2's and I honestly think the NC2's are better by everything.
4,Fitted my ears nicely and isolated noise very well on trains.
