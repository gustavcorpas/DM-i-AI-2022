1,Let me summarize it for you.  Go to Antennaweb.org and enter your address.  The stations in yellow are what you MAY get with this antenna.  BUT do NOT buy this antenna.  Get a ClearStream 2V or 4V.  You will thank me later.Now for the gory details.  I made the mistake of buying this antenna without doing three hours of research first and assuming that the "product description" was not a bold faced lie of horrendous proportions (wrong).  I got it and tested it on the ground.  It picked up the stations coming from a tower 46 miles away in 1080p.  I thought my "100 mile range" antenna didn't receive the towers 33 miles away on top of the highest point in the state (with binoculars I can see them) because there is a thick group of pine trees in the general direction of the other towers.  WRONG!  With my incorrect assumption firmly in place I proceeded to mount this on top of a two story house above the trees with a clear line of sight to the towers 33 miles away.... and I didn't pick up the stations.  FAIL.I checked everything and reset everything scanned stations over and over to no avail.  I finally sent an e-mail to support.  Still no response from the company BTW.  Forget it.  I returned it and replaced it with a ClearStream 2V which picks up all of the towers even though it's not "omnidirectional."  So let me save you the trouble and research and explain how this over the air digital antenna stuff works.It doesn't matter how close or how far a tower is away from you.  It has to do with the power of the transmitter at the tower (of course).  The towers send out waves that carry embedded in them a digital signal but they're still waves.  The strength of those waves and how many obstructions there are between you and the towers determines how far away you can pick up the signal.  For this antenna to pick up towers from 100 miles away like it claims those towers would have to be transmitting over the surface of the ocean with no obstruction and with so much power it would interrupt the migratory flight patterns of trumpeter swans and probably kill all honey bees within 25 miles of the tower.  In other words it's just a bold faced lie.OK so back to digital signals.  A digital signal means that the waves transmit bits and bytes and importantly those digital signals carry with them built in signal correction so even if some of the message gets lost along the way it can be rebuilt from the pieces when it arrives.  What this techy speak means is that you will not get varying grades of snowy reception like you did with old analog signals.  Instead you get a full picture.  The picture quality is crystal clear 1080p if you have a properly selected antenna.  As signals get weaker it gets progressively lower in quality going from 1080p down to 720 480 and ultimately to the point where you get pixelation and finally there isn't enough data to build the images.  Pixelation is where parts of the picture get broken up because there isn't enough data arriving to build and/or correct the image.  You'll get an image with a row of weird looking blocks or an area on the screen that has weird looking blocks.The way ALL antennas work is they receive whatever signals they can from ALL directions.  ALL antennas are "omnidirectional" it's just that some are designed to optimize signals received from a single "direction." Importantly that direction is not a straight line but an ever expanding triangle going out from the antenna.  Also there is no such thing as a special HD antenna.  That's just marketing garbage.In my case I have towers located at 118 degrees and 226 degrees from my house so there is 108 degrees between them.  With the Clearstream 2V I point it 118 degrees toward the weaker towers which are closer.  Even though the tower at 226 is "out of the cone" it still picks up the stronger tower at 226 degrees just fine PLUS it picks up a tower located at 56 degrees which is 55 miles away basically in the opposite direction as the 226 tower.In the old days of TV you had VHF and UHF and you had two types of antennas to pick up each type of signal.  You still have both bands and you will still need BOTH types of antennas built into whatever you get.  One set of waves is picked up by circular shaped antennas and one set is picked up by straight lines.  If the antenna you're considering doesn't have both shapes you will have poor reception in one band or the other.Now things get tricky.  Channels 2-13 are VHF and channels 14-51 are UHF BUT when things switched to digital signals the towers changed the frequency they broadcast on.  My "Channel 13" used to broadcast on analog VHF channel 13 but now broadcasts digitally on UHF FEQUENCY 17.  So although it's channel number is 13 and in days of old I needed a VHF antenna to get it now it's 17 and I need a UHF antenna.  Meanwhile two other channels broadcast in VHF frequencies.  Also you don't get just a single channel.  Most of these "stations" broadcast 3-5 different channels ie. 13.1 13.2 etc.FWIW the VHF towers were not picked up by this 1byone antenna because there are no long straight things sticking out.IMPORTANT:  Antennaweb.org will tell you the broadcast frequency for each channel in your area.Finally let's talk about the actual antennas.  Today's antennas are MUCH smaller than the monsters that used to be on houses but they do a MUCH better job at picking up signals so they don't need to be as big.  I learned a lot about antennas but here is the summary.  Any disk looking omnidirectional thing is going to have a hard time with VHF towers.  Those antennas with claims of "150 mile range" that look like you should be trying to pick up the signal from an elk that has a radio tracking collar where the antenna rotates... those that show up first in the Amazon search... yeah they're basically all the same made by the same Chinese company marketed under different brands.  The rotor burns out and or the internal electronics fail within a short time.  They're cheap and break easily.  Do not buy them.  Repeat after me "I will not buy them."  One more time.  DO NOT BUY THEM.  Lava Five Star PBD View TV.... I'm talking about those.That leads me to the ClearStream 2V and 4V.  Honestly... just buy one of these save yourself the headache and be done with this.  I got the 2V with the wire grid to optimize signal pick up and it picks up towers classified as yellow green and red on AntennaWeb.org.Now for the one star rating.  Why does this antenna get 1 star?  If you have an RV and you're going to set it up near a city and you just want some stations I'm sure this is fine.  If you go to AntennaWeb.org and all your stations are in yellow it's likely fine as well.  It delivered a picture from the one tower it was receiving.  There was nothing "wrong" with the physical product HOWEVER the product INCLUDES the product description which is supposed to provide "product information" that is at least reasonably accurate.  The  information about the product is just a series of bold faced lies meant to mislead consumers.No one has time to educate themselves on the intricacies of every single industry for every single product they buy.  The purpose of the product information is to inform and educate the buyer and even in a "buyer beware" world when the antenna claims 100 mile reception and your stations are 33 miles away you ASSUME that no company would overstate the capabilities of their product THAT much.  You ASSUME that even if it's 1/3 as good as they say you're still covered.  Yet this product did the opposite.  It purposely misled.  It forced me to do hours of research to figure out what's wrong with a $70 product because support NEVER got back to me.  Plus NOW I don't trust any of the product descriptions on these antennas so I have to understand what's behind those claims.  Most importantly the product and its marketing lies caused me to spend one evening mounting this thing and another evening taking it down followed by yet another evening replacing it with something else.In short this little antenna cost me far too many hours of my life that I will never get back and support is non existent.  So since the antenna the company and their marketing have no regard for my time I thought I'd spend just a little time exposing their little game and saving YOU from wasting your time.  Spend the hours and hours and hours I just saved you doing something amazing for the world!Cheers.
4,The antenna is easy to install and is a good value.  I mounted the antenna on an exterior wall and connected three televisions.
5,The antenna arrived as expected. The outer Amazon box was un damaged but the antenna original box showed signs of wear and tear. When I opened the box I realized it had been a returned item so I was concerned. However I gave it a try and I picked up almost 20 additional channels and problems I had with existing channels (pixelization) was gone. This antenna is definitely a great purchase for the price. Mine is installed in the attic! Imagine if I install it outside.
5,We originally tried the black window panel over the air antennae; it worked pretty well but our window doesn't face the right direct for optimal reception so picture would often pixilate. Decided to try the 360 degree antennae. Mounted it in our attic space and extremely happy with the quality and number of channels we now receive. Just bought a second one for our bedroom TV (didn't want to risk splitting the signal)
4,Had to run extended cable and splitter but it has 3 TV's and one FM Stereo on it and all reception  is greatly improved. All local channels went from 2 to 5 bars dumped a rotor antenna for this. It works great.
5,Dislike:  This outdoor antenna needs 110 volts a/c to operate.  Like:  I mounted it indoors and it works great.  The mounting mechanism also worked great for me. My friends think I have some clever spying device in my home.  Many don't remember rabbit ears.
4,Pretty much "plug n play" . Although a solid poll for mounting is a must.This was used in a coastal pacific northwest location with line of sight at the local repeaters.It pulled in 13 channels with good reception.
5,I installed it on the side of a metal sided outbuilding and immediately pulled in dozens of high def channels. Very pleased!
4,we did not get very good reception on our RV antina but thhis worked great and easy to set up
5,I have bought (and returned) at least 15 different OTA antennas and this is only one of 2 that actually work well....easy to mount and gets many channels.....the only other antenna that worked as well was the old style metal one that is bulky and big...this unit is compact and has a long coax so it can mounted outside-nice and light and u can move it for the best signal...i will not be returning this one!
5,Easy to install. Picked up a lot of channels immediately. Happy with this product.
5,This thing works Great! I read some reviews and 1 was bad and 5 were good. So I decided to get one and see for myself how it would work. Amazon has a Great Return policy if you want to send it back. So this Antenna not only picked up my original channels clear as a bellit also got me 18 new channels and it performed well in a big storm  that hit yesterday. I mounted it on my old Antenna tower above the house. I can run 2 TV s off of this thing at the same time So I wont be sending it back.
3,Its not the antenna in most cases that will get you any channels its your location and proximity line of sight to the stations antennas.  If you have a hill in the way between you and the antenna HD is not coming your way from that station probably 5 miles away.  If you don't have a hill in the way you might be able to reach the full advertised distance.  That not just this antenna its all of them.I was very disappointed though on the claim of signal from any direction hence the main purpose of having bought this thinking put it up circular design omni-directional will get all the stations I got with the past straight antenna without having to position and maybe I could even keep it in the house and not have to climb to the peak to install.  Its a fail position direction and angle of this antenna all impacted even the basic channels that we can get quite easily with most any of the advertised antennas.Its that set where the direction has to be right and the line of sight right that this fails on too.  held it in many locations with good direction to the antennas it mattered which direction the circle was pointing or you got some or none or the additional tougher channels some.I've come to the conclusion just get an antenna that is the least price and points in a direction toward the television stations they'll just as good as all this high priced false advertising and fancy look and feel.  Can't give it a 1 cuz it did sort of work just not as advertised but none of them do its my 3rd variation of trying this time around.
3,Would not pull in all channels until I tilted the top of antenna towards the towers then it pulled in the channels
4,Ordered it and it was simply to install. I also order a flat cable to use it through my window. And ever sense I installed it. Picture is clear. And haven't had any issues with it. Only issue was when I first scanned the channels. I got some channels that was black. Second time I scanned. They was gone.  I didn't get channels I thought I would of received with this product. But that not the products fault.  If you get this antenna it worth the price. Just don't forget for the flat cable.
5,We just no longer needed cable. This device gives us as many channels as we need. If we need something else we can pay for it individually and still save $50-$75.00 a month.;';
5,It's by far one of the best amplified antenna tried some others but can't beat the reception or durability.
3,Had a cup of water in it after the first rainfall
5,Works like they said it would. So easy too install and set up!!! Works great and definitely recommend!!
5,Way better than a flat wall mount!
5,I live way out in the country and have had to use streaming service because I could never get any more than a few channels. I mounted this antenna on my roof and instantly got 75 channels. I am no closer than 48 miles from any tower and was amazed at how many channels I got. It was very easy to install and only took about an hour. I made sure an installed it in an open area and pruned back some tree limbs so there would be no obstacles getting in the way. I got another one to use when we go camping and I can get anywhere from 50 to 60 channels. Great buy and worth the money.
3,The primary signals in the area do not come in; 6.1 8.1 and 12.1 . All the associated channels come in beautifully; like 6.2 thru 6.6 8.2 thru 8.5 and 12.2 thru 12.5 . The are transmitted from their respective towers. Each channel main number has its own transmitting tower.
5,Easy to install clear picture and receive 92 channels.
4,I thought I’d get more channels with 360 but got more channels on my old standard antenna but still had great picture
5,Muy buenos
3,Antenna is lite weight.  But it does not pull in channels 100+ milesEquipped line amp that comes with it is no good. I had to use a higher amp to pull in channels. Most channels I get are from south bend Indiana and I live in Michigan along the lake.
5,This antenna is much better than what I have previously owned. With this antenna I upped my choices in the Houston area from 87 on one TV and 64 on my second to 117 channels on each of my two TVs. I am using a splitter to share the signal so a single TV without using a splitter might have even more choices. The instillation was very easy and the included co-ax cable allowed me to install this antenna and not disturb my old system in the off-chance that I liked the old signal better or it had problems with multiple TVs. The only drawback to this system is that the plastic right angle mounting bracket is one way only. It has splines on each connecting point to adjust the angle but the splines are not the same on each end. I tried to set it up where the cable would slide straight down the supporting pipe but that wasn’t an option with the way the bracket was made. Not a big thing I made a loop with the cable but it could have been designed better. I did appreciate that no tools were needed up on my roof after the support pipe was mounted. The cable has knurls so it can be tightened with your fingers and the bracket has large wing nuts for adjustments this means fewer tools to drop and need to be retrieved before the job is finished. Additionally I live in an area that has few outside antennas and this antenna has style and doesn’t shout “TV ANTENNA”. I like that.
3,After the ad stated it supported 4k HD I assumed the product would say so but only says hdtv not what resolutions it does/doesn't support.Most of all there is no mention of it requiring 110vac to power a 5vdc power supply. No mention of needing any power at all. I bought it to use when camping so didn't appreciate this surprise.Quality of construction looks poor too and I'd never trust the plastic brackets to support it mounted on the roof of an RV.I haven't hooked it up yet as I'm considering if I should return or rethink the project. If it works well inside the camper and I can mount it on a flagpole when remote camping I may just keep it. If it's no better than my 25yo rv roof antenna when used indoors Then it will get returned.Expect an (as seen on tv) type of marketing on the box and unbranded Chinese parts in the box. Of course I will update my review if I find the performance exceptionally good or bad but even if it's the best reception I've seen it still won't earn 5 star.Could be a decent antenna for an apartment so I generously offer 3 stars.
2,EDIT  10-12-2021:  Antenna slowly died receiving less and less channels until it was only one channel out of over 50 originally received.  I checked all cable connections and went up and down the ladder from rooftop several times.  I finally took it down and heard water sloshing around the inside.  THIS THING IS NOT WATERPROOF.  3 days past the return window and I called Amazon.  They would not take it back but gave me the unpublished number for the seller.  Seller sent me another.  I used clear silicon caulk around all the seams (don't forget the one near the bracket).  So far OK but a lot of aggravation. I lowered my rating to 2 stars.  This antenna may work fine in an attic but not in exposed weather.  Eventually I took it apart and sure enough there is not a gasket and it was full of icky water (see picture).Original Review was 3 stars as written below:  I am surprised how sensitive this antenna is to a little tilt.  I have experimented and moved the unit just a little bit and get really mixed results.  I bought this to replace an older similar antenna made by another manufacturer that was blown off the roof. Sadly this antenna does not pickup as many channels as the old one.  Most of my stations have towers that are about 35 miles away but in different directions. I just can't get them all like I used to with the old unit.  The old unit was advertised as a 60 mile unit and this one 100+.  Apparently a strong antenna is not good for 35 mile away towers.  It was a lot of work to get this up on a mast on the roof so I am not likely to take it down to send it back.  I'm just a bit disappointed.
3,HAD TO GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE TO REPLACE MISSING BOLTS. THE BOX HAD BEEN OPENED BEFORE. I'M NOT HAPPY SO FAR
4,Between 2 major cities equal distance apart and within the range for this product. I only get the channels from one of the cities not the other. I live in the highest part of my little city so I should get from both directions. It is mounted on the highest part of my roof.
5,It was easy to install and we get 40 channels.
3,Just a so - so antenna. I had a rotating antenna that was starting to give sporadic reception so I thought I'd try an Omnidirectional one so I didn't have to be rotating the antenna every time the weather changed. I'm afraid I can't really recommend this antenna. It doesn't give any better reception or bring in anymore channels than my old cheap antenna did and it was $20 more. It was easy to install however. I live approx 34 - 40 miles from the transmission towers and this was advertised as a long distance antenna so I thought it surely would be better than what I had but it isn't. It pulled in 33 channels but several of those aren't displaying either picture or audio. As long as it  is pulling in the basic national channels I'll probably keep it just for the convenience of not having to worry about rotation but I wouldn't purchase again.
3,Worked for 4 months until it gradually started getting bad reception. And it was installed correctly on a pole next to the roof.  Finally decided to check it out took it down and heard a sloshing sound.  When I took off the coax cable water started dripping down.  It totally looks sealed and the coax cable was tight and the plastic covering was tight.  Not sure where it leaked from but evidently rain got in.  Will not be getting the same one now.  Be warned.
5,We now have clear tv!
4,Too bad the price of these has nearly tripled since I bought the first one.
4,We installed this the day after we received it.We went from 20 channels to 59 channelsWas easy to installIt has been through two wind storms and a couple of heavy rain storms and still working
5,This is my access to the news of the world when the power (have generator) and/or cable fails. Beautiful screen imaging.  Air DTV = 95 channels & TV PLUS = 216 at my location.
4,Good 👍
4,Cut the cord at second home.
5,great reception and value!
5,I purchased this product to bring in television signals that previously were difficult to view. I do not have cable access at my home therefore I have tried many OTA antennas.Product install details: my 1byone antenna is mounted 10' above ground and the rig output is delivered to a Seiki HD television. That's it. The manual explains how to do it.A simple scan here brings in over 3 dozen channels (it is possible to adjust the sensitivity). The image quality is exceptional. I would call it DVD quality. I don't know what thickness means but the antenna is an easily mounted slim disk. The channel discrimination is great.Edit added Feb 18 2021. The critical component is the little 1byone amplifier. Our city received a foot of snow yesterday so I disconnected the exterior antenna. I attached a very cheap indoor antenna instead. All the channels came in strong and clear. The little indoor antenna does not receive any channels on its own.
5,Easy to install on roof.  Picture is amazing on new TV.  Did not work with older tv.
5,Four attempts at get all the local channels and finally got it.  Best that I have found.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love this antenna! Easy to install. Picture quality is awesome. And over 150 clear channels. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
5,I live in an apartment so I couldn't have a big bulky antenna and my indoor antenna just wasn't doing the job. This is discrete and the white blends in with the building. I went from a 1/2 dozen channels at best to almost 30. This is a great antenna!
5,This unit works great and is easy to install  good value good picture
5,Got rid of my cable and satellite. Now streaming and using this antenna I get over 155 channels of local digital TV- all for free....!!!!
5,I get 24 channels
5,Mounted inside my attic instead of outdoor for ease. Living in west Houston I'm picking up 140 channels pretty well.
2,Got better picture quality from a cheaper regular directional antenna without glitching. Too late to return it. Any buyers for half the price???
4,I have not yet installed this as the weather has been such to prevent it.  I am going to mount in on the roof on the pole of my old antenna.  A previously owned 1byone antenna worked great in my old home so I am confident that this one will also.
3,This antenna works great but it's built cheap flimsy I don't expect it to last long
5,I used this to get reception on my bonus room tv. I also have one for my bedroom rv and I have used one in my family room this past year. I am completely satisfied. I have recommended this item as recent as yesterday to my family members to order .
5,We live out in the country and no cable is available.  All other antennas I have tried I constantly have to turn the antenna to get better signal.  No more!!!!
4,It's okay definitely better than the Wingard standard antenna that came on my travel trailer mostly because I was able to raise it up higher attaching it to the ladder with PVC. It is directional and you have to turn it to the best position to pick up any TV stations.
5,Get a lot of channels where i used to only get 3. Most of them are infomercials and other languages but its nice to have variety!
4,After hooking up the antenna we were able to get about 60 more stations than with our previous antenna.  Very happy so far.  Time will tell how it fare in the weather on the lake.
2,You can't pick up station. That we pick up before. With a standard antenna we were getting stations over 150 miles away.
4,Could have a more stations
4,The antenna was easy to install and has a great picture. My only complaint is the range. I am not getting the range it should get. I have it mounted on my roof where the dish was mounted. There is no trees or anything around me to block the signal.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this unit brought it so many channels. After trying several other products this was heads above  the rest. even though I am surrounded by tall buildings and trees this omnidirectional antenna brought in about 68 channels clearly with no distortion. It should be noted however  that I live in a metro area about 7 miles from the transmitter. Notwithstanding no other antenna that I have tried in the same location has worked so well. Very satisfied.
4,We live in rural Nebraska many miles from the nearest TV station. It may not sound like much to metro folks but we get nine channels over the air with this Antenna. I recommend it to rural folks.
3,It’s small and compact. We liked that it did t look like an old fashioned metal antenna that as big as our roof. The picture look great as long as it isn’t storming. Channels become pixelated and will flicker off and on.
5,Easy to put up lots of channels and you don't have to keep rotating to find the best signal. Would recommend to anyone paying too much for cable.
5,I've had an attic directional antenna since 2017 when we bought this house. Always had signal trouble during storms and high winds. The sound and video would break up a lot. Finally decided to go with the 1byONE omni directional antenna. Sure glad I did. I was getting 28 channels before - but now the new antenna brings in 40 channels. Wish I had got this antenna back in 2017. Can't speak for other antennas but this one is great. Installation was very easy (even for this 75 year old). Great product and a great price.
2,Not sure why but this will not pickup ANY UHF channels no matter where I point it.  I am sure I am past my return window since it took me so long to get in put up. I am very disappointed with this product because I watch mostly the shows on UHF..
1,I purchased this in an attempt to replace the factory installed Winegard omni-directional Air360 antenna.  The Winegard would only get 1 channel at our present location a little outside of Phoenix (about 35 to 40 miles from transmitters).  At the first 2 tries the 1byone didn't get any channels.  Although I will try again in multiple positions on RV later.  My current usable antenna a King Jack at 10 feet gets 49 channels in just one direction and would get more if direction pointed could be changed.  The main TV (a TCL) doesn't have the ability to manually add channels or scan without erasing existing channels.  The LG TV has the ability to add one channel at a time manually (very time consuming).  Most TVs seem to have deleted this "feature" when having to change direction of antenna to get additional channels.  One of our main locations has channels in 3 different directions and an omni antenna won't work.  Having to re-scan a TV for each direction and lose previous channels is a real pain that the manufacturers don't seem to care about.  Also the Amazon description states 45db gain but the box received only states 36db gain.  This is misleading when deciding on what to purchase.
3,I was disappointed it the quality of this booster that connects to the tv.  Out of the box it did not have a good cord connection. The power plug had to be taped in It didn’t work without turning and tuning in.. picked up no more than old one..Then when disconnecting  the coax connection came completely away from metal inside box...
5,I live way out in the country where it’s extremely hard to get reception. This antenna fixed all of that I get all my channels.
1,Before installing this antenna I picked up 15 channels. After installation of this antenna I got ZERO channels. I double and triple checked the easy installation and still got nothing. I do not know if perhaps it was damaged in shipping but I would not buy this again.
1,First one I received was used. Every package was open or equipment was not in the plastic. Replacement unit I received didn’t pull in any channels at all. Tried it 3 different times.
2,I received an "open box" producti have not looked inside.
4,Easy to install and great picture quality
5,It wasn’t hard to install at all.  I was surprised by it’s ability to pull in signals from great distances.  When I did the channel search in my area it pulled in 172 channels.  I live right on the edge of Orange County and LA County.
3,I mounted this antana on top of my RV hopeing to get better reception than the flat antana I have in the window. Some channels pixualate that come in fine on the flat antana. Hopefully raising the antana up higher will solve this problem.
4,I liked that it’s not huge but still gets the channels I honestly didn’t think were going to get picked up. So far so good but I’m anxious to see how it will hold up with strong winds.
5,The most important thing is to try many locations to establish a signal once you have a good signal then you can find the optimum location to mount it sometimes the best location is not where you would think it should be. Mine was in my laundry room near a duct. I went from 6 stations to 26 station just by trial and error and rescanning many times
4,There is nothing wrong with it but I live in a dead zone for TV and cell service. I only get 3 stations but the picture quality is good on those.
5,Good design great reception good amplification.
1,I'm on the city of Houston TX city limits and I lost channels.  My home made antenna picks up more channels then yours does and whats funny is my home made antenna is a piece of coaxial that the end is stripped back 8 inches letting the copper wire show and get all channels available.  Sometimes I even get College Station. I hope i get my money back. This will be my first and last time i will purchase anyting from Amazon.  The antenna came in a prime box and iinside the box with the antenna was torn and had been rewraped like soneone sent it back and then sent to me box was partially open and Parks or bouncing around side Amazon box. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,I live in Venice FL and replaced my older antenna that had a remote  with this antenna. It is so much better as I get all stations from Tampa to Ft Myers without having to use the remote or get on the roof to adjust it. This antenna worked better right after I hooked it up. It's only been a week so far but good for now.
5,I love this little antenna so compact but believers a great quality picture. This is my second one to buy. The first was so good I didn’t even think about any other type when I needed number two. The first is installed outside and this one in the attic for convenience. Both work equally well. If I ever need another digital antenna you can bet it will be this one. Thanks for a great product!
5,It was very easy to install. We live pretty far out in the country so we discovered the higher you can mount it the better. The only downside to that is in strong winds or really bad weather the picture will cut in and out. But we had that same issue with all antennas we have tried. So far this one has been one of the best we have tried. Definitely the easiest to install.
1,I just got my antenna put up this evening Sunday Oct. 2. I will be sending it back by the weekend don't waste your time or money!!
5,This antenna was easy to set up. The price was great with the coupon. I like that it's omni-directional so you don't have to mess with spinning it around to pull in stations. I have one of these at my home and my rental cabin. I live about 60 miles from Columbus Ohio and get quite a few stations.
5,Easy to install. Used old satellite mount. Picked up 37 hd air channels in my area.
5,Nice product more clear picture than cable TV.
5,Es excelente no hay duda
5,Easy to install scanned the tv for channels lots of channels some from as far as 75 miles away very clear was able to get better quality pictures than the service provider on internet there shows would freeze up  over the air you have some adds but no freeze ups  where an hour show would take an hour and twenty mins or more to air
2,We live 20 miles for Chicago and this antenna has very poor reception.  After installing (by instructions) on the roof outside channels go in and out with a lot of No Signal.  Pulled in only a few channels with very very bad reception.  Would not advise to buy.  I can't send back for a refund so we are out of the money. I have a five dollar inside antenna hooked to my kitchen TV and I get 55 channels with good reception.
4,Works pretty good. The reception could be a little better but for the most part I'm 90% satisfied.
5,Easy to install
2,This antenna didn’t work as good as the plastic flat10 in square one I bought at Walmart 5 yrs ago. I mounted both of them on the same tall pole to test each one equally and the old one got a better antenna signal than yours.
1,Tried this in multiple locations pointing directly at towers with clear path should not matter as this is a 360 degree reception  no use did not enhance or increase current channels I still receive 8 of the 12 channels available
4,Easy to install. Antenna did not pick up any additional channels with the 360° pick up.
3,Has to be rotated for signal reception thought it was " 360 degree omni direction. Wind effects. Much like the 25 year channel master antenna it was replacing. The channel master picked up more channels.
1,Trying to get ahold of support is impossible. Antenna worked great for a couple of months and started to show signs of deterioration after that. Wouldn’t recommend.
3,Tried to active the lifetime warranty within the 14 days as required.  BUT the website address given is non existent.  The should say something about the 1byone company.
1,This thing doesn’t work like they say . I bought a different one and it works great the 360 is crap don’t waste your time .
4,Rv
5,I had a directional antenna that received 25 OTA channels but I was missing out on the channels from the local NBC affiliate who's transmitter tower was in the opposite direction.  After I installed the new omnidirectional antenna I can now receive all channels available for free in my area!! 29 total! Great upgrade!
2,I installed this 100+ miles antenna at the same exact location is my current antenna and ran the channel scan on my TV with both the amplifier installed and with out.  On both scans this antenna only found 31 stations where my current antenna found 54 channels. My current antenna is this model:  Antennas Direct ClearStream 2V TV Antenna 60+ Mile Range UHF/VHF Multi-directional.  This 1byone will be returned as defective or at  minimum false claims on reception capabilities.  So much for a deal of the day lightning item.
5,We live pretty far away from the local stations in our area. We get all the local stations plus some we didn't know existed. One station doesn't always connect if it's really windy but that's probably due to the number of trees around the house. Was super easy to install. Would highly recommend.
5,Very easy install. Clamps tightened with wing nuts. Unit is sleek and handsome. The channels that it picked up are crystal clear. I’m pretty much in no mans land for over the air reception but this unit got me 6 channels.
3,Very small.
4,It picks up some channels ok but still not all.
5,I bought this since our indoor antenna had off and on reception. No more we get lots more channels  the picture is much better and no fading in and out. Very happy now! We live in Windsor Park Austin Tx. For reference.
1,Worse picture than our cheaper antenna that we replaced sent it back.
5,We bought this antenna for a bunkhouse that is off the grid it picked up 31 digital stations clear. It’s easy to install light weight and worked really good
5,I had an existing coax cable run to my roof from a previous homeowner who had satellite TV. Went up and installed this antenna and hooked it up to my tuner box in my living room and it works great. Cut the cable!
1,Didn’t improve my signal at all. Had to purchase a different antenna.
1,This antenna was supposed to replace an existing working antenna. The reason I need a replacement is the HOA; they don't like the look I have now. This antenna was placed directly beside the existing antenna. The TV has a signal level on channel change. With the existing antenna I get 3 and 4 bars on all channels. This antenna showed no bars what so ever and reported NO SIGNAL on any channel. Disconnected it and connected my original antenna and voila got signal again. This appears to be a plastic box with no internal parts. Oh there is an amplifier that comes with it. That didn't help one iota.
3,Expected better reception.  This just doesn't get the job done.  We can only get 1 local station depending on the side of the house it's in.
5,Needs a short vertical board or pole for attachment especially in attic.  30 foot cable  is enough for two floors  from cellar to attic
3,Not getting all my local channel's my old antenna picked these up even being broken.
1,Update: Be very cautious about purchasing anything from the 1byone vendor. After posting this unfavorable review the vendor has sent me an email daily asking me to remove this poor review. These emails now contain offers of Amazon.com gift cards which is clearly in violation of the Amazon policies. The gift card amount does not even cover the purchase cost. This is wrong in so many ways.This antenna was very promising. Super crystal clear channels and a lot of them. So we went to all the trouble to install it on the roof. It worked great for one day. Then we stopped receiving the VHF channels the next day.  The UHF channels still work. We checked and rechecked all the connections and they are good. The little light is red. What a hassle to have to climb up on the roof and take it down to return. :(
1,We had to return this. Because we got 0 channels. It’s a cute antenna easy to install just no channels for 15miles out of town! Seller was awesome to work with!
5,WOW! Even before posting it up to 30 foot mast the picture came in super sharp.I have purchased and returned four different powered antennas prior to landing on this one. Hands-down this is the best I’ve come across in my little experiment!!
5,Received in a timely manner. Installed and connected in minutes.  Performed a scan of channels and was able to receive good signals from all stations expected.  The cable length from the TV connection to the amplifier could be about a foot longer.
3,It does everything is said.
5,Neat looking antenna that is relatively small easy to install and adjust. Now get 70+ stable channels. Only downside is that it does not cater as well for vertically and horizontally polarized signals.
3,It says 360 degree receptionBut Iam not having that
5,Love this antenna!  We tried several different ones but this gave us CBS ABC and two Fox channels along with 50 plus more channels.  No NBC though.  It was easy to install.  The picture quality is excellent!
5,Great Picture
1,Not happy with the reception.
5,Really well built and worked right out of the box. I'm able to get many local channels in High definition  by just placing it in my attic. Very happy with the product and yes will recommend.
3,Ok..... just ok. Good for maybe 40 miles that is all.
3,It didn’t do any better than my other antenna which my other antenna is a competitor.I new I shouldn’t of bought it.
5,I received 16 channels prier to purchasing1byone Outdoor TV Antenna 360° Omni-Directional Reception Long 100+ Miles Range Enhance VHF&UHF 4... I now receive 45 clear channels. My closest tower is about 60 miles away.
5,works better then my other one but it has oner range only scrambles when big trucks go by now and only a split second as the other one would scramble and loose signal. Recommend this as it also has HD for all channels.
3,Not multi directional
1,Mounted it 30 feet up got zero channels.My old antenna that a tree fell on and snapped off .. got 16.This thing is junk
5,We are very pleased with this antenna.  We purchased to pick up local channels and it does just that with a few more.  Picture is very clear.
5,Great antenna at a great price. Installation was easy and I was able to pull in 47 HD channels when installed with great picture quality.
5,long rang I live in the mountains before I could get any signals now  I can get 5 channels  about 50 miles from the stations
5,Overall very happy with this antenna.  We did have one reception problem on a day there was poor weather but no other issues.
5,A friend of mine have one I order it and I'm very happy looks great came with everything you need easy setup great picture quality. Cut the cable.
5,Super easy to install. Now getting 40 channels instead of 13! All 4 major networks clear as a bell. Perfect for our RV!!
5,Got it hooked up and found local channels on the first try! Wish both connectors on base rotating 360 but overall happy with the system.
1,The best I received was 5 channels.My previous directional antenna received 40
2,Doesn't pick up some stations as well as another similar model which has been discontinued.  If you're close to TV transmitting towers should work well
1,No better than one half it's cost.
5,Took 15 minutes to install and works great.  Tied into existing home cable wiring and got 59 channels.  Old window unit only got 23.  A+++++
5,We’ve had this antenna about a month. We love it and get forearm reception for our area. Easy to install fast delivery
5,We get around 50 channels now. Very satisfied  with this product!
1,Got 22 channels with a cheap indoor leaf antenna. Got 4 with this mounted on the roof outdoors
5,Easy to install. Once installed no movement to find a Signal. I’m now getting local tv channels I’ve never been able to get. And it’s not an eye sore.
5,Easy to install. Great picture clarity and quality. I would recommend this as an alternative to cable.
5,The installation of this antenna was fast and efficient.  The picture quality is excellent matching that of cable or dish.
1,Was easy to install
2,Read reviews prior to purchase.Reception is terrible .I get more channels from indoor antenna than this one.it is high on second story house and there are no obstructions to where towers are and it again gets very few channels
5,Pretty simple. Drill it into something high point it in the right direction hook it up.
5,Easy install. Good 360 degree coverage. Check TV Fool.com for coverage patterns near you.
1,This weekend just had time to installed antena and the  package looked like it was open before parts inside were not package properly they were all in ziploc bags cable wire was tied with a string like someone had return that product already and place were I installed it did not work for nothing .
2,Did not get all stations as expected in my area.  Missing some key stations.
5,This antenna works great.  We have been able to pick some tv no matter where we RV.
5,The 1byone Antenna worked better than I hoped.Easy to setup and worked great.
5,Very good. Take less space and very good signal.
5,easy to install
5,easy to hook up and use.
5,Seemed a little cheaply made but worked perfectly.
5,Brought all the stations in great. Easy install. Highly recommend.
5,As expected! Easy setup and worked great for my home.
5,Gained 6 more channels immediately. Great product. Would buy again!
5,Super easy to install. Works just like expected.
5,We live in Kenansville FL and it's working great. 75 channels and crystal clear.
5,Installed on casitas trailer.
5,Works great nice picture even when it’s raining
5,Simple to install in the attic replaced a directional antenna that was not performing well.
1,I count not get sinpo stanching that every one got
5,Easy to install
1,I was replacing an unpowered desktop RCA antenna with this. I was hoping to get better reception in the 20 channels the desktop antenna pulled in. Unfortunately this antenna only brings in 3 channels from a tower about 2 miles from my house and nothing else. Junk
5,It was very easy to install
2,It didn’t pick up 1/2 the channels we had before. Easy to install but not worth the money
5,Easy to install great picture
2,did not perform as advertised. got less channels.
1,It don't pick up 360 like it says I won't ever suggest it to anyone !! I'm not happy at all !!!!!
5,Love it
5,Worth buying
1,This didn't work for me at all. I live in Glendale CA. Mount Wilson is where our local television Antennas are located. Within 20 mile's. I put up in the 3rd story. No buildings that abstract the line I sight. That this according to the manufacturer shouldn't matter..I sent it back.
1,Bought two of these antennas both stoped working after 3 months
1,I was very unhappy with the range of reception.No where near what they advertised.I moved the antenna to the high point of my attic. Still only receiving stations within 20 miles !No better than the other crummy ones.
2,Did not pick up any channels
1,This is completely false advertising. This piece of junk doesn’t do any better job than a $10 on the wall antenna. This product should be Delisted for sales for such false &  deceptive advertising.
1,No picture no connection
1,Mounted antenna on a pole 30 feet in the air Doesn't work I get better reception with my old antenna that sits near TV inside DONT BUY
1,I replaced an older antenna because I got a couple stations that would freeze up. I HAD approximately 25 stations with the old directional antenna with the 360° Omni-Directional antenna I now have 3 tv stations only. It Sucks!
1,For me this antenna had very poor reception for local channels less than 10 miles away.
1,I’m 8 miles from the broadcast antenna but still couldn’t receive any channels with this in my attic.
1,Works no better at all than the indoor antenna I had been using. Would have returned it but I was one day too late to start the return
1,Arrived quickly packaged well. Took down old antenna (getting 12 channels) and put up this new antenna. Did not pick up even one channel. Returning.
1,Doesn't work well
1,The antenna did not cover the stated distance.
1,My 20-year-old antenna gets more stations than this antenna I would not buy.
1,This antenna did not work at all I was unable to get any stations with my old antenna I got some stations none with this one
1,Did not work on my TV
1,Didn’t work.
1,Only found 12 channels while the other one I bought for half the price found 38
1,Keep your $$Poor picture
1,12 chanels
1,Was not worth the money. Got more channels from a inside wall antenna. Could only get 10 channels. With inside antenna can get 21.
4,Compra y envio expedito. Fácil instalación en el tubo de baranda de ventana del piso superior. En busqueda  16 canales digitales y 5 analogos. Canales analogos y algunos digitales con mala imagen los restantes bien.
1,Pos  Doesn’t work  Bought different antenna that works excellent
1,Didn’t work
1,Had to send back
1,I bought an antenna magnavox at ollies that was half the price worked twice as good as this ufo looking piece of s#$%
4,Came with all the necessary hardware to attach to a disconnected vent pipe on the outside of my house. Sturdy unfazed by the wind and has solid reception. I don't get additonal channels compared to my inside antenna but I also don't have to adjust for any reason. I am really glad I purchased this antenna.
3,This product claimed that it able able to pickup stations well beyond the distance to our local TV station antennas. Unfortunately the $10 flat antenna that I was already using was able to pickup twice as many stations.
5,Gran alcance 58 canales gracias
1,The antenna seemed to be a good choice when made but did not last for the price paid. After 8 months of use on a mast about 20 ft. off the ground it failed and would no longer work. I took it down and when tipped on its side water ran out of it. I opened it up to find it was full of water and had shorted out the circuit board and electrical system. I have no idea how the water got inside and it appeared to be much more than could be accumulated by condensation. The unit obviously needs to be properly sealed for weatherproofing ... maybe even adding the addition of weep holes in the bottom for moisture relief.
4,I have installed outdoor TV antennas since the days of  early color TV broadcast I received the 1byone omni directional antenna from a friend who purchased it from Amazon.  There are many factors that will contribute to good quality reception the further you are from a broadcast location the more critical these factors become. I have read several reviews about this model which were not helpful because the most critical evaluation of any TV antenna is the line of sight distance from the reception antenna and the broadcast transmitters which was not mentioned in some of the reviews.  I live about 30 miles from the nearest TV broadcast and 65 miles from the furthest.  I mounted the antenna on the side of an existing TV antenna tower at a height of about 35ft.  My first scan locked in about 38 channels including the more distant channels that were 50+ from my location. But I felt that the reception could be improved by adding a better quality pre-Amplifier made by GE.  I  substituted the supplied pre-amp with the GE model add picture quality of the more distant channels was now equivalent to the closer broadcast channels. I  conclude that the supplied pre- amplifier is nominal in signal gain  Pre-amplifiers will not usually bring in additional channels but will provided a clearer solid signal especially if you have long run of coax.  In conclusion the 1byone antennas is a good option for most TV reception under 60 miles but the higher the location of the antenna the better and this antenna does  have some directional factors as do almost all omni-directional antennas so you may have to experiment with turning the antenna to get all channels in your area.
1,Mounted outside this picks up less channels than a cheap flat wall mounted antenna and the ones it does are not reliable.
1,Was able to pick up only 4 channels. Bought from a different company and now getting at least 50+ stations.
2,We've tried three antennas this year. This had the fewest channels and poorest quality picture of the 3. We wish we could find a good antenna.
1,Reception was zero in rural area
2,Bought this a couple of months ago  easy to install but that's all.  I live about 20 miles from the towers and get bad reception.
2,Not a very good antenna for where I live. My old antenna gets a better picture.
2,Mounted on roof and only got a few channels.
1,Easy to installSave your money doesn’t work well
5,I try several types of interior and exterior the interior many times doesn't work because the side of the tower is blocked by a wallbuildingtrees or any physical obstruction and sometime outside is the samebut this one in my case I installed easily and fast well I am very handy toowork in a construction companybut a person with little knowledge can do it in a couple hourswith minimal toolsbut after installed work greatgot as many channels that i never knew that existed broadcaster in my area I am really pleased with this device.by the way I didn't buy at amazonI found a better price elsewhere.
5,Better than expected antenna. I have tried the flat ones and they do not work nearly as good as this one.
5,Actually pretty surprised how many channels it pulled in. Two of the lower channels 8 10 it doesn't pick up. Unsure if distance or frequency issue. But everything else works fantastic.
5,I bought a new home and I did not want to subscribe to an expensive cable package so I installed this fabulous antenna system. NO CABLE BILLS and received 120 stations with lots of viewing pleasure. Great system glad I purchased this system. Highly recommend it!!
5,Great product excellent range and easy to install.
5,I love this antenna. Easy to install picture quality excellent with over 80 channels from transmission towers 40+ miles away.
5,We like it.  The antenna's amplifier works well. We also bought an amplifying splitter to send signal to all the rooms.
5,Buena invercion
5,Easy to install with a great picture as long as you have good reception.
5,The weatherproofing! It’s a solid setup and can lock into various angles to improve your connection. This is my 2nd order. Love that you crank up the juice of some channels are acting up!
5,This is awesome.
5,Fast shipping and this product works better then expected.
1,Stopped working actually 45 days after install. Currently no channel will tune. Worked fine until today. We are 40 miles from transmission towers and this antenna is elevated 16 feet above ground. And no there is no storms and it has not been hit by lightening
5,Good buy
4,I bought this antenna to replace an older 1byone that I had. It could have been designed a little better by make the front arm smooth in the front instead of the back and the coax connection really should have been on the side toward the back so i's behind the support arm.
5,This product was not expensive and delivered a solid picture. Easy to install and placed on fence and received channels immediately.
1,Don't waste your MoneyI purchased this to be replace my Walmart $39 antenna. The other antenna was only singular direction. I was hoping the omnidirectional would work better. It's advertised to pick up stations within 100 miles. But that really means is 50 miles on each side of the antenna. I hooked the antenna up and did a channel scan. Keep in mind the cluster of antennas are only 32 miles away from my house. I also have this elevated on a 17-ft pole with no obstructions. I actually lost 20 channels using this device. I put my Walmart antenna back on and rescanned it got all of my channels back.
5,It was easy to install and now we have cut the cord to cable providers. We get all the channels from stations up to 90 miles away clearly.
1,I like the construction of this antenna. I have a bunch of trees which could possibly make it difficult to get a signal. I didn’t pick up really any channels. This antenna wasn’t for me.
5,I live half way between Austin and San Antonio roughly 50 miles each way. I get most channels from both cities. Who needs cable.
1,Don't waste your time and money on this antenna. I leave in a valley with antenas as near as 30 miles away and was not able to get any channels. I have and older antenna and way cheaper that I bought on Amazon 3 years ago and works way better.
5,Great instructions well packaged. I returned due to weak signal no hassles. The instructions helped me determine I needed a different antenna due to the nearby mountains.
3,I am disappointed I have trouble with most of the channels even my local channels break up.  It is nice looking and was super easy to install
5,It was really easy to install. I was replacing an old fashion antenna that was weather beaten and notice this slick antenna. I installed it without the amplifier but didn't get all the channels the pervious one did although the picture quality was great. But when I installed the inline amplifier did another channel search and BOOM got all the channels that the pervious large old skool antenna did. Picture quality was great also. No pixilation and great HD quality. Very Happy!
5,Had a double bow tie with a $40 booster on it. This Omni has green signals across the board. I’m in a metro area and shouldn’t need much antenna but a recently built high rise was blocking line of sight to the towers. The booster didn’t get it done but this antenna did. Super easy is install.
5,Lots of channels on a sunny day lose about half of them when it’s cloudy.
5,El producto es excelente.
1,No creas que comprando una Antena para tv cara funciona como la descrivenespecialmente si vives en una area rural. Logre tener 5canales de tv.En mi caso una antena Sensilla de menos de 20 dolares  Funciono.
4,Bottom line: It does what it says it will do when real-world environments are taken into account. As with most of these products the performance is generally overrated and based on ideal conditions.  In the real world we have terrain distance and obstacles to deal with so performance is never going to approach the marketing claims of the manufacturer/hype-masters.I bought this to replace an older 1 by One directional antenna that seemed to need constant adjusting because here in Kansas Dorothy we have winds that can on occasion take down an antenna or as is usually the case turn it.  It had a rotor which was useless because there is no indication of what direction the antenna was pointing.  So I decided to try this "lightning deal" from Amazon knowing that the actual performance would fall short of the claims.Installation was pretty straight-forward; we have ours on a 20 ft. mast.  Once installed I fired it up and did a quick re-scan of channels and... I was actually surprised.  Remarkably  it  was able to add a few more channels to our system.  None of those are exceptionally distant and channels that were further away did not scan but there is 60 miles of trees and hills... and houses... between us and Kansas City.  Even the closer channels have to deal with those things so with 38 channels in the system I was pleased.  Signals were on par with what we had gotten with the directional antenna and I expect to have some intermittent signals from some stations due to those obstacles as well as weather time of day and interference from man-made and natural sources.If you want to go the route of the cable cutters this is one option.  Depending on where you are and what kind of obstacles you have to deal with it could be a good one or you might find another solution.  I seem to have had good luck with it so far and time will tell how well it holds up.  The antenna we were replacing had suffered from exposure it seems and the plastic had become fairly brittle as plastics will do when exposed to heat cold wind rain snow...I recommend this antenna with a few caveats. Not everyone will have the same experience.  That's life.  Or as is more popular to say "It is what it is."  Your mileage may vary.Oh and I might add; using a splitter I am running 4 tvs off of the single feed and each tv has the same levels of signal.  The manufacturer says it is only for 1 television but that appears to be geared to selling you an antenna for each tv you hook up.  Maybe it's the luck of the Irish but it seems to out-perform on this point.
5,No more wire hangers moving the antenna to a different location for each channel. No more having to sit in one spot just to get a great picture. This was easy to install and run the cable.
5,I now receive more channels than my previous indoor antenna provided. Once the antenna was installed and adjusted I haven't had to readjust. I am very pleased with this produce and the price.
5,Easy to install and the picture quality is PREFECT!
5,Just a note: i had the white power box backwards and picked up 0 channels - i was frustrated until i figured out my mistake - didnt know if anyone else did that but other wise - its light weight and picks up a lot better than my old antenna
5,I connected this to my TV before putting on my roof. Great signal even at that level.
5,Works Great
5,Antenna pulls in 57 channels in my rural area no issue to install or hook-up.  Most stations 50+ miles away and are all clear.
