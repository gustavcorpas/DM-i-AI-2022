5,If you’re like me and saw people on Twitch playing guitar hero meme charts then this is the guitar you need to get started. Paired with a USB adapter this guitar seamlessly plugs in to my PC for all of my Clone Hero fun!
4,So I seldom ever review something unless I truly feel it needs it. So when I do it's worth reading.For this guitar with past reviews people complained about how the Wii remote doesn't fit showing pictures of them trying to insert it from the top. This is the incorrect way to do it. There's actually a cover flap on the back that you can remove. That is where you put the wii remote in and connect it. Then you close the flap and the hole in the front gives you access to most of the buttons on the wii but is small enough so that the controller doesn't fall out the front of the guitar.Next this seems a bit smaller than I remember. I could just be remembering wrong but I recall the guitar for the wii being bigger. Again could just be my memory. At only 30 inches it's 2 1/2 feet and for someone like me that's kinda small. Not the seller's fault they properly described it. Just understand it's not the size of a normal adult guitar so you won't be able to hold it right. Best for kids and smaller adult folk not someone who's 6 foot like me. However if you plan to sit and jam then it's ideal because its size will fit in most seats across your lap comfortably.I don't have my wii yet so I haven't been able to test whether or not it works but I'm going to assume it will. If able I'll update my review.For now because of the size I have to give it 4 stars. Again it's nothing against the product or the seller itself just forgot how small 30 inches was.
5,Firstly the guitar works perfectly well.  I have had no problems with it.  This'll work for Clone Hero if you have some manner of Classic Controller to USB adapter (as usual the RaphNet is your best choice as most other generic adapters will not realize the whammy bar even exists).What I wanted to address was reviews saying "a Wiimote doesn't fit" so while I use this with an adapter to play Clone Hero (and thus don't actually use it this way myself) I figured that since I do own a Wii and some Wiimotes I should show that yes a Wiimote does in fact fit in this thing.  Apparently some barbarians believe they're supposed to somehow shove it in through the visible window in the front but that is not how it's supposed to get in there; the front window is deliberately a bit too small so that it can't *fall out* of the front.  There is a hatch in the *back* of the guitar that you open up to stick the Wiimote in.
5,Very responsive nice guitar cheap guitar
4,I’m pretty sure that this isn’t an exact Nintendo wii brand guitar but it still feels good. I’ve played about 5 hours on pc on clone hero and the only complaint is I can’t figure out to to set up the proper calibration on turn on hyper speed because on expert mode sometimes I feel like I miss notes I shouldn’t have. But I don’t think it’s because the guitar the buttons are good the strum bar feels a little bit too flimsy but it’s just something to get used to.
5,I will say at first the fret buttons are kind of tough to push on compared to a standard GH controller but over time they get easier to press. Usually only noticeable for fast tapping and hammer ons. The strum bar is top notch though very easy to feel yourself hitting every note
4,there is an odd squeaking sound over extended use but other than that it works like a charm!
5,The products works just like the original it does feel like it was made of cheaper material but overall works fine. Just keep in mind YOU CANT play rockband 1 with this product. For the price your getting product for you can beat it. Very happy with it.
4,I liked the quality of the item and that there was no significant physical damage. I wish the seller would have cleaned it before shipping to me though it was dirty.
4,I absolutely love this product I’ve been using it for about 6 months now and my only complaint is the whammy bar dose not work but other than that I love it
4,Everything worked great besides the whammy bar. That might have been from user error though.
4,once i got my keys bound it works pretty decent.although i couldn't get the wammy bar to work but i didnt really spend that much time trying.just bound the whammy to the joystick and star power to the select button.i do find the color buttons a little stiff but im sure theyll get better with use or ill just mod it
4,For anybody looking to play Guitar/Clone Hero this controller works very well as long as you get an adapter with it. The only issue I found was the wammy bar not working but that isn't a large necessity for most. Overall not bad.
4,Was a gamble but it paid off. it works great. I've had no issues so far. My only issue is the strum bar. It's very loud and springy sounding. I believe you can purchase a 3d printed strum bar off Etsy for $4 that will fix this issue.Works with Clone Hero. I don't have a Wii to test it out that way but it works well with the adapter so it should work well for a Wii-mote.
5,Couple of things to add:1) This guitar works with Clone Hero just get either a Raphnet Adapter or Emio Adapter so far those are the only 2 that are KNOWN to work.2) For everyone posting pictures saying a Wii remote doesn't fit and showing the remote sitting on top of the guitar I don't know if you're ignorant or what but the controller is inserted through the BIG door on the back. Maybe try RTFM.
5,Need to do some button mapping but works with clone hero seamlessly when paired with the cheap wired elecom wii usb adapter.  Also recommend buying a usb female to male extender if you don't have one.  No need for a wii mote if you go this route.I've read the raphnet adapter may be better but this setup seems as good as an xplorer / les paul
3,Blue button stopped working after a month of every day use. Made with cheap plastic that jitters and clanks when shaken. Sometimes strumming didn't register and the whammy bar didn't register either.
3,Kind of terrible button quality if I am being honest but sadly the only better one is so much harder to get ahold of so this is probably your better option.
5,This is really good and well made . It also works with dolphin ;)
4,I ordered this guitar to play Rockband 2 on my Wii and it showed up fairly quickly. It works for RB2 by the way. Some people are falsely answering questions on here claiming that it doesn't work without even trying it; just doesn't work for Rockband 1. Anyway everything is shiny and new and no technical issues so far. For everyone saying that the controller doesn't fit in the hole have you tried turning the guitar over and opening the back panel? That's where the controller goes lol. The front is the window for the remote; it allows you to press the needed buttons to play. So overall no complaints so far other than there not being enough room for the Wii remote to fit without bending the wire connector that plugs into the remote. Seems like that will break the guitar by speeding up the wear-and-tear process. Also it scuffed up my remote a bit as well.
5,When paired with the Raphnet adapter (look on ebay for that) this is the best guitar for Clone Hero.  It is what Acai uses check him youtube to see what is possible.
5,After having this for a month I can safely say this is perfect for clone hero. However you NEED the raphnet adapter in order for it to work.Straight out of the box its just fine if ur playing casually. the frets are a little stiff to my liking so I modded it (there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube).I dont know if it's the case for all of them but my guitar wasn't blessed with the 1-finger rake sensitivity.  It only overstrums on an upstrum. There is a stupid easy fix for it tho and you dont even need to take it apart. all u need to do is slide a piece of paper into the body down the strumbar hole. tape it down to the faceplate. that's it. I've attached an image of it.Tl;dr great for clone hero. needs raphnet. stiff frets (can be fixed). overstrums on upstrum (yours might vary; can be fixed easily)
4,Item exactly as described.  Brand new in package fully functional clean free of damage and with all components.  Low latency and smooth performance.  The buttons and strum bar are crisp fresh parts and are responsive and steady with a tight actuation.  Sliding on the buttons is tougher than for example an Xplorer as the buttons are slightly less rounded on the edges and feel a tad more raised from the neck (this could just be a result of wear on my Xplorer and this guitar being brand new).  The neck locks into the body fine but there is a little play and it can move back and forth a little bit.  Personally this hasn't affected my gameplay yet as the way I hold/use the controller does not cause the neck to move at all (it shouldn't be a problem).  If you are planning to use this through the Raphnet adapter be warned that MOST third-party wii guitar controllers DO NOT natively work with Clone Hero through this adapter (as the branded ones should).  You will need to use something like JoyToKey (this is free it's what I use for it and it works perfectly) to map the controls for Clone Hero.All-in-all for the price this is quite a solid choice.  Hopefully it lasts a while!
2,I'm not sure if this is a design flaw of all Wii guitars or just this version specially. But the cable that connects the remote is already fatigued and it's not staying connected. It's broken somewhere in the cable I have to kink the cord to get it to work. Kind of disappointed it worked really well for a few days.
4,Guitar works buttons press fine and on time. Only thing is the whammy bar doesn’t work but not the end of the world until the battles lol.. I just switched guitars for that as I bought this one as a second player guitar.
5,If you’re looking for a good guitar and don’t want to spend 80+ dollars on eBay make sure to buy these! Get them new instead of used. Buttons are very responsive and the strum bar is great. Very quality guitar considering it isn’t official. If you’re looking to get into clone hero or just want some old nostalgia gaming on Wii this is your best choice.
4,Functions just as the original. They include a card explaining the whammy bar won't work if it's depressed when you plug in the wiiMote and I had that happen to me but re-plugging it fixed things as described.Docked one star because the neck strap doesn't have the soft leather pad section that the original did and thus is incredibly scratchy/irritating on the back of your neck.
4,I don't have an official Les Paul controller to compare to so I can't speak as to whether or not it's a perfect emulation of one but it's pretty great as is. Definitely get the raphnet adapter with it if you wanna use it for Clone Hero. There's also some fairly easy mods you can do on the buttons to make them click a little better so if you think they're too stiff then look for that. Only downside so far is some overstumming happening when I go to use the whammy but I've experienced that on like 90% of the controllers I've ever used. gud purchase
5,We used it with our Wii remote to play games on our computer and it was just like old times.  Took some figuring out how to get the Wii remote to connect to the computer correctly but the guitar works exactly like it should.
1,PROS:-The guitar worked well for the time that it was working.CONS:-There is a loud audible sound when the strum bar is used but that can be overlooked pretty easily-It completely stopped working with no indicator of why only a couple months after purchaseI bought the same guitar in black in March of 2022 and it lasted until May when it would not take any response from any button on the guitar. I bought a new one in white thinking it was something that I did or a defect. But this guitar also just went bad randomly as well. I did nothing to break it and I did take it apart to see if something snapped but all looked fine. I am no expert but if you spend $60 on a guitar you would hope it would last longer than a couple months.Side note: I'm not good at guitar hero so it definitely was not me pressing the buttons that broke it. I probably will buy a different brand to see if that does the same and if it does I'll edit this review.
5,Honestly the best Guitar Hero controller I’ve ever owned.The frets have such a short travel distance and are perfectly responsive.The strum bar is like butter. Smooth and no overstruming. Feels sturdy and tight unlike the ones from back in the day that always had a “loose” feel to them.I was hesitant to buy because I’ve seen some reviews of people getting broken or used models with sticky keys missing faceplates etc. Mine was pristine and brand spanking new. It’s such a good feeling to open a brand new guitar in 2021 I would recommend picking this up 100%. This is THE best experience you can get with a guitar hero controller.
2,Although the product seems like it might be worthwhile it is absolute garbage. It does not work with Guitar Hero 87% of the time. You’re lucky to hit one out of every 14 notes. We tried calibrating the system - nothing. Even on EASY the notes don’t register. Would request a refund if I was eligible. Will NEVER recommend this.
3,Definitely a perfectly okay beginner guitar for anyone coming back to Guitar Hero on Wii or Clone Hero but the frets and especially the strum bar are miles harder to press down than the official controllers. However it is definitely an okay buy if you need or want a new Wii guitar. Would still recommend finding one of the official ones second-hand but if you aren't willing to this is serviceable.NOTE: The guitar DOES work with the ELECOM Classic Controller Adapter but the whammy bar DOES NOT work. When used with a Raphnet adapter everything worked perfectly (including whammy!)
4,It was a gamble ordering this product because of all the mixed reviews but I'm glad I did. I ordered 2 of these guitars for the Wii and wasn't disappointed. My guitars were brand spanking new with dongles and everything. My only problem was that one of the guitar's yellow buttons was not working but I opened it up and fixed it myself; a quick fix. Overall the guitars work very good and I'm happy with the product. I didn't give 5 stars because the button wasn't working and I had to fix it myself.On another note many reviewers said that they had ordered the guitars new but instead received used guitars with the dongles missing. This might be a longshot.. but when I ordered I clicked on the "new and used" option and clicked on new; so that might be why I got 2 brand new guitars. I hope this helps somebody.
5,Came in nice packaging was not damaged cable was intact I have to say I got lucky that it arrived in perfect condition and I’ve been using for a while and haven’t had any issues
5,El producto está en perfectas condiciones. Para ingresar el control del Wii es necesario retirar una pequeña tapa en la parte de atrás de la guitarra.
2,The strum bar squeaks when I strum which annoys me so now I play with headphones to avoid that. Blue and Orange are a little stickier than Green Red and Yellow and overall the frets have an odd travel time. I have to tap a little hard on the frets to get them to register and holding notes will sometimes drop because I have to hold the fret so hard. But hey it works on Clone Hero so I guess that's a plus. I like that it's smaller than your average Guitar Hero guitar which makes it more comfortable to play casually I guess but overall feel it's a little overpriced for the downsides I mentioned.
4,So i wanna mention this: if you don’t mind a guitar controller where the frets are a bit tough to push in a little bit and are close together a bit more along with a smaller strum bar this is a fantastic guitar. No major issues yet for the first 12 hours but id say it’s holding up good so far
1,When I first got this guitar I was excited to play clone hero but I thought it was weird the whammy bar wasn't working but I ignored it; then after like 27 days in the guitar stopped working. I thought it was the cable or the adapter but everything worked. But the guitar just straight up stopped working without any warning.BEWARE: I don't know if it was intentionally made to die after 30 days but I was despondent to see this guitar stop working just because.SIDE NOTE:Got a replacement to see if the one I got is defective and surprised to find out it had the same problem as the other one. So yeah it's basically a scam DO NOT buy this.
5,Wiimote fits in nice and snug doesn't disconnect during gameplay and none of the buttons stick. That's all I asked for so 5 stars from me.
2,Whammy bar doesn't work right and buttons feel way too stiff w/o modding. Other than that it works. The whammy bar not working for clone hero on a brand new guitar sucks though.
5,Hooked these up to my PC running clone hero and was playing in no time.
4,the whammy bar does not work well besides that the product works really nice.
1,Do NOT trust the high rating for this guitar. I received the guitar today for my Wii and both the packaging and the guitar itself looked perfectly fine! I was careful to insert the Wii remote without touching the whammy bar. Then I attempted to play Wii RB 3. The green & red keys worked but nothing else did. The strummer only kind of worked when I was holding up the joy stick button for some reason but even then the strummer would only sometimes work when I strummed down. If I was not holding the joy stick button the strummer automatically acted as though I was strumming up. When it came to playing an actual song the yellow + blue + orange keys were registered as being pressed down. Whenever I hit any key RB showed I was hitting completely different keys on the game. For instance when playing '25 or 6 to 4' on Hard I was strumming the red and orange keys simultaneously. However the game showed I was pressing the green + yellow + blue keys. The strums were also significantly delayed. I took the guitar apart cleaned the connection points between the body and neck and tried again. Nothing changed. I worked through every trouble-shooting option and still nothing changed. The same problems occurred with all the Wii GH games as well. Not worth your money. I have returned the guitar the same day I received it. This guitar is a rip-off of the official Wii Rockband and official Wii GH guitars. This rip-off comes from China and is not compatible with any Wii RB or GH games. Absolutely not worth your money. You are better off spending this money on an official Nintendo Wii guitar.
4,If using with an adapter for PC the whammy bar and tilt will not work. If it wasn't for that it'd be a full five stars
5,I bought this with a raphnet adapter over a year ago for Clone Hero and it's still going strong. I played it for multiple hours a day for several months and it's seen much lighter use since then but it has never dropped a note as far as I can tell and the buttons and strum bar still feel good. For me this was better than looking in the second hand market: you're getting a brand new product and it's convenient to purchase.
5,I was worried about the button quality and strum bar the most but they work really well. The buttons are light and the overall build quality is great. I would buy again for a friend to use
5,Buy this don’t bother buyin real retro
2,I returned the item today.  Had it for a week then it stopped working randomly.  Thought it was the cable had it replaced to find out it was the guitar not working.
2,I was shipped what was clearly a very used guitar controller although the description does not specify anywhere that it would be used. It seems to work but I was disappointed that it wasn't a brand new product.
4,Day one... so far so good. Played Rock Band Beatles and Guitar Hero Metallica games and all is working perfectly... Will try to update more as I play with the guitar. But if it keeps like this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...UPDATE:Some time has past this guitar still is great. I have played many Guitar and Rock Band games. Completely compatibale with both games. Get one!
4,I purchased two of these as a gift for my significant other's birthday. I would probably purchase them again given the price. At first we thought one was broken. Eventually we figured out that when you plug in the wii remote that all the buttons and the cursor and such must all be in a neutral position. If you say have the cursor up when the remote gets plugged in the system thinks up is the neutral position and constantly acts as if you're trying to scroll down.Of the two I purchased we can tell the difference between the two because the strum bar seems looser on the one I play only after about a week of use. Apparently I strum much harder. Not sure how the strum bar is going to hold up over continued use.
5,This guitar works great on Wii and on PC. If you have a WiiRemote you can connect this wirelessly to PC using Wiitar Thing. It works flawlessly. You can also use this with the Raphnet adapter for a wired connection to PC. I have been using this with Clone Hero and wow what a great time.
1,When I got it I tried it out immediately and it didn’t work for me (using Wiimote). I had ordered something else with it that I had returned so Amazon wouldn’t let me process a return for this as well.
5,It works perfect with clone hero. Best guitar hero controller u can buy. way better then spending heaps on a used one.
5,This Wii Guitar Hero Guitar controller worked great the the adapter for my PC. No problems at all.
1,I bought this guitar and shortly after plugging it in I realized there was an issue. After some tests it appears there was a short in the wire that connects to the controller. I did a replacement through Amazon and not even a month later the new one started shorting out as well. Beware of these faulty guitars.
2,It seem to work fine in the beginning. But then it started giving issues with the strumming bar. It works sometimes it doesn’t work sometimes. You have to unplug it and plug it back in. It seems to fit fine in the back of it but it does pinch the cord a little bit. When it works it works great. But when it doesn’t very frustrating!
4,For the cost this is an excellent buy however it has the same defective design that the official Les Paul styled GH guitar controllers did with the neck not seating fully thereby sometimes dropping notes.I was not able to remove the face plate sections of it would start to come up then then bend at the center so I think it may be glued on or something.  Everything else works just fine.  I use it in Clone Hero.
4,I ordered the ELECOM adapter too so I could play clone hero with the guitar. It does work the only problem was that the yellow fret wasn’t working so I had to take it apart and clean it. When I hook it up to the wii everything works but when I play on the computer the whammy and star power don’t work.
4,Glad to see this actually worked as a replacement for the Wii Guitar Hero original guitars.4/5 stars because out of the 1st 2 guitars we purchased only 1 would make a connection but we reported the issue and the company sent a replacement and it works well so far. Thanks!MikeThatHelpfulDad-dot-com
5,Broke after a month but they refunded me fully after contacting them.
4,I bought this after mine had been stolen in a home robbery. Bought used and it has some flaws when you are strumming where it doesnt register the strum but i never had a problem like this with my previous ones. Bought for my son he is 6 so he is able to do beginner modes and just strum but is not big enough to coordinate the buttons and strumming. Even if he were able to coordinate those this doesnt have the buttons further down the neck for smaller arm spans so he would still have trouble reaching. Great for an adult/teen little hard for kids but overall its a great product. i would consider buying another.
5,I’m not sure why people are saying the Wii remote doesn’t fit. The opening is on the back of the guitar to connect the remote to the guitar. This guitar is so great and works very well with my game. I’m definitely ordering another one.
4,So my issue was that every time i down strummed it kept over strumming basically inputing 2 strums even tho i only strummed once. The fix is to hold the whammy bar down while you're connecting the wii remote or the raphnet classic controller to usb like im using. It should work for almost all strum bar issues unless your strum bar is just broken. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because while it is cheap and a good deal it really shouldnt have dumb issues like this. Easy fix tho.
4,I got this for Clone Hero (like everyone) and tried using a script in glovePIE to run it. I would assume the coding for the frets is based on some different standard because nothing I tried worked. Eventually I had to get a Wii to USB adapter but it works fantastically now
4,I use this for clone hero and it works *well* however the strum bar is LOUD and when I say loud I don’t mean like a nice click... it’s a squeak that can be heard downstairs in my home. Other than that it works perfectly!
5,I got this guitar after many days of indecision a while ago and I've been playing clone hero ever since! It's been a really long time since I've handled a legit Les Paul GH3 guitar but I would say they're pretty similar. At the very least I haven't been dissatisfied with this guitar. Buttons feel fine and so does the strum bar and every other button/toggle on it. If I didn't know this wasn't the official guitar I wouldn't have even thought twice! Really love this guitar it works perfectly with the Raphnet adapter I bought for my laptop.
2,The quality control clearly isn't the best. The fret buttons feel gummy and weird and the upstrum and downstrum feel different when they should be the same. It also has a chance of causing your Wii to freeze before launching the game while plugged in.The fact that this thing is brand new doesn't save it. You will almost certainly get a better experience buying a used Official Wii Les Paul for less and trust me it's a night and day difference. Frets feel snappy strumbar smooth as silk. The fact that it's "new" doesn't make up for the fact that it's worse in every way. Sure you could mod it to make it better but it would take less effort to clean and polish up a used Official Les Paul assuming you'd need to do that at all.This product is simply pointless unless it comes way down in price. Only at $20 or less would I consider this thing worth a look and even then that's pushing it.
5,I've waited so long to be able to play guitar hero again! I am so happy I've been able to find a new guitar we've worn out 2 others. Just make sure you calibrate the lag! Have fun!
2,These guitars were great for about 2 months of infrequent play. Decided to play with a few friends and suddenly everyone on the 2nd guitar was failing. Realized it's due to the red button not working. Tried again twice since the incident and it is definitely not recognizing anything at all when red is pushed anymore. Extremely disappointed that we can only have 1 player at a time now after looking for controllers for months.
5,Got this bad boy so I could relive my youth with clone hero of course you need the adapter everyone gets.  I’ve been playing expert dragon force and it’s still holding up after 2-3 months its pretty close to an old PlayStation 2 guitar feel wise obviously it’s not official but still feels pretty good. For the price though I haven’t been disappointed I make sure to put as little stress on the neck so the connection doesn’t get loose and stuff.
5,Bought this after i tried going through used dealers and ebay etc. and consistently was disappointed. Tried this since it was a solid price. IT WORKED! Clone hero recognized it immediately and i've been jamming ever since! Bought this guitar even before Acai and UKOG mentioned them/made videos on them. Strum Bar is consistent frets are tough (but you can mod them if you really want to) but i've been playing for a few months and they have eased up.
1,Bought this for my sons birthday as soon as it arrived we hooked it up whammy bar doesn't work at all. Tried calibrating it in the game and it doesn't even register. Buttons work like they should buy kinda pointless without the whammy bar.
3,Overall solid but very weak the cable that is implemented in the guitar to connect to the Wii remote broke already in less than 2 weeks of use. Unfortunately I gotta buy another guitar but not this one again… Very unfortunate.
2,I got this guitar today and i've been playing clone hero with it. All of the button work exept the wammy bar. I took it apart and the issue seemed to be a failed electrical part. I could prob replace it but I paid 55 bucks for it so I would expect all the buttons to work. Kinda bummed.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I was excited to be able to play all my old games again but this just ruined it. One guitar has buttons stuck and the strum doesn't work and the other guitar has a drift at the analog.UPDATE: I later found out you have to connect and turn the Wii mote while the guitar is facing the air. If a button or analog is activated during connection it will stay activated. Still ridiculous but they do work.
5,Guitar works great on my Wii U. Played it with guitar hero world tour and rock band 2.
5,Dope guitar!!  The remote fits there is an opening in the box. Came pretty much brand new. In the box and wrapped up. Love it. Had it for a few days and I’m loving it is. If anything changes I’ll definitely update you guys. Follow me on IG @tahjaserene
4,Would give it a 5 if it didnt have a messed up whammy bar. But idc about that overall the guitar is amazing.
4,This is a wonderful product because it performs as it should. The only problem with this is the wire in which you connect the Wii remote to the guitar. I am afraid it will wear down quickly because it must be jammed together when putting a Wii remote on it. Otherwise this product is perfect.
1,The wire connection to the controller is faulty and the 5 keys don't all work either. I know it's not an issue with my controller because I have another guitar that works just fine with each of my controllers. 100% not worth it.
5,A much better guitar than the PS3 les paul! Responsive and easy to use with a wiimote. Review readers please realize this is the wii guitar ONLY. You will need the extras such as a wiimote or usb converter to connect to a PC.
5,This worked perfectly no issues. Very satisfied with my purchase and debating buying one or two more for some friends!
5,Had two of these for a while and one of them stopped working. This one works just fine and my grandson and I are enjoying the competition again!
4,Keys are a little stiff. Hopefully they will loosen up as I play.
3,I'm not just talking about this version of Guitar Hero or Rockband instruments. They are prone to being broken out of the box. I recently purchased this Les Paul wireless guitar for my mom when I bought her Guitar Hero 5 for her Wii. As it was with different Rockband and Guitar Hero instruments I have bought over the years since the franchises have started it had a problem. The whammy bar on the guitar showed up broken still usable but broken. So you have to turn it backwards or else it will do the whammy bar on any long note and you can hear the broken piece rattling around inside. Other than that the guitar is pretty good it honestly just comes down to if you get a defected one or not really. A good buy but be careful
5,Excellent customer service! I ordered two guitars and one didn’t read the strokes well and stopped working a couple weeks after the return window. I emailed the seller and had a new guitar in less than a week! They both work great now!
4,Great replacement! Doesn't have a true feeling as a real guitar hero controller but it gets the job done.
5,I ordered this along with the ELECOM Game pad converter for Wii Classic controller and it worked flawlessly out of the box. If your controller isnt responding make sure you have mapped the controls for you guitar first (Open the game and hit the space bar)
5,Haven't had any issues yet!  Works just as promised and with the games as stated!* REMOTE- the remote DOES fit.  Some of the reviewers were trying to put in through the front opening which is just supposed to display the remote.  There is a back opening that easily fits the remote in there...
4,I got this guitar for Clone Hero and so far I’ve had no issues other than I can’t get my whammy bar to work...I would recommend this to anyone who’s getting into Guitar Hero/Clone Hero
5,I love guitar hero I did get one and the yellow button wasn’t working it was so easy to send it back and get a new one quick.
1,Bought it for a Christmas present and it’s not working.  Not even a year and its broken!
5,works with clone hero minus wammy dont know if it was the adapter or guitar but I can live without a wammy bar.
5,I bought this for use with Clone Hero! I use a raphnet adapter and it works perfectly. No issues at all. I will probably buy another just to have a back up. Used it for about 2 months so far.
5,Excelente producto no tengo quejas
5,I bought it for my son for Christmas and it was exactly what he wanted.
3,So I got this just to see how it was over all it’s good for any casual guitar hero players out there once I started practicing the rake method the strumm bar felt a bit worn out after a week but still worked well an the buttons are overall good except the blue button which doesn’t work too well with fast trill notes so for advanced players you might wanna just keep searching for the activision wii tar but this is a great for now guitar as well though.
5,Really good guitar for the price! Works like a charm.
5,Bought specifically for CloneHero. Wiitaur arrived and everything works buttons are a bit stiff but once broken in it plays well. Mainly use on PC with a dolphin wii motion bar with zero problems. Just needs some extra programs to get it all connected
2,i didn’t expect it to work flawlessly but it only works half the time. i have to keep unplugging and plugging in the remote to the guitar i have to keep the wii remote halfway out in order for it to actually work and even then it only works sometimes sometimes it doesn’t correctly register which buttons i’m pressing and when i’m strumming. however when it DOES work it works perfectly fine.
5,Product as described and fast shipper!
4,I gave this product 4-stars since my wiimotes have not yet arrived so i can't test the guitars yet. As far as what some other reviewers said about the guitars being used the ones i received were definitely NOT. They were well packaged and smelled very strongly of new plastic. I like how easily the necks attach to the bodies and they seem sturdy enough. I will update this review once i can actually try them out.
5,Works perfect !!
4,Product arrived in specified condition and works perfectly. However the neck is kind of lose (unnoticeable when playing normally) when inserted into the body of the guitar which makes me suspect that it won’t last as long as it should.
4,It took a little work to get the green button to work but think I got it fixed now for 3 bucks I'm not complaining. Guitar is clean has normal use marks nothing crazy or deal breaking ... as long as that green button keeps working I'm good. :)
5,I've been missing Guitar Hero since I moved out of my mom's LOL I finally have my own set up and can shred whenever I want! Super easy to use even if you've never set one up before cuz really it's just 2 pieces snapping together and plugging in your WiiMote and bam done.
5,No issues we love playing the WII again.I think the people having problems constantly are putting in and taking out the controller We are playing the rock band games alot so we haven't taken the controller out but a few times no signs of wear or damage just be careful when putting in the controller and don't chaff the wires.L. Hall
5,Purchased this brand new and it works great.  Highly recommend.
3,Yellow button sticks always has
5,I ordered 2 of them for both me and my friend to play and its super nostalgic both of them worked great!
5,Just received this and set it up. This guitar works with Wii U and Rick Band 2. Great replacement guitar when the original finally gave out.  Very happy with this new guitar!
5,My grandkids have so enjoyed this product
5,I like that the product was delivered much earlier than expected and it was easy to assemble and start using right away
3,Everything works fine and works for Clone Hero. Except the whammy bar didnt function.
3,Arrived in nice packaging looks brand new. But the yellow button does not work at all. Sending it back for a replacement hopefully the replacement works better.
5,Bought specifically for clone hero on PC. After programming all the buttons it worked first try.
5,I love it I bought an adapter to plug it into my pc for clone hero and it worked right away.
4,There could be a bit more room for the cord to breathe but I suppose its designed like that so the cord will wear out and you will have to but another one. It works fine though all no delay or anything I will probably but this again.
5,Can't tell this is a third party.  The buttons and strum bar are very responsive.
2,Product works alright. The wammy bar doesn't work and not I'm not sure if the wii remote or the guitar is the issue for using star mode.  It cannot sense when the guitar moves to activate "star mode". For the price I'm not satisified.
5,Sometimes doesn't hit buttons not sure if that's me or the guitar.
3,*Update* *Amazon replaced for free*  Shoulder strap popped off and the guitar neck broke when it hit the floor...  Buying another only because there is no other place to get a new one...
2,I would give a 5 star review if this thing had the ethernet port that comes with any of the original ones you can see they took it out probably to cut costs for an ethernet port and wiring to the board.
1,Stopped working a week after the eligibility return date ended.  Now my daughter is stuck with a piece of crap. Doesn't even deserve a star.
3,Came as described. Nice box. No defects. Works as expected. Quality is a little cheap IMO for the amount.
4,Pretty gnarly little guitar
4,It worked perfectly for maybe a week. But I guess I was a little too rough with it because after about a week it stopped strumming down.
5,Was a little nervous about ordering these after reading some of the other reviews but the items arrived promptly.  Sure these guitars aren't made of the highest quality of material but for the price...it was a good value.  So far my son and friends have played for hours and hours with not one glitch.
5,bought this for a boy i liked but he ended up being a huge butt to me. dylan sucks. buy an adapter if you buy this for clone hero
5,Looks great works great now I just gotta get the guitar hero games I want then I'll be good. All buttons work right. Packaged well.  Brand new condition with nothing out of place.
5,This is a good product and fun to play with.
3,The buttons are broken on it if you have a spare one chance the buttons and you will be good to go
5,Works great. Came in a good box with strap and all.
5,Great product and fast shipping!
5,Wish they were more clear that you’d have to buy different guitars for different games. Ended up with a bunch of stuff I couldn’t use
3,I was so excited to get this game again. I bought the guitar on prime same day and got it that night. Everything seemed awesome until I tried to use the whammy bar...it doesn't work and is necessary in parts of the game...gonna have to buy a different guitar and hope it works.
1,I got the guitar out and set up the game excited to play it again and come to find out the strum bar only works when you hold up on it. The blue and orange are going on the screen even though I wasn't touching the buttons and the yellow you go on the screen every time I hit the green. I don't know if I got a bad guitar or if these other reviews are fake but this thing is complete garbage. Save yourself the time and the money.
4,Pretty Good guitar
1,After a couple months of owning it the wire seemed to be wearing out just from plugging it in and out. Sometimes it would connect sometimes it wouldn't. The crappy wiring job probably had to do with that when i unscrewed the mounting for the Wii port thingy the supposedly neutral wire wasn't even on anymore when i stopped receiving  signals onto my pc. Oh yeah the buttons were really stiff and just to get them to be even good i had to cut the silicon. My PS2 guitar does better than this. However one good thing was the strumbar and actually seemed better than other actually brand guitars but i found out it is a 1/1 guitar which is sad because it cant compete with a 2/2.
5,We have been playing too much guitar hero since we got this
5,Great Guitar delivered very fast Love it thanks !!!
5,Quicker shipping than expected. Thank you ! Works perfectly
5,Daughter had it before on Playstation II but now has Wii and wanted it for that  so didn't want to spend a lot so went for this Guitar instead of game version. Works fine and she is happy as she missed this a lot from her older system.In fact it looks better and she thinks it works better then the guitars that come with the actual game.
3,It worked great at first and after being used 10 times it stopped working.
5,Bought this for my kids and it works perfect and seems to be durable
5,My kids love Guitar Hero so being able to find everything we needed here on Amazon was perfect. They have been playing non stop and knowing it was all brand new still in packaging was great.
4,Exactly as promised.  Not as good or easy to use as the original world tour guitars.
3,Good amateur guitar but not for serious guitar hero players. Buttons are a little to hard and plastic material seems fragile. Good t have as extra for when a friend comes over and wants to try the game out.
2,We received the package today in good condition. However that was the best part of it. When my husband opened it he said the guitar looked like something that came from a teenage boy's room. He did have to clean it because it was dirty. The piece that holds the Wii remote in the back is missing. Also all of the buttons especially the blue and yellow buttons are sticking. The blue and yellow buttons are working maybe 30% of the time. We are very disappointed in this product. Had we had known the condition of the guitar we would've bought from someone else.
5,Also have the drums. Great fun.
4,It works.  I misread the page and thought a game came with it. But it was easy to set up and easy and it works without fail so far...
3,The guitar works but there were stickers all over it and some of the stickers were worn off.  When I ordered the guitar I read the description and saw that it was used but in good condition with "no stickers" on it.  I was a bit disappointed when I got it and saw there were stickers all over it.  Some of the stickers weren't even "guitar hero" stickers.  :(
2,The whammy bar is stuck on and it’s sucks don’t buy this cheap thing could get better luck at a good will
5,My daughter really enjoys the guitar! She uses it everyday
4,if you were to look out for the buttons design and emblem you will know this is not the original guitar hero 3 guitar but it works as described...
1,Don’t recommend!! We don’t use it.  If we did the remote would get broke since there isn’t enough space in the guitar for it.  It can be jammed in which will only break the wires and connections.
5,When I recieved the package it was ripped on the side and the neck of the guitar was missing. (The guitar comes in two pieces).  Once I contacted the seller they immediately sent another neck.  Hassle free transaction.My son is very happy with the product and the rock band game.I most definately would do business with them again.
1,The item did not work got a second one to see if it was just the one but both didn’t work still haven’t got my money back from it
5,Came new in box everything works as it should.
3,The guitar came in working fine but the packaging left tape residue all over the face and the buttons for the guitar began to get stuck only two months later.
5,Good quality
5,Good working condition sticky keys and buttons. However alcohol dubbed it right off and practically brand new.
5,Now i can finally rock out again on guitar hero for the Wii Thank you!!!
1,Those who say the wii-mote doesn't fit are not  putting it in correctly. Connect the plug and insert the bottom first. It fits. However I believe this crap design causes the plug to come loose. Ours was used a few times and no longer works at all. Junk.
5,Is compatible for Wii. brand new  no malfunctions connected to wii/ remote fine no issues. use often
5,It doesn't come with stickers just an fyi... just the guitar... and the strap.... you have to buy you're own skins...
5,This guitar controller looks just like any of the expensive 1st party controllers and plays just the same.Strum bar feels sturdy and has a distinct click and the buttons are responsive.Works in Rock Band 2 & 3 as well as all of the Guitar Hero games I have tried on the Wii.
3,It's a little bit smaller than I expected but works as intended. Overall decent and better if you have smaller arms and/or hands.
4,Product works well but I was disappointed the guitar was missing the back piece to close in the wii remote. Product arrived very dirty but at least it was easy to clean off.
5,Last year my kids poured soda on my hubby's guitar. He is not a big gamer but he loves Guitar Hero. For Christmas I bought him this as a replacement. He loved it and hasn't stopped playing it! Looks And works just like the original one he had minus the rock stickers.
5,Came with everything it said and came in a nice new box! Guitar was in great condition !!
1,Controller was missing screws.. obviously was tampered with.. didnt work at all
4,Initially wasn't working at all but after a few minutes it was functioning fine!
3,Product was delivered in worse condition than anticipated. There was no back for the Wii remote and there are scratches rough patches and broken parts on the face plate/neck. there is also no guitar strap.
5,Works great owned it for almost a year and hasn’t broken.
5,works with clone hero but needs the raphnet adapter
1,I mean as someone who wanted an official GH3 guitar this is not what I was expecting. This isn't even close. Very poor quality and the frets and not loose almost a little sticky. I was hoping that this would be a good alternative since I just bought a Raphnet but this is not the case. I should have just bought an official one from the get go.Something positive: if you are wanting to get learn guitar hero or are not very good yet this is a pretty good alternative. If you are an advanced player then don't go cheap get an official Les Paul.
4,It worked but the wammy bar was lose. But they did tell me it had minor wear so guess I should have seen it coming.
5,It worked just fine for me. The previous one I had broke so I got this one. It arrived on time and It was in great condition. I recommend this product!
3,Very cheaply made.  Yes it works with GH and RB2+ but it is very poorly made.  The plastic does not line up correctly at the seams and is a little warped.  I would not buy this item again.
5,Works perfectly one of the best guitars I have.
5,works great. had it for about a month and it still works
2,The guitar isnt that great. It's useable however when connecting the wii remote it doesn't allow me to put the controller into the spot it's supposed to sit in. The wire connecting to the guitar gets bent and the guitar doesn't work. Instead I keep the remote outside of the guitar and just let it hang from the guitar. This really isnt the easiest way to play guitar hero and it still gets bent sometimes.
5,Works
2,It would have been nice to know it needs a dongle to attach to the wii in order to use it. We have no clue if it even works
5,Gr8
5,Looked brand new! Came in original box with manual.
4,Works great.  Tight fit on controller but fine when you figure it out.My daughter loves it.  I still have no rhythm...
5,Good
5,xmas gift
5,Works great
5,Works perfectly with my Wii but the design is frustrating if you  mostly play Guitar Hero because you need to remove the WiiMote to start the game properly.Otherwise great.
5,Works perfect!!!
4,Easy install and worked as advertised.
3,The guitar itself worked for the most part.  It worked until you had to hold out some of the notes. It would mark notes wrong even if you know you got them right. I immediately returned it. Not impressed.
5,Works great and gets a lot of use..
5,Feels and looks just like the original Guitar Hero guitars! Very happy with the price and quality! Bought both the black and white one off Amazon. Would not be able to tell that this was a knock off brand! Would definitely buy again!
1,I had it a few days and left a great 5 star review on the product. After 3 months the first time around the guitar stopped functioning. I had it exchanged free of charge and the new product worked well so I kept the review. After a couple weeks with the new product it too stopped functioning. I ended up having a 32 minute phone call with Amazon that resulted in nothing. I would not buy this Chinese junk it's hit or miss on a good day.
4,used wii guitar arrived in a very timely manor. was definitely used needed some cleaning otherwise worked well as a replacement
3,Well they worked and are still working after a month and the person I bought them for was quite pleased with them. But they are definitely refurbished NOT new. The blue and orange keys were switched on one of the guitars.
2,I bought 2 of these from this seller. I kept them safely in their boxes after I received them and  visually inspected them. Upon the visual inspection they looked just fine. I bought them for my daughter as an add-on gift. 3 weeks later when I presented them to her we noticed that one of them did not work. I contacted the seller and OF COURSE since it had been over 3 weeks from the time they shipped til the time we discovered a problem they would to NOTHING to help us.
1,When the FIRST guitar arrived everything seemed normal and it played fine. We played for just around 2-3 hours and in the morning it would no longer work--so we got 2-3 hours out of the first one. We sent it back for a replacement. The 2nd one arrived with NO STRAP and all dented up. The keys were loose and (at times) unresponsive. I am not happy.  I DO NOT recommend from this company.  We are now returning our second one as well. Bummer.
3,i got my guitar today and everything works but my wammy so i dont understand because i ordered it brand new.
4,Quality is excellent took off one star just because it still seems too expensive for mostly plastic
5,Works like a dream!!  Have played nearly non-stop for the last 2 days! Been great to be able to play a game I haven't in 2 years!!
1,I recently got back into Guitar Hero and my old guitar had serious issues so I purchased this guitar since it was Amazon's choice.  It arrived in nice packaging I put it together and booted up Smash Hits on my old Wii.  I go to quickplay and play Through the Fire and Flames on Hard Difficulty.  I proceeded to quickly fail due to the fact that the blue button did not work.  I am truly saddened and disappointed by this and I will be returning the item.
5,great was a gift and he loves it
5,Arrived in a timely fashion and works great for my Rock Bad 3 on the Wii. My fiance and I played all weekend.
5,Nice guitars to jam on!
5,We had a hard time finding used guitars and the 2 that we did get for $7 a piece aren't in great shape.  This made it worth it especially with all of the indoor time we have had this winter.
5,came 3 days early and it’s very clean. works well :)
3,No stickers
5,Great guitar great price. Now the whole family can rock together.
5,I bought this for my daughter for christmas and she playes on it everyday she loves it. Very pleased.
1,Mine broke 1 day later so upset about this
5,It works!
5,Dis a gud guitar :)
1,Item does not work. My son is going crazy trying to set ir up but they keys don't appear to work. This was his bday present yesterday and he's so dissapointed.
1,We bought this guitar as a Christmas present for our 4 year old and within two weeks the wires were starting to work only intermittently.  Only adults were attaching and removing the Wii controller from the guitar as my son's fingers aren't strong enough to remove the back panel by himself so I know the failure wasn't due to a child's carelessness.  But when the controller is inserted into the slot the wires must be stuffed into a very small space and they just didn't hold up.  After one month the wires were coming out of the plug and the unit stopped working completely.  I know it wasn't an expensive toy but we were still very disappointed that it only lasted a month.
4,The guitar works great but the game that came with it doesn't work.
4,This guitar works fine with Lego Rock Band and my son loves it.
5,I bought this for a 7 year old because its frets are designed for smaller hands. She loves it.
1,Don't waste your time with this finicky piece of junk. You have to squeeze an actual Wii remote into a slot it barely fits in and it bends the wire badly causing all kinds of problems. It detects button presses that are not being made and some buttons won't work. You have to keep unplugging replugging and restarting the Wii until at some point it decides to work. Not worth a penny.
1,I ordered this guitar since it was recommended by amazon.I was super excited to have it come in until I hooked it up and started playing.The red button didn’t work for a little bit.Until I tried restarting it.Then it started to work but the strum bar didn’t register at times.Causing me to miss notes I couldn’t play expert due to that issue.Could only play at a medium difficulty guitar is definitely not worth it.Highly don’t recommend it.Definitely not worth 40 dollars.
1,Scam.
5,Got this for a friend he loves it
1,I’ve had multiple different problems with this guitar: whammy not working strummer not strumming strummer stuck going down and there has seemed to be a new problem everyday.
2,Was hoping for something gently used.  I think I paid too much for this.  The other one I have (exactly the same style) is easy to use...this one is difficult and touchy.
1,Plugged it in and played one game! The guitar would not sync with my remote after only 2 games! Maybe the maddest I’ve been in my life this item is worthless and gives false hope! I wish I could meet the creator of this guitar so I could back hand slap them across the face! Don’t waste your money can’t believe Amazon backs this item!
5,This is as advertised
1,This product is horrible!! I thought the guitar was tight because it was new and so I tried to play with it to loosen it up ... nope the strummer doesn’t work doesn’t react to the action of hitting it. $40x Dave your money and find another guitar that actually works too bad I waited too long to return it
1,I’m guessing it’s hit and miss with this item. I read the reviews and bought it anyway. Big mistake!  I spent a lot of time researching the right wii guitar and still failed. Has me wondering are there different sizes of the wii remote? Cause the only way my remote was gonna fit in this guitar was by making the hole larger. So disappointed.
5,Amazing lots of memories
5,I am a rock n roll legend (in my own mind).
5,Very good!
4,Works great
5,Came in perfect condition works like a charm. Loveee it especially since my fiance and I play guitar hero like teenagers lol
4,Excellent!
3,Very poor condition. Was worried that it would be broken upon arrival but it wasn't. Works alright but it's just......gross. Very worn out. All buttons work.
5,First one didn't work had to return at my expense but they did replace it
5,Works perfectly and at a great price. I would recommend looking for deals instead of buying a new product. I found this one and it exceeds all expectations. Thanks again.
5,Works great. Now I have two!!
2,I enjoyed using it while it lasted but it didn’t even take a week of game time before the thing broke. Very dissapointed that it didn’t last longer than a week! Waste of money!
1,Bought this guitar and looks great. The buttons work and it is compatible with the wii but the whammy bar does not work at all. I tried to calibrate it to see if that was the problem and no such luck can’t even calibrate it because the whammy bar doesn’t work. Can’t return it because I threw the original box away.
5,Works feels a little heavier than others i have had but that it a good thing. Doesn't feel cheap
1,I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS!  The guitar didn't even work!  NOT a happy customer AT ALL!  Do NOT buy this!  Save your money and go elsewhere.  I originally bought this hoping to get a decent guitar for a fair price.  Save your time and pay a little extra for a guitar that actually works.  I'm so disappointed.  I'm shipping it back immediately.  Should have listened to the reviews!  DO NOT BUY THIS!
3,In the beggining I liked it a lot. It worked easily and perfectly but in 3 months it sttoped working. :/
1,Guitar worked well for about a few weeks ... the cable that connects to the Wii remote just came off. I take care of my stuff didn’t pull hard and now it doesn’t work. Pls someone get back to me
1,Guitar didn't match the beat. I would press the button and it would not show up on the screen for 2 seconds. This lag made it impossible to play the game. So sad. Returned it the same day it arrived.
5,Perfect size
1,Do not buy this! There is no brand name. It does not work. You will end up sending it back & driving to the store to buy a real one. Don’t waste your time. Amazon should NOT let this be available to sell. Cannot believe I even have to give this one star!
5,Received item as described on time.  Thanks!
1,I got this for my family for xmas and we were really excited to play this (luckily we already have another guitar) and when we put it together the lock to keep the neck and body together was broken and because of this it couldn't go in all the way. I was considering ordering another because I thought it would just be a random defect but after reading other reviews I'll be buying another one somewhere else.
1,This guitar worked well in the beginning but after a few uses it stopped working and I thought maybe it might have been the port but everything is still intact. Super disappointing.
5,Good
1,Warning do not buy this item!!!!!  It never worked and I’m no amateur gamer.  The amazon website never gave the option to return!!!! So I’m writing to tell you you could be wasting your money!!!  Horrible experience.
5,Works like new!
1,Do NOT purchase this I could’ve gotten a brand new one somewhere for the same exact price description states no stickers on the guitar. That’s a LIE I spent about an hour trying to remove them if I could rate this 0 stars I would. Horrible and wouldn’t reccommend
5,My son loved it.
1,This is the second one of these guitars that I have purchased. I don’t play super frequently but as happened last time the guitar simply stops working. Very frustrating and disappointing.
5,I mean who can complain with a good game of Guitar Hero? This works really well!
5,Goood.
1,Bought the guitar for a birthday and hooked it up to TV. The buttons were permanently stuck on the red and blue buttons making it not able to be used. Waste of money.
1,will be returning it it is delayed when playing on the guitar.  We tried several games and does the same.  Not the original one that nintendo Wii offered its a knock off.
5,Nice guitar plays good and looks good.  I am very happy with it and we are having lots of fun playing Rock Band
5,My son loves this guitar and it is very easy to hook up to remote . We enjoyed playing guitar hero with it.
1,I used this product with GH3 and was surprised to find out it just would not connect. i tried everything to try and fix it but it would not show any results i am truly disappointed.
1,Terrible. Hooked it up to the console for my wife’s Christmas present and the toggle switch that chooses the songs is stuck and runs through all the songs without you getting to choose.
1,Quit working in three weeks after receipt.
5,Works well.  I have not used it much yet but for the money seems to be functioning just fine.
5,size is just a hair smaller than our old one but functions the same.
5,Guitar Hero guitars are waaaay better than RockBand guitars! That's why I bought this one!
3,Works OK but occasionally some of the buttons "stick"
1,When I got it it didn’t work it kept lagging on the game. It was always second late and I kept losing. Now I can’t return it either and get my money back.
5,It was a present for my daughter.  She loves it.  It came as promised.  Very nice.
5,This rocking guitar helps you become a Rockstar on the wii
2,Good equipment need to give me another one
1,Opened it hooked it up right away and literally only the red fret worked. I bought it because my old guitar's yellow button didn't work but this "new" one was even worse. I'd avoid and try to get a brand name guitar if you can. Super disappointing and I'm returning.
5,Does exactly o what it is supposed to.
1,Dislike it would not completely connect and wouldnt work and when it did it was spotty and barely would actually hit the wrong notes
5,Works great!
5,Works great with  guitar  hero.
5,Great way to play music spend time  enjoy this guitar so much with two players and totally cool sound
5,I liked it because I could play guitar hero again
1,It came broken when I opened it up  and I will not be purchasing anything like this In the future
5,works great
2,Loose wires and had to be returned as it would not work. But great customer service.
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brothers and upon opening/ setting it up we realized that the strum bar was stuck strumming up and the yellow blue and orange buttons were being pressed without being pushed.
1,Connector stopped working after 2 days of use getting a refund on it. Do not buy this product it is a chinese knockoff
3,works good.
1,I tried playing on the Wii and it did not work most of the time. Some notes it would play others it wouldn’t.
5,very good gift.... thought it could be an inch or two bigger but above all he liked it very much........
1,Item stopped working after about a month or 2 and I missed time frame to return it's a piece of garbage don't even waste your money
1,The product worked for about a day. I was always worried when playing the guitar that it felt rather cheap so I played carefully. Despite that the strumming button broke after a day and would send the strum twice even though I only strummed once. Returned it and found another.
1,Unfortunately this guitar did not last but one month after it was given as a gift.
2,It broke after a couple of months of use
1,This product worked for two hours & then just stopped working. I did all the troubleshooting i could find. Waiting on a new one
5,Now I'm my husband's rocker-chic again!
1,The blue and orange buttons don’t work.
1,Don't buy this product it isn't actually Guitar Hero brand and doesn't work with the wii or guitar hero games.
5,Has strap included nothing was wrong with the buttons or whammy bar. Arrived earlier than expected!
1,The guitar came in with no white facing on the front and no back panel to cover where the Wii remote goes. Worst of all  all of the wires were cut in the cable that plugs into the Wii remote. Totally screwed over
1,My guitar came not work the buttons are broken and will not work on my game
5,Works great. Me & my son have hours of great gaming.
1,Does not work well wont buy it again.
1,Didn’t work out of the package.  Ripped off.  Hustled.  How is this okay to sell?
5,Timely shipping good price and it all worked. Will do business again. Thanks!
5,Smooth transaction great product
1,I just ordered the guitar and the strum bar just keeps scrolling down.  Don't buy this  it is a waste of money. Absolute trash
5,It works great.
5,Very good product!
1,The plus button broke within 4 days of having the guitar.
5,Great buy - shipped on time and came brand new in the box.
5,Works great with the Guitar Hero. Great guitar for a great price.
5,works perfectly there is nothing wrong with it! the only thing i do regret is not ordering it any sooner!
1,Product worked for less than 24 hours. Heavily dissatisfied and dismayed at the purchase
1,None of buttons or strum bar work.  Can't return because we didn't keep the box...our is 100% defective.  Disappointed in quality control on this (and mad at myself for throwing box out before trying product)
5,Great!
1,The product was damaged and for the amount of money I spent I would have though it was new looking.
5,Works great

1,It doesn’t work
5,Good guitar. haha  What else is there to say?

3,Literally stopped working 1 week after i got it but was working fine at first wish i could refund
4,Like many of these reviewers I thought the strum bar wasn’t working. I unplugged wii controller and held down whammie bar when I reconnected and it is working now. Hope this helps instructions should make it clearer.
5,Product looked new and works great.
5,I love this guitar it feels like a new name brand guitar I fc TTFATF on I wanted to see if it works on rock band 1 and band hero and it dose and works well with clone hero this should be the next guitar you get
5,Fc'd Soulless 5 on this
1,I got this guitar second hand new from marketplace and it just didn’t work at all no response at all from the guitar. Tried 3 different controllers and still didn’t work. Pile of trash.
5,Awesome controller!! Great price and I will tell you if you have the original band hero game it will work with it. Just make sure your Nintendo controllers are fully charged. Works amazing no complaints here. Would definitely recommend it 100%!
5,So fun to use playing Guitar Hero!
5,Works great.
1,When i got the guitar it was brand new and looked to be in great condition! However when I started playing the strumming wouldn't register. The bar that is used was almost sticking when I made a down strum. If I played on any level higher than easy about halfway through the song it would just stop registering. The game showed it like I wasn't strumming at all. This obviously led to me losing the game.
5,Purchased this guitar to add to our Wii Rock Band set (with the standard drum set and guitar). This one rocks adds a lot of fun when used with the microphone and the rest of the instruments. Works perfectly with both Wii Lego Rock Band and Guitar Hero does not have the fret area like the standard guitar but I rarely use that area anyway. The star power button is a little harder to press than the normal guitar but you get used to it. I like the style and there is plenty of space to add stickers. Overall if you are looking for another guitar to augment your wii rock band I highly recommend the Les Paul guitar!
5,Nice looking works great.
5,He uses with the game and is very happy
5,It works really good. The only little problem I had was that the neck dissamblede itself in the middle of a game but I put it on lock and it worked again.
1,Was so excited to have a second guitar and it didn't work at all. The color buttons worked but nothing on the actual guitar worked; strum wammy analog and +/- buttons. Extremely disappointed.
5,I am really considering buying this. but I don't know if it works with the game Green Day Rock Band for Wii. if someone who knows that can respond please do so.
1,Ordered two guitars neither one worked.
5,Had a wii controller connect it too the guitar. Download a software call wiitar. Connect Bluetooth or buy it and boon you playing clone hero
5,Exactly what we needed! Thanks
5,An adapter is required to make the guitar work for PC but it works well. Makes for a nice budget guitar for Clone Hero
5,Works perfect
5,brand new  works perfect very fast delivery
1,Ordered a second guitar hero wii guitar from amazon after the first did not work. this has the same issue as the first i ordered where it lags and hits only a few notes when music tempo is faster. can’t believe i wasted my time and money on this product. gonna have to find the original guitar for the game to fix issue. unbelievably cheap quality. don’t waste your time
1,Doesn’t respond as well as the Xbox version. Seems like I have to strum almost half a second early.
5,Worked good
5,Awesome Product - Works just as expected and is brand new.
5,I bought this despite being kind of skeptical on purchasing a non-official guitar hero controller. I got the package in set it up with a Wii to USB adapter and was pleasantly surprised when it worked perfectly on Clone Hero. The strum bar doesn’t feel super flimsy and the buttons are very responsive. I have no idea if it works with official guitar hero on the Wii console but it worked well with Clone Hero.
5,Exactly what our grandson wanted.
4,Everything was working fine until today. How to I get my money back or at least a replacement
5,Works great
1,three out of the five keys don’t work at all. I tried playing a game and it was literally impossible.
5,They work with clone hero BUT you won’t get whammy bar and start power has to be mapped to a button
5,You can tell it's used but still in pretty decent shape. It works great so far with clone hero on computer adapter purchased separately to make sure it connected.
5,Wii game
5,I've been dying to find a guitar and games to re buy and play for a while and so far I have guitar hero 3 world tour and band hero and it works great for all 3 games! (It does say on the box it comes in that it doesnt work with band hero but mine does)
1,Did not work with our WII. Sent back
5,Purchase the USB wii dongle with it. Pretty much plug and play for Clone Hero.
5,Really liked it plays real nice
5,Recibí la guitarra hace un par de días esta justa se ve de buena calidad. La recomiendoReport abuse
5,Original order had a loose neck. They replaced it immediately with a perfect new one.
5,Great guitar for a causal player. color buttons are kinda hard to press. amazing track strumming. also works with Clone hero if you have a raphnet adapter.
5,Recibí la guitarra hace un par de días esta justa se ve de buena calidad. La recomiendo

5,Perfect for playing Clone Hero!
