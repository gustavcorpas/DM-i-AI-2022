4,After troubleshooting a few issues with my original Xbox One I concluded the power pack was at fault.  The Ponkor replacement came faster than expected.  I've only had it for 3 days.  My pros and cons/warnings are below.Pros: It was a quick plug and play replacement.Several reviews have mentioned its "loud" and I do not doubt it is louder than the original power pack.  Some have referenced it gets louder the longer you use it.  So far its not bothersome especially for price.Value is good.  At the time I bought it Ponkor is 50% less than Microsoft's power pack.  Microsoft isn't manufacturing power packs for the original Xbox One any more so these are all leftovers if you can find them.Cons: The "Standby" light states its orange but looks closer to red which is more of a aesthetic issue in my opinion.  I figure red is bad but it takes getting used to.  You may need to reset the settings in your Xbox to ensure startup preferences are corrected.  This is not bad however I had to switch from Standby mode in Settings to Energy Saver mode to force the power pack to actually shutdown.  The pack takes a little longer to turn the system on and off.WARNING: "Ghost issues": On three different occasions when turning the system off the pack for some reason turns the system back on by itself.  No joke... after 5+ minutes of being off the system turned back on.  Not sure if the pack turns back on because the Xbox is trying to update and the pack is designed to "start up" when it senses this but so far I haven't figured out why it does this by itself.  This is the most concerning part right now.  You don't want your Xbox turning itself on randomly and overheating wasting energy etc.  I had to unplug the pack from the Xbox to turn it completely off.  Annoying but right now at least I get to use my system.The "on light" is Green not white like the original power pack.Eventually if this pack dies or goes through electric fits then I will invest in a new Xbox One system.  In my opinion it is worth a try if you have determined your power pack is the issue for getting the Xbox One to boot up.
5,Great replacement for original power box. Our Xbox was shutting off unexpectedly we couldn’t figure it out and switched out our power box and now it’s no longer a issue
5,For being at GAMESTOP FOR $50 DOLLARS This is a deal you can’t miss I’ve only had it one day and it works like a charm  doesn’t make any noise it’s long cables makes it convenient comes in great packaging very happy with purchase
5,This was a replacement for the original power brick that came with my XBOX One it did the job faithfully for 26 months. It does not last as long as an original part but assuming my experience is representative it's cheaper per working month than the original.
5,But when my power brick died I was really happy to get this I've had it for about a month now and it's still working good and after a while I got used to the louder noise.
5,No bull cheaper then OEM from Microsoft and work's just the same. Hardly no noise unless your right up on it and still takes a second to hear it. Worth the Price paid for it.
4,Powers up my XBOX ONE. Original power died. I don’t know what sleep mode is so not sure why it asked even with system off I can still hear fan ( I’m guessing ) I didn’t ever hear my original supply. But it’s doing it’s job.
5,Waited months before leaving a good review to ensure product is still working.
5,The old power brick had started to sound like a jet engine. Can’t tell you how good it is not to even know if it’s on!  Unit works great. Im very pleased with this item.
5,Works perfectly for our Xbox one and still continues to do so great product
