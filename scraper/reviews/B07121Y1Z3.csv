4,This worked on a Gateway NV 79 with Windows 7 and the same Gateway with Linux MX-21 on a different SSD.The same Windows 7 SSD  in a Dell Latitude would not work.  This Dell would work with a separate VGA to VGA cable and a separate audio cable.The Intel graphics driver is up to date.  Probably user error
5,If you're like me and just want one video capture device for everything this worked perfect for converting my Windows 98 PC's VGA source to HDMI to plug into an EVGA XR1 Lite. Does 4:3 & 16:9 resolutions perfectly. Sound quality is excellent from the 3.5mm.
5,I had tried different VGA/HDMI connectors but they did not work. After I Goolged the issue I was having the reviewer put a link to this product on his article. And it works! I have a KVM switch and was unable to get any signal from my 2nd PC requiring that I switch the inputs on my monitor whenever I needed to switch from my personal PC to my work PC. With this connector (not an adaptor) I'm able to make the change on the KVM switch and leave the monitor input alone.
5,I used it to connect a second monitor.My computer had only one HDMI port so could not connect a second monitor. This one did the job perfectly. Just connected the VGA connector from my computer to my HDMI monitor. Set up took about 3 minutes (just connect the VGA and the USB that comes with it to make it work) and in a minute I had my second screen working perfect!! I definitely recommend it! Don't get mix with the reviews this is all you need to make your extended monitor work!
5,This a great solution to getting my old HP optiplex 7020 desktop to output vga to my Vizio hdmi tv. The image and sound are both excellent. I had been using a graphics card to do this for a while but it quit working. This is a much better solution.
5,3 parts later and this is the one to meet my needs.
5,Hooking up a desktop computer to a 42" tv screen. Works beautifully.
5,worked right out the box
5,Connected an older ELMO to a new large flat screen TV.  Works beautifully!
5,Easy to install
5,I had a HDMI cable that I couldn't use without an adapter. This one was inexpensive and did the job it was supposed to do. Now I can use my TV as a second screen when I need to.
5,I had to use a pair of needle nose pliers to tighten the screws (no big deal).
4,The product works well. I'd buy another one.
4,Simple and straight forward. It plugs into your vga  card it has a cable included to power it via usb. It comes with a second cable to add sound but in my case I use an external sound  device not the monitor. Please note: this is to adapt your vga output to an HDMI input for viewing and using your computer. Setup was plug and play. You will have to finger tighten it onto the socket but a suggestion would be if this device is ever redesigned include two pass through holes so you can access the screws with a small standard  screwdriver from the back.. The hdmi cable socket actually blocks that option in its current configuration. It is off to one side vs. being in the middle. I understand not wanting it to be larger. Just layout could have been a plus vs a very good. I installed the device powered up the computer with all cables attached and  the computer adjusted the resolution to the monitor  pretty much immediately. So no real user complaints on the working part of this device. I am pleased. You might be too.
4,It was needed for a purpose
4,this finally got our older desktop computer to show up on a new monitor so we could get our old files to a USB and transfer to our new computer. However despite plugging the audio jack into everything that remotely looked like audio we could not get sound to our monitor speakers from the old desktop. Not a huge deal but it was odd as it claims to transfer the audio as well.
5,Every time I get a browser update I have to unplug and replug in the cable.
5,If you like myself and others have a laptop with one HDMI and one VGA port but only have monitors/TVs with HDMI ports and are looking to EXTEND your desktop (VS MIRRORING THE SCREENS) then this is the perfect adapter at a affordable price. This micro USB type-B powered adapter offers great picture quality (for VGA anyway) and has the ability to have audio routed to the device as well via 3.5mm AUX cord. It is durable and does the job quite well however there is one (potential) design flaw. For some computers such as my ROG Asus the VGA port is sandwiched between the native HDMI port and the charging cord. Luckily for me my power cord was small enough to wedge it in there without cause too much pull strain but for others it may not be the case and could render the product useless. Please provide a version featuring the 3.5mm port be facing to the side with the HDMI adapter port facing outwards. This would ensure the device useable by more users who have computer models similar to as described above. Plus having the visuals with no audio would render the device useless might as well have it designed to where the audio would be sacrificed not the visuals aka switch the port locations. Great product 10/10 so far. Keep it up.
3,It works great while it works. USB had to be constantly reset to bring monitor online again near the end. Don't know if it is eligible for a warranty replacement. Maybe the seller can make it right...think there is a 2 year warranty on it.
5,Was able to hook up my  laptop to my 50" 4k tv. Works great. The cord isn't  as long as I would like but it works
5,great quality
4,Returning
5,Converts smoothly from laptop to hdmi tv so I can dual monitor from the couch. The adapter gets a little warm after prolonged use but I’ve left it plugged in for over 6 hours and no issues yet!
5,Adapter worked perfectly.
4,Mixed reviews in amazon to some it worked perfectly while others didn't so basically your mileage may vary.  Please keep this in mind when purchasing this product.While the adapter has worked my screen would disconnect and reconnect every 2-3 minutes I tried resolving it myself by:1. Giving the adapter it's own power source (2 amp usb charging block for cell phone) I thought it might be a faulty usb port on my pc or some odd power-saving feature. Tried swapping power cables too2. Connecting it differently from their suggested installation of installing the adapter w/ power while the PC is off. I tried a 'hot swap' (plugging it in while my PC was on) both with having the vga adapter supplied with and without power before fixing it on the vga port.  I tried having my pc off then attaching power after the PC has booted.3. Swapping HDMI cables mind you I only had 6 foot cables at hand at that time but cables seem fine tested them with a TV and another monitor.The only thing that varied was the disconnect interval increased from 2-3 minutes to 3-4.  I've also tried to  change power settings monitor sleep settings monitor refresh rates etc with no luck in any of those also.I've contacted customer support about it and they've tried resolving the problem by sending me an instruction video on how to install their product something I've already found before contacting them.  They ended up sending me another unit which unfortunately gave me the same results.  It might be my set up/monitor/temperamental hardware  (evil spirits I dunno some other malignant factor) but I thought they were sincere about giving me the customer satisfaction I wanted.  This is why I've given this review 4 stars.  I don't think their product was faulty I think it's my set up.I guess what I haven't done (because I didn't have enough time to do so) was try using the adapter with a different PC/monitor combination.  I've decided to keep the adapter in case I might need it for another time in a different setup maybe it will work next time.  To CS if you want me to return the other adapter please let me know.
5,It works just fine out-of-the-box if you use it properly - so read more and pay attention.YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE USB cable plugged into a powered USB port because it needs power to work!NO POWER NO WORKEY!I am using this item on an older computer that only has a VGA out port so that I can use a newer monitor that only has an HDMI port.  IT WORKS JUST FINE for that!  Only works from computer VGA port to HDMI monitor or TV port - and only if it has power.  It only works in the from-a-computer-to-a-video-display direction.NOTE:  IF YOU TRY TO USE IT TO A VGA MONITOR IT WILL NOT WORK IN THAT DIRECTION because it is not made to do that.The provided audio cable can be plugged into your computer speaker out port and into the device which allows the device to have an audio signal from your computer (if the computer audio port has a signal) on the HDMI out (say you wanted to play a DVD on the old computer and wanted to plug the computer into a large screen TV to see and hear the movie playing on the computer).  But you don't need to have the audio if all you are interested in is the computer display -- but it's there if you want to use it!For me this is a very useful device allowing me to use older computers with newer monitors or a large screen LCD TV.  Very cool!  Decent picture - keep in mind that the original signal is VGA so the quality can only be as good as the VGA signal coming out of your computer.  THE DEVICE WORKS AND DOES WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO.Hope this review helps you non-technical people.  It really is a good and useful product if you use it correctly.
5,Recommend this product. Used for a dual pc monitor display and worked perfectly.
4,So I used this with a graphics card that has one vga one dvi and one hdmi port. I was using all three with a couple random tvs and a monitor that I'd acquired over the years. A friend gave me an old tv because he'd gotten a new one so I figured I'd replace one of mine since it was bigger than any of them. Only problem is that the monitor was the only thing with a dvi port so that had to be used there and the new tv only had HDMI but vga wasn't working on the TV I wanted to keep (no idea why) and the other tv worked but I wanted to replace it because it didn't support 1080p so was forced to have a lower resolution than the other two displays so in comes this.2 issues.1. it didn't work with the TV I'd bought it for it simply would pick up the signal but using the hdmi directly from my graphics card worked and the new tv worked with the adapter so it worked out anyway.2. As I've noticed with pretty much every tv I've tried to use the image is 'zoomed in' and cuts off the edges by default. Previously I'd used the nvidia control panel software to resize the image correctly only it didn't give me that option with the adapter fortunately the nes TV does have an option in the menu that I was able to find.
4,There is a weird noise coming from the TV speakers.  Sounds like it's picking up digital interference from the usb port powering the device.  Noticeable but not insane.  Not really audible when any sound is playing.  Maybe poor isolation.  Serves my needs so won't send back but probably try a different brand if I need another one for another computer.  Picture quality is excellent.  Getting the video sized to the TV screen required changing settings in the TV.  Quite a pain to figure out.
3,I have to look for another onethe power support first start to give up working
5,Using to take an old Windows 7 system and connect up to a UHD monitor.  Worked right out of the box.  The picture looks great.  The only thing I would have liked better is to have the power connection on the other side of the adapter.  On my computer the current position of the mircro-USB power connector is on the same side that the USB ports (into the motherboard) that I need to connect into.  The other side has nothing in the way.  Oh well I got it to work.  I'm sure other computers would have had the opposite situation.
4,I initially rated this product two stars because I could not get it to work with my Panasonic plasma 50" 1080p Plasma HDTV but it did work with a smaller Toshiba led TV which I don't use.  After hours of struggle with only hints as to a solution from the internet I finally figured it out.Using an older Dell Optiplex 755 following the normal instructions the initial startup screen would show up on the TV but then the display would go black with a message on the TV that it wasn't getting a signal; however I could get audio through my Yamaha RX-V573 receiver.  As I now understand it the TV was not displaying because the screen resolution was too low but how to change it when you have a blank screen to work with?  Plugging the computer back into the computer monitor did not help because the screen resolution topped out for the recommended resolution for the monitor.So the solution for me was to:1.  Shut down  the computer.2.  Plug in the converter cable from the computer back into the computer to the TV (or receiver) HDMI port.3.  Start the computer (gets computer initial screen and then goes black.4.  Unplug the converter cable from the computer and plug the computer monitor back into the computer.5.  Right click computer monitor screen and chose screen resolution.  I then had the higher recommended resolution as an option on the computer monitor.  Select the higher recommended resolution and apply it before it reverts back to the lower resolution.6.  Unplug the computer monitor from the computer and plug the converter cable back in it now worked for me.7.  The recommended resolution stretched bit beyond the edge of the TV screen so I chose the next lowest one but be careful not to choose one so low that the TV screen goes blank again requiring  going back to step one.8.  Without restarting the computer it also seemed to work going back and forth between the computer monitor and the TV choosing lower resolutions until one shows up on the TV.  Then right click the TV screen choose recommended screen resolution and follow the change screen resolution procedure.
5,This does exactly what it needs to do. It converts the VGA output of my computer to the HDMI input of my monitor. No drivers and such just plug it in and it works.
5,I have an old computer running Windows 7 OS with a vga monitor hookup.  Wanted to use a TV with HDMI for my monitor so I could switch between TV and computer.  This "appeared" to be what I needed but it sounded too simple and I was worried about the old OS.  However I ordered it and it worked like advertised.  It arrived 2 days early it took about 2 minutes to hook up to my TV and everything looked and sounded fine.  I ordered another one today for backup.  I got the 10ft cord to make sure I had enough length to reach everything.
3,The cable  picture’ resolution is poor  must upgrade to a high-end Creative graphics card.
3,Captain's Log 1/20/2021 6:47 pm CA  i just installed it and it work so far but the VGA plug part get very hot.all u need to do is plug the VGA in to ur laptop then plug your usb in to ur laptop and then the sound jack into the earphone port of the laptop. NOT: if u want the sound to come out of the laptop then do not plug in the sound jack. then plug the other end that is HDMI in to the back of ur tv.  i used [ HDMI 1 ] i then turn turned on  the laptop and then the tv. then u looked for the setting that you will use to switch the live tv to HDMI 1 and that was it. i use it about 15 mints as a test. when i close the laptop as in turned it off. and switch the tv back live tv  witch is just normal TV. like Chanel 4 nbc  or 2 cbs and so on on a 4k tv. and wen i graved the VGA part it felt very hot to hot if you ask me. but it did the job so far but worried about it getting to hot or doing some thing to my old laptop. it's not my hero laptop as in it is not one I use the most but still do not want to brake. if the VGA  beaks or dos any thing bad like to my laptop or tv i will for sure come back and let u know what happen. i just wish there was a way to cool the VGA plug down like 50% down safely. because having a hot VGA plug is very worrisome for me.
5,Within a minute of pulling it out of the box I plugged it into my old server's VGA USB for power and plugged my HDMI cable into the back.  Flawless no issues.  I was finally able to see why the server was hung up correct the issue and finish administering the headless server.Note: it did its job and  did the job quickly and easily.  My needs were basic and did not involve any detailed screen benchmarks so I cannot speak to that.
4,I love this cable compared to the converter box I bought this fully supports text mode. And if you're running an older dose machine or you want to get into your bios to fix the system time this cable Works. My only issues are that when you load up Dos box in full-screen mode it cuts out a few vertical lines on the right hand side... which is negligible. You can still read the text. And some of Windows text when running something like Windows 2000 is a little blurry if your reg is older than Windows 2000 I'm pretty sure there are true clear type fonts and options you could settle with. But this isn't a deal-breaker for this device.It does the job there's very little fuss the power plugs in right behind your computer and a free USB port if you have one available it includes a cable for audio out and the quality of the image is really good. If anyone is playing old DOS games or Windows 95/98/2000/XP computer that only outputs VGA this cable is amazing.Overall id give it a 8.5/10
5,Excelente producto 100% recomendado
4,The main downside to this adapter is the weight that is cantilevered off of the DB15 female connector.  I'm using this on a laptop and the female connector does not have matching 4-40 female threaded studs to attach the adapter to.  Once you attach the HDMI cable the audio cord and the USB power adapter cable the whole assembly pulls loose.  If your computer has the DB15 female studs then you may not have the same issue.
5,I tried a couple of hdmi to hdmi adapters and none of them worked.The screen flickering was just terrible.This product was the only one that worked; and it worked perfectly.Good clear picture from my laptop to my TV.If your laptop doesn't have hdmi built in; this is the product to get if you want to connect your laptop to a TV.Yes I recommend this sellerYes I recommend this product
4,This adapter does exactly what I needed.  I have a docking station that has VGA and DisplayPort connections and I'm converting both to HDMI to send to a KVM.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the design concerns me that it will hold up under mechanical stresses.  Where it sits on the dock and it size combined with the HDMI cable means that it might tweak the docker connector and/or the adapter itself.  For my case it might have been better if the adapter and power connection were one solid piece with a cable coming out to a female HDMI.  The design may make it difficult for people with desktop systems and how close you can get the back of the computer to a wall.What I may try doing is put the adapter on the end of a VGA cable so that the adapter is not connected to hardware at all and just the cables.Bottom line: It does what I need and would likely recommend to a friend.
5,I received this little adapter the same day I ordered it. I plugged it into my desktop computer connected my HDMI cable plugged in the USB cable and audio cable. And hey it worked! This solved my problem of my audio not working most of the time. I've been using my 32 inch Samsung smart TV as a computer monitor because it's a bigger screen. For some reason when I power on my computer the audio sound wouldn't work and I kept troubleshooting why to no avail to solve the problem. I was using a DVI plug adapter to connect my HDMI cable to my computer. I double checked my connections and even changed my HDMI cable back and forth thinking it was a bad cable. That didn't work. I went to the Sound Device on my computer and it was receiving the audio signal as the bars were moving up and down but not coming out. After thinking about it I said to myself "Why don't I use my VGA output?". So went here in Amazon to research and see if there was a cable. Surely enough there was and this was it. To make things short I'm now glad I ordered this and very happy now that my sound in on for good!
5,This was very easy to plug in and use immediately. Great quality and solved my connection problem.
4,If you only have one HDMI port on your PC and you want duel monitors this product works as advertised. However do know that you will see a difference with contrast. Although it's obvious with two dark screens once I went online it was difficult to see any difference.
5,This product worked perfectly for my needs. I have an older computer with the blue monitor output. I purchased a newer monitor that is HDMI only. This item when used will successfully allow you to hook up your vga output commuter to HDMI monitor.
5,Good for adapting my old VGA computers to newer monitors.
5,I've been trying several ways to connect multi monitor/TVs with HDMI. My computer only has 1 HDMI. I tried connecting USB to HDMI using adopter USB-c to HDMI using a hub and finally this time I decided to go back to an old day of connecting VGA output.At first try it did not work. TV showed 'no signal' message. I read several reviews on Amazon that said it did not work at all so I thought this would be the case for me but before I gave up I tried it on my other TV.. which did not work either...Then I decided to replace my HDMI cable and tried again and tadaaaa! it worked!!  The first HDMI cable was actually working between my computer and TV so I never doubted that the cable had any issue. But after I replaced the cable with another one reconnected it and no problem whatsoever it just worked instantly with no additional step no flicker no noise no slowing down no on&off connection...If this adopter does not work for you before you give up try to replace your HDMI cable it might do miracle.
5,Picture worked but did require connecting the (provided) power adapter to a USB port.
5,I have an older DELL laptop (2009 model I think).  It's a beast that still works great BUT it only has VGA ports.Here is a real life EASY 2 minute installation guide for you:1.  Stick this little VGA to HDMI adapter into the male VGA port on the laptop2.  Insert the Micro-C to USB cord into your adapter (Micro-C goes into adapter/USB end of cord goes into USB port on your computer OR any phone charger with USB accepting port.  This gives the adapter power and that's why it works so well compared to other crappy ones.3..  Insert an HDMI (on both ends) cord into the female HDMI port on the adapter.4.  Insert the other end of the HDMI cord into one of you TV's HDMI female ports5.  Change the input settings on your actual TV to match up with the port you used (example if you plugged into "HDMI-2" on your TV--set the TV to input on your remote or manual buttons to setting for "HDMI-2"ALL DONE!!!NOTE:  There is an AUX cord included with a plug in port on your adapter.  I don't use this as I bluetooth to nearby speakers instead.  But this works fine just plug the other end into your TV's aux port.  You may have to play around with audio settings on your laptop but likely things will link up automatically for you.
4,I was told I could use this to get my audio from my Xbox to go through my computer and into my speakers... The problem with that is once I got it it says that it has to be plugged in almost the opposite direction... Therefore I would have to be using a desktop computer and not just the monitor... So if you're looking for this as an alternative to add an aux port for your non-speaker having monitor and non-aux port having monitor.... Then don't waste your time.. I really wish I knew what to do but I think I've given up on it.
5,I have a work-issued older Lenovo that only had a VGA connection and it took me an embarrassing amount of trial and error to realize it wouldn’t work with a simple VGA to HDMI cable. This fixed my issue and was easy to use - plug it into laptop plug in my HDMI cable and it works! My monitor is a little older too but the picture quality is good. This thing has made my WFH life much easier!
5,Bought the Adapter Converter to turn my “Old” television into my mega monitor for work…working from home has its challenges…being able to view everything all at once is nice…I was using 2 monitors…it was nice…this is something to get used to…however…it is working out pretty good so far😁😁😁
4,I believe this item would probably be fine for laptops but not so much for a desktop PC tower. The screws that are meant to secure the item to the VGA output are simply not long enough to do their job. With the unit plugged in the screws just spin and spin. The result at least in my case was that the unit sort of *hung* on the back of the tower instead of sticking straight out perpendicular to the back of the PC tower. I presume that affected the quality of the connection of some of the pins. The only image on the monitor was the PC's company logo in black and white at startup but that was it. The screen was simply black after that. I believe that was because the PC lacked a secure connection to the monitor because it works quite well with a VGA/DVI monitor.Other than that the device was easy to install and not terribly expensive. If there is something to stabilize the connection such as the table a laptoop is sitting on this would probably be perfect for getting a VGA output to display on a screen with HDMI input.
3,3 stars because this adapter probably works in some setups but not all and not the one I bought it for.Got a pair of old PCs from a garage sale for $20. One unit has an AMD2 mobo circa 2009 with Phenom 9150e. This CPU has integrated graphics and the mobo has VGA only. I got the splash screen to show once for about a second and then vanished. Numerous tries no dice. Popped in the old 4650 GPU I've held on to since 2009 used the same HDMI cable without the adapter and the setup worked like a champ.
2,I have bought 3 of these and only one worked right. One lasted a month and then the image was very red. Bought another to replace the first but it was dead out of the box. Got a replacement for the dud and it works for now.Not a very good average.
5,It does what is intended to do. Pretty simple really. The one thing about it is it sometimes takes a minute to power up if you are using it with an old computer and using the USB to power it right on the computer itself. Not unexpected really with that but it is a thing to be aware of. That said it works very well overall and glad I have it when I need it.
5,This cable does one job and it does it very well. When you only have a VGA connector on the back of your PC and you need to drive an HDMI monitor and/or tv this is exactly what you need. I first bought a straight VGA to HDMI cable and that WILL NOT WORK in this scenario. Since the VGA is passive and HDMI is active a cable such as that will only go DVI to VGA which is definitely not the scenario I needed to resolve. The product arrived quickly setup is obvious and requires no instruction. It worked immediately at the full resolution of the monitor. I purchased 4 total and I would not hesitate to purchase another.
5,This is a very specific device that truthfully if it didn’t exist I would be in a ton of trouble. But it’s such a specific product that it only has one purpose. The fact it takes up an additional port for power isn’t my favorite. But I’m grateful to have it.
5,I bought this adapter cable because I sometimes need to connect my laptop to a TV in order to do presentations to a group of people.I have only one video port on my laptop - a VGA port.  Therefore I was concerned that the video quality wouldn't be very good with this adapter since it would be "up-converting" from VGA to HDMI.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the video quality is excellent on the TV.  The sound quality coming from the TV is also excellent - the adapter does an excellent job of combining separate audio and visual inputs into one HDMI video output.I believe the key is that there is a USB cable which powers the adapter allowing it to do an excellent job.The only negative I would add to this is that the audio and USB cables are thin; they don't look very strong or durable.  But I am careful when I connect and disconnect them and the laptop and TV are still all the time I am using them - nothing moves around.  So I don't expect to have any problems for a long time to come.This was well worth the few dollars I paid for it.
5,This is a nice device for connecting older computers to newer TVs that only have HDMI input. Once nice feature is that audio as well as video can be output to TV. As described this conversion hardware takes VGA output (plugs directly into VGA port of computer) and standard stereo output (from motherboard or sound card jack separate cable included) and outputs HDMI. A separate HDMI cable is required (not included) to go from the output of this device to the TV or monitor.
5,You probably won't need this review but I wanted to compare which adaptor will work best for my 2K monitor Samung SD850 32". Given that all adaptors out there support only up to 1980p I had no choice but to try all the VGA-HDMI adaptors and compare them to see which one would scale well for a 2k monitor.Surprisingly this product (Foinnex) did the job despite being the cheapest one. Of course it's a little blurry but it gave me a good result. See pictures. The oher ones only gave me a square image in the middle of the screen.As a note the other adaptor that gave me a similar good result was the Insignia from best buy however this costed me 34$.So I'm very happy with this 10$ purchase.I compared:Onten - failedWonlyus - failedFoinnex - workedInsignia - worked
5,The connector to the computer could be a tiny bit longer. It works great but will back out of the vga connector on computer and cause an interesting picture on tv. It does have the screws but my computer doesn’t have any place to screw them into for a secure connection.
5,Great design and flexibility to handle came in real handy when you need to extend your equipment
4,I have received a replacement and used it for about an hour and it seemed to work fine with no issues. I raised my rating from two star to four star knocking off one star for manufacturers insufficient quality control since others had the same or similar problems and having to do a return. My original review follows. As of now I am giving a two star rating because mine arrived defective it does however have price and size going for it. I will change my rating depending on how the exchange for another one goes hopefully it will be good. As in other reviews mine had no sound and had red pixilation especially on dark backgrounds. I thought it had died because after I tried a reboot a message appeared on the TV that said device not supported tried a small TV and got the same message. I finally noticed the resolution on the laptop had changed reset it back and had picture again but still no sound tried other HDMI cables and audio cables with no effect to sound. I also tried a USB power supply in case the laptop was not putting out enough power no change. Will wait and see what happens with replacement.
4,The only thing is a little bulky but I have a little room to spare so that wasn’t a problem. Overall works good and great value.
3,I bought this cable to use with a KVM switch switching to monitors between four different computers. The KVM switch only excepts HDMI inputs and outputs but my computer has only one HDMI output. The other output from my computer is VGA hence the need for a VGA to HDMI cable. The cable works fine when I connect it directly from my computer to a monitor but when I try to go through the KVM switch it doesn’t work.  I had to buy a more expensive VGA to HDMI conversion module and that works fine.
3,This adapter works well for the listed resolutions.  The biggest problem I had with my old computer is that it would not show 720x480 text mode or even 320x200 graphics modes on my 4k monitor.  Those low resolution modes which are not explicitly supported are rendered in HDMI as 640x416 70hz.  My other screen is very tolerant and will display that resolution albeit with a wavy image quality.To summarize this is great for those looking to use Windows who will never go into their text-mode bios.  For those who want to use this for their old PC and use DOS programs or be able to access their BIOS or command prompt... forget it.  It will only work if your screen will attempt to render odd resolutions.
5,I was hoping to get around an issue with ubuntu when no sound coming through hdmi. This didnt solve the issue but picture was good and it works as described. I had to unplug sound then re-plug after boot up to get sound. So OS issue not a product issue.
5,This is a great product but the buyer needs to understand one issue: it won't produce 1920X1080 unless the computer hardware/software can produce it in VGA.This is "plug and play" no software needed. I tested various motherboards under Linux and had 100% success with this device.The photo illustrates using a 2010 Jetway motherboard with a 1.5GHz processor and 512 megabytes of RAM The output resolution was a sharp 1920X1080 running Debian 7.The second photo is a screenshot from a video I recorded from the old Jetway board recoded though a USB 3 HD capture box shown in photo 3. I got that off Amazon.I also used this on a  a S3 AGP video card operating in a Compaq Pentium III 550mHz built in 1999. It worked well producing a 1280X1024 output. There was a little corner problem but nothing major.
2,This worked for the HDMI- but would buzz sometimes on my screen- also never got the audio to work through the aux on this thing- tried multiple methods
3,While this adapter does work with my Visio TV It does not work with the HDMI selector in my entertainment system nor in another TV that I tried.  Apparently it does not meet all of the HDMI specs.This is the second adapter that I tried; the first one died after a few weeks.  I will say that the exchange at Amazon was painless.
5,This converter was a great find and saved a lot of additional back breaking work.  At my church our old projector finally died and we purchased a new HD 1080P projector with display port and HDMI inputs.  Our old one as well as cameras and the rest of our system are still standard definition.  We will eventually be upgrading to HD a few pieces at a time (we don't have a big budget to work with).  The reason this was a lifesaver is because our projector is mounted about 30 feet up and we use a little giant ladder to reach the projector that weighs over 100 lbs and takes 4 people to get into place and take down.  We were currently using VGA extenders over cat 5e cable back to a Kramer Presentation switcher/scaler.  We didn't want to have to go through this with the ladder again in a few more months as we slowly upgrade the equipment to HD.  I purchased HDMI extenders over Ethernet to put in place for the future upgrades.  They worked great at least the third set purchased so I needed a VGA to HDMI adapter to come off the Kramer VGA output.  Tried a couple of others that didn't work until I found this one.  It works great and of course everything looks better with the new HD projector.  If you are wondering how well it works we are projecting on a 180' diagonal screen with no noticeable artifacts.  So when we upgrade the switcher and other components we just have to remove the VGA to HDMI Adapter.  No backbreaking ladder work!
5,I bought this initially to convert the VGA signal from my old computers to my HDMI capture card before switching to a different solution. It did not add any lag to the signal. Even though I do not use it anymore for capturing footage from my old computers I will keep it in my collection of cables whenever I may need to connect an old computer to a modern display.
5,Works as advertised.  No Issues
5,Being new to some of the newest electronics  I did not know what that meant.  I really needed a RCA to HDMI port instead and assumed this would work both ways.  Not your fault but the return place is too far away to make it worth my while.  So I kept it.  Thank you for listening.
5,They should say that you have to all the cables to make it work. I tried to use it without the little USB cable and it would not work. Was about to send it back then I tried it with the USB cable and it works.
5,My legacy computer gets hung up on the blank bios screen and the VGA to HDMI adapter does not start to work until Windows XP begins to load. I think it is just a dead motherboard backup battery but after that it worked great.  I was able to quit the "invisible" BIOS screen by entering ESC > ENTER> ENTER to procced to Window boot-up. I'm going to buy a new battery to see if it corrects the problem.
4,I would give this a 5 for getting new life out of an old Video card except for the USB power connector.  Being on the side it ran up against the other monitor port on the card. I think a better design would be to put it in a way to face out or even a tail for a tight fit.That said it works great and for the price it was great to be able to get a second new monitor to work with the old card.
5,When my wife wanted to use her large flat-screen monitor with her older laptop computer she couldn't make the connection.  Her large-screen monitor had only an HDMI input while her laptop computer had the older conventional analog "D" shaped video connector.  This adapter allowed us to resolve that connection challenge.Without having to install any additional software or drivers bridging that connection with this adapter involved just plugging it into her computer's video output attaching the adapter's USB cable and then using her existing HDMI cable between this adapter and her flat-screen monitor.  A 1/8" stereo audio cable was included to add sound for monitor or TV with a speaker but she did not need that connection.Her video clarity and resolution on her large-screen monitor is the same high resolution as the screen of her laptop computer's screen but much easier to see.  A connection challenge was solved with this relatively inexpensive simple-to-install device.
4,First one worked as advertised so bought a second for another computer works just as well. Some computers might require a longer audio cable depending on location of socket on computer.  Wasn't available locally
4,It works perfectly. (Hooking PC to big screen for streaming events online.) However the wire strand count must be very low it kinks when coiling it up to put it away. Very hard to straighten when using it again. (Compare a decent extension cord to a wire clothes hangar.) That is what I mean. It stays bent when bent. In retrospect I probably would have bought a better one or returned this one. But if you are not pulling it out every weekend for events it is a great product.
5,This product worked when I tried other brands that didn’t
5,Bought this for my wife's older laptop computer that didn't have HDMI output.  Tried one of the USB to HDMI converters but the video was choppy and laggy.  Realized the computer had an external VGA monitor output so I thought I would try this item.  Easy hookup.  Basically plug and play no drivers required.  Came with all the necessary cables except you will have to provide your own HDMI cable which I connected to my HDTV.  Works great so far.
4,It helped me connect my Linux OS (which is on an oldish MacBook Pro) to a projector or external monitor.
5,I was looking for a vga-hdmi adapter and this was pretty much all I could find. In addition to needing to translate the signal I wanted something that wouldn't slow performance. This device meets the bill.The dongle is VERY easy to setup at least on my laptop: plug the female vga connector into the male vga port on the back of the laptop connect the power line to one USB port and use the small jack for audio. I've had no problems whatsoever with performance and the picture is crystal-clear. For the price this provided the solution I was looking for as far as using incompatible equipment and making them work together.
5,Works very well when using a GBS8200 (modified with GBS Control) because most LCDs now no longer use a VGA port.The application I used this for was installing an LCD on an arcade racing machine Motocross Go running on the custom Namco System 23.
5,The AV Access HDEX80-KVM HDMI Extender works great. I initially had a little trouble using it in conjunction with a VGA to HDMI converter.  Both my VGA/HDMI converter and the HDMI extender worked fine independently but not when I used the VGA converter as input to the HDMI extender.  Ryan at AV Access tech support figured out that the quality of VGA converter I was using was the problem.  I purchased an AV Access VGA/HDMI converter and now everything works the way it should.  Great product – good price.
2,I picked up this item with the hopes of converting an HDMI port on the back of my TV (monitor) to HDMI so that I could run a video game console through it.  After several attempts I could not get it to work.  I was unsure if this item would work prior to purchasing it so I submitted a question to Amazon for help.  The answers were all over the place and did not provide me with a clear cut answer for determining whether or not this item would work with my set-up.  As I write this review I can't help but notice that there is now a picture on the website of the adapter being plugged into the back of an "old" computer so that a more modern HDMI monitor can be ran through it.  I have a hard time believing that I would have overlooked this upon my initial inspections but maybe I did.  It does offer a potential explanation on why I couldn't get it to work though (e.g. it would seem that I had it's use backwards for lack of a better term).  Either way the item doesn't work and now I need to determine if it's worth my effort to pursue the return process.
4,Hooked this up to my PC as directed. No signal at the Monitor. My HDMI cable was 40 ' so I figured this thing could not push that far. I decided to try keeping my old 40' VGA cable and setting this thing up at the monitor. Needed a F/F VGA Gender changer and a 1 foot HDMI cable. Presto it worked. Now I can use the HDMI input of my monitor.
2,This is the third time I've bought this exact same cable. My advice about this is: Don't buy it for an "upfront fix" for an issue. You will have to work with it to get it to work (from having bought THREE of them).  To be fair making a new monitor [HDMI} work with old technology [VGA] is a tough thing to do. That is why there are lots of cables that work the OTHER WAY (HDMI to VGA) and this is one of the few that go the way I needed (VGA to HDMI).  The bottom line on this third purchase is the first one I bought several years ago worked straight away. The second one I had to figure out a way to get it to eventually do a great job--like the first one. Ten years away from the first try? I couldn't get the computer and the monitor to cooperate. The manufacturing processes have diverged too much it seems. So... when it works it does a great job; when it doesn't you are out of luck.
5,Note! This is a VGA to HDMI converter! Meaning it will take a VGA signal (say from a computer) and turn it into HDMI. It will not work the other direction. HDMI allows for signal to travel both directions but VGA does not. Very important so you don't purchase the wrong adapter!That being said this is exactly what I was looking for! This allowed me to connect my computer's output display to the input port on my Skyzone 04X FPV googles. Flights sims on goggles!
3,I was hoping to get this working for my 386 on a fairly modern Dell monitor but I found that there were a lot of problems with it that made it a bad choice for my needs. The biggest problem was that it experienced some noticeable ghosting especially when shifting between different resolution sizes. On a DOS command prompt it looked rough for example.Another problem was that the overlay on the monitor was quite a bit off leading to some noticeable cutoff that I was not able to do much with.It did the job and was easy to install but I found it a struggle to stick with alas.
3,I just had this one day and I couldn't figure out how to get the audio to work.  I was looking at the schematic they provided online and I noticed the audio jack on the adaptor is "audio in".  So I connected my green audio female on the back of my old pc to the adaptor and I had sound coming out of my TV.  I suppose I was thrown off by people talking about the red and white Y they received which I didn't.  That 3.5mm jack would have had to be an out for that to work and of course that is not possible.  Anyway it works fine so far.  Just be aware that the audio jack on the adaptor is "audio in" not "audio out".  I believe this is the one you need to buy if you have the 3.5mm green line out on your old PC.  There are other old PCs that have a USB audio out apparently.  And they make these adaptors with a USB instead of a 3.5mm.  I don't think those adaptors will work for you although I couldn't get a definitive answer on that.  I didn't know if the usb audio selection wasn't available on my windows sound tab because I didn't have it plugged in or because it doesn't exist.  Probably the latter.  FYI Also someone commented that the USB plug doubles for sound and power.  So if you want to use different speakers you won't be able to cause you have to plug the usb in to power the adaptor.
4,Exactly what I needed to get VGA-out on PC to hook into HDMI-in on TV in order to use a form factor as a game emulator for the kids. Folks having issues be sure the plug the USB cable into a port on your PC. The VGA plug has a small converter board inside it that needs to get powered to do its job. I'm taking 1 star off b/c I've had to mess around with the TV settings to get it to display correctly. The PC can do all kinds of resolutions but I had to set our TV display to "best fit" instead of "16:9" to get it to fit the screen properly otherwise edges were clipped off. I've hooked the PC directly to other TVs using a VGA-to-VGA cable (b/c those TV's had VGA ports) and the screens fit perfectly without messing with them. So I have to think the analog to digital converter board in this adapter is maybe doing something to make it a bit odd in screen-fitting. But I was able to work-around the issue and all is good.
4,Works good right out of the package. USB power connector and sound jack will easily cross to other side of laptop if your USB ports are so situated. I will purchase a 4 port usb hub to increase the number of usb devices I can connect. I thought i had ordered a 15' cable but I received  6 footer which is too short for my purposes. I will have to order a longer cable and return this one. Other than that I expect that the longer cable should work out well....
4,Does what it's supposed to except tightening the screw heads is a bit difficult since it is right next to the connection.
4,It works that enough for me
5,I was very curious about this as i tried other vga to hdmi adaptors before but ive never tried one like this it worked right away out the box from my old dell pc tower to a new hd tv im running windows xp and the picture isnt crystal clear but its not bad either but what do you expect from old pc tower graphics its definetly worth it to see on a new tv
4,If you're laptop has its headphone jack right next to the VGA hook-up you should seriously consider buying (or finding if you have one already) an L-adapter so that the headphone plug doesn't obstruct this adapter/converter in any way.I got a good two months usage out of it until the USB connector cable (which MUST be connected to the laptop because it's really short or you must replace it with a longer one you can plug anywhere else) loosened and ultimately tore from its place. Now it seems no USB connector is making contact and I've ordered a replacement.
5,I was just about to return this converter because about every 1 to 2 minutes I would get a "No signal" message on my screen. It would go away briefly if I jiggled the converter but then came right back. Then I read in these reviews about someone with a similar problem who fixed it by just lowering the resolution.  I did lower my resolution but I also changed out my HDMI cable to a higher quality cable at the same time.  I'm not sure which of those two actions solved the problem but now I have sharp and consistent video and I'm quite happy.  It's only been a week since I did that but so far so good.
5,I had  this overnighted for use with a new Dell PowerEdge r720 server that I was afraid was failing out of the box. The PowerEdge series are notorious for failing to convert the VGA output to anything else without the right adapter. When this adapter came in I plugged it in and the image showed up on my HDMI screen something that 2 other adapters failed to do for me.The shipping was quick and prompt and the cable was in excellent shape.The video quality has some lines that show up when the server first turns on. It appears to be an artifact of the injected power interfering with the signal.
5,No problems  perfect picture
4,I try to use this product to connect my DVD player with the new 4K Smart TV but the plug does not fit my TV I have to return the item. Instead I purchased something else that fits. It's not the fault of this product and since I could not use it on my new 4K TV I can't tell the picture quality but the whole purchasing & returning experience had been wonderful and pain free.
2,Lose connections the picture goes in and out if the cables get bumped.
5,Encontre justo lo que buscaba no me arrepiento de esta compra se los recomiendo
4,No tiene hdmi y no aprieta tan fácil esos tornillos no tienen cabeza ni forma para apretar
5,Bought this to watch videos from my computer. easy to hook up. Gave it 4 stars because picture is slightly degraded. Improve this & you have a winner.
5,The fact that I can use it on my Dell AIO that allows me to switch to external monitor. Great for Mac tech's. Saves space.
5,This adapter works... but be careful because originally I ordered it and I ordered the wrong direction by how it was worded in the title. Amazon return was easy as pie So I had the correct replacement within 2 days. You have to look at the diagrams of how they say the flow chart is before ordering. The only thing I would add here is that it could possibly be made to be a little larger than what it is only because it seems kind of fragile and the connections on it are very close together. But it works just fine for what is intended and well worth the price I paid for it.  Good product!
3,I will give my honest review about this product.***** it quality is perfect.*****1) I order Amazon 2 prime. It shipped me the wrong items. I contacted the seller. I ended up have rapid replace but there still missing USB cable and I still missed my dateline for a project. I am sicked tire to contact or return since I need this for my project.2) I was struggling to get the dongle working. IT does not send signal from VGA to HDMI w/o power. I ended up have to  find out the device need micro USB to power up the device. I have to look for my old micro USB cable to plug in from the PC USB to the device. After plug in the power there is single send from the VGA to HDMI.3) When you plug in to PC you have to skew two skews to make it tight but it is hard to skew in dues to tightly space available. Should have make longer.Lastly I hope other customer don't have to suffer and waste of their time like I do.
5,very happy easy to connect only thing is i did not get the extra bonus (Extra Bonus: 3.5mm minijack Audio Cable and Micro USB Cable. The USB cable must be connected to a 5V 2A computer USB port or a 5V1A power adapter. Audio output: 3.5 mm AUX audio .)  maybe cuz it was a resale item i bought ....good thing i had an extra audio minijack of my own ....otherwise good buyvery delicate handle with extreme care ..i cracked the outer case still works though i need to buy it again soonupdate bought two more and still work great 2021
5,Works great exactly as expected. I'm happy.
5,Very helpfull
4,It’s a little bulky with all of the wires but it does what I need it to do - audio and visuals are great
3,Hi so let me start off by saying I bought this in the begging of January and it stopped working after 20ish days. I returned it because it stopped displaying from my pc onto my tv and i tried unplugging all its wires and plugging it back but it wouldn't work and they didn't give my refund until 4 weeks later... But the day I returned it I wanted to give them another try maybe it was just a faulty device. So I ordered another one.. but that only worked for a week until it also started giving me the same problem but luckily this one displays back on when i unplug the power cable then plug it in again. This is always happening when my pc goes to sleep mode when i leave it. Its definitely not a pc problem because i have a vga cable that works on my old tv that i have tried and everything works flawlessly when i use that.
4,This converter works very well.  The picture is clean and clear.  The reason for four stars is the device get hot very quickly.  I have only used for about ten minutes in testing and found it to be very hot.  I'm hoping it will not burn out because of the heat.  Only time will tell but for the money its a good deal.
3,While this product does its job at converting the signal I discovered it is a bit finicky. I got this to convert the Sega Dreamcast to Hdmi.In my experience I first got lines across my image almost like scan lines but I fixed it by unplugging the device and plugging it back in. This solves the problem but it still occurs occasionally at first start up.As for image quality it's far below what it would be if the TV natively supported it. This is from converting analog to digital. It's possible with a much more expensive box the image quality could be improved.But if you're looking for a cheap solution this does work.
4,I have an old PC that I had stuff on it. I had newer monitor so I had to find a way to connect my old PC to the newer monitor. This worked great. It was a life saver for me because I got all my old stuff off my old PC. The cable was not very expensive and good to have around to finally clean up all my old PCs in the basement.
5,This does a fantastic job of doing just what's supposed to. I got the 1st one to use to connect an older laptop to a projector. It worked so good when I had another issue getting a monitor hooked up the first thing that popped into my head was that I needed another one.  Highly recommended
5,Just plug and play.Not flimsy like others Ive bought
5,Compact works well good price!
4,I purchased this so I could use my Roku stick. It did not work so I have an adapter that I may or may not use for something else.
4,This VGA to HDMI adapter works great as I installed it on an old Vista PC which I use to watch you tubes on my flat screen.  My old flat screen died which had a VGA port.  My replacement flat screen has only HDMI input ports.  This adapter is the solution.My major complaint is that FOINNEX gave no instructions that the HDMI portion of the adapter was USB powered.  So I hooked it into 2 computers and monitor setups with 2 different HDMI cables without success.  One PC is in hard to work with location.Then I figured it out and it was a quick fix.FOINNEX needs to point this out for new users.I'm glad that I have a solution - so I can get my news from you tubes etc.instead of TV networks
5,Very pleased - computer did not have hdmi port (only vga) and I wanted to use a 43 in hd tv as a monitor - hooked it up and I now have a 43 inch high definition monitor and at price that fit my needs.
5,Just what I was looking for. Works perfectly. Thank you.
5,I really should wait to post a review to make sure this item stays working but at the moment I'm so pleased going with hopefulness.  Got this to connect my ancient laptop without DVI or HDMI ports to a much newer TV HDMI port.  Primary reason was  to be able to watch YouTube on the much larger screen.  Have a Roku box with a YouTube channel but hasn't been working well for over a year and customer service at Roku no use.Keep saying they'll fix it.  Once I connected the laptop to the TV got full movie on youtube -- and also anything else I tried on laptop screen.There is even a link from the old fashioned headset input that also transmits sound. There is no need as with some of the other adapters on Amazon to buy a separate HDMI cable. If it stops working I'll come back and change review but for now for the price speed of mailing and quick answer to a question to customer service very happy with the product.
5,I used this to connect my HP Pavilion tower to a new 24” monitor with only an HDMI connection.  Plugged the VGA end to the tower and the audio cable to the speaker jack connected my HDMI cable to this VGA adapter and the monitor and everything worked fine. The sound quality is decent.
5,Fantastic tool to setup retro rigs on modern tech with included sound.
4,I bought this recently and I have started using it to connect my laptop to TV. I noticed that the device get hot very quickly.  Since it is close to the keyboard every time i accidentally touch the top of the unit and it's very hot. Not sure if others have noticed it but I am not sure if I have to return and get a new or it is like this.
4,Corporate laptop non corporate docking station not beomg fully functional and I wanted two bigger monitors but laptop only had one HDMI and one VGA plugs.  Forgot how bad VGA is!  Another problem the smaller TV I'm using as a monitor also has the issue of display being slightly larger than screen.  Not sure if it's a monitor (TV) or other issue.  Product works but guess over the years I've forgotten how bad VGA signals are.  It's functional for what it's being used for.
4,I bought an HDMI to HDMI cable to connect my Asus Ultrabook to my Sony 65 inch smart TV.  Could not get the laptop sound to work on the TV although picture was good.  So I bought this cable which connects to the monitor output and the earphone output on the Asus laptop (and is powered by a USB connector) and connects to any HDMI input on the Sony TV.  It worked right away with both sound and picture.  Just what I needed.
4,Plugged right in and worked great until my puppy ate one of the cords.
5,I bought an old refurbished computer that came with a very dirty and low quality monitor. I had an extra flat screen TV that I wanted to use but this old computer only had VGA ports. That’s where this converter came in. Worked like a dream. Pro tip: if you want the sound to come through your TV or other external monitor you must also plug in the attached 3.5mm (headphone/audio) jack.
4,works great
5,Picture and sound coming through just fine.
5,You can connect your Laptop or computer to ANY large flat screen TV (smart or not). Great quality. Tells the computer what resolution the screen is and you immediately have a great display of your computer on the TV.My only after thought is.  I might have wanted a longer cable for hard to reach connections however 90% of the time this is perfect.I'm presently using it for Conference Room Presentations connecting to wall monitors.Excellent unit.
4,When I bought it the literature online said this unit would do either 720p 1080p or 1080i.  It does not.  It only outputs 1080i and will not otherwise recognize the resolution of the device attached.  There is no way to manually change it.  So if you have a device that requires something other than 1080i this will not work.  As for the 1080i the output is clean and nice.  I can't use it because my device requires a 720p resolution.
5,I have an old computer that I upgraded with a new hard drive....which is lightening fast now.  Then decided to get a monitor with a larger screen which works well and also has sound which would replace some old speakers that weren’t working well.  But the old computer HDMI ports were too old to be usable for that.  So I got this VGA to HDMI cable....and voila!  It’s all working great and just as I had hoped!  Just FYI....I am an 81 y/o woman and I did this all by myself!
5,Hey it works! I was previously dumb enough to just buy a cable with HDMI on one side and VGA on the other which effectively does nothing. This adapter is required with a microchip and power supply to convert the signal. The only downside is it’s pretty bulky so if you have a tight fit for your electronics in a shelving unit it can be awkward to fit in. Otherwise works seamlessly.
4,I needed to install Linux on what is typically a headless server.The Dell server had only a VGA port and all monitors avail were HDMI only.I am able to get into the BIOS settings at boot time without issue (this being something another reviewer experienced problems with).The only potential downside might be the picture quality.Its not terrible by any means but if this my daily driver I would purchase a graphics card that natively supports a higher resolution monitor.Again for a server that will be headless post OS install I am happy enough with the adapter.
5,fast shipping works great exactly what came as described in post.used it for computer to tv great picture and sound
5,Almost exactly what I needed. Was really needing an adapter that would convert from DVI + Stereo sound to HDMI. But those adapters seem to be expensive so I went with this one hoping that I could use a DVI to VGA adapter and then connect this cable adapter to the VGA converter.This appears to be working almost 100%. Though I am getting a weird screen/video output scaling problem but that's probably due to using a 10+ year old HD TV along with a 10+ year old 8800GT video card.
5,Very easy to use and works as expected.
5,In order to hook up my new monitor I had to get a HDMI cord. It was very easy to just plug it in and it was done
4,This worked on 2 out of 3 TVs I tried it on. 1 of the TVs (the VIZIO one) the image was good but it did not transmit the sound. And I am honestly not sure if it was the TVs fault or this device's fault. Also it seems like there's a lot of wires floppin' around on the back of my computer after I use this but that is not the fault of the device and method it's just how it is - I suggest using twisty ties to bundle all the floppy cords up.
5,I like that it’s easy to use and it has a great picture
3,Recibi el producto luego de conectarlo la imagen parpadeaba despues de 5 segundos y cuando paso 1 minuto dejo de funcionar por completo.
5,Used to connect a second monitor with an hdmi connection to a laptop with a vga connection.
5,It worked as expected.  I bought it to connect a large screen TV in a different room to my computer.  So it did require about 30 feet of HDMI cable and that worked no problem.I had forgotten that VGA carries video only so the extra cable from the audio port is definitely necessary for sound.
5,Finally I can see my cameras on my TV set
5,great product great value
5,It did what I needed it to do.👍
4,I bought this so I could have a bigger screen on my laptop. The vga port is next to the usb ports on that side and the power cord blocks off one of them for the most part. For audio it uses an auxiliary cord plugged into the speaker of the laptop. That's on the other side of the computer. The cord it came with was too short.I've had it for a good 6 months now and it still works great. The power cord it came with started falling apart but that's just because of how it has to be in my computer
4,Easy to install
2,Worked marvelously at first but because I wasn't looking while plugging the USB back into the adaptor I ended up breaking the poorly done soldering on the USB connection in the device rendering it useless.
5,Made a huge difference to the picture on my monitor. Totally rid of ghosting and now a very sharp picture
5,Easy to install and included the USB connection for audio. So glad I found this particular cable.
5,Installation was simple and quick. The adapter sticks out a bit outside the PC case. Also you need align it with the VGA pins carefully to tighten the screws. Overall it’s a simple prices.
4,Good product but sucks to connect USB to give power to the device. It includes an extra cable to avoid losing the port.
5,As an engineer I gradually have more and more laptops in my hands. For a laptop that was purchased for more than 10 years my best way is to use it as a central device for watching tv shows and movies. Unfortunately old laptops usually do not have HDMI ports to project its screen onto a tv. This VGA to HDMI adapter definitely helps for this matter. I used this adapter for about a week and it works perfectly for my case. Good picture quality with 1080p or lower resources and normal sound output. So far I am pretty happy with my purchase and highly recommend this for others who may have the same use as mine.
5,My wife was wanting to do a genealogy class for 6 - 12 people from a laptop screen but didn't want everybody clustered around the little screen. I looked on amazon for a projector but the cost was prohibitive but I ran into this VGA to HDMI cable. For the price I felt it would be worth a try. WOW WAS I PLEASANTLY SUPPRISED.  It works great I hooked it up to a 55inch Vizio HDTV and the picture is crystal clear no distortion what so ever and so easy to hook up.  There is no installation to do you just plug the VGA end into the VGA port on the laptop or desk top and the HDMI into the HMI port on the TV Set the input button on the TV to your HDMI slot and it is up and running.  My wife now thinks I am a rocket scientist which is another big plus THANK YOU FOINNEX.
5,Perfect item for my application !!  Would definitly buy from this seller again when the need arises
4,This is a great device if you need an HDMI cord adapter. It has all the usability you could want in this kind of dongle. The only issue is is that the USB cord that comes with it is not replaceable. I bought 2 different Mini USB cords to replace the one that was damaged and neither cord worked. So if you damage the USB cord plan on buying another one or having amazon switch it out for you if it's within warranty.
5,This adapter is truly amazing! I was able to hook this adapter from laptop with VGA to my portable monitor with HDMI. It gave my portable monitor a 1080p output (that is the highest resolution that portable monitor can go up to). The only downside would be having to power this adapter with a USB but it's not quite a big deal for me! Highly recommended for those with older computers that are trying to use a 2nd monitor!
5,Simply put the adapter into your computers vga port attach your own hdmi cable turn on the TV and find the correct input. Voila...giant monitor!
4,This adapter works fine with a GBScontrol build.  The only complaint is that is gets pretty hot to the touch after only a few minutes of use.
5,Very easy to install.I used to connect a tv to my security cameras and picture is perfect!
5,I have had two TVs hooked up to my computer for a while with just an HDMI splitter so I could use either the smaller one for day to day use or the larger on to stream video on and see better across the room. I decided I wanted to be able to use both screens at the same time so I researched and found this product. I was hesitant that it would work as simply as described or that my computer would recognize it but it did right away. I have one HDMI cable in the HDMI slot to one TV and the other HDMI cable attached to this device in the monitor slot and my computer automatically recognized them both. I am very happy with this purchase and wish I'd done it years ago!
5,I have a great picture on my monitor
5,I had a NVR security camera controller that lost its HDMI output because of an electrical storm.  I was looking at replacing the NVR which meant having to individually resyncing my 5 cameras and reprogramming my smart phone with a new link.  Luckily the NVR had a separate VGA output and a USB port.  I plugged in this VGA to HDMI adapter connected the USB cable and reconnected my HDMI cable to the back of the adapter.  Everything works as it did before.  Saved me time and money.
5,This is exactly what I needed. I have an older computer that has a VGA output that I run to my TV. Bought a new tv that only has hdmi connections so I needed an adapter. Connection was simple plug vga end into computer audio jack into computer USB power source into computer then use your own hdmi cable to plug into your monitor/TV.This helped out a lot as my old setup i had to plug in external speakers with the audio jack built into the adapter it transfers everything through the hdmi cable.
5,I used this cable to connect my new desktop with my old Samsung all-in-one computer. The computer won't boot any longer but there was nothing wrong with the screen. I wanted to use it as a primary display on my new desktop because the screen quality is so much better than the old stand-alone monitor. This cable came extremely well packaged and protected and had end caps on both ends.  It fells well made and it was an easy one minute to plug in and it came right up as expected. Both display and sound are great! Very pleased.
5,ok first thing i am not puter stuff savvy lol. i bought this to connect my puter to a HDTV it is only a 1 way cable from the puter to the tv. you do have to plug in the USB but i didn't plug in the speaker wire do to an exsisting speakers(but my tv has speakers) it does come with a L/R y plug. i read the same crap postings about this and wondered if it would work. it works fine with no fading/blurness or lines as i type this i looked over my monitor/tv its sharp and crisp picture. so if i need to purchase another one i will buy another one. hope this helps  VGA to HDMI Adapter Cable 6 Feet (Old PC to New TV/Monitor with HDMI) FOINNEX VGA to HDMI converter Cable with Audio For Connecting Old PCLaptop with a VGA output to NEW MonitorHDTV ALL-IN-ONE
5,I’m currently using this to capture an arcade game outputting at 640x480 in combination with an HDMI capture card and it works incredibly well! There are some diagonal lines that move across the output image though but they’re not extremely noticeable unless the image is relatively static and/or dark.The best thing about this device is that it does not stretch a 4:3 image into a 16:9 image in its output. It will keep the original aspect ratio in the converted signal.
3,Better than not having it. The picture is noticably fuzzier than the monitors going direct into display port / HDMI. Also the picture is slightly shifted to the right about 5 mm and it's noticeable. I can't adjust it back to center because my monitor doesn't support such controls.Gets the job done enough that I don't feel like spending more money on other products to risk similar or worse outcomes.
1,I bought this item to convert vga to hdmi. It’s came with external power option but whatever I tried it wouldn’t read a signal on my projector. I don’t know if the item is defective or not but I will just try with with another alternate.
3,Ordered two. One worked one did not.  The working unit works great!  The other one just sat dead no picture.
5,Works on my 2013 HP laptop outputs 1080p.
5,I used it to connect the VGA port of my laptop to an HDMI port on a remote TV. Now because I have an app that allows me to stream my TV remotely to my laptop I can watch most of the channels I paid for at home remotely for free on any TV that has an HDMI port.
5,My older laptop doesn't ave an HDMI output so I bought this adapter to be able to connect to my LCD TV. This adapter works like a charm. No external power supply is needed. The power comes through a USB port. Audio comes through the computer headphone jack. Computer VGA output to HDMI is flawless with crisp full screen displays. I couldn't be more satisfied with the way this is working. My old laptop has extended life to present slide shows for pictures Powerpoint presentations as well as using it for web surfing demonstrations. I can take my old machine on the road while leaving my $$$$ machine at home and have HDMI utility for professional presentations. Using my old machine gives me an "air gap" when accessing outside networks separating my main machine from potential infections.Five stars from a happy customer.
3,funcional but definately NOT well designed!If you will want to send the audio output through the HDMI output the USB plugs in on the side of the adapter-other output connectors may interfere or prevent this connection.The screws to secure the adaptor to the VGA output are almost impossible to connect unless you stopped growing @ ~8yrs or have an 8yr old @ home.They DO have screw slots in them but the body of the HDMI output makes that impossible to access!
5,This item worked great.  I was finally able to upgrade my ten year old television which connected my old ADT cameras / ADT4HS2 DVR via VGA input.  As newer televisions no longer have this input I used this with a SVGA connector to get the cameras back up.
4,This adapter works great with the normal resolution settings. 4 stars only because the audio input channels (left and right) are reversed making it a pain.
5,The unit arrived with a bent audio connector but one email to service and a new one is on the way.  That's good service!  The quality of the video is perfect and it can't be easier to use.  Just plug it into your computer's VGA output set your computer to send video to that output and plug the other end of the adapter into an HDMI monitor or TV.  You do need a USB port to power it up or an external USB power plug.  I recommend this device.  Also very small and takes up little room in your laptop case.
5,Got an old device that only has a VGA output?  This is the adapter you want.  Picture looks great I don't notice any noise or other signal degradation.
4,My only complaint is it sticks out the back of the computer a couple inches and if your VGA port is vertical close to the bottom of the device you may not have room to plug in the power on the side.
5,Works exactly like it should!
3,The cable worked with my Dell monitor but not with the TV.  Could not find any settings that I could change to make it work.  I contacted the sender and followed their instructions but to no avail.  Windows 10 could not detect the TV through the cable.  The sender thought the TV might not be compatible so I returned the VGA to HDMI cable.
5,works as described
4,It worked perfectly for me and allowed me to use a device with an old style vga connector on a new monitor.  I don’t use it extensively so I can’t comment much about quality.  Also it is a bit large and gets plugged into the vga so I can imagine some circumstances where it may be a tight fit.  For me though... it was perfect.
5,Does what it's supposed to do.
5,I hooked this up to my old Windows Vista system to use it to run scheduling for my small office. I researched it well and have had no issues as I read the instructions about it NOT working 2-way. So I was aware it would not go from HDMI back to a computer but only from the computer out to an HDMI input. Since I was only using it as a large monitor I was fairly certain that it would work for me and it has performed perfectly. I have the 40" flat screen TV mounted on the wall so there is no problem seeing it. It gives us a beautiful display and we can watch TV from Direct TV Now on it as well.I will definitely recommend this item.
4,The connection is perfect works exactly as I thought it would. But the only thing was that the picture quality was noticeably less clear. Definitely not 1080p. But still good connection and very stable.
4,Needed to connect an old laptop w VGA connector to a big screen TV to watch pictures and videos.  This worked well does need a USB port to plug into for power so make sure there is an extra USB port available.  Didn't think I'd use the audio cable but plugged it into the headset jack on the laptop and the sound did come out of the TV speakers.  So for the price seems like a good deal for this kind of setup.
5,Works As intended. Went through a few to find one that actually works.  Pc vga to my hdmi flat screen.  This is the one to get.
5,easy setup on a win-7 computer with no HDMI output.  Picture is fine to excellent on a hi def TV (32 inch) over my deskthat.  Like m0st modern YV it only has HDM inputs.  If used with a laptop you can use the TV as a second large  monitor  as needed.  very handy for pictures and movies.  My main computer has two VGA outputs one is now hooked to the HDMI TV and lets view and write text without looking for my glasses.The 5 foot HDMI cable with this adapter is long enough for most applicants.
5,Works. Problem is windows doesn't understand it's a tv so you'll have resolution problems unless your flat screen has vga resolutions. Overall works great. Built a cheap and I mean cheap PC to play borderlands and such runs up to vermintide and some fairly new games but it's so bad ha. My old PC is outdated and still is pushing everything up to Nier and Doom but those had poor optimization. Can't beat replaying older games at ultra but this does the trick until I think hey that is a good price for tech that was 2k last year. Now it's 400. Already happened but well maybe another year cheap lol. Got a working PC killing stuff with my wife and it works on the old 720p tv that's probably worth 30 bucks. Good stuff.
5,I plugged this into my older version of the Lenovo ThinkPad and it was very easy to set up and connect to my ASUS monitor. It doesn't negatively affect the picture quality at all. I'm hoping it lasts until i am able to buy a PC.
5,Good device for older laptops with no HDMI connection
5,After trying a lot of different adapters I am very happy to find this product - Foinnex VGA to HDMI cable.I have connected my old laptop to a new big screen TV by using this product. After connecting the VGA Audio and USB on my laptop the TV gets the signal through the HDMI port easily and the display is stable and clear. It makes my old laptop useful I can watch a variety of videos and flash through the TV.I tried to use it on a desktop computer as well. I try to connect the PC and monitor and it works.There is also a free minijack to RCA adapter in the bag which is very useful for some DVDs I think.All in all I would like to recommend this product to my friends :)
1,The unit that I was sent has poor image quality.  Everything is a little blurry no matter what I set the input resolution to.Figuring it was just this unit I am sending it back for replacement.
3,When I first plugged it in everything was fine and I was happy with the unit.  What I found over time is that it gets out of sync after a week or so.  Menu task bar and desktop icons are gone.  Can't get them back have to ctrl+alt+del to force reboot to get everything working again.  On one hand a reboot every week isn't terrible but when I have unsaved items open...it becomes painful.
5,We use this converter to output the video and audio from a laptop's vga output to a television hdmi input.  The converter has a connection for audio from the laptop and uses a usb cable that we connect to the laptop to supply power the converter.  The resulting audio and video quality on the television is very good with no noticeable noise issues introduced by the converter.
4,I enjoyed that it was simple to use. the only draw back is that you lose a USB slot to power it up. If it wasnt for that i would have given it 5 stars
4,This is a must have for those who have an older computer and would like to connect it to a tv via HDMI. I didn't give it 5 stars because it does get a little hot after long term use. And I don't know how long it will work regarding future use but for now I am a satisfied customer
2,This is probably fine for some applications but the image had too much distortion. This is probably fine for an industrial machine interface but not for a home/work computer. One input device I own wouldn't even acknowledge the HDMI signal at all.
5,Finally I can add my 2nd monitor.  My HDMI port does not work and the USB to HDMI connectors only work sometimes.  This one you just plug it in and its done.  Has a power feed you plug into a USB and a wire you can connect another speaker to.  Very clear instructions also about how it work.  Made my day!
2,I have audio issues that the customer service people could not understand. The left and right channels are transposed 5 emails later they claim they have no issues. Finally I gave up and Jimmyridged it by getting a male to male 3.5mm stereo cord cutting it and connecting yellow out to green and green out to yellow in.
3,I didn’t need this after all
5,Very well constructed . not cheaply made like others . Would buy from this seller again.
5,I recently bought a refurbished computer tower that had no HDMI outlets and I was using my tv as a computer monitor. .  Using a  USB to HDMI adapter worked well but whenever anything required administrator level access i got a blank screen which  required switching to a  VGA cord to resolve the problem.. I would have just used the VGA outlets but the picture quality was really bad.  The VGA to HDMI adapter proved to be a perfect fix. I was able to have HDMI quality graphics without having to use a VGA cord for anything. Overall I was very satisfied with this product.
5,Purchased this to replace a VGA to HDMI converter box that I had for several years.  This device is much easier to use and takes up a lot less space than the converter box did.  It was very easy to set up; one note:  a power cord comes with it but you will need a standard USB power adapter to plug the cord into.  The picture was very sharp and I was pleased with this purchase.  I do not use the sound cord so I can't comment on how well it works.
5,I wanted to use my tv as my monitor and it was very easy to plug and install
5,I had to go back to using VGA CARD ON COMPUTER MY TV  ALL HDMI INPUTS I NEED THIS ADAPTER.
5,Works as described no complaints. Should’ve read the specs beforehand as this is my 2nd one. My fault though. Overall great product!
5,The product description was very clear that this device converts a VGA signal into an HDMI signal. The graphics outlined how the device could/should be used and how it could not be used. Extremely helpful to ensure I bought the correct device for my needs.It works as advertised and even works in a KVM environment.Shipping was quick. The entire transaction and product were as I would expect.
5,Easy setup solid device.  Includes short USB cable for power that you can plug into a USB right near the VGA and on my laptop that provided enough power no wall adapter was needed.  Keep in mind that it is for VGA TO HDMI so if you hear it didn't work consider that the person may have tried it in reverse which wouldn't work.  Also note that it does not include the actual HDMI cable so you have to have that or order separately.  It does include an audio cable that might be useful with some setups.  It's small which is great for just tucking it into the laptop case for travelling.  Solved my problem of old computer to new monitor within minutes.
5,Great little gadget to allow connecting old Windows based test equipment to a new monitor. Worked just fine.
5,Hooked this guy up to an Asus VG248QE from an old Supermicro motherboard that only had VGA output on it. Does what it saysDon't forget to connect the USB cable to one of your ports otherwise the thing won't work.
5,This VGA to HDMI is perfect and totally solved the problem of an older computer being able to use my tv as a monitor. I highly suggest that you read the small print when ordering a cable of this type. Many only send data one way. In this case it is strictly sending from the VGA to the HDMI. Thankfully that was included in the description of this cord.
5,Ive tried others that just did not work but this one does....sound and picture quality is out standing....great product!
5,Thank you for providing a product that I wanted and needed. Anybody like me with an older laptop that only has a VGA output that wants to connect to a monitor with an HDMI input needs this product. Best bang for the buck.
5,Needed it to connect a video surveillance system to a large screen TV.  Seems I have a couple that go from HDMI to VGA.  But you need a special one to go the other direction from VGA to HDMI.  This one does that.  The only thing I don't really care for is that it requires a 5 volt powersupply not included to power it with a micro cable.  But like I say it works.  Provided that it does not fail anytime in the near future it is worth it's price.
5,I needed this for a slideshow at a celebration of life for a deceased relative. The only laptop available to display the video was VGA outThis worked perfectly and I had no complaints about the picture or sound.Also the laptop vents are right next to the VGA port which mean this dongle spent 3 hours at ~70c and it didn't skip a beat. I suppose the next step would be to set it on fire and see if it still works after that but I don't know if/when it might come in handy again so I'll leave that up to someone else.
4,Product works well.  Just note that you will need to power it if not by the PC's USB plug.... a wall outlet.
5,I have a 17 inch Toshiba laptop.  The thing doesn't have an HDMI port.  I also have an Elements TV that is not a smart TV.  Wanted to stream Comcast Xfinity but there is no app for it on the Amazon Fire Stick.  So I purchased this to hook my laptop up to the television.  Comcast wants to try and charge $60 just to hook a simple box up.  Not happening.  So this works!  I can stream it from my laptop AND the sound is resonating from my TV.  It still plays through the laptop too and if my TV isn't up loud enough I can hear it through my laptop.  This cord works and was easy to connect.
5,easy connection to older laptop....worked as it should.
5,I used this to watch videos from an old NVR player onto my tv screen. All of the ports on the NVR box failed and the VGA port was the only one that worked. I needed to recover some old recordings for a legal case. Worked well! This was my last option and it saved my life!
5,I purchased a new DELL monitor that only accepted HDMI inputs but needed the ability to also accept VGA input. This VGA to HDMI converter was the solution and I've very pleased with the quality performance and value. I would recommend this converter to anyone requiring VGA to HDMI conversion.
5,Laptop to monitor access!
5,Last year I purchased a new "Ultra" monitor for my desktop PC but despite months of trying could not get it working satisfactorily. PC had VGA HDMI and USB out. Connected to HDMI but frustrated by no BIOS displayed at start up. No amount of web searching provided an answer but did reveal many many people with same unresolved problem.  I stumbled on a mention of this adapter by chance and happily it was available thru Amazon. Arrived very rapidly and voila BIOS display restored. `One minor minus: the screws to attach the unit to VGA port are difficult to turn as they are tucked into a small space but a little perseverance got a firm grip.  Small gadget big help. Thanks.
5,When connecting an old computer with a built-in graphics card that as a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 this adapter achieves that resolution.  Previously I was using an adapter from another manufacturer that advertises the same resolution but I could only get 1600 x 1200 on that one. So I would recommend this FIONNEX adapter instead.
5,This was the greatest thing I could have ever purchased. I wanted to connect my older laptop to my brand new 4K Smart TV. I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 but it does not have blue-tooth capabilities making it a challenge to mirror my image to the TV. I could have done so by purchasing a few pieces of equipment to make the connections. I also tried other cables that did not work. In my skepticism I purchased this because it was fairly inexpensive and it worked. This miracle cable made the hook-up effortless. I simply plugged in all of the ends and a picture with sound popped up on the TV screen. I will most definitely purchase another. I highly recommend this ingenious cable.
5,Good job or converting VGA to HDMI
3,Bought this to tie in a TV as a monitor for my computer.  The TV only has HDMI ports and my computer is older and only had a monitor (9pin) port.  I was able to get picture but never able to get sound.  It appears the sound card in my computer has gone out.  I am giving up for now.  This was for a convenience and not a have to.  I will eventually upgrade this computer.
1,It didn't work. No picture no audio. Checked and rechecked everything. My VGA out worked on another monitor just fine so it wasn't an issue with my hardware. I'm not feeling the idea of rolling the dice on this accessory again.
5,I bought a new tv (the new tv didn't bring vga connection) I was trying to figure out how to connect my tv to my computer to use it as a monitor. I bought a vga to hdmi connector but it didn't work. I was about to connect a small monitor so I could use it's vgahdmi connections to connect to my big screen tv. Finally I saw a vga/hdmi connector with usb for power. I then got it to work
5,This item worked great getting myopd pc hooked up to a ne 4k monitor. Just be sure to plug in the usb to the computer for the 5v power to make it work (was getting frustrated when it didn’t work plugged in the usb and magic...it worked.
5,I connected an old VGA graphics card to a brand new HD 49” TV HDMI input with no difficulty. Results were better than expected. I tried the sound cable connection without success but didn’t try hard; the computer has its own speakers. What surprised me was the ability of the quite old Nvidia graphics card and older cpu to drive such a large screen.
3,The only problem I am having is that the output is a little larger than my 55" Sony LED screen which cuts off part (all four sides) of what would normally appear on a conventional monitor.  I can still use it but the adapter that I had before (different manufacturer) did not have the output issue and the screen and output matched up perfectly.  Hope this description of the issue is clear.
5,PERFECT! Why oh why didn't I do this a long time ago??? Resolution was screwy at first because the Samsung TV is 46" & newer than my PC. The edges were cut off just a tiny bit on the screen but I fixed that via the TV settings. I cannot express how pleased I am with my huge a$$ new "monitor" & being able to switch easily between PC & Roku. This is awesome! The resolution is fabulous the audio is fabulous & so am I now. See the pic I included! I whited out private information & it's a bit fuzzy but; that's NOT the product being weird. That's me sucking at taking pics with my phone.
5,I used it for a tv that did not have a vga connection and wala it work ee.
5,Everything plugged up easy pc came to life on my Toshiba 40 inch sceen. Great picture  good sound very happy about this product
5,I like everything about this device :) sound works great too.
4,The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is I wish I had gotten the one with the pigtail rather than the unit that connects directly to the VGA port on my laptop.  If I had screw holes on the laptop for it to screw into it would have been just fine.  However it's just a little too heavy and wants to work it's way out.
5,I have a dedicated old laptop used for streaming video and I use the VGA output to connect to the TV (it has no HDMI output...I SAID it was old). I bought this since my new Sony does not have a VGA input. It was easy to hook up except for plugging in the HDMI cable into the back of the TV as the TV was already wall-mounted between two bookcases (which weren't going anywhere) so I had to feel around to find the HDMI socket and plug it in by feel. No big deal really. And certainly not a knock on this unit itself which seems fine and inexpensive.
5,I got this so I could stream hulu from my laptop to the television.  My smart tv canceled agreements with some providers so I needed a hook up to be able to watch some of my shows now.
5,I bought this because I work from home and my office gave me a docking station.  Well it has only the new HDMI and the old VGA and the other white one.  I bought this adapter to run my 36" TV from my laptop and then my monitor can run on the display port.  It works great.  I can't comment on picture quality because I'm only using Outlook and other basic programs but for the price it works GREAT!
2,Wanted to use this on the HDMI input of a multi-input multi-format monitor. The VGA input on the monitor looked good when fed by the VGA output of the machine. When the VGA to HDMI adapter was used the HDMI image was noticeably poorer and overscanned to the point that maximized windows couldn't be closed because the controls were off-screen.
5,I bought this product because my new tv does not have a vga input (only hdmi.)  With this cable I was easily able to hook my older computer up to my newer tv with the computer's vga output and the tv's hdmi input.  I have good quality picture and sound.  I did not end up needing the included aux/rca adaptor to get sound from the computer to the tv however it has proven useful in extending my sound to my sound board which I can easily change out devices now to play music off of my stereo phone computer or anything running through my tv for surround sound.
5,Worked as expected A+++Instruction book could have larger text
5,Works great with my dell power edge r410 and Samsung 4K TV.I prefer remote content for server since it’s a very old server iDrac uses Java in client those settings needs to be changed to disable modern ciphers so I had to maintain a VM to do that!With this connector I can physically connect the server via its VGA port to my modern tv.Thanks a lot!
5,Got this to send video & audio from my old laptop to a FHD 1920x1080 TV.  My old laptop has a 1200x800 resolution but the video I get on my TV using this adapter is FHD 1920x1080 very clear and stable.  Audio is perfectly clear too.  You need hook all 3 plugs VGA\audio\USB.  In my case after telling Windows to duplicate the screen (on the display settings area) i also had to close the laptop lid to get FHD on TV.  It may also work with other Windows display settings like show only video on TV vs both laptop and TV.Very happy with results so far.
5,I found my entire experience truly enjoyable. The delivery and email shipping updates were fast and accurate. I found the price to be incredibly fair especially when you take into account that it is more expensive and harder to find locally than it was to have shipped in. The instructions were short and precise which made hooking it up a breeze. I must say that best of all was that everything was made to be done fast and efficient. I will assuredly be ordering more products from them when the need arises. AAA+++
5,This does exactly what it says it does unlike the two different ones I bought from other companies that I had to return.... Not all things are made equal and this stands above the others..... I highly recommend this if you want to use it to connect TV as a monitor and your computer doesn't have an HDMI output plus as a bonus with this you can have your sound come out through the TV speakers 👍
5,I purchased this after a lot of research for my HP Elitebook. I have been using it for more than 6 months and I have so far not faced any issue with it. The most I love about this product is its ease of use. I highly recommend it.
5,I wanted to hook up an old HP laptop to a new LG 4K tv to use the DVD player in the laptop.  The new tv does not have Svideo the laptop does not have HDMI.  This adapter solved the problem. I guess I could buy a new DVD player but I wanted to try this.  I did receive a defective power cord with mine but the seller replaced it and it works great. The seller was very responsive.
5,You have a motherboard that doesn't automatically detect and use a pcie HDMI video card (cough supermi cough) and one day you reset the bios to factory defaults and find you have no video then have to hook up an old monitor (if you have one) to go into the bios and set the video to external.
5,I just plugged it on the PC VGA output the USB to power it and the audio output jack . It worked great! Very sharp picture quality.  Very Happy getting an old PC running again. Needed it to run some old software I have.
5,This little gadget is amazing.  It is very easy to set up and now I can stream Playon again which I have not in months as I purchased a new tv and could not hook up my older CPU computer that I use as a "server" to run Playon and don't use it for much else.  I hope the product lasts a while however at this low price I may just purchase another one to have in case it doesn't hold out.  It's been operational since installing 2 weeks ago and it's awesome using my big screen tv as a monitor when I need to access my computer.
3,This works but the picture contrast is not as good as my displayport but displayport audio didn't work.  Unfortunately I can't find a better solution to convert from VGA DP or DVI to HDMI that also includes audio...  This is the best thing I have found so far.
5,Bought two different and totally wrong cords before I realized this was all I needed to connect my old dell pc to my Samsung smart tv as a monitor. does exactly what I need just connect HDMI cord to the device and tv you'll need a USB plug in cube though it doesn't come with that but I had one laying around.
4,Had to connect extra monitor to older laptop with only VGA output.  Works fine.  Did not connect the audio - not needed.
5,No issues so far.
4,The product fit the need of connecting VGA computer output to new HDMI type inputs on newer monitors and TV's used for monitors.
5,As of now this thing really works great. I wanted to use a 32 inch tv as a monitor and this is exactly what is needed. It also lets the volume be controlled with the TV remote. That's cool. I have only used it once because my computer had to go into the shop for other scheduled repair. The only thing I am not sure about is it does get pretty warm maybe even a little hot.
5,I wanted to keep my old Dell Win 7 with Media Player DVD Maker and other applications that Win 10 no longer supports. With only a VGA output to my TV/monitor this converter is a great solution. Bonus was that now audio goes through TV speakers much better than separate set of PC speakers. Less clutter better sound and a spare set of speakers for other uses and most importantly I can continue to use Win 7 features.
5,Not sure it is this product's fault but when connected to my room-mate's Philips TV there was no audio.  However on my Samsung TV audio worked first try and every time.  Oh well used a different computer that didn't need this adapter on her TV and all is well.
2,Out of the 10 I’ve brought only 3 was able to work. The rest was plugged in the same way but did not work. Wasn’t able to connect at all.
5,This was an easy adapter to install and use.  The hardest part was getting on the floor to access the back of my computer's  case.I unpackaged it plugged in the USB portion heard my computer make the New Hardware detected sound plugged in the VGA port and then the HDMI into the adapter and heard the New Hardware detected noise again.When I went around to the front of my desk there was my new monitor working like a charm through this adapter.I've only had it in place for three days but I can't find anything not to like.
4,The video works fine but the audio is TERRIBLE!!! I have my laptop AND TV on 100% volume and can still barely hear it.
5,I received my purchased item in relatively short time from date  of order and it functions as precisely as I had expected it toI am thoroughly satisfied with the desired results.
5,It was as simple as plug in and it works.  I had to realize that the USB cord atttached must be plugged into the computer to power the adapter. Once I did that it worked perfectly. However the max resolution on my old VGA port was not the same as the standard resolution on my new Dell monitor and I have two of the Dell's set up. For viewing consistency and drag and drop across the two screens they needed to be the same size. Therefore I returned this and got a USB to HDMI adapter instead. However this product worked exactly as advertised.
5,works exactly as described.. you may have to adjust the screen resolution ( ON COMPUTER NOT TV) to get a normal picture.. at first. after installation. the picture generated by computer on tv screen was stretched.. but after a screen resolution using the Windows Settings feature under Display.. the image normalized in appearance.  Audio also works great.. plug in as described as the manufacturer describes in the accompanying brochure.
5,It gets the job done for sure.  Like the description says you can only use this one way.  VGA to HDMI: cannot go the other way.  I can tell a difference in picture quality between the VGA and the HDMI (I Have 2 monitors; 1 straight HDMI and 1 using this adapter from VGA to HDMI) the difference in picture quality is not huge but it is noticeable.  Still not a deal breaker I'm sure its just due to limitations of the VGA connection.
4,The ONLY drawback from a 5 star rating is the conversion quality. A regular HDMI port and cable provides a noticeable difference when compared side-by-side. Maybe another review after some time to verify longevity.
5,It came with everything I needed to hook up to my laptop. I plugged it into my VGA output port Ran the included USB power cable and the audio cable  to the respective connections on the other side of my laptop with cable to spare. Hooked up the HDMI cable from my TV turned on the TV selected the HDMI input and there was my computer screen on the TV. Set the TV to 16:9 display played a movie turned up the sound on the laptop and on the TV and everything worked great. Highly recommend.
5,so far  so good worked better then I expected using it to  bypass a certain device that has HDMI copyrighted and  certain context gets  blocked but not with  this  little gem ( nothing  illegal BTW) picture quality is great  don't know about sound since I' chose to use the  Bluetooth of the device instead Pros - everything  Cons - so far nothing that I've  noticed -simple to use and simple to hook up even using an external  power source as I'm doing let's see how it holds up in the long run
5,Much better then the others ones I got in the past seems sturdier and easy to install
4,The cable for some reason did not work initially. I had to switch the usb power to a different one to make it work. Then I switched back to the one which did not work then it worked. After that little mysterious process  it worked fine. I need it to output video and sound from my laptop to my receiver. It does the job.
4,Easy plug and play adapter.Four stars for item doing what it says it would 5 stars if it did a backflip or something fantastic like that.
5,It actually works and at a good price point! Spent all day driving around looking for a VGA to HDMI converter. 2 Walmarts 2 Targets and 1 Best Buy later decided to order it from Amazon. No one else had it!
5,I have an old Dell C521 that I am using for a server. I needed to connect to my TV that only has HDMI.  This adapter does the trick.  Everything needed is in the box.
5,ok
5,I ain't at all tech-savvy so buying this thing was a bit if a gamble. But it works. After a few minutes of very intuitive set-up time shazzam the 17-inch image on my laptop monitor is now a 45-inch image on an old smart-TV that I wasn't using. Crystal clear visuals even when watching videos with the added (and unexpected) plus of excellent sound through the TV's speakers. Pretty dang good for $14.
5,Exactly what I was looking for
3,I bought this as its the only option i had for setting up dual monitors without significant lag and has worked well in that department. However if you look at the Amazon icon on the 2 photos you'll notice a slight difference in quality. Both my monitors are set at the same resolution but one is hooked up to hdmi directly. I even tried switching monitors to see if it was there was a hardware issue but same result. I don't have 2 hdmi ports on my desktop so needed a converter. The quality difference is subtle but a little disappointing
3,Not sure of the problem is the device but the screen will not even go to 1080p.  Max resolution is 1600x1024.  Other screen output is 1080p no problem.  Can't get screens to match resolution.  Unusable because of this.
5,Exactly what I wanted hooked up desktop pc with vga video port to hdmi port on tv and got perfect picture. Hooked up 3.5 mm audio jack to port on desktop and got perfect sound through the tv. Good value for the money.
5,I tried using various adapters going from my laptop to a tv.  Known worked till I got this one.  It needed the USB power source for it to work.  I don't have a smart tv; but I do have a few older laptops.  Down load the app or bring up some streaming in your favorite browser; it's now on a big screen.  Great upgrade to tv viewing; with buying a new tv nor a new streaming media setup.
3,Had nothing but problems with the clarity of the font of text. I tried updating drivers calling for help different monitors and all same issues. Font was like trying to read under water. I eventually gave up and returned it. AND the sound wouldn't come from the TV just the pc. Samsung TV and bee dell desktop com used
3,Power input failed after 3 months. Very poor construction as expected in line with price. There are much better designs that seemingly will avoid the issue I had for only a few dollars more.
1,The included USB Power cable USB-C end that connects to the adapter is TOO LONG(5/8") so that it interferes with the power cable for the D630 laptop (1/2" from laptopVGA connector).  If they would have connected the cable on ANY OTHER side of theadapter this problem wouldn't have occurred.  In order to correct this I would need tobuy an additional 90 degree (L-shaped) USB-C cable that would allow space for thelaptop power cable BUT would cost more than the FOINNEX adapter.Additionally for my Dell D630 laptop while the adapter sends HDMI for DVD gamedisks that display to the screen it does not work for normal DVDs played on thelaptop using either the VLC player CyberLink PowerDVD or InterActual DVD playersoftwares.  The error displayed is "UNSUPPORTED VIDEO SIGNAL".For these reasons I am returning the FIONNEX adapter and trying another vendor.
5,It works really well. To bad I obviously need glasses since I didn't see the built in hmdi port already on computer. It will probably come in handy later on.
4,Always works!
5,Work as said picture is great  of course got Samsung q 90 even using VGA plug looks great no problem found
4,I ran out of HDMI ports on security system and had an RCA port unused so I used the converter to allow be another HDMI connection. I had to tap into the USB on entertainment center. The device worked.
5,Didn't think it would be good. But it works fine.
5,Works perfect with my new LG 4K Smart TV. No set up. No drivers to download. Just plug and play. I have an old desktop PC that came with a Microsoft Vista operating system so you know I don’t have Bluetooth or the latest tech and connection ports on it like hdmi. I do have a new laptop with all the latest hardware technology and connection ports and my old pc looks just as good with this cord. Brilliant colors and sharpness out of this world! It’s like I have a new desktop! Lovin it!
5,I used this device to send video from a security system DVR to an HDMI input on a newer TV monitor.  Clear image with no distortion.
4,Concerned when I first opened the package  the USB plug  was on the HDMI end of the cable  versus the VGA  plug next to the computer.  Fortunately  it worked out for the better because the power is drawn from the TV versus the computer end of the cable.  Everything works excellent.
5,Great value got it exceptionally fast needed i just got my.new tv and needed my computer to connect  to right away and as usual  Amazon  was there to.save the day thanks Amazon keep up the amazing  work.
4,Just remember sound volume is controlled by tv remote.
1,From the pictures i have provided you can clearly see that they claim to support 1920x1200 resolution. However in actuality they only support up to 1920x1080 resolution. I tested this on Linus as well as Windows 10. Both computers work find when either connecting directly to HDMI or connecting via the VGA input on the monitor.Pic1: False informationPic2: Max resolution in LinuxPic3: Max resolution in Windows 10Pic4: Windows 10 resolution when bypassing this productI am using a 5V 2A USB power supply. My monitor has native resolution of 1920x1200. My graphics driver is fully capable of driving 1920x1200 just not through this device. The fact that 1920x1200 does not even come up as an option is proof that it's not even built into the device.Pic 5: They include a card with the package which says to go to service@foinnex.com for support.Pic6: This is the page that comes upPic7: I finally did find a web page with foinnex. They claim to offer "lifetime" technical supportPic8: The actual support you get is simply to return the device.This is my biggest complain about products from China in general. They always advertise their products to be better than they actually are. Then when you give a bad rating they beg you to remove the bad rating in exchange of a refund. Meanwhile many people just don't get around to making a return and they get the $$$.
5,As long as your laptop has the VGA port audio out port and a USB port all on the same side this will work perfectly.  The cable to the HDMI port was about 6' long so if you need longer you will need a M/F HDMI cable or a F/F HDMI gender changer plug.
5,I have an orlder desktop computer that I wanted to connect to my TV.  This cable is perfect as not only is the video signal sent to the TV HDMI port but since the cable has a 1/8” phono jack on the VGA end the audio o is also delivered through the HDMI at the TV.  The USB plug also on the VGA end provides the necessary power to the HDMI cable.  It didn’t require any additional cables for connection like other box converters I considered.  Easy connection no fuss.
4,it work well and was easy to install.
5,I originally purchased this for my laptop but then I thought I'd try it on my main PC and now I have a 32 inch TV as my monitor. At first the picture was not full so I went to the TV and changed the screen size to full. This adapter has all you need both picture and sound. Should have thought of this a while ago this thing is cool. A monitor has more pixels for better picture quality but I like the TV no PC speakers.
3,This is my second one. First one stopped working. Picture quality isn’t the best but it’s not horrible.  I would pay more for one that was better made internally.  It does the job but marginally.
5,without dramas
3,The DisplayPort on my 8-year old laptop started having problems.  That worked much better with only a single inline plug adapter.  The experience is surprisingly good.  This requires a relatively large adapter to be plugged into the VGA port then plug a USB cable into the side and the USB port to supply power to it then an audio cable to connect the adapter to the headphone jack of the computer.  For a computer without a DisplayPort or HDMI jack this is an acceptable way to stream video to the TV.  I'll never buy another PC/laptop without an HDMI jack.
5,Plug/Play worked perfect.
4,I think it's pretty cool to use my big TV as a monitor but sometimes the picture is a bit off - oddly colored and (sometimes) a bit crooked.
5,Some people have reported problems but for me it was a very simple plug and play process.  I selected 1080 resolution on my Lenovo Thinkpad T410s and got a very clear image on my Sony HD TV.  Both audio and and USB (power) cords are supplied.  You never know with video resolution configurations - they depend so much on both the source and the display.  But for me it is a great product.
5,easy to use
1,The pic that describes this product/component is totally different than what you might receive. Might as well be prepared to send it back. This comes with cables(usb). Not a plug-n-play
5,I bought the adapter to use on my enterprise grade server in my WAY overkill home network because my KVM switch is HDMI only. The materials quality is very good and it worked flawlessly. If there was a complaint to be given which is pretty much irrelevant is that the thumb screws are a PITA but when you have to squish that much electronics into a tiny package room to put your fat thumbs kinda takes a back seat. Grab a pair of pliers and problem solved.
4,In a word it simply works
5,Painless setup with perfect results.  I personally use the adapter for a gaming machine.
5,I used it to hook up a 12in portable tv to my laptop as a extension monitor when i travel. Did the job great. Thx Amazon love u guys.
1,The cable does not work.  Tested with multiple computers and monitors.  DOA
5,immediately connected connected and turned on and brought my  Computer back to life
5,Recently purchased this Foinnex VGA to HDMI cable adapter to connect the laptop for teen gaming at work. The connections from the laptop to the TV screen works beautifully. No issues with the audio and video on the TV screen.  I highly recommend this product if you’re looking to use the laptop for showing work presentations picture slide-shows streaming movies and online gaming. On a side note for those that are not tech savvy it would helpful if there was simple instruction manual included in the package.
5,This is an incredible product and delivers better video quality than the old brand I used.  It is also more rugged!
5,My HP dock only had two display ports and a single VGA on it. My current screens are HDMI/DisplayPort only.I ordered two different cables and one different adapter before this one and let me just say - I wish I ordered this one first! I plugged it into my dock plugged in the (provided) USB and went to down. I now have my three screens back for work and I couldn't be happier or more productive!
5,It works as intended. From my MacBook Pro I can now use my 55inch flat screen TV as a second display monitor when I have Zoom meetings.
5,Works as intended.
5,This VGA to HMDI adapter was a money saver since my CPU don't have a VGA/HDMI card for the monitor. I purchased a 32" curved monitor to watch movies and series but didn't noticed the need of the HDMI slot. This adapter save the day and I'm enjoy my favorites movies and series while my wife is watching her favorites programs in the TV.I recommend it to anyone that don't want to spend the money in a VGA HDMI PC Card.
5,I'm using it with a rather old PC and a not near as old LED TV. Everything seems fine. Picture quality is equal to my old 22 inch monitor. I'm not a major tech person it works for me!
5,Have a PC with no HDMI output i wanted to hook up to my television. Installation was killer easy. worked great. Plugged VGA into PC ran aux cord to the aux output plugged USB power cord into the USB slot on PC  plug in HDMI presto! Works exactly as described!
5,Smaller than others made in this style Impressed at the quality of the picture on my HDTV
4,Everytime I plug it in I have to reset the resolution theres always some streaking  moving across if I don't but after the reset it works fine.
5,Couldn't be easier. I needed a converter from an old Windows 7 PC that only had a VGA output to a 27" monitor which only has HDMI and DP inputs. This worked instantly. The only issue is the monitor has a resolution of 3840x2160 and the VGA output only goes up to 1920x1080. It filled the whole screen but onscreen lettering was not as sharp. I expected that. I did not try the audio plugs.
3,In a meeting preparing to present to a room full of potential clients and this thing did not work.  So embarrassing!  Afterward when preparing to return I happen to read the reviews and this is where I find out that it needs to be USB powered.  Not mentioned on the page when I bought it no instructions in the box when I received it.  Now I know it works but would have been nice to know before.
5,Our office has modern TVs on the walls but some staff and consultants arrive with VGA only laptops.  This nifty adapter allows these old laptops to connect to the HDMI TVs without trouble.  It does require connecting to both the USB and VGA which I suppose is just for power to the HDMI connector.  I haven't tested the sound but suspect that works too.  It feels like a durable plastic device.  No drivers needed just plug in.
4,Could not get sound to work  I was able to connect my 32 inch monitor to  my old  window xp  system  with and old apg graphic card.
3,This product works however if your a gamer or a recorder this will not work because some os will see it as a recording device and will stop working
5,Need to connect a third monitor on my HP laptop.  It has 2 Display ports and one VGA output.  This little cable did the trick.  I was able to connect a third monitor that only has HDMI DP inputs.  Unfortunately I could not set it to the recommended resolution of monitor.  1980x1200.  I was just able to do the advertised resolution on the cable of 1980x 1080.  For the price I would recommend and buy again if need be.
5,Easy connections and worked great no issues at all.
3,I bought this product because I'm running dual monitors and my laptop only has 1 hdmi port. While I could have lived with the vga quality that my vga cable provided on occasion my monitor would go black when I scrolled using my mouse wheel. The positive is that in the week I've had this adapter that hasn't happened but the display quality is not any better then using a straight VGA cable.
1,Arrived and didn't work. Must of got a faulty one! Was very Disappointed.
4,although i was unable to use it it worked very well . I was unable to make it fit my screen. going VGA i had an adjustment not available on the HDMI
5,This product really works
5,Just fits and works - perfect setup - got a older Desktop PC connected to a new 55' Flat-screen TV it as Monitor via VGA Port.  Its a 4k HDR TV - and I used the Standard HDMI not the ARC HDMI to connect it. Its a great Picture Quality on Standard HDMI with up-scaling to 4K on the Monitor by max Resolution from On-board Graphic Card coming from Intel Graphics with 1920 * 1080. Perfect.
5,Timely shipment and delivery; the cable worked perfectly the first time I hooked it up.  I needed to display documents from my laptop on a flat screen TV for a meeting.  The cable enabled that to be done very simply having arrived within about a day after being ordered.  I am pleased.
3,its alright its a cable adapter after all it works but not much tech to use on bought this for my friend and it locked onto his computer causing us to take it in and getting it removed screws would not undo and became stripped
5,Works perfectly - easy to install thankfully because the instructions weren't all that easy to understand but easy enough to figure out... great quality picture.
4,Great little wire I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I plugged the USB drive into a USB hub and it cut the power to the other USB on the hub so I had to pull out an old cell charger to power the USB cord no complaints now
1,It's a waste of money because I had to buy a second one because the first one I bought broke like a month then the second one without even touching it broke so why do I have to buy new one about every couple days to a month cuz automatically breaks oh I get it this is how they make their money and they make a cheap crappy product
5,Using it to hook up my third external monitor.  works great!
4,Easy to hook up Can't use the skews but fits tight. use on my little notebook to my projector. The audio plug is on the other side of my pc but no big deal. Works Great.
5,Does what its suppose to do and I absolutely love it so far. Just my personal opinion but I think its totally worth the price. I'm glad the usb & audio cable(s) aren't sold seperately too saves you the hassle of having to look for the cords so you can make immediate use out of it.
5,This adapter works well and the picture quality is surprisingly good!Be aware that:*  it does get a little bit warm* The adapter REQUIRES POWER via a USB-A to microUSB cable.  You'll need an available USB-A port to plug in nearby.I would buy this again.
4,The only thing I didn't like is that you need a power source. If you are  Purchasing the items then you'll be fine but if you are using it for old technology then you need a close power source.
1,THIIS DIDN'T WORK WITH MY TOWER AND MONITOR WHICH IS A BRAND NEW MONITOR.
3,Works fine when I use it with something 1024x768 or greater.I needed this to connect test equipment to an HDMI capture system and it won't capture any of the equipment that uses 640x480 or 800x600 resolutions. If you use it for a laptop or something else that's at least 1024x768 it will work fine.I believe that my use is an edge case they did not think of or did but decided that it was not worth implementing. They should amend the documentation to state that it will not work with lower resolutions.
1,Do not work don’t buy
5,purchased a new monitor for a re-furbished (upgrade to new components in a older body) that had no HDMI port. This adaptor did the trick.
1,When I used this it gave me a pounding headache idk what came out of that thing but it wasn't good had to go outside to feel better
5,This VGA to HDMI adapter / converter works very well allowing you to connect your Computer tower or laptop which only has a VGA port to your HDTV HDMI port.Crystal clear resolution and audio for this wonderful money saver as i would have had to buy a new computer. The cost of this product is worth it to extend the use of your current electronics.
5,Works as advertised.  Will need a usb port to to give some power to it otherwise works really well.
5,Got my new PC connected to my 6 year old monitor
5,I was using a VGA to VGA cable on my HD monitor and the picture was fuzzy. I purchased this VGA to HDMI cable to see if it would clear up the picture and it did. It looks like my monitor that has HDMI to HDMI. I would recommend this easy to install cable and the price was very reasonable. Really good value and results for your money
4,it worked fine didn't have any problem..
4,...I don't use the audio cable so I can't speak to that. Otherwise it does what its supposed to. It is also made well with good material. Should hold up for a long time.
5,Yo compre este producto por su funcion en si fue una buena inversion es exacto como lo describe el website pequeño facil de instalar accesible pude conectar mi TV a mi computadora y tiene doble funcion de TV & Monitor sin ningun problema
5,When it comes to data signaling this thing seems to get it about as right as you will need it.  Stinking cute too.
3,This works well to adapt a VGA source (computer) to a HDMI screen.  This will NOT improve your video quality if you are using a low end video card.  The adapter comes with a small USB power cord that must be plugged in to your computer to work so if you don't have that many open ports this may not be a good product for you.  Outside of that it delivers what it promises with a decent picture.
5,If you have a older machine with only vga output this will let the newer monitors display vga.  It is easy to use plug it in to the vga port and plug the hdmi cable into the adapter.  Be sure to plug in the usb cable to the side port and into an empty usb.  This converts vga output to hdmi monitors.
5,Works like a charm. Using it for my Zmodo security system to view on my tv.  Not using the audio so not sure about that. I tried other adapters but this one is the first that worked. Very satisfied.
3,This is pretty easy to use. Helpful to project on to a tv without VGA from a laptop without hdmi. Picture and sound are ok especially if you aren't super particular. The main issue is my unit has already began a buzzing noise. I never considered this to be a long term solution. Probably will be upgrading my laptop and/or TV soon.
4,Order arrived in good condition and on time.Quality and performance as advertised/expected.Simple device but I will monitor long term performance and robustness and update as needed.
5,Works Great!! I have two monitors but the docking station of my work Dell only has one HDMI and one VGA. The VGA had a horrible quality image and resolution that wouldn't fit the screen properly regardless of adjustment. This worked perfectly in just a few seconds!
5,This cable is inexpensive and made from modest materials.  However it worked perfectly for taking the VGA and analog audio output from a computer into a device with an HDMI input.  In this instance a Lenovo Thinkpad W520 running Fedora GNU/Linux 27 into a Samsung 8000 series LCD television which does not provide any analog audio input.  I was unable to get audio working via the DisplayPort output and the VGA/analog audio works great with this cable.
4,Having an older Pentium computer that I use to allow my grandsons to access some shows on the internet and dvds This cable allows me to attach a flat screen tv to the computer and lets the boys watch something on a bigger screen than the computer has.
5,It was easy to install and it was easy to use it was just plug and play I would recommend this
1,Out of the box will not work.  Tested connection that does work and the only difference is this device.
5,The product worked as advertised and I receive great support when I ran into issues.  The video that came with ordering the product was very helpful for someone who hates hardware.  5+ stars
5,Works fine awesome little adaptor.
5,Used this on my HP Proliant DL360 G7.  It was cheaper and easier than adding an HDMI video card to drive my HDMI display.  Plugs directly into VGA port on my computer.  Requires power from USB port to operate.
5,seemed sturdy and well-made enough but didn't work for me. I know video conversion can be tricky regarding compatibility so I ordered 3 possible solutions. This item was one of two that didn't work out. In defense of the product and manufacturer my system is made up of various Win Mac and Linux computers so I find it unlikely this item was designed for my unusually diverse work-station.
5,I did exactly what I wanted. It helps to read the Q&A and reviews. Great product.
5,Used to attach two monitors to one computer with one HDMI and one VGA display output.
5,Connecting the adapter was logical and straightforward.  Connecting the included audio plug part of the  is required in order for the adapter to work properly.
5,I was a little skeptical in ordering this but I needed a VGA to HDMI adapter for my work laptop to be able to work efficiently from home. There was no setup required just plug and play. The picture quality is what can be expected from a VGA output so don’t get too excited. Definitely worth the cost if you need this type of adapter.
5,Great
5,Finally a transfer cable that works.  Tried several but they never worked.  This one does!!!
5,This device works converting a VGA output to HDMI. The quality is very good.
2,I was happy that this works to get video signal out of older computers with no HDMI port converting VGA to HDMI.  What's disappointing is that I also get vertical noise bars.  It must need shielding and is picking up RF interference and showing it as "noise" on my monitor.  None of the other 3 computers I have connected to my BenQ monitor through HDMI direct and utilizing a TESmart 4 port KVM switch have the interference problem.
5,This works great for my purposes ever since Microsoft updates killed my laptop's ability to connect to remote screens (thanks Microsoft)!!  But glad there are still options like this so I can at least take advantage of the video ports on my laptop.
5,I recently got a new laptop at work that came with a docking station... the only problem was I use three monitors that require HDMI input and the docking station only had two HDMI ports and one old school VGA port.  This adaptor solved my problem and works Great!
3,I hooked this up to my HP laptop and then to my Viseo TV. There is a constant chirping noise when watching videos. The power cable and the HDMI output cables are in the way of each other.
5,Screen quality very good (Not HDMI but very good quality) no issues other then the audio is reversed. So if you were playing a game (which I would use HDMI for that) not so good. But used with a second monitor without purchasing another video card. Very much worth the purchase.
5,Had an old Window 98 computer with only a VGA connection. Hooked it to an HDMI TV here. Worked like a charm. I can get rid of the heavy CRT monitor now.Yes you do need a USB connection probably just to power it up. The cable is included which is good!
1,I was searching for a solution that would allow me to use three displays with my Dell OptiPlex 9010.  This PC has (1) VGA output and (2) DisplayPort outputs for monitors.  I was attempting to use a 55" Samsung TV as one display and it does not have a VGA input or a DisplayPort input only HDMI inputs.  This adapter worked and successfully passed video from my VGA out on my PC and converted it to HDMI into my 55" Samsung.  I did have to adjust several display settings on my Dell before the video would be passed through to the Samsung properly.  Overall a great value for approximately $10 and the shipping was quick as always through Amazon.  I would buy this adapter again if needed.
5,Need a way to connect my old PC to a new monitor it was easy and it works vell.
5,Used this on my older HP desktop with a VGA connector to hook up a new 32" Samsung curved monitor.  Worked perfect.  Very happy with this application.  Only thing I had to do was to select the correct HDMI connection on the monitor.  Easy to do on the monitor.
5,I plugged this into my computer and monitor and there was a picture. They made it easy to make sure I purchased the right item with a straightforward description.  I installed it the day I received and it remains working to this day. I highly recommended it.
5,If you're like me and aren't sure if this is the cord you need to use an old pc with a vga cord with a newer tv that only has hdmi this is the product you need. Just hook up the respective cords to their corresponding source and you're all set. Now I can play Sims on my 42" screen and the picture quality is pretty decent.
1,Lamentablemente perdida de tiempo y de dinero este adaptador tiene señal análoga y no deja que la laptop detecte la señal del monitor no inviertas en este artículo para que no te pase lo mismo que a mi
2,Per headline. I switched to an external USB power when HDMI TV/Monitor said not strong enough signal. Then the adapter overheats pretty quickly and intermittent video creeps. This is connected to a Thinkpad T430. Other than that when it works it works great.
4,It works going from laptop with Win7 OS to a projector system.  The only drawback - mirco USB power source and sound Jack cords clutter up the podium.
4,The cable itself was of good quality and came promptly.  The only downside it did not work with my HP monitor. I did have a Dell monitor I could use and it worked perfectly with that.  Good quality and a good picture.
5,Would be nice if it didn't need to draw power from USB but still very useful.
5,This is a good product.  Well made.  Works well.
5,This piece works as described. I had no issues connecting my old work laptop to my TV screen. I already had an HDMI cable but the old laptop only had a VGA port. The picture quality is fine and I haven't had any connectivity issues.
5,Easy to install. Works as advertised.
5,I bought this for a dual screen set up I have at work. Both screens are hdmi but the second port on my pc is vga. This works great for what it does! Output quality is a little low but not enough to ignore. Just beware of placement. The USB power portion is in the way of my hdmi connection so it's a little snug!
1,It's my third one I bought from this guy the store the second two broke automatically by itself and this one automatically came broken so I'm done with this company
5,This is my first indoor antenna and I was skeptical about indoor antenna and the quality of signal they received. I was totally blown away by the clarity and sharpness of the local station and the antenna is just mounted on a window. I am very delighted with the purchase and the recommend anyone cutting cable to get this indoor antenna to start off.
4,Worked well  except my laptop does not have screw holes and the plug must be very carefully inserted and propped up to make sure contact is maintained.
5,Needed to connect an older laptop to a new mini projector. Projector only has HDMI input and the laptop only had VGA/USB output. Tried a HDMI/USB adapter we had laying around but apparently the projector doesn't support that.Got this instead. Plugged it into the VGA (video) Headphone (audio) and USB (for power) ports. Apparently you need a little juice to convert the analog (VGA/Headphone) signal to digital (HDMI).Worked perfectly.
5,It's just what I was looking for!! Super Cheap !!easy set up!!
4,Diminished video quality but connected the VGA port on laptop to the HDMI port on the TV like I needed it to also uses a USB port on the laptop included a headphone connection for sound but I haven’t used that feature
2,It only works in a very basic way... Tried it with CCTV systems and stand-alone monitors tv sets pcs and laptops... It basically works - although you should be careful you have a trusted power supply - but the VGA-to-HDMI output gives you a somewhat degraded image over the original. You may find that works for you but it didn't work for well enough for us. If you need sound be sure you understand how to select "source" both in the operating system and in the software you're using. We had no problems there - but we've done a lot of this before. Worth checking if you should have sound and don't. As for the picture... If you're "stuck" and need "something" to get from VGA to HDMI this will get you partly unstuck. It may not however be good enough quality for your presentation monitoring screen mirroring etc. A copy is never as good as the original....
5,We have TV's in our church meeting rooms that are used by lots of different groups with all sorts of tech (and many levels of expertise).  We just leave this cable plugged into an HDMI port on the TV (and a Lightning>VGA dongle in the drawer) and we can accommodate almost anybody's machine without doing a lot of swapping out.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Just the item I needed for a dual monitor setup.  It also allowed me to add a 3.5 audio splitter to share stereo speakers.  I would buy this product again.
5,My hdmi port is bad so I can't use it to hook up to my tv.This adapter works great. Just remember to hook up the included audio cable.This saved me from buying another laptop. The shop said it would cost to much to fix my hdmi.
4,Simple to use inexpensive but takes up a usb for power
5,Iam using some older computers with vga only and I have new monitors hdmi only so I wanted a simple solution.  I do not need the sound on the hdmi so It does not bother me but sounds like it does works from the brief moment i use the port.I will buy more If I need them.
2,This came with (1) VGA to HDMI adapter (1) Audio Cord and (1) USB cord.Based on other reviews I assumed it did not but Yes it does come with the required USB cord.Day 1 I had an issue getting my screen to recognize that it was plugged it... I thought It was just a glitch but it has turned into a daily struggle.If my computer goes to "sleep" this converter stops working and my monitor will display "no HDMI found" The first few times a little wiggle got it back up and running... But that no longer works.I would return it.. But I tossed all the packaging.. So that sucks.
5,Building a NAS server realized I had zero vga compatible devices in the house. Needed one ASAP to install the OS. This arrived next day via Prime One-Day. Picture quality is marginal at best but worked for what I needed it for.....will keep it around for next time.
3,The adapter shrinks the picture with no way to enlarge it.
5,so fair its very good and works really will and people should buy this
5,Buy it! Plug and play. I tried two others of different brands that did not work. It's VGA to HDMi works perfect!
5,This cable was exactly what I needed to connect the new 50” display (HDMI inputs) in the church’s foyer to the older dedicated pc (VGA output) that runs the slideshows featuring activities in the church.  I connected the male VGA to the jack on the pc the HDMI to a port on the display set input to HDMI 1 and started the slideshow program. The photos appeared like magic!
3,Initially it appeared to work as windows booted and then it stoppedworking.  After many different attempts I learned the VGA refreshrate MUST be set at 60 Hz.  Any higher and it won't work.  I don'tlike that the device makes noise.  If you have a noisy computer thenthis won't bother you.  The output of the device isn't as clean as Iwould like but it does work."
5,This worked well for what I wanted old PC to new HDMI (TV).  Please know that there are other cables that might be specific for TV (HDMI) to VGA but they probably won't work for PC to TV (HDMI).  This one does work for PC to TV. The direction of conversion is important and specific.  This is just what I needed.
5,I ordered a HDMI monitor and forgot my desktop only had a vga port.  I contacted Samsung to ask if there was a converter and they said no.  Scrolling through Amazon I found this converter.  A reviewer said it worked so I ordered it.  Plugged it in and I now have a beautiful new monitor.  It really works and that's what counts.
5,n/a
4,The VGA port is a little tough to stay plugged into my old Compaq laptop but once I plugged in the USB it worked like a charm. I was able to use my tv as an alternate monitor and get all my data off my machine.
3,My Geforce graphics card crapped out so I needed to hook up a VGA to HDMI cable in order to use another larger display. It worked. However the area where the screws are is way to narrow for my hands I can't get in there and tighten it to my computer.
5,I needed an adapter to go from an older model laptop with only a VGA port to my TV - which has an HDMI input. This worked right out of the box and was powered by the USB port on my laptop. Sound and video are great and it recognized the full 1920x1080 resolution of my TV.
4,image quality was just fair but I wanted to display pc laptop karaoke files on my hdmi projector.  Cable did it's job.This cable will not work with older laptops.  I have two old vga laptops.  The newer of the two worked.
4,The Adapter works just fine. Does what it says without any drama
5,Picture quality was awesome connected quickly great value
3,I'm giving this product an overall rating of 3.5 for 2 reasons. 1. Connection instability when attaching to laptop. Very difficult to secure to laptop with nothing to secure it in place. 2. Picture quality on video/movie is poor when in full screen.
4,Works fine.  Issue is the VGA connector will not stay plugged in to my notebook PC.  The notebook does not have retaining screw ports.  Weight of the VGA plug assembly causes the connector to fall out of the socket.
3,I had to return this item since it did not work with my system.  Customer Serbice handle this issue very expeditiously
4,The picture quality is o.k. bit not great. However the device was easy to set up and use.
5,I needed to hook my notebook computer (PC) to my smart TV and this solved the problem.  In our office we have several individuals who will need to present using the TV and this makes it so much easier than trying to upgrade everyone' to a bluetooth or wireless connection from every individual computer.  Great product!
4,Works well for connecting the Security Camera DVR box with D15 pins to the LG TV with an hdmi port.  The adapter cable has a USB connector for power input so I can just plug it directly to the TV.
4,Worked exactly the way I needed it to.  Would have been 5 stars except that I hate that the connection has to be powered using a USB port in the laptop.  Has all the video and audio connections you could need.
5,Used an old laptop without hdmi port to play DVDs to a screen projector.  Worked perfectly.  Three ports into old device *usb *aux *vga....transforms to HDMI into newer device.  You can bypass sound transfer though and only use the *usb and *vga...and plug another sound device into *aux port.  (E.g. in our case we used better speakers for movie sound than were available via projector).
3,I wasn't able to tighten the teeny tiny screws on the VGA side to ensure a good connection.The product that I purchased to plug into this adapter didn't work - so I can't speak to the quality of connection but those screws man - impossible. And I have pretty small hands.
5,Cool but really hard to screw it in too tight to get fingers to get it to screw in. But it’s okay need it a lesser price cause too expensive for this type of product seen many elsewhere much cheaper about half the price.
5,Finally a VGA to HDMI adapter that works to set up two monitors that only have HDMI ports.  I have purchased other adapters that the big store I bought my computer from sold me only to find out none of them worked.  This adapter works GREAT.
5,It does get warm and the weight of the device puts some strain on your VGA port so I recommend propping it up to prevent overstressing the port.
5,I’m using a Windows computer with a VGA output and a TV with a HDMI input only. Using the adapter works great.
5,Awesome product glad I found this adapter for an older work laptop so I can use my monitor.
5,So be ware that this dongle is an active converter and requires 5vdc via a usb cable (included). It gets a little warm during operation but performs well. You will get some resolution loss due to the digitization of the analog signal... that will be true of ANY device that performs this function. I would recommend this device if this is what you need.
5,It works great. I ordered this because we had to replace our old monitor. We wanted HDMI for a better quality resolution etc but we have a computer that only has VGA. This adapter made it possible to have the the better quality picture resolution as well as better audio feed. It would have been nice if there were some directions to help with hooking it up.
5,Following the instructions was easy. In my case I went from a lap top to a 75" smart TV. The picture & sound is super.
4,Seems to work well most of the time.  Occasionally my TV tells me the device is unsupported.  Turning the TV off and on again clears it up.  It is a minor annoyance.  Picture is very good.  Sound is very good.
4,Unit works as described. Watch out for the VGA connection if your connector is flush with the case of your PC. It may have issues staying plugged in to the PC. Make sure your PC allows for tightening down the connection.
5,Worked perfectly and was pretty easy to set up everything connects where you’d expect.
4,The HDMI function works as advertised. The audio works for 4 or 5 minutes and then seizes up and make an electronic sound that is only restored by pulling power and connecting again. No use for video presentations with audio.
5,Been searching for a low priced simple connection of a Media Center PC to my TV's screen. Easy to setup and plug in VGA and Audio connections and it all comes out of my TV with no issues or distortion. Actually Works very well. Thanks Amazon for finding this device. Recommended
5,It worked without a hitch. The casing is kinda flimsy but as long as there isn't strain on the connections it's no big deal.One main gripe was the USB power connector is perpendicular to the unit which obstructs other nearby cables. They really should have put the USB as a separate dongle integrated to the unit
5,would recommend to anyone to hook older computer to hdmi.
5,I'm pleased to say that this works great.highly recommended .. Thanks for a great product 👍🐱‍🏍
5,Just what I needed to connect my old computer with a vga output to an hd tv. Great value. Easy to use.
5,Glad I found this.  The info online doesn't mention that the adaptor needs to be powered by a USB connection (which is included).  We used it at the TV after a long run of VGA cable and were fortunate that the TV had a powered USB connection.
5,I bought a network appliance that only had a VGA port on it and didn't realize none of my monitors had VGA. Bought this at the last second and it worked great! No issues at all.
5,PROS:  o affordable solution to connect my old HP notebook PC (with VGA output) to a newer video projector (with HDMI input) CONS:  o none that I experiencedWorked as advertised very pleased with this adapter.  I must confess that I was a bit skeptical this would work well for the price but I was pleasantly surprised.
5,It works very well and I'm very happy with it.  Should be aware that you will need an HDMI to HDMI cable to connect the device to the TV monitor.
5,I'm glad that I made this purchase. I used to have a converter box that did the same thing but it was a lot larger and had more wires. I plugged everything in and put it to my projector and everything works perfectly. It does feel a little bit warm while running but so far no concern of overheating.
5,Did exactly what it was supposed to. The customer loves it.
1,Plugged in as directed but TV shows no input
4,WORKS GREATAS ADVERTISED.
5,Works very well and low profile. I like the knurled screws that secure the adapter to the computer.
3,It works but due to the nature of the adapter and where it needs to plug in it's very easy for the adapter to come out. Now there are some resolutions for this but that is the biggest inconvenience besides it being a bit bulky.
1,JUNK DOESNT WORK
2,I have an hp docking station with two HDMI outputs and one VGA output. I was hoping to use this converter to raise the resolution of the monitor connected to the VGA output to HDMI level. No joy.
3,Works but not the best pic quality
5,Works like a champ! Allowed me to connect my old vga graphics card on my computer to my new 4k tv! No problems.
5,Used the FOINNEX VGA to HDMI Adapter to connect an older computer with a new TCL smart tv. Easy and effective. Recommended.
5,I connected my new monitor without any problems
4,There is no instructions that indicated it needed to have a separate power supply listen.
5,The servers I purchase come with VGA video outputs. This adapter is perfect as the USB power cable allows the unit to plug into the VGA port without the server power cord being in the way. Purchased multiple versions of this unit and this one is the perfect fit.
5,Had 1 hdmi and 1 VGA output on new pc and needed to hook up 2 monitors both only hdmi inputs. This adapter let me use the VGA out from pc to the hdmi cable. Works perfectly for 2 months now.
5,It’s exactly what I needed to connect my older computer to my HDMI tv.
3,This adapter does what it is supposed to do. However IMHO (in my humble opinion) it is very over-priced for what little it does and costs to make and the shape/design is quite poor with the retaining screws being very awkward to access/use
3,My TV wont recognize the signal. It recognizes natural HDMI signals but not signals using this device.However when paired with a monitor it does work. The display can sometimes be intermittent with occasional artifacts on the screen if the connector isn't seeded perfectly. The quality of the image is average.Overall it's way better than the cheaper versions on here. But it failed to achieve my goal.
5,Hooked this up from my work laptop VGA port to my son’s HDMI monitor. Worked like a charm. I rated it 4 stars in the picture category because there is a difference in the sharpness slightly (VGA is lower quality) but all in all it rocks. You won’t be disappointed!
5,Works exactly as per description of item
1,the vga to hdmi did not work but the other parts did  only reason why i did not return the whole thing
1,As you can see in the photo the pin got bent backwards and I’ve only inserted the supplied USB cable. It’s been plugged in once or twice while building my server rack for this to feed a KVM. Went to deploy it today and noticed this issue. Missed my return window. Regardless very poor quality control here.
3,Wish it had worked on my old Dell 755.Unfortunately my Dell wouldn't boot all the way and wouldn't let me into the Bios to try and set the video :(Screen would show but was very distorted and computer wouldn't recognize having a monitor.Maybe works on other computers but not mine- But then I can't even get mine to boot a new Bios flash either.
5,The cable I received was very well made and worked as described.  I purchased it to connect my older home assembled desktop with an RGB  output to a new 55" TCL ROKU television I am using as a computer monitor/big screen tv in my office/den. All in all my viewing experience has been exceptional.
3,I give this 3 stars instead of 5. The item works as described however when using this to convert my television to my pc screen the volume on the tv does not work. The item description should have this critical information in it.
5,When I accidentally destroyed the TV being used as the monitor for my wife's computer the replacement TV did not have a CRT connection.  I picked this device to make the conversion to HDMI and it worked immediately with no instruction or delay.  Perfect.
5,As soon as i plugged it instantly worked. Hopefully it lasts. But it's exactly what i was looking for. VGA to HDMI
2,Worked OK as far as getting items on screen.  It did convert VGA to HDMI. The bad part was the color.  Everything on the screen was pretty much some shade of blue. If you are doing text only it might be OK but if you need or enjoy a complete color palette this may not be for you. Not worth fiddling around with returning it. The cost of this was reasonable but I view my purchase of this as money wasted.
1,This product did not work for me at all
5,You need to get this if you only have VGA. You j have to convert VGA to  HDMI for sound with out that converter
5,I needed to connect an older refurbished PC to a new TV/Monitor - this cable did the trick. Seems well-made includes both audio and video connectors
5,I used this to output an older HP server to a TV.  I didn't test the sound functions as I have no use for them but quality was perfect.  It does require a spare USB for power
5,I needed this item to hook up another monitor to my computer. The adapter works PERFECTLY!
5,Dropped my laptop the day before vacation and the screen had a ton of dead pixels. Ordered this cable with same day delivery and plugged it in to the back of my laptop and the hdmi on the TV at the hotel. Back in business. It works perfect.
5,I bought this for an upcoming presentation with Powerpoint and I wanted to be able to preview it on my tv beforehand. I plugged it in changed my tv input and instantly my Powerpoint slides were up and running. This was a lifesaver in helping me prepare for my presentation.
4,Works good for the price. Little green and static if moved. Just wiggle it back and make sure it is on right.
5,Blazing fast delivery speed. Came in 2 days after order was placed... even though I had chosen the slower shipping. Hooked up the cables and works as advertised. I was able to connect my 2015 Dell Desktop to my newly bought 40" Samsung Smart TV and now I have a giant screen for working/surfing on my computer. Happy with the purchase.
5,Needed to connect an old XP machine (old HP laptop) to a new monitor with only HDMI or DVI inputs this worked great for me so I can run my old software from the XP to my current monitor then switch back to my active win 8.1 desktop in a few seconds.Chas
5,Plug and play.  Worked great to add an additional screen to my computer with 1 hdmi and 1 vga port.  Seems to be well made and needs no accessories.
4,I couldn't get the sound to work but not a big deal as I use external speakers.  I was only concerned about the video and the quality is great.
4,The VGA to HDMI adapter cable works great with no problems. However the red/white audio cables I received didn't work at all
5,Great product
5,Great price works better than expected easy to install will buy again if needed
5,It works great and really easy to use. It’s the best upgrade my 15 year old computer has ever had. Connecting to the big screen is what I’ve wanted to do for a long time with that computer. Overall I’m VERY satisfied with this product.
5,Not a lot to add item worked exactly as described super easy to hook up and a great value. Nice to be able to get rid of "computer speakers" and use the TV speakers for sound. Recommended.
3,The device works as it was advertised but I didn't like the fact that it changes the Laptop screen to VGA and didn't work with my SVGA screen.  Caused my desktop to move around and change icon locations.  After use I have to reset my desktop and screen resolution/size.  I wanted it to duplicate the laptop screen image as it was.
5,Works well - input from KVM (VGA) output to HDMI monitor.Gets slightly warm but not critical so far.
3,Unfortunately I didn't read the description well before I purchased.  It will not support the resolution of my monitor.  So while it does work I can't use it for my intended purpose.  My bad.  :-(
5,This gadget has only one purpose; to convert an older computer vga video output to the newer HDMI so I was able to connect an older Windows computer (for which I had no monitor) to an unused TV set and use THAT as a monitor. Works great!
5,Very satisfied with this product. Converts vga to HDMI straight out of the box. Added advantage of the audio cable which functions well.
4,No available instructions came with the cable.  It works on the video but haven't got the audio working but that's not a problem as I have a separate sound system.
4,easy set up and connecting to the TV Monitor.
4,Be sure you are using it the right way though... try to apply the video direction in reverse and it won't work.
5,Arrived quickly and worked as described.
3,Adapter
5,Plug and play to connect my old computer which lacked HDMI output to display on my TV which only had HDMI input.
1,My monitor is a VGA monitor. I bought this to see my phone screen on my monitor. It did not work.The idea was to convert VGA to HDMI so I could connect it to a hub which my phone is also connected to. Then I could see the phone screen on my monitor.  Did not work.
5,Connected the vga connector to my pc and the hdmi connector to the monitor. It turned on and works perfectly.
5,Works perfectly with my needs. It is connected to a small form factor dell optipex PC. Sad to see Televisions without legacy ports now a days. Even a DVI port is welcomed.
5,Updated monitor on an older computer.  Worked exactly as intended.
5,Very useful to add an extra monitor to a computer screen.
5,The max resolution for a VGA is 2048x1156. Most ultra wides are 2560x1080. This works great for standard monitors (16:9) but not ultrawide. Be careful!
5,My stupid outdated laptop doesn't have an HDMI port despite there being a slot where it would go... This was a godsend!! I would have bought one sooner had I known they existed. I love it so much! If anyone I knew had outdated hardware I would recommend this to them.
5,I was able to use this to connect an older computer of mine to a 32-inch TV. Works fine. Just had to make sure I plugged it into a USB port also. :-)
5,Simple as 123. Great for connecting old computers to a new monitor. It has audio capabilities along with mini plug / cable to go with it.
4,I like the fact I finally found one of this. It’s pretty nice product expect tightening the screws up with fat fingers
5,vga to a 2560x1440 resolution monitor works for every thing i needed it for like that the power is supplyed via usb
5,This adapter let's me connect my older laptop to my TV. Good quality connection.
5,When I connected it to my laptop a picture came up on my tv.  Was now able to use the tv as a monitor and could stream program from the laptop.
5,This worked right out of the box love it.
4,I like VGA to HDMI cable it's just perfect for my laptop to a older flat screen TV
5,Did the job just fine. Picture was a little fuzzy in startup but clear in OS GUI. Returned it because I found a used VGA monitor cheaper than the adapter.
5,Used it to connect a workstation server and laptop to a single monitor.  Very easy to install and use - hook the VGA to the computer plug in the USB to an open USB port plug the speaker connector in if you want audio from your monitor and you're done
5,Works as described Great audio & picture @ 4k
1,Picture looks like It’s 1990s
4,Little bulky and takes up a lot of available ports on my laptop but does the job of connecting to my newer tv.
4,It runs pretty hot which is a little nervewracking but no complaints otherwise
5,Tried to use cord with a VGA computer and a TV with only HDMI input but never could get signal to TV. Had to return cords. I was very sorry it did not work for me. I was later told the computer was analog & TV is digital.
4,Good product
5,The item arrived as sold and has worked very well for the purpose purchased.
5,This product really WORKS!  I was apprehensive about purchasing this cable.....but it delivered with flying colors!  Hooked the computer up to the Home Audio/Video receiver which is connected to my LG OLED 65" TV and we were able to watch anything and everything on the web (in HD)!  Very happy with the purchase!
5,prompt service and worked just as forcast
5,Just plug it into a power source plug into VGA port plug in the HDMI cable and Voila! Great picture. I was very surprised that the picture quality was improved from the VGA cable.
5,This is a great adapter. I highly recommend it
5,I bought this to couple a monitor with HDMI connector in to an older PC with only a VGA connector out. Running Linux. Worked right off. You must connect the USB pigtail coming out of the adapter (which presumably powers it). I have no complaints whatsoever.
4,Whew... don't forget to hook up the USB because it is the power supply for the cable.... drove me crazy until I figured that out.
5,Plugged it in and it worked.
5,The first one was faulty so the company sent me a replacement. Worked perfectly with my laptop
2,Not compatible
5,You need to connect an old laptop to your HDTV? Well no problem at all. Just use this adapter. I bought an extension so we can have the laptop on the other side of the room and bring up what we like on the main screen. Super sweet. Easy.
5,Exactly what I was looking for to connect a vga output to an HDMI only tv. You can use the 3.5mm to send in with the HDMI input or use the provided 3.5mm female to Eva male to use another 3.5'll male to male and run your sound out to a surround sound system. Great product.
5,Works perfect. Better than the AmazonBasics cable equivalent.
5,Managed to move a 44 inch Samsung in as a monitor for a very old PC.  Occasional issues with "Invalid Format" when coming out of sleep mode but a quick on/off of the Samsung fixes that.  I don't think that is caused by the cable.  Love my 44 inch monitor!
4,My computer
2,Although it works with my new monitor/TV Samsung TE310  The resolution of text is degraded.for video I get no sound from my TV speakers. I can use my headphones plugged into the front of the computer with USB plug.  With my old TV/Monitor with VGA to VGAI had sound for surfing from the TV speakers and the resolution was fine. When I ordered this cable I though my computer only had VGA. When I turned it around I found I also had a HDMI outlet as well as VGA. My question is If I get HDMI to HDMI cable will the sound come from my TV speakers and the text get higher resolution?
5,Good product it works as expected good quality at a reasonable price.
4,Th
5,Works great using this to connect a older computer with only vga out to a newer TV it's cheaper than a new video card and works great
5,Great adapter for the money.  Works great.
5,Bought a VGA computer and had an HDMI monitor. UGH. Researched what to do and this converter came up. Im not say that the picture is comporable to HDMI to HDMI but it works. Bought inexpensive renewed Dell it solved the issue.
5,This product worked great I needed to use my desktop pc that is kind of old for a new monitor and this was great just make sure you also use the micro usb too
1,Works but with bad picture quality
1,I've tried several different times to connect this. Not sure if it's because of my tv or if I'm doing something wrong. Finally just gave up and put it back on the packaging and it's stuffed in a box somewhere.
5,Works great and great customer service!  I thought it didn't work but vendor contacted me immediately and helped me to resolve the issue-basically-I didn't plug it in!  A USB cord is provided that when plugged into the converter and the PC provides the power for the device.  Would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
5,Worked great to hookup work laptop to two TVs. Laptop has 1 hdmi and 1 VGA plug. Plug and play.
1,Cheap build. Flimsy. Upon attachment  the soft metal screws bent necessitating pliers which shredded the metal. I had to break it to get it off. And it didn't work before it broke.
5,Didnt end up needing it had a bit of an issue with one of the cables it came with but i had extra parts. Good product.
3,Lots of additional wires to make it work  if you saw it you would not buy it I guess that is why they don't tell you
5,Until recently I have had the view that you cant get good quality in HDMI from a VGA signal. I was proven wrong by this product. Picture and Sound are are crisp as the original (in my opinion).Could have asked for any more.
5,Use this cable for my laptop to tv.  This is the second cable I have bought and they both work great!
5,Works like a charm. Used for an old computer I hooked up to a TV to use as a monitor
1,This only displays my BIOS screen when the PC is booting up then nothing. No signal. When I explained the situation to the scumbags at FOINNEX they FOINNEX is purposely misleading customers by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting the product. The product is marketed with the Title/description:"VGA to HDMI Cable 1.8m/6 Feet (Old PC to New TV/Monitor with HDMI) FOINNEX VGA to HDMI Cable with Audio For Connecting Old PCLaptop with a VGA output to NEW MonitorHDTV.Male to Male  ALL-IN-ONE"Please note the portion of the title/description: "Old PC to New TV/Monitor with HDMI". FOINNEX then has the audacity to condescendingly say "we have stated in different places in our product detailed page  but might be not clear enough so some customers have missed this" then goes on to suggest I buy more of their garbage products in one final attempt to separate me from any remaining moneys I might have to waste on inferior products. UNACCEPTABLE! I DEMAND SATISFACTION! I DEMAND A REFUND!
5,I was a little skeptical but this thing ran my HDMI monitor off an old VGI machine with zero issues.  Thank you thank you thank you!
5,Make you that the connection you need is VGA to HDMI and not the other way around.
4,Works as expected.  Nice that all necessary cables included
5,This adapter works great for me. It even allows me to see what’s on the computer screen and the TV screen simultaneously which my partner’s cord is unable to do.
5,allowed me to connect a computer with limited output but still relative;y new and working well to my newest technology.  had purchased a different one that didn't work so was most pleased with this did the first time I set it up.  very simple and easy to set up also.
5,We have an older computer that does not have an HDMI output and the VGA input on a used screen we inherited did not work.  This worked great to convert from the VGA output to the working HDMI input on the monitor.
5,Needed adapter to connect old server with VGA to new LCD with HDMI - perfect for the job.I first got one to see and test I was pretty happy and just installed 2 more on my other servers
5,Glad I read the other reviews where I learned the USB is necessary for function otherwise I would have sent it back. Plugged it in works perfect I use the USB port from my tv to power this device
4,Great
5,It works exactly as it should. The only problem I had was that the maximum resolution it would allow is about half of what my monitor should be. I am using it until I receive the graphics card that will boost the resolution.
5,Works as described.  I wish I didn't need to power it but it is a limitation because of the VGA interface.  Does what I need it to do.
5,One comment: if you have other ports near your VGA jack check for interference.  My laptop has two USB ports and they cannot be used now (the micro USB that powers up the adapter takes that space). Otherwise all good.
5,Funciona sin problemas cumple con la función de convertir la imagen
5,Works great! I do media at my LDS Curch Ward and this adapter allowed me to connect an older laptop via long hdmi extension to a projector freeing our teacher to work from the front of class. Arrived on time.  Note you must plug in the USB to 'energize' the output to work.
5,Works as expected I have an older laptop that has less than 30 hours use on it but my only option is vga out for video this cable allows me to take my 17" screen and mirror it to my 32" TV.
5,Ok
5,Bought this for our lab when setting up new hardware - now we can push the display up to the 50" LCD on the wall. The USB cable that is required to power it is a hassle but it works well for what it is.
5,This adapter is powered by an included USB pigtail and also has an audio pigtail with 3.5MM to RCA adapter.It is very well made and required no adjustments or downloads.  I am well pleased with it and would recommend to others.
4,Pero funciona de maravilla buen sonido buena imagen.
5,The VGA to HDMI cable was exactly what I needed to connect my new monitor to my older computer.  I plugged it in and Voila' everything worked perfectly.  Thank you for supplying this cable connecting the past to the future!Wally Winter
5,I have an older computer that I use with my TV to watch internet content.  This allowed me to project video and sound together through an hdmi input on my TV.  Have used it for a few months and would highly recommend it.
5,This product worked as was described and an unexpected outcome from its use was that the quality of the output to the screen was improved.  The TV that the computer is connected to now displays  more clearly.
3,I purchased this for old laptop with new smart TV connection. Install is easy. Out put quality is good as description. However it makes a lot of horizontal lines on TV every centimeter. You can see when the screen is black.
1,Burned out after 2 years. What a waste. 👎☹️
5,Was easy to install and seems to be doing it's job well. Even though my new 32in monitor has both HDMI and VGA ports I preferred HDMI so the adapter is handy. Hope it last!
5,Easy to connect to device.
5,This product worked for me plug and play
5,After trying 4 different connectors this one worked instantly with my 32 inch Samsung 1080 curved monitor. I purchased a refurbished Dell desktop from here (Amazon) which is perfect but it has a VGA connection that was unusable as is. This adapter solved the problem! Yay!
5,Works.  Using an old computer to hook up to a TV.  So far everything is working as expected.
5,I travel with an older laptop that does not have an HDMI port. I often give presentations at outside firms many of which do not VGA capability. I have used this 2X in the past week to give my presentation and it worked well both times so I am very satisfied with purchase.
5,This product's simplicity and overall audio/video quality make it the "ONE" to purchase; best value for price product.
5,I liked how easy it is to set up and the price just makes it all better I've only had it for a few days and so far it's perfect
5,If you have an old PC and are purchasing a Screen without a VGA output this is the adapter you need. Simply connect the adapter to the back of your PC and connect the HDMI to the adapter and to your new screen
5,Finally a vga to hdmi! I have only been able to find hdmi and dvi to vga. Works great. Solved the problem of having two hdmi devices and only one hdmi port on our computer.
5,I have looked everywhere for one of these and bought different ones from different stores this one worked great just the picture quality is not that great but for what I'm using for which is homeschool it does the job
5,Works GREAT!  No issues at all.  Just make sure your going from Computer VGA to Monitor HDMI.
5,Got this product in today and hooked it up with no problem. Works well so far. Have tried other cables but never could bring the sound over This has all the cords i needed all in one. So far great product.
1,Did not work not much more to say.
5,It work on my old  HP notebook 2000  laptop but I have to buy it without the little side that is to hold it on place because it doesn't have it  but other than that is perfect.
5,This was just what I needed for a HP Desktop that didn't have a HDMI input. Took some handling to get the audio portion going. But once I did the cable worked like a charm. GREAT Product!!!
2,I wanted to connect my computer to the large screen TV It blinked on and off and worked for about 4 seconds all together then it stopped. I hyad things like it before. They didn't work very well either. Just get a large screen for a computer that is a computer screen. Mixing TV and computer does not work very well.
5,Easy to set up and works perfectly!  No complaints or problems.......Thank you!
5,works great
1,It didn't  work and my computer guy said he's had  problems with this  product and it will not allow my monitor to come onCustomer service is bad. Don't waste your time and mony.
4,it works
5,It works amazing from Pc to tv via hdmi
5,Had to do a little research online to figure out why I was getting a format issue message on my TV. But once I found the answer it worked like a charm.
2,Not at all impressed with this and am sending it back. The connections (particularly the power connector on the unit itself) are far too loose and wobbly. One has to push in too hard in my opinion to make it finally get power.
5,I’m always unsure if these kinds of purchases will work out. Pleased to say that (so far) this item performs exactly as it should. VGA to HDMI success.
5,The best tool ever easy to set up and has ast connection I recommend this to everyone who wants to buy the best item ever.😀😀😀😀
5,Am using this unit in middle of multi-computer switch / VGA splitter (1 in-4 out) / the VGA-HDMI converter / HDMI transmitter / HDMI receiver / TV in front of church.Works perfectly/
5,Works very well using an old (2010) Dell Vostro laptop (VGA) to a Samsung 2013 Smart TV (HDMI).  No picture size adjustment necessary and the audio is excellent.
5,worked as advertised
5,Crispy picture and audio quality. Great value for money
5,Worked like a charm.  Great product....
5,This thing works so well! It's fool proof despite not having any directions. I can set my TV up as a monitor now which is great! I love it.
5,Worked exactly as described.  Picture and sound much better than expected.
5,Was sceptical this would work but it did.connected my PC with vga to the HDMI port on my hdtvused a USB port and the headphone port on my PC and I have picture and sound through my TV.great solution for computers without a HDMI port.
5,No issues so far running 1080p from an older laptop to an LCD!
5,Works perfectly with my 2010 ASUS laptop and modern HDTV. Sound plays out of the audio jack and comes though my surround sound. Switch the TV setting to wide and it fills the screen perfectly. Sufferfest never looked and sounded so good on a 65" TV!
5,it incredible works as it says it would . make sure you guys know what you are buying because this product cant go wrong  it works VGA to HDMI  not HDMI to VGA or on any way you like  only VGA to HDMI very simple.
5,Wonderful cable and works as described. It converts the signal properly and has no issue of feed dropping out. I was happy that audio worked as well. This really helped me use an older computer to connect to a newer TV as a monitor.
5,Works great for my new home set up.
5,Perfect for what I needed computer to Hdmi on hdtv with Sound saved me from buying a expense video card installing it installing drivers etc. Love plug and play just that easy thanks .
3,This DVI to HDMI adapter works as advertised.  Amazon delivery was late as often happens when USPS is the carrier
4,It works pretty good  just need to be better quality
5,Old laptop without HDMI port is what I had. This allowed me to connect to the laptops VGA port and connect the other end to the Tv's HDMI port. I picked this one as it had a audio connection to HDMI also.
5,Works as advertised
5,Just got it today and it works great. Really easy setup. I have a really old laptop that I wasn't sure it work with But no issues.
5,I have an old PC with only VGA output. This adapter converted that signal to HDMI so now I can view the PC and three Raspberry Pi's via an HDMI switch all on the same HDTV! Works great! I have not experimented with the audio so far.
3,it works fine connecting a newer monitor to my older laptop. The connector is bulky and protruding with the screws hard to handle. So it can dangle there precariously and easily comes off.
5,I tried other computers to work with my 27" curved monitor but they didn't work. I installed this on a Thnk Pad and it is fabulous.  Don't even hesitate. It works!
5,This works perfectly. I use it to show my laptop on my TV.
5,This is a great product! I use it to connect my flatscreen TV and my older desktop computer that doesn't have an HDMI and it works perfectly! Sound and video all transfered without any super complicated adapter and multiple cords. Very pleased!
5,I am happy i stumbled upon this I have an old PC which only has a VGA port but my monitor is only HDMI the VGA to HDMI adapter worked the first time no issues!
4,Easy way to connect our computer to the new TV.
2,came with a bad usb cable needs more power than a usb port can putout and cant see lower resolutions of the bios.  JEEUNK!
5,My husband got a new monitor for Christmas and it needed an adapter and we tried several times to find the right adapter and this one was it! It was a good price for a great product!
5,I loved the product easy to use and saved the day for displaying a webinar from an older laptop. The sound and picture quality was fantastic as well.
5,Easy to set up. Great quality on workmanship and  picture. Competitive price.
5,I was able to use this converter to connect my TV to my computer.  It has worked great for me.
5,Got to my Amazon pickup location super quick. Packaged well and no broken parts. Worked with my old HP laptop just as intended and wasn't hard to figure out. The seller's videos and pictures helped a lot. Thanks!
5,Product was delivered on time.  Product did the job I expected.  Good transaction.  Even includes RCA inputs for audio.  Just plug it in and go!
4,It worked fine with my old laptop to new monitor.
1,I bought to use with an old tv/monitor so I could plug in a fire stick but it just does not work. I tried every setup I could imagine and the monitor just said “no input”
5,Finally found the item that I've have spent months and a couple hundred dollars looking for. It works that's the main thing for me.
5,This is just what I was looking for very inexpensive and the picture quality is great. There is a lot of extra wire that I don't use.
1,I'm sure this is a perfectly good adapter for a monitor that sits 2 feet from the central processing unit so that the adapter can be plugged in to the monitor the speakers and the UPS connection it needs for power but the description doesn't mention any of that and I can't use it.  Even my tech doesn't understand why an adapter of this type would require all of these extra connections.  Plus there are NO instructions that came with the thing so no one can figure out a work-around - if there is one.  My CPU is 5 feet from the monitor so I have to return it and get a different adapter that doesn't require all these 'special' connections.  That has delayed my ability to use my monitor yet another week.  NOT HAPPY HERE!
5,ok
5,My work computer did not have a HDMI output so I use this to adapt my VGA to a big TV via HDMI.
5,Very well built device.  It allows me to connect an old VGA out laptop to a big new HDMI in monitor.
5,Exactly what I needed for my older model desktop!
5,Did exactly what I needed it to do: connect a laptop to a large TV so I could stream The Teaching Courses. And with the two extra ports the sound came through great! The VGA was the perfect size for the laptop port.
5,We received the order quickly.  It was a breeze to connect and begin to use.  We will be ordering more units for other conference rooms.
5,This product was easy to install and works (to-date) as promoted. No issues.
5,This device allowed me to connect my laptop computer with only VGA output to my HDMI monitor.  The HDMI image was adjusted by changing the laptop output screen resolution setting.
5,Two of them were just what was needed to convert a KVM Switch from being VGA-only to HDMI-only PCs.
5,What is it that I like best about the VGA to HDMI Converter is that it works perfectly the price was really good based on appearance it should last a long time and delivery was quick.
5,Was purchased to add an additional monitor. Easy set up no issues. Great product. Thanks
3,Works on some displays but not all.  I tested the VGA to HDMI cable at home it worked.  But when I tried to give a presentation at another place it didn't work.  I think there may be some compatibility issue.
5,Product does exactly what its supposed to do. Connects older computers to the hdmi port of new tvs. Very easy to use. Worked on the first try.
5,It was plug and play very easy to hook up
5,It’s difficult enough having to connect old to new but we were able to accomplish work from home while recovering from surgery. Thanks for the ease of use and functionality.
5,This actually turned out to be a good product that works great. Very pleased. Have used it with two different computers to project to our TV and it works fine with both of them. (You will need your own HDMI cable...in case you were wondering.)
1,After properly connecting the product all I can get is a no signal on my TV. It was working fine with a standard VGA cable but I wanted to try this for HDMI and I now get no signal and black screen. I wanted to get a refund but apparently I have to pay for shipping costs to send it back so I will just trash it instead.
5,Perfect for the application.
5,Works as expected. Very easy to install. Happy with the purchase.
4,Needed to be longer. Otherwise nice. Need to figure the smart TV. Landscape deal.
5,Worked perfect for setting up VGA Laptop to HDMI monitor.  I was worried that the audio cable wouldn't reach the opposite side of the laptop.  Well is had plenty of cord length.  No issues or disappointment.  Thank you
5,Good value for $ spent
4,Works as advertised. The screws for the VGA input are awkwardly positioned making it difficult to screw & unscrew.
5,Along with switch  let me get vga monitor off of desk
5,I Purchased a new monitor that was HDMI compatible. My older computer was not. So this device made my older computer worked perfectly with the new monitor.
4,Working so far. Works MUCH better than a VGA to HDMI Converter Box.
5,Ok
5,No complaints with this product. Its exactly what i needed to connect my old acer laptop to my 40 inch tv.  Works perfect. And i couldnt be happier. Its small and sleek easy to use and understand. Powers on from your spare usb port.
5,I needed a cable to connect a  VGA pc to a new monitor with HDML connection only.  This cable worked very well.  The length met my needs.
5,It works great with all computers I tried. Length of HDMI cable is good. The USB cable could be longer to allow connection to a charger.  Would buy again.
5,A+
5,This product works as advertised.  Plug and play.  I use it to connect a desktop pc to a 55' led tv.
5,Had an old laptop and a new flat screen t.v. and it worked as described. Amazing picture quality and sound from laptop to t.v was great. Works great for intended purpose. Thank you.
3,Did not work out as expected
3,Screen sharpness is low and my monitor keeps losing connection and goes blank with this VGA to HDMI cable.Sharpness is perfect when connected with HDMI to HDMI cable so it's definitely cable issue.
5,This item worked great to connect an older computer (vga) to a new tv (HDMI).  The best feature is that it also transmits the sound from the computer to the tv.  Great product.  Definitely recommend.
5,Cable worked very well and is of good quality.  Remember that the cable will not work unless you plug in the USB part of it.  Audio function worked good as well.  No ghosting of image as I originally expected.
5,Worked exactly like I needed it to work.  I used this cable to go from a VGA female connector on a Dell T320 mini-server to a Dell monitor that only had MDP/DP and HDMI and this cable gave me the functionality required.
5,Item worked perfectly. Added plus was the built in HDMI cable.
5,You need to add a power supply source option  (usb wall plug in type) when you don"t have access to a usb port.  This wii increase cost about $10
5,Works great with an older laptop that doesn’t have an hdmi output.
4,everything you need for old pc or laptop to new projector
1,It’s another junk that ended in my garbage bin and after that I ended buying another on a walk-in shop
5,It works and that's enough for me.
5,The length of the cord is what I really needed. It worked great! I needed this for an early meeting and received this just in time. Thanks!
4,connected a laptop to a projector
5,Product works as described. Easy to understand instructions quick installation and quality graphics once installed.
5,This is working fabulously for me.  I have an older refurbished desktop computer that I am using with a newer 4K monitor and it works beautifully with it the quality of the picture is flawless.
3,The picture looked liked female vga. It was not
4,USB power source required
5,Hooked up a ten year old PC to the new TV and now we can surf the web and shop on Amzn... Very happy ... Installation takes less than five minutes.....
5,It worked just fine. But the computer that I bought it for didn't work. New computer came with new cables. I'll just keep it on hand in case I need it later.
5,My cable came exactly when they said it would come it is good quality and hooked up right away. Picture and screen quality are both great and the cable was best priced!
5,Got this to connect my old Elmo to a new HDMI input projector. Works like a charm. I just wish the USB cable was a bit longer.
5,Product just as described works great easy to install
5,This worked great to connect my old pc to a newer tv that only has hdmi. Did have to make an adjustment to the tv to have it displayed correctly but otherwise no issues!
5,A++
5,does exactly what it’s supposed to
5,I have been using this cable for about two months now. Works great just followed the advice I saw when researching my cable choices and made certain to plug in all the components and it works like a charm.
4,Just as described
5,Worked perfect for a old pc to connect to a newer tv!
5,Worked great for my application. It allowed me to use an HDTV with only an HDMI input as a PC monitor with only an VGA  output. I didn't need the audio cable but it's there if needed.
5,Cable works well with both video and audio.  Be sure to connect the USB plug on cable.  It supplies the power needed to perform conversion.  When I initially connected cable I thought it didn't work (didn't read instructions).
1,overly long adapters always cause problems causing too muahc strain to the connector and often won't fit if space say behind the PC is limited;the most severe problem however that not all colours were transmitted here:  NO SIGNAL for REDso I had the defective unit returned
5,Loved it I was in need of a cord so I can do stuff for people with older PC's and I had a TV and monitor with no vga port any loner. Works wonders :).
5,Excellent product. Better than described!
5,Works great 👍🏼 we transmit to 3 HD TV’s from our 10 year old Samsung laptop for church.  Sound and picture are very good - no negatives yet.
5,😁 This helped me hook up my Guitar and Computer Midi system to my spare 60 inch screen. Easy hook up and the separate audio let me have the sound go to my mixer. Highly recommend this product!
5,Works very will. Hooked my old gaming computer to my new tv. wish I would have had this back in my gaming days.
5,Worked easy set up
5,now if the computer would work I would be in business
5,Cant do better then this unit for the price.
1,Connected to TV and image is displayed yellow color. Connected hdmi monitor and same result. Additional now CPU VGA port of two are showing yellow when we connect any other monitor without converter.
5,This product did everything everything that it was advertised to do --- and the price was of great great value. A real good buy if you need a cable that preforms.
4,Works fine except it always takes three tries to sync to my HDMI connected monitor
5,No complaintsit does what is supposed to.
5,Precisely what I expected. Very well packaged and with protective dust caps on the connectors. Clear concise usage guide included.
4,Good price
5,Worked great for me to take an older laptop go from vga to hdmi. Then I used a splitter for it to drive to different monitors.
5,Thanks for helping me be able to connect my computer after I realized I had the wrong kind of cable. This worked well. Picture was great. Easy to use.
5,Adapter was easy to install and works fine.
3,It was able to convert the picture but on a 22” tv the picture was too large put 32” tv on and still too large a picture. No way to adjust the size.
5,This cable was exactly what I needed to connect my old Toshiba laptop to a new Dell monitor. The bonus was the maker’s all out commitment to customer satisfaction!
3,The product is great for what it is supposed to do.  The sound is not so great and i don't know why.
5,Includes sound using computer ear phone jack.  So now I have a 30 " computer screen with sound using an old flat screen TV.
5,We needed to have a cable to transfer our computer screen and audio to the tv.  This works fine and we have had no problems.
2,My computer have three outputs DVI HDMI VGAI have an extended monitors one using the HDMI port the other the VGA which I was trying to make it HDMI with this adapter but the picture quality is so poor and this is important for me since I am a photographer and picture quality is important for editing pictures....I might use this for another purpose if I need it but I don't recommend it if you need good quality image
5,Absolutely love it.
5,It works well I'm happy with it.
5,As described works well
5,I have been using this for about 2 months now to have my older computer hook up to my tv and it has worked flawlessly. I forget I'm even using an adapter.
5,Product was correct. Fast on time delivery!
5,VGA to HDMI on my newer TV. Now I can watch my old videos that are still on my old laptop which only has VGA-out.
5,I previously purchased one of these and I claimed it didn't work.  Well I did finally got it to work and this one I just received works great too! Great product and my apologies for the review previously sent.
5,I connected and it works without any problem. I wish it was a bit chipper as HDMI to VGA cables are less than half the price of this cable.
5,Bought this product for my dad so he could connect his computer to our tv and play karaoke. The product worked perfect and would buy again from this company.
5,Accomplished what we needed to do! (monitoring security camera views on a big-screen TV rather than a computer monitor)
5,Product is great and works as it should. Remember to plug in the small plug along with the VGA. It wouldn't work without plugging it in. Works just fine and came in perfectly.
5,Should have did this months ago. Just plug it in to the right spots and now I can use my HDMI TV for a monitor.
5,Nice worked fine
5,Worked exactly as advertised to convert ye old docking station vga to hdmi on my new laptop
5,This is the product that I need. It was as easy to use & install.
5,Computer to monitor connection
1,Item doesn't work. I connected VGA to my computer as well as USB and 3.5 audio. The signal is glitching and doesn't go through. Returned
3,first one i bought fell apart in a weekhad to buy again
5,Instead of spending $400-$700 on a large monitor I bought this & a 32" TCL TV for $125.  Works like magic!!!
4,As advertised
5,Picture and audio came out clear and it was just an easy plug and play
5,I've had it for almost a month was very surprised how well it works and how little it cost. Very easy to install. Great product
1,This product did not work for me. I really don’t want to buy a monitor. I live small apartment with little space.I’ve tried 2 different cables. I guess I can not hook my tower to my smart TV.It was worth the try.
5,Works perfectly with my Dell and it also takes the audio from the computer to the TV
5,Bien
5,This product help connect both of my monitors to my PC and using them as individual monitors.
5,Me fue de mucha utilidad y el precio es acorde
5,The quality of manufacturing is good. The cable looks and feels durable. It works exactly as advertised and I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,My older laptop only has a VGA output but this allows me to use a second HDMI monitor and the picture quality is good.
5,This enables me to hook up my PC to my TV.
1,I tried this on my laptop docking station and my laptop itself. It will not display anything. I even tried different power outlets for the device to see if it was not getting enough power. Came to the conclusion that the adapter does not work.
5,Worked exactly as described easy connection to the computer (you need an open USB port to provide power) with the VGA end connect the HDMI end to the monitor and voila.
5,Arrived quickly easy to connect works perfectly. Projects from the vga port of your computer screen to any HDMI port of TV monitor projector etc... and includes sound.
5,This adapter works great with my Lenovo laptop VGA port to HDMI Vizio TV no problem. 👍
5,works perfect using two monitors but only had one hdmi on my hard drive
5,Plug & play.... Now I can see old movies that's on my window 7  netbook & view on my flat screen TV...  Glad I've found this.
5,It was easy to hookup. I am using it to hook up my TV as a second monitor and it works just fine.
5,I am very pleased with how well this adapter works. I would recommend this if you need to go from vga to hdmi.
5,Works exactly as described. Simple to install. Packaging was easy to open. I’d buy from this vendor again.
5,Works as advertised. The picture does not have same quality as an HDMI to HDMI. However the picture fits the TV screen perfectly where the other computer did not.
4,Works well
5,Cable design and length.  Prefect fit no software needed.
5,Worked exactly as it should
5,Easy to install Plug and in and your ready to go. Don't forget usb as that's where this magic cable gets its power
1,Not sure what's going on with this but I can't get it to work at all.I have tried connecting reconnecting re-starting the computer firing everything up and then turning on the TV firing everything up with the TV already on and all combinations/permutations including all of the above.  Nothing works.The other issue that I'm noticing is that my Windows 10 computer is telling me that the last USB item that was connected is not recognized and may not be working properly.  Isn't the USB supposed to be only for power?  Am I missing something?  If the USB is attempting to connect to my computer there may be something inside that's not just power and I'm not necessarily liking that possibility.
4,Did exactly what it was supposed to do.
4,Quick shipping works just as expected
5,Worked as they should. A great price. Must make sure that you use the USB for power to device.
5,Arrived as expected.  Works excellent out of the box. No need to search for drivers and no software necessary.
5,Product worked perfectly to hook my old PC up to my new HD tv! Great picture quality and this one actually works unlike some other adapters!!!! Very pleased!
5,Don’t worry just buy it. It works perfectly.
5,You must have a USB plug nearby. It works perfectly for me because my situation has a USB adjacent to the VGA port.
4,Good
5,As described. Used it to connect my desktop (vga) to my TV (HDMI)
5,Does everything I need it to do
5,Used to export VGA from a computer to a HD TV.Hooked up all the cables and got a nice picture on the HDTV!
5,I love it!
5,I like it in general and it works well with my LG TV because since my LG TV doesn’t have a VGA input so I can just use hdmi input instead.
5,Very simple install I replaced an older converter block which everything plugged into this is way better and the picture is clearer.
5,Does what it says it will do and the picture quality is good.
1,There is a USB cable that powers the conversion of the VGA signal to HDMI... unfortunately it was on the same end as the HDMI plug instead of with the VGA as shown in the picture. The cable was useless. Waiting for a replacement... would change my rating if the new one does what it is supposed to do.
5,GHARPHIC and Infonation helping to select corrected item which we want
2,This does not work....I have tried with a DVD player with AV cables to HDMI TV output. Also I tried laptop VGA to HDMI for a TV and could not get a signal to view program on television. I did not have use of these cables until a later time so unfortunately the return window has passed. I bought 2 cable units and neither one works. I am very disappointed and lost out on my money.
5,I just got mind yesterday and tests it and it works.I would recommend this to anybody that has a desktop or laptop with no HDMI port.
5,Took less than five minutes to hook up.
5,After two trips to BEST BUY and getting told what I needed I got tired of being sold items I Didn't need!! This was what I needed and I was reallyrelieved and stoked!!
5,Excellent. Computer auto-recognized the adapter and adjusted accordingly while maintaining input-specific settings control.
5,Good
5,Use this to put a nvr with  vga output only into a modern tv and it worked flawlessly. only had to follow the included instructions and had a beautiful picture.
5,I connected a desktop computer with a tuner to my TV. I had recorded OTA programs and this allowed me to watch them on the large screen TV rather than the monitor.
4,Good enough!!
4,VGC>HDMI CORD WORKS GREAT FOR MY PURPOSE.......THANX AMAZON.......GV
5,Review headline said it all
5,In my case it didn’t work until I figure out that the USB cord attached to it. The USB must be plugged into the computer to power the adapter.
5,I have it connected to a DVR. Worked perfect on all available output resolutions.
5,Good product even  Adapts audio from VGA to HDMI  With included chords in adapters works perfectly
5,I have an older Lenovo x200 think pad took 5 min to hook up. easy  works great. Picture and sound . To a Visio smart tv
5,This was just what I needed.  I looked at several electronic stores they sold me items that didn't work.  Works great  Thanks
5,Cable works well.
4,It works.
5,Works
5,Just what i needed for my DVR that has VGA
5,Didn't work for me but I think it was my Trueos driver that caused the problem.  Gave it to a friend and it worked great for him on a different OS.
5,Excelente muchas gracias
5,This was a very good cost effective solution to when our Samsung TV quit working with Amazon Prime.  Easy to use.
3,I would have liked it better if there was an actual click when changing ports though.
5,Loved this product and worked perfectly with the USB port for my laptop.
5,Easy useGood Quality
5,Works great with my old laptop with VGA. Able to connect to the new 4K TV with only HDMI inputs with ease. Highly recommend .
5,100% works!!! I have tried multiple adapters but this is the only one that was able to connect to one of my screens while using a laptop docking station.
3,SCREEN AND PICTURE QUALITY COULD BE BETTER.  IT SHOULD BE SOLD WITH A LONGER HDMI CABLE.
1,USB on the incorrect end of cable. USB was on the HDMI end of cable. Should be on the VGA side of cable. Cable is useless. This is the 2nd defective cable I've received.
5,Exactly what was needed to connect my computer to my tv.
5,Like it. It works good!
3,Hasta el momento no he logrado ver en mi televisión la imagen de mi computadora
5,We had a unique set up with a customer and this adapter is what was needed. The alternate methods would have cost my customer much more money..
5,This exceeded my expectations.  I'm able to drive 1920x1080P from my older laptop without HDMI and the sound and video are perfect!
5,Ended up I ordered the wrong thing. I needed to go from HDMI to VGA. I think it only goes the OTHER way right?
2,The little screws are too short and very flimsy so it won't give a connection to the monitor. I will be returning the item.
5,Good quality of video
4,excellent product
5,Product works as described! Picture quality is just as good as 1080p I couldn’t tell a difference from using a HDMI cord
1,It doesn't work it shows there's signal when unplugging and plugging it back in but if it's plugged in and ready to go theres 'no signal'. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
5,I have very old laptop.  I purchased this cable so I could connect to my TV.It works great.
5,Very good price simple to connect + HDMI cable straight to your TV set.Haven't use it for long yet
5,After months of trying to get my new computer screen connected I finally found a product that does what it say! Thank you!
5,Worked just as described great work around for a PC stuck with just a VGA port.
5,Plugged as instructed it in and it worked using an old laptop Dell E6500 using ubuntu using newer tv with HDMI
5,Exactly what I needed to hook my Vizio TV up to my HP desktop PC.
4,Worked wellThanks.
5,Although it's kind of spaghetti mess from the USB and audio cords when installed it works great on my tv
5,Nice product.. will purchase more if needed
5,Easy to connect to computer and TV. Love how it goes full screen on my TV.
5,I had went through a lot of cables that wouldn’t work. This cable was a saving grace to get my tv and computer connected!
5,Used it to hook a new tv up to a security camera dvr. It works no problems.
5,Used it to run around a graphics card. Works
4,I bought it for my friend.
5,Worked perfectly as described to connect from older PC VGA connection to HDMI computer monitor used as an extended desktop. Super-easy to connect at 6ft more than enough cable.
5,Installed new curved Samsung screen on old HP computer and needed the converter. Works as described and have had no issues.
5,Connected Dell desktop pc running Windows 10 to 4k TV.  Easy to install and great picture.
5,Great product good quality at a very affordable price. The image that have out of this adaptor is crystal clear with crisp audio. Buy it you won't be disappointed
5,Simple to use.My laptop was able to instantly make use of it to deliver an extended or duplicated display to our large TV monitor.
1,Tried VGA to HDMI cable from my old Windows XP tower to my Acer aspire Z24 HDMI input side and does not work. This input on the Acer has worked with various other devices. I did test the cable with an old Dell all in one and the HDMI input did work. Unfortunately this doesn't serve my purposes. So beware this product does not work with all computers. Considering the price I will not go through the trouble of returning it. But buyer beware.
5,Delivers what it promises
5,Used this to link my computer to an old HD TV and now I have a dual monitors.
5,My son cracked his laptop screen. I was able to use this cable to hook up his laptop to his TV and he is back in business.
5,Does the job it is supposed to and appears to do it well.  I'd buy it again.
5,Excellent converter exports from VGA to HDMI cleanly which is more than I can say for some of the connectors I tried previously.
5,Used it on a Windows 7 laptop and worked perfectly hooked directly into HDMI tv.
3,I did not need this and I might send back as an unnecessary item
5,Works fine - great picture and AUDIO ...previous audio cables did not work. THANK YOU! So happy! :)
5,It works just as a regular HDMI connection. It is not very long  so you must have the VGA source close
5,Worked perfectly.  Just be sure you choose the right type.
5,and for not very much money too.
5,Works well as intended  great length3.5 audio cable can be plunged in to an alternate device while connected to pc.overall its ok
5,I bought three of them.They were great. 😁 📺
2,Works but my screen keeps cutting on and off when it uses alot of white. I think it might be the power but I have no idea how this thing works.
5,Easy to install instructions are pretty straight forward. Picture quality and color is good. Excellent price.
5,Good stuff. Worked as advertised to connect my old "headless" storage server to my 4K television for occasional maintenance tasks. Good purchase at least so far.
5,Met or exceeded my expectations for a VGA to HDMI adapter converter.
5,Like cause I use this with an older laptop and connect to a newer tv
5,Good buy. Buy it
5,Handy item to run computer into a tv
5,Worked well I broke it but that was my fault
1,The mini usb cable does not fit snugly into it and moves around causing it to lose connection  when you try to press it in the connectors break...its cheaply made.
5,Excellent!!!
1,Item returned. Would not work for my intended application.
5,I had difficulty finding a low-end adapter that could take the vga from an Aspeed AST2400 on a Supermicro X10 board to hdmi.  This did the trick.
5,Works like a charm--easy to use! Able to hook up an old computer running Windows 98 (of all things) to a brand new flat screen tv.
1,i TRIED THIS LITERALLY FOR HOURS AND HOURS. I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF...DIFFERENT HDMIs 2 DIFFERENT COMPUTERS EVEN 2 DIFFERENT TVs AND ALMOST EVERYTIME IT SAID "NO SIGNAL." MANAGED TO GET IT TO WORK ONE TIME WITHOUT AN EXTENSION HDMI WITH COMPUTER ON FLOOR NEXT TO TV BUT WHEN I ATTACHED HDMI EXTENSION CABLE STOPPED WORKING...AND TRIED MULTIPLE CABLES WHICH WERE TESTED TO WORK FINE WHEN ATTACHED TO CABLE BOX SO I KNOW IT WASN'T THE HDMI.THE COMPANY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER! VERY AGGRAVATING...WASTED MANY HOURS TRYING TO GET THIS JUNK TO WORK!!
5,Worked PERFECT!  Just make sure you plug BOTH the HDMI AND USB into the back of your computer.  Once that’s done it works perfect 😎
5,Dont forget these are one way cables. Cable is thick and heavy duty. Very nice quality
1,Connection was straight forward but it would not work on my Packard Bell 406CD (mid-90's). The system works fine when connected to the Packard Bell CRT monitor but did nothing connecting with the HDMI to my Acer Predator 27" monitor. I tried 2 different power sources USB to ac outlet adapter and to the USB connected to my fairly new Dell XPS 8930 (these older systems don't have USB so another power source is necessary). It may be something I'm not connecting properly or compatibly issues. Apparently from the reviews it appears to work for some but it didn't work for me.
5,After trying numerous HDMI cables inputs and outputs I finally realized that this thing requires USB power (cable included). Worked great after that.
5,Good product  stationary laptop connected top 32" tv. Works great
5,Needed this in a pinch.  Worked great.  Easy to install.
5,Converting the signal from VGA to HMDI on the arcade video games that I make
5,Hard to find item.  Finally found this one.  Old computer needing to connect VGA output to HDMI TV screen.  Works great.  Very pleased.
5,Does what it is designed to do
5,Would there be a longer cord for model
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Worked perfect......for an old computer I play music videos and karaoke .....perfect
5,Did the job swimmingly! Good product!
5,Upon using the cable it helped made the display of my computer more detail on where I didn't have any trouble. The installation is quick and easy.
5,IF YOU DONT HAVE A DISPLAY PORT THIS IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE !VERY GOOD QUALITY AND NICE DIMENSIONS OVERALL.
1,This was going to ve used to send tge output from a desktop pc tower to a small 32" TV but it didn't work at all. We tried various USB power options and even tested the monitor output with a regular monitor to verify the VGA was working.  Unfortunately this was a waste of money
5,Have older tower with VGA source and new monitor with HDMI works like a charm.
5,It arrived quickly and worked as described.  The easiest way to turn a tv into a monitor.
5,Purchased this to use an older computer on an HD TV worked well with good picture quality.
5,Works just as I expected. Very happy with the results.
5,Didn't read that you have to plug in the USB to power the converter inside apparently. Once I did that it worked perfectly.
5,Fantastic. Was looking to connect an older mini PC without and HDMI connector to my newer smart TV with only HDMI ports. Works perfectly.
5,Great for connecting that older laptop to a newer TV.  Saved me from having to buy a new computer.
5,Great product  at a great price! My computer  looks amazing  running thru hdmi!
5,My CPU did not have an HDMI or DVI port  this connector resolved the problem
1,I tried to use this item to convert my VGA cord into an HDMI to use a wireless projector. When it didn't work I asked my job's technology technician to assist me to see if I had done something wrong or that my wireless projector piece was malfunctioning. The problem is the adaptor. We could never understand why an adaptor would need a power source ... So I know I was too late to return but please save your money and do not buy this product.The shipping and packaging was very nice. No delay or physical damage to the package. The adaptor just didn't work ...
5,Good quality item
1,Turned on my laptop one morning and flashing screen and no taskbar is what I had to try to work on; worked great until then. Do not recommend for VGA Laptop port to HDMI cord for Monitor.
5,Great product!
5,This was a plug and play right out of the box i'am good to go now
5,As soon as I got the cable and then plugged it in I was receiving a signal on my television from my computer! Thank you so much
5,Did exactly as advertised.
5,Worked like advertised and very well at that installing it was so easy and works great with my tv
5,Item worked just as described with no issues.  Very satisfied.
5,Purchased for my son for hooking older PC to new/larger monitor.  Price was good delivery was fast -- so far working very well no problems.
5,Solved a connection issue for us work as expected plug and play.
5,GOOD
5,Love it! Projects an old laptop to a tv with great picture quality
5,I have vintage servers to mount my lab and I need to extract video signal to perform setup and maintenance
1,Very poor design re the mounting screws.  It is next to impossible to get them started because there is no way to put enough pressure on top of the screw.  This is made even harder because the screws are so short.  Once I finally got a screw started (by wedging it with a knife) it was held on by barely one thread.  Note:  this adapter requires power from a USB port.  Not a big deal the cable is provided but I don’t recall seeing this in the description.
5,Works as advertised was easy to connect now we can use our computer with our new smart TV that did not have a PC video input connection.
5,Works great.  My new HDMI monitor recognized it immediately.
2,It works but as you can see in my picture it doesn't appear that a lot of effort was made to have a sturdy USB port for the power.
5,All is good but there was no manual so a little bit confused to set up
5,Use it as intended and it works perfectly !
5,works well!
5,Received quickly and this item was exactly what I needed!
5,This product work perfectly. Now we're watching online movies on our 75' TV with audio coming directly from the TV.

5,Correct Part as described by the picture and description
5,Needed it fast it got me out of a pinch good length.  Worked as intended plug and play.
5,Loved it ... was exactly what I needed to connect my Laptop to my HDTV - and best part it saved me hundreds of dollars

5,The HDMI out put went out on my NVR this was an easy fix works great
5,This adapter works great and is easy to install.
5,works great-pluged from vga to 32" tv/monitor and pluged my 60" into hdmi on pc-now I have the best of both!
5,Works as advertised.  Max resolution is 1920x1080 which is less than the 2560x1080 my monitor can support but it still looks pretty decent.
3,Didn't do what I thought is was going to do. Too lazy to return it.

5,Very easy to use VGA to HDMI. A very good purchase!
5,Exactly what I needed  works fantastically just plug and play  Worked perfectly for my old pc to show on my lcd screen
5,Did exactly what I needed for 1/4 of the price!
5,good
2,It didn’t work on my Linux system as I wanted but it did work on my Win7 system. So I can’t give this too bad a review.
5,Product worked as advertised with no issues.  Very satisfied
2,I’m using this to convert VGA out on a laptop docking station to HDMI in on a newer monitor.  HDMI direct to the laptop picture is great with VGA from the docking station converted to HDMI to the monitor the text is fuzzy.

3,Works to transfer image from p/c to tv but sound stays with computer.

5,easy to use short coupling & gets the job done
5,Súper bien para usar CPU vga a una pantalla HDMI
1,Wanted to plug this into the back of our projector that doesn't have an HDMI port to convert it to HDMI. I used the same HDMI to VGA cord we already use and plugged the male HDMI into the female HDMI of this device then the VGA into my laptop and I got nothing. Using that same cable but flipped around and without this device it works perfectly so it's not the other cable.
5,delivery was on time and the adaptor works great.
1,Did not work could just be bad via on my monitor but...
5,Product works as described.
5,Exactly what I needed to get an older style laptop connected to a newer led tv HDMI input for viewing
5,Great plug and go.
5,Exactly what I ordered.  The description was extremely helpful to understand what cable would work for the application I needed.
5,Was looking for this for a while
1,Tried to connect my old laptop to my TV with this. Didn't work. Either it can't convert an older laptop resolution into the 1080p or 4k that the TV accepts or it can't handle going through an HDMI switcher. But since the switcher did its job and switched properly I strongly suspect that it just can't convert to laptop resolutions to TV resolutions. And that sort of defeats the whole purpose of buying it (for me anyway).
5,Plugged the cables in powered it up. It worked.  Not much more to add.
5,Great products had some worries at first but it works. thank you. connect usb for power and aux for sound and everything works perfectly
5,This product put up the screen on my HDTV and that's all I need👍
1,This quit working after a week or two of regular use. The screen kept blinking on and off before finally shorting out and not working at all.
5,Works GREAT. Highly recommend. Connected my computer to 40" Vizio Smart TV.
5,This cable worked great for converting a 1080I tv as a moniter for my older tower.
1,I have ordered two of these VGA to HDMI adapters and both of them after hooking up the sound had no sound. Two of them didn't provide any sound. I'm through giving them any more chances.
2,This thing worked for a few days eventually giving up. I ended up going to Office Depot and buying a different one. No issues since don’t waste your money on this thing.
3,Going to have to return it only half of the audio works but everything else works great
5,Great unit. Can't handle 60fps though.
5,Easy to use and includes audio connection from laptop to my external monitor  (tv)
5,Not only does it work but it is quality construction.
5,Does exactly what I wanted! Came in on time as well. Cord is really long and made with great quality.
5,Hooked up an old computer to my new Samsung not smart tv and the additional wires were perfect for adding sound
1,Tried every which way to use this doesn’t work at all. Tried from pc to monitor pc to tv laptop to monitor laptop to tv. Not display
5,Very easy to use. Works as described
5,Muy bueno
5,I came when they said and the product was just has described! Thank u
5,Bought for my dad.  Works great as describe

5,What I needed for an older server with limited res to an newer hdmi tv
5,Excellent device. Easy to use. Simply plug and play. Highly recommend
5,Just what I wanted
5,Did not use has nothing to do with this product.
1,Product is of poor quality the connection requires an additional USB power and the cord stopped working after 5 months of use. For the same price choose an adaptor that does not need additional USB power.
5,It's a nice product. I like that audio and video are combined together. No problems!
5,With a big monitor it leaves black margens.
5,Very accurate description felt confident with the purchase.
5,Like that this cable allows me to continue to use my older model computer with newer HD video.
5,WELL MADE AND WORKS GREAT FOR WHAT IT IS
5,It does exactly what its supposed to.
5,Good to go
5,Made it possible to hook old computer up to new tv.
5,Easy to install works well. Make sure you know it’s unidirectional.
2,Super cheap.  Falls out of the inputs frequently and very finicky.  I'd look elsewhere when I need to replace this.  It works but it's definitely not a long-term solution.
1,Did not work as advertised. Hooked this up from vga to hdmi which is what we needed at my church and it wouldn’t work. HDMI didn’t show any signal at all.
5,Worked perfectly!
5,Finally A cable that will connect my old (win 7) laptop to my new smart tv.  Thank you
5,I can now watch the videos I downloaded from YouTube on my 40" flat screen TV.
2,Does not allow the computer to operate at a full 1080p.  Otherwise it seems to work fine.
5,Perfect solution for my dual monitor connection.
5,Better than expected with varying USB connection.
5,Just what wanted now I can display my CD' for easy view for all.

5,Great
5,Great product great Quiality
5,Works as described 'out of the box'; exactly what I was looking (and hoping) for.
5,I installed it to my electronic project and it works great!
1,It seems to be one direction and not the other which wasn’t clear to me when I bought it. It is either VGI to HDMI or HDMI to VGA. If I am wrong on that will someone PLEASE tell me?! I haven’t been able to use it to connect my laptop to a monitor.
1,I bought 4 VGA to HDMI cables and when I went to use them none of them worked.  I was just outside the allowed time to return them through Amazon so I was not able to return them.  My fault for not trying them sooner but very disappointing that not one of the four cables worked.
5,This product was trouble free to set up and works as I expected.
5,Works perfectly. Nice to have one big long cable instead of hooking up one
5,Works perfect great quality . I wish I would have ordered a longer length
5,Iove it and no issues.

5,Very pleased with the product!
5,This keeps outdated laptop in business. Where there's a will there's a way.
1,it did not work at all. i am still looking for a solution but it definitely did not work
5,Good product for the money
1,The headline says it all. No signal. Yes I know it is VGA to HDMI. Tried to set it up for a second monitor. Not recognized. Then moved it to a second monitor to connect it as monitor #1...no signal. Finally connected to original computer as monitor #1...still no signal.
2,It worked well while it worked. It lasted 5 weeks and without warning it just stopped.
5,Works really good. Have high definition of my computer without hdmi out.
5,It worked as it should
1,Using the HDMI cable none of the monitors I tested this plug with (4) recognized a signal when it was the only thing plugged into their input port.  Further the USB cable included did not provide a signal to the monitor either.  Don't waste your money.
5,Just what I needed and more! Amazon always comes through for me! Thanks.
1,This product didn't work
1,No transfer of signals to the enable dual  monitors. Had to return and bought regular conversion cable
2,Trying to use it with a Lenovo VGA laptop and a Toshiba Fire HD TV. Funny noise coming out of TV speakers no matter what I do. Sounds like some sort feedback loop not sure.
5,It turned out to be the perfect solution to connect my older PC to a new monitor.
5,Product worked perfectly description was accurate.
5,Works pretty good.
5,Did the trick. Got my older laptop up and running with my smart tv.

5,Excellent
5,took a little longer than I expected to get it but it works great.
1,I was expecting the device which is pictured and the one I received was completely different and did NOT work with my VGA screen. I had lost my original packaging and was too busy to even return the item. I DO NOT RECOMMEND purchasing.
5,Received as expected and works fine
5,Works flawlessly
5,I like it
5,Great product!!! Works perfectly for my computer to tv!
1,this thing works fine for a while but if I have been plugging away for a while and the computer has been on for a long time it seems to either short out or overheat or something and stop working. If I unplug it for a few minutes it starts working again. Unsatisfied. Defective.
5,Works great. Hook up was easy and even the sound works on my TV.
1,I bought a HD projector it only had VGA HOOK UP still can’t use it
2,This is a great product when it works. Unfortunately that does not happen often enough for me. It cuts out repeatedly and frequently making it useless.
5,It was just what I needed.
1,This product is awful. When it works it gets the job done; unfortunately it has only worked about half the time and just 2 weeks into owning it it has completely ceased functioning. Exceptionally frustrating. I will be replacing it ... but with a different brand for sure.
5,Work perfect with my old computer to my new monitor.
5,Ok
5,Product was late but it Works well and was just as described
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars I know the reviews were mixed but this piece of junk didn't work whatsoever.

5,works - clean design.
1,Used to convert VGA from PC to HDMI to TV while not bi-directional it should have transmitted the VGA signal through the HDMI but did not work with any of my HDMI Cables old and newer. I will be returning the Item for the 2nd time.

1,So... It has the same problem that the other dingle I bought does...  It only supports one resolution 1024x768.  Not awesome for me.  If it's acceptable for you then it'll do the job.
5,Good product
5,worked good  good picture and audio .
5,Works exactly as advertised and puts out up to 1080p over VGA
1,This product did not work when I received it. I tried multiple different combinations of input devices (HP desktop Lenovo laptop Dell laptop) and monitors (TCL TV Samsung monitor Vizio TV) and tried varying the boot sequence of devices making sure the USB dongle was connected each time.... still no go dud. Returning ASAP
5,Works
5,One word perfect!!!
1,Item did not work at all !!I tested multiple points to make sure it wasn't the source or monitor and both were functioning perfectly so that leaves this adapter as the failure point.. Don't waste your money..

5,Worked exactly as I'd hoped. Just what I needed.
1,Burned out the VGA blue color on my video board upon installation. Although I was able to return it for full credit my request for compensation for the video board was ignored. The customer service rep took all the information and promised to process my request yet I never got any feedback.
1,Came non-functional.  No matter what we do no picture.
1,I tried  to hook my Dell desk top and my Toshiba laptop to my Samsung smart TV neither would work. I tried all 4 HDMI inputs. with both PCs.I received the same mess from all inputs " This source is not connected. Please check connection again".  What a PAIN!
5,Connected Gaming computer to 60" TV.... badass gaming system now!!
1,It is either bad out-of-the-box or not workable with my Lenovo T530 to drive a TV with an HDMI input.  I tried everything posted in the other reviews with no success.  My computer drives the TV through its VGA input just fine.  It should not be this hard.
5,Great product.
5,a lot of wire ends
5,wonderful
5,Kick ass!
5,amazing deals
5,Worked GREAT!  I'd give it six stars if possible.
5,Exactly what we expected and IT is pleased.

1,Pos
5,Works perfect fast and easy
1,The plastic housing split in two pieces just from the pressure of hand tightening the screws

1,No video no audio did not work at all. Verified everything working on both ends with other cables.
5,Story Time:So I was really frustrated when I got a refurbished computer for Christmas and couldn’t use it because my new monitor didn’t not have a VGA port. So I ordered a VGA to HDMI Cable only to figure out it was backwards and was VGA monitor to HDMI computer port. I needed VGA computer port to HDMI input on the monitor. Apparently they usually aren’t bidirectional unless otherwise stated. So after returning the other item I ordered this product. I plugged it in to both items and NOTHING. I was bummed. Figured my computer was DOA even though it showed power going to it. BUT as a last ditch effort I found someone with a vga input monitor and tested the computer. WORKED GREAT.So then the next problem was is the brand new monitor not working or the new adaptor.  Then I had an “ah ha!” moment and looking at the adaptor one more time the💡 went off. There was a micro USB cord included with the device and it was plugged into the section that said “Power” when I got it but thought it was just an accessory. Thinking ‘could it be that easy?’ I plugged the adaptor back into the computer and monitor and then attached the microUSB power cord back into the adaptor and plugged in the USB other end into an open USB port and BOOM! I was in business!So TL:DRmake sure you have the microUSB attached to the adaptor and the other end plugged into a USB port to get power to the adaptor! Do this and it should work!Side note: All of this probably could have been avoided if the item had come with a set of instructions. Or I  had reread the description or even read other reviews.Learn from my stupidity folks. Computers 101 Check the power cords.
4,Came quick and worked well every lifetime unlimited refund guarantee. So that's a plus. I would recommend the purchase
4,I plugged into my windows laptop and into a Samsung TV HD monitor.  Worked well.  The resolution is a bit off so it takes a bit to figure out what works best.  Much better than trying to work on the laptop screen.
1,I got the part but it is not working
3,The screen is making some waves on the monitor which is very annoying. I need it basically for one time use because my server does not have any other video ports exempt VGA and my monitor inputs are all digital.
5,I have 2 27 inch  1920x1080 monitors.  My computer has an HDMI and a VGA port.  The HDMI was easy.  I got this adapter for the VGA port.  After I plugged it in I was able to get both monitors working both set to 1920x1080 resolution and there was no obvious difference in them.Be aware that this plugs into your VGA port  but it also has a power adapter that plugs into a USB-A port.  That was not an issue for me since I had several USB-A slots open
1,Th audio jack broke after a few uses
5,I needed this adapter convertor for one of my classes I am taking this semester and this product gets the job done. I have been using it for the past two weeks and it works perfectly fine with no problem at all.
5,I needed a cheap HDMI Signal generator..so I used this cable with a $5 FleaBay VGA test signal generator...It's a quickand dirty $20 solution to test the HDMI inputs on most TV's and Monitors.
5,I needed a cable for an NVIDIA Card's VGA port the the HDMI on my KVM.  Works like a charm.  No complaints at all.
1,I bought this to go from my tv to my Xbox because my tv hdmi ports aren’t working and I wished it was mentioned somewhere that this converter only works from a pc or laptop device not from tv to a device smh but I guess it was partially my fault
5,I liked that it worked very well and was simple to install.
2,once it's all plugged in and set up it works as intended... but the signal keeps dropping. sometimes it's every few minutes sometimes it's multiple times within a few seconds - at times unwatchable. reading other reviews here this seems to be a common thing.
5,I used this cable to connect a older laptop without hdmi port to a new TV it worked great after I messed with the TV speaker settings!
5,It does exactly what you want it to do.  Plug it in to your computer plug it into your TV and boom it is working.
1,I haven't even had this product for a month and it already quit working. Very dissatisfied.
5,Turns ur old pc or laptop with a cd/DVD drive into a modern hd tv player!!
5,WORKS GREAT AND INSTANTLY. not with these people --just a customer-- WIGHTSHADOW your favorite rapper -- endorses this product!!
5,Computer to Tv
1,Had to return the picture cut in and out and the sound did not get transmitted but an obnoxious buzzing did. Attempted to use the adapter on multiple laptops and with different power sources did not work. Wanted to use the device to allow my dad to stream video and TV from the comfort of his bed after surgery now I guess he'll just have to stick to DVDs
5,I needed for computer to link to Tv works great
5,Everything works as mentioned.
5,Very good product.
5,Sending a VGA signal from a Windows 7 PC to a 55" LG Smart TV.  I was very surprised by the excellent quality of the VGA signal displayed on the TV.  It is for my older computer and for what I use it for it works in every way.  The audio is equally good.Highly recommended.(added 1/08/2021) My second order for this item was to connect my newer Windows 10 PC (only 1 HDMI out 1 VGA out) to my new 55" TCL 55s535 QLED Smart TV.  I want to be able to connect two displays to the computer to extend the video signal but HDMI will not split the video.  HDMI will only duplicate the same video.  Next best thing is to use the VGA which will split the video output and connect to the QLED with this cable adapter.Until I get a get my next PC with more than one UHD video output this will do fine.
1,Item did not work at all with my laptop even after several attempts to connect and disconnect device.  Items like these should be operationally checked prior to shipping or distribution for functionality and proper connectivity.  It should not be the responsibility of the buyer to operationally determine if a product does what it is suppose to.  Obvious lack of care concern and overall pride over product and purchaser.  Attempting a return but have experienced several errors on the web site to process a return.  Hmmmm.
5,I had no problem connecting this converter to my son's older Dell computer and his newer refurbished Dell Monitor. The picture of the monitor changed so much from the dreary SD quality to the vibrant HD quality. I searched for a while online to find this converter/adapter and I'm glad I looked and read carefully and bought the exact item that I needed to get a GREAT RESULT!
5,I have a wall cove with a 27 inch high resolution screen (2x HDMI 1x Display port) connected to my MacMini (projecting to the Display port). However I still have on the side a PowerMac 9600 with some vauled data and even more valued software (running System 9.2). Hence a necessity to connect this old beast. THis convertor did the job utilizing maximum PowerMac resolution on my screen and porting out the sound to the screen speakers. Good job! Easy install (yes my PowerMac has an Add-on USB card -good also for an optical mouse). Altogether I could not be happier.
5,The USB to inject power is a must I tried plugging in the USB and it doesn't work. With the 1/8" sound jack plugged in it injects sound into your HDMI cable so you can hear it through your TV speakers.  The highest video resolution I can get from it is 1920x1080 that is Full HD that's good; however it is not 2560 x 2048 2k that is the max VGA should be capable of
5,I have a slim model PC. I didn't have the time to find a micro-sized graphics card to add HDMI to the model. So I ordered this product and was Amazed that my OS without any effort accepted this device and initiated my HD connection to the Television.  That's it.
5,Worked right away! The right connector for  my tv turned monitor. Easy to plug in. Less than Half the price of the Best Buy cables and connector. Thanks!
5,I live this cable!  I bought serveral diffent similar items all that didn't work.  How ever if you make the effort to hook this up it works great!  So good i bought a seco d one as a back up at our training site.
5,Product was fine & probably worked as it should. I ordered wrong part.
5,Working well so far... wish the was a way to run audio through the ARC.
5,do what it should do.if the usb port had at the back it will be great.
5,Finally I found a VGA to HDMI cable that can works for my laptop now my HP Elite can connect to 2 monitors now.
5,Easy to set up and produces an excellent image on the TV
5,We will buy again 👍
5,Everything as expected
5,I use it to help me work from home. No complaints it’s a good buy.
5,works good
5,Works great
4,4 stars only because only used once for a class so far- used for teaching a 9 hr class with no issue.
5,Worked just as described
5,Does exactly as it's supposed to. Easy to use.
5,Excellent product
5,Very good  excellent quality
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Great VGA to HDMI Adapter everything looks great and works beautifully. Can't be happier. My old lap top doesn't have HDMI and it works now.
5,Easy to install and great video connection
5,Works great
5,Product came packaged well and on time. Easy to install and works great!
5,Really awesome with the sound cord included!
5,two thumbs up
5,Good
5,Simple se conecta y se puede usar como duplicado de pantalla o como adicion de pantalla todo dependera de su computador para mi funciona muy bien la calidad de la imagen excelente buen producto a un bajo precio.
1,Tested on multiple devices. Did not work as advertised or described. Plastic with right looking parts and concept but no ability to deliver.
2,got this to connect a ps4 to a monitor with vga/dvi and no hdmi this converter didn't work so just ended up getting a hdmi able monitor off facebook this did not help at all
5,Like this cable very much. It is so easy to use. I got exactly what I paid for. The only con is that I didn't know that you had to supply your own HDMI cable. Other than that it is a very good product to have. My picture quality looks the same but I hadn't been paying attention to that aspect of it. I just needed another outlet source because I had to plug in 2 monitors. I wasn't looking to sharpen up picture quality or anything like that. I guess the quality is better I don't really know for sure as I wasn't paying attention to that detail.It's small & convenient and it doesn't take a genius to use it. It's also ready to go as soon as you plug it in. Just quick fast and in a hurry is this product's assembly time and use. Try it out for yourself and you won't be disappointed...
5,Plugged in and have comp on the big screen. USB was a little short for my application but it plugged into cable box.I like it. :D
5,It works perfectly I wish it was slightly better quality but it is exactly as described. 2k quality would be preferable for me but it works perfect.I wish the power input was on the back instead of the side because I didn’t realize that the side was the same as where my computers power cord is however it works it’s just a tight fit.tldr; Good quality as described just minor nit picks from me.
1,I could not get the product to work. I even contacted Amazon support and still a no go. I  ended up returning for a refund.
5,good
5,Cambie el monitor de PC por un tv con hdmi y se ve super.
5,my pc
5,Works flawlessly with GBS Control.  Low/No discernible lag.
5,Works like a charm. The t.v. didn't have a vga input and I didn't want ti replace the video card for hdmi output. This really works like a champ!
5,Does the job
5,I have tried 2 previous purchases of different products that I thought would perform the function of this product with no success. Finally after 3rd attempt at running an image from my P.C. (VGA) to my LG TV (HDMI) this magically beauty right here has produced the results I've been after. The information the company has listed right here on the product page is more than sufficient at explaining the installation process but they've included a small set of instructions in the packaging. I was also very impressed with the fact the unit came with every part needed and plugged in. My end user experience looked like connecting my HDMI input to the device the device to PC.
5,plug & play easy installation
5,It did what it supposed to do. I was tempted to give picture quality 4 stars but I think that is not the fault of this. when you go from VGA to HDMI and feed that to a 2K monitor its not going to look amazing. you are still converting an analog signal and trying to show it on a 2K display.
1,Worked great when I set it up. Turned everything off and when I restarted everything an hour or so later adapter would not work. Checked everything and turned everything off and restarted but no go.
5,very good to use
5,Working 100%
3,Does what it says.
5,In less than 60 seconds....all my pains gone...lol....I was FIVE adaptors DEEP before finally ordering this one...that actually WORKS!  No driver downloading changing graphics....OMG...JUST PLUG IT IN.
5,Works exactly like it should. Good picture and value for the money
4,I needed a product like this to be able to use my computer with a VGA output to connect to a monitor that only has HDMI output. I did not want to dig up an old monitor just to use my computer every time I need to used it. I would buy again.
5,Quick easy and cheap way to connect my computer to my tv set. Works good enough for me
5,Mush be plugged into the VGA terminal and a USB outlet to work. But it works amazingly well to send my VGA from my laptop to my Roku Television. The picture is clear sharp and colorful. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,Setup win98 computer to Samsung 57" tv HDMI input. Needed to change the computer graphic card setting to 800. When the game starts you may need to switch input settings as in go back to HDMI 1 then back to HDMI 2 and picture is there. occasionally when say exiting the game it takes a second to get back to the main 98 screen so as to exit and turn off the computer no biggie. The picture is a little big so a small part is cut off have not figured that out yet would appreciate any input on that. But I play steel panthers on it and come back for more. Been playing that game for about 30 years now through a few different versions using commander for the last 12 years.
5,It works as it should.  There were no issues.  For that I am most grateful.  Just connect correctly and you have exactly what you need.  It is the perfect little device.
5,As expected
5,Super simple you follow the easy to understand instructions and you are done.
5,Love it
5,Sturdy cable works nicely in connecting VGA out to TV.  Setup was simple and straightforward unlike some other VGA -> options.
5,My PC only has 1 HDMI and 1 VGA port and I have two monitors neither of which supports VGA but both support HDMI.  This device converts the PC's VGA port to HDMI which allows me to attach my second monitor.  Like any of these devices it won't support the full video resolution of my Dell 24-inch Ultrasharp monitor but I knew that going in (I believe it's an inherent limitation of VGA signals) and the image on the second monitor is fine for my uses (spreadsheets and Word docs).  If I need something with better image quality I just use the main monitor for that.  After using it for about a month I recommend this product.
4,Needed a way to connect an old beige G3 Macintosh to an HDMI screen. Although the screen ratios don’t line up it’s good enough to access and manipulate old files. Note that it needs USB power. For pre-USB oldies like this machine that means it needs to be close to a modern USB charger or you’ll need a looooong USB extension cord.
4,Bought this adapter to use my old 386 with VGA on my modern HDMI monitor. Did not look great on my 35” ultra-wide monitor but looks good on the 27” FHD. Picture isn’t perfect but it works. Text is sharp but graphics are a little blurry. Bought to replace brand-name adapter bought from a local retail store that would not work at all.
5,i used one of these type before and had trouble but this worked right out of the box on first hook up and even supported audio to hdmi very impressed with this adapter keep in mind max for vga is 1080p at 60hz.
5,Conecte mi Pc con mi Tv de 65” y la imagen es excelente y excelente precio.
5,I have a two monitor setup here at home and needed an adapter to go from VGA on my PC to HDMI in my monitor.  This device worked like a charm.  The only thing to remember is to use the USB cord with it where one end plugs into the device and the USB end goes into the PC.  Video quality isn't quite as good as hdmi to hdmi but this may be expected and my 4 star rating for quality may be a little unfair.
5,It was just what I needed to fix a problem hooking up my monitor. It arrived 1 day early and I was very pleased.
5,Plugged into the various ports and ended up with a great picture and sound on Vizio TV.
4,worked like it should  no issues
4,This adapter works fine for doing a VGA to HDMI so I can add an additional portable monitor to my laptop.  The portable monitor actually has better resolution than the host laptop and the adapter relays this better resolution and Windows recognizes it when you plug it in.  Sucks that it will take up one of the USB ports on your computer for power.  The only other issue is my laptop does not have inlets to screw the adapter onto the connector.  I have to plug the adapter in and it gets loose and comes out pretty easy.  If your port will accept the screws on the adapter you shouldn't have that problem.
5,This just revived my old laptop. Now I can travel with it again an connect it to the hotels TV. Works great nice sharp picture
5,It works great and easy to install
5,Wow amazing I open the package everything was so clean neat and tidy I connected it to my PC with the audio and USB power source hooked in the HDMI cord at attached it to the VGA port and in less than a millisecond my computer was displayed on my television screen.This does a wonderful job and depending on how powerful your computer is and how well your television is you can get great to outstanding visuals displayed over a large screen.For me I have a simple three old year PC and my television is a 52 in 1080P Vizio flat screen television it does an amazing job and it has amazing sound combining with a soundbar and the capabilities of a subwoofer with this device hook to my TV and computer I can play amazing Steam games in great detailed quality and amazing sound.The benefit also is I'm not hunched over having my TV on a wall mount I can sit in a chair that can make me feel comfortable align my posture and allow me to gaze up at the wonderful visuals without being hunched over in a computer chair and I am surrounded by sound instead of having my ears covered with gamer headphones.

5,works perfect
1,I have a PC desktop monitor with a VGA (IN) connection.  I have a DVD player with a HDMI (OUT) connection.The monitor receives VGA from a PC just fine.  And the DVD player produces a signal to TV just fine.However I wanted to set up the monitor and DVD player instead of buying a new TV.  It simply does not work.  It should work.
1,Didn't work for me.
1,Doesn’t identify the computer.
5,Works just as described.  No problem.
5,nice little adapter to have just in case your new smart tv dont have a vga port
5,I used this with an older AMD Athlon II processor motherboard whose built-in video does not have updated drivers available. Works great!
5,I was worried that my older computer wouldn't work with my new 32" HD TV that I wanted to use as a monitor but this cable fixed all that picture quality is as good as my new computer on the same TV.
5,The VGA to HDMI adapter works as expected! You connect the device to the VGA port and then connect an HDMI cable to the output on the back. It comes with the audio and usb cable to power the device. The image quality is excellent. Definitely recommend for anyone who needs a simple to use converter.
1,It heats up planned to use on laptop with tv. The adapter came with head Jack insert. But if I switch to my roku I have to unplug headjack from back of tv it is annoying. Not sure if there is a better way.
5,Great product - fit my needs perfectly
5,Worked perfectly. After buying a few of the wrong ones (why I'm the world would anyone ever need a hdmi to vga only converter🤦) this is doing exactly what I need it to.
5,Easy to hook up and works perfectly.  I can now use two new HDMI on an older PC
5,I had an adapter thinking I was good until I realized it is the opposite direction--HDMI to VGA.  This adapter is the correct one for my needs and works great (VGA to HDMI).  These adapters are not bi-directional in terms of source and target display.  If you plan to record various combinations of video sources you should have something like this in your tool bag.
5,Using on a 20 year old desktop running XP connected to a tv. Works great.
5,I had to return the product because it was not compatible with my computer.
5,Essential equipment for bringing outdated computers into the 21st century. The first one I ordered had a defective sound output but the seller promptly replaced it with a newer model that's even more streamlined than the first one. This is literally plug and play no need to install or download anything. The picture and audio quality is great really gives DOOM and Need for Speed and all those great vintage games a new lease on life compared to those old CRT monitors. Very happy!
5,Buen producto me sirvió para lo que necesitaba
5,Good prize  and fast shipping
5,Before this product I bought a HDMI to VGA to connect my old monitor to a hdmi TV. Wrong choice if you're going the same route make sure you get a VGA to HDMI there's a difference. This product works great for that!
5,Lo unico malo que tiene es que se ve mucho cable y un poco desordenado pero cumple su funcion. 10/10
5,Bought this to connect PCs on my work table to my ROKU TV. It was tricky to get the device connected but that's on the TV. I've had the same issue with it  and other devices in the past.In order to get the ROKU TV to recognize the device I had to remove the HDMI #2 from the settings then attach another HDMI device to that input.  Once it was recognized I switched over to this VGA to HDMI adapter and it worked fine. Swapping out computers doesn't impact it's performance.
5,Worked Just like described. Will buy another
2,After sitting for some time you have to unplug the power to get the unit to work again. Buy something different!
1,I ordered this product needing it for a future date and so I didn't test it right away.  And of course a week after the return date was when I finally needed to use and I tried it on multiple devices and it never worked.  It's very cheap material and poorly made as it doesn't fit snug into the ports.  I wish I could have at least been able to receive a replacement item.
5,I was going around in circles trying to find a solution for hooking my new PC (only 1 HDMI out and 1 VGA out) to a newer monitor (only HDMI in).  I didn't realize that it makes a huge difference which way you're going.  I had it the opposite way trying to use a cable that was meant for HDMI out from PC to VGA in for an older monitor.  This cable worked perfectly and the new monitor looks exactly the same as my second monitor which is connected via HDMI.
5,Todo
5,I recently purchased a old school laptop which connects via VGA. So I decided to search online and noticed this VGA to HDMI cable was the best to consider. After testing the product I am well pleased because I am able to project the image from my laptop onto my HDTV. Thank you.
5,Perfect
1,NoMe sirve lo barato sale caro
5,This worked perfectly for hooking up my HDMI monitor to my VGA video card on my computer. I was concerned this wouldn't work but I was relieved it when I hooked it up. This will work whether you're running Linus or Windows.
5,VGA laptop out > to HDMI < in - works perfectly! Also a USB port is needed to power the VGA converter which was included. I recommend this adapter!
5,I had my doubts but it works flawlessly. Tested on a very old PC (Intel Pentium 4) Running Linux Mint. Excellent.
5,I had a computer monitor given to me and I had an old pc from another older computer. I lost hours of sleep trying to figure out what it was I needed. Basically vga is outdated and my old computer and pc required one vga cord to turn it on and that is what I’ve only used whenever I’ve used a pc. This go round I had a screen with a mini port regular size port or hdmi only “holes” and a vga only pc. Omg! I searched high n low n almost every YouTube video trying to understand the difference in vga and hdmi dvi cords “male to female” blah blah blah!! Finally I started to understand and landed on this baby here and luckily it worked like a charm!! Mixing old school with new school technology is not for the weak!! So if you’re like me and still operate with old school tech please stop cause vga has been outdated since 2013 and hdmi is it’s replacement lmao. This cord fits securely into my pc and the picture quality is great!! And it has copper which I found out is something u want to look for because it’s the best energy conductor since like the beginning of time. The screen quality was so great I had to turn down the brightness alot. I hope this helped anyone with the same issue because all these tech savvy folks talk in Morris code trying to explain what it is u need in this situation!!
4,I had an old laptop (more than 10 years). It does not have HDMI port. So I have to search connector which can link my laptop to my new 4k monitor. I found this one which works great but it need USB to power up. Overall it works well. Thanks.
5,This device connects to the VGA port and from there connects to a monitor or TV HDMI port It WILL NOT work in the other direction and it requires a source of 5V 1A power (any standard phone charger will work.)It comes with a USB charging cable and a 3.5mm cable for transmitting sound. Apparently it will not send sound interlaced with the HDMI signal through the HDMI cable (that you will need to supply.) For me this is not an issue because I am using it on a legacy laptop to send video only to a legacy TV which I am using as extended video under Windows 7. Yes it's using some ancient gear. But that is why I rated it five stars.Limitations: even if your TV or monitor is capable of higher resolutions this is not going to provide more than 720p from an old laptop or PC to an old monitor or TV. I know the specs say that this will go higher but I could not get it there. Yet going straight VGA from my T400 to my Sanyo TV it went into higher resolution as an extended screen. I am OK with the limitation because I am only using the TV as a second screen with MS OfficeOn an old Windows 7 system it's truly plug and play. I had it up and running without the scant instructions in mere minutes. For me it is a perfect solution.
5,as advertised
4,Works pretty well but the resulting image is offset by 5-10 pixels to the right when using 1080p (I did not test the other resolutions). I included a photo of how it looks on the left side of the screen. On the other side of the screen it is slightly cut off on the edge. Adjusting the picture back and forth on the display itself did not resolve the issue. There is also no other adjustment on the unit to scale the output. I tested multiple displays and the problem was the still there so it is definitely this that is causing the issue. Due to the price point of this unit I only knocked off 1 star.
5,Muy buen producto
5,This unit is perfect for the application.  Plug it into the computer's VGA port plug in the HDMI cable adn DONE!  Worked great-
1,Item didn’t work when received
5,a little tough to tighten thumbscrews but does the job no prob.
5,It works as intended!
1,It worked great for about a week and then stopped working!
5,Initially my monitor would just shut down when I clicked play but I eventually over came that. Im now a happy camper. The picture quality is absolutely awesome. Great product. I highly recomend it. Buy it again. With out reservation or hesitation. Britton.
5,and it does it well. I usually don't bother reading instructions this time for whatever I did and I followed them. I am using this adapter to connect a refurbished and dated HP ProDesk 600-G1 SSF to a newer television. This kit works great for my intended purposes. Well worth the $12.00 spent.
1,The adapter was on and off for the past month but it decided to die on me today. The USB cable it comes with is really low quality and when it stopped working so did the adapter. It will not work even after replacing the cable
2,It worked but the chords were too short converter is larger than expected and not user friendly.  Didn’t have the packaging so I couldn’t return so I purchased something else that worked much better.
3,I’m sure this is user error but I can’t get it to work on my computer.  It’s not finding the monitor.  It did work on my docking station for my laptop though.
5,I was having trouble getting a second monitor to work on my new Dell Inspiron computer. The computer only had a single HDMI output and a simple VGA to HDMI cable did nothing. This little adapter/converter did the trick immediately.
5,Comes in a flat package with the USB and audio cables already plugged into the adapter.Connect the adapter to the VGA connector on the back of your computer the supplied 3.5 mm cable to the audio output connector on the back of your computer (green) plug the USB cable into a USB connector on the back of your computer. You have to supply your own HDMI cable. Connect it between the adapter and your monitor. You're DoneIt Is That EasyGood Purchase.
3,It works good but it makes things short and fat and the sound has an echo.
1,Does not work well as a remote second screen
5,Worked as expected.
5,Simple plug & go operation.  Display is clear and crisp.  Very useful if you have VGA output you need to send to and HDMI monitor.
5,I HAVE A OLD LAPTAP COMPUTER WITH WATER ON THE SCREEN THAT IS GETTING WORSE.  I BOUGHT A NEW REFURBISHED COMPUTER FOR 200 BUCKS THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.  I WAS LOOKING FOR A SMALL TV TO HOOK MY WATER SCREEN COMPUTER TO WHEN I FOUND THIS......IT IS AMAZING!  I AM 63 YRS. OLD AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND I HOOKED THIS UP IN A MINUTE! THANK-YOU SO MUCH FOR SUCH AN AWESOME PRODUCT.....I HAD NO IDEA IT EXISTED.  NOW I HAVE A 65 INCH TV COMPUTER SCREEN.....INCREDIBLE!
5,It did the trick to make it so I could watch netflix on the big tv in the living room.
5,Like it
5,I had a vga port available on a laptop docking station to connect a second monitor but wanted to use the hdmi port on the monitor instead of vga. This adapter worked great. It wasn't clear to me that it also came with the audio cable and a short micro USB cable for power but it did. I used one of the available usb ports on the docking station and the power cable helped keep things clean and organized. Video quality on the monitor is very good.
5,Better picture quality and easy to use.
5,Used this product for an older monitor
5,Cumple la función para la cual prometió buena imagen fácil de conectar estoy contento con la compra. Recomendable
5,Works as expected good quality too
5,I upgraded my old VGA monitor to one with only HDMI input. I needed this converter to make it work and it did just fine.
5,Nothing to dislike here. I had rolling lines on my monitor. I was using VGA but now this adapter has removed the lines.
5,You just need to plug the adapter and usb cable and connect your hdmi and it works. Initially i did not plug the usb so it did not work
1,The adapter has to have a USB port to power it. The adapter "blew a fuse" so to speak not sure what caused it to quit working but the power light does not come on and no picture is being sent through the adapter not worth buying.
5,Easy to use works very well
5,Simple to use and works as advertised. Fully satisfied with his purchase.
5,I bought this to replace one I bought here a year ago. (from a different seller)  For around the same price. It worked but fell apart 3 months later. It did not have the extra (RCA) audio cables and was only about 6 inches. The first thing I noticed is how much better the picture quality was. WAY BETTER. Having the longer cable also meant that I did not need the extra HDMI cable I used on the last one. My only mistake was I did not put the effort into buying the right one in the first place. I have my old laptop hooked up to one of my Tvs and I use it to watch movies and listen to music. It is hooked up through my home stereo System. I also use it rarely for reading books that I get here at Amazon as well. BEFORE YOU BUY.. Just remember that the quality is directly effected by how good or bad your laptop or old PC is.I forgot to mention the seller. 3rd party sent from seller. Package was sent in secure bubble/envelope. Brand new UN-opened package inside. and I received it on a Sunday which is a first. The company is new to me but they operate on weekends AND e-mailed me the instant it was at my door. Again very happy with that. I always have good deliveries from Amazon so I am not totally shocked this supplierfollowed on that tradition ensuring very quick reliable delivery with notice. It does not get better then that.
5,I have a VGA out only laptop. And when I do presentations at customers this allows me to hook up to whatever flat screen or projection system they have.  Great item plus compact. So easy to have in my laptop bag at all times.
5,I have tested the VGA to HDMI Adapter.I connected the VGA output of the computer to a Flat Screen TV.I found it to work virtually with any computer with VGA output.I have tested it with Windows 95 98 Xp and 7 trying different resolutions.If your flat screen TV HDMI/DVI supports the resolution settings of the computerthen video should be seen.  Use a computer resolution that closely matches the TV screenof 720p or 1080p for a larger screen for the crispest video display.Full screen DOS can be displayed if your flat screen TV supports IBM 720x400.Good for those old DOS games.
4,概ね思っていた通りの商品ですが、常時充電しなければ画面が映らない点が微妙にイケてないなって思いました。技術的に充電無しってのは難しいんですかね？
5,I bought this VGA to HDMI to transfer Slingbox TV from my older HP laptop to an HDMI input on  a flat screen TV while on holidays. Works GREAT!! plugged in the VGA video audio cable the headphones usb for power connected to the TV and BAM laptop video to my LG flat screen. Works great!!
5,I give 5 stars because is doing the job what I need it for so far  looks like a good product  i didnt use the audio so i can't comment on that.
5,We used this in our video system to connect some older equipment to the system.  Works fine but they need to tell you that you need an external USB power supply to run things.
1,Honestly the biggest mistake I've made was I bought this thing without testing it right away when I got it not until recently when I actually had to use it. It didn't work at all! Tried it with multiple monitors and TV screens all said "no signal". At first I thought it was my devices that are broken so I borrowed a similar cable to this one from a friend but everything worked. So in conclusion I was given a defective cable and found out too late. I highly don't recommend this cable man. What a waste ):
3,I ordered this product to replace it with my old cable as it was short to connect my laptop and monitor.Pros -1. It works well as of now.2. Available at a reasonable price.Cons -1. The device heats up faster.2. The connector is not long enough to reach from one end to another.3 A short cable cannot benefit for multiple uses.
2,The device works though the image on my monitor was very sharp as if it was out of focus (not much though)  and the power cable for the device which is a miniusb cable is on the device's side which is the reason it didn't work for me right beside the VGA port is my HDMI port (In my Video Board) that I was planning to use (that is the reason I bought it in the first place) with this device in the power cable was exactly over my HDMI port which makes it useless. I'm returning this device.
1,THE SET=UP IS I ASSUME QUITE SATISFACTORY. HOWEVER I PURCHASED THE 50 FOOT SET-UP AND FOUND IT DIFFERENT THE INCLUDED CHIPSET IS MISSING AND THEREFORE THE LONGEST IS NON-FUNCTIONAL. FOINNEX FOR SOME REASON DID NOT INCLUDE IT IN THE 50 FOOT AND FORCED ME TO RETURN IT AND BUY A DIFFERENT SET WHICH HAD THE CHIPSET AND IT IS WORKING PERFECTLY!
1,Plugged it I to my laptop as directed and it worked great...... for less than 2 minutes.... at which point it overloaded and crashed thus becoming a fancy-looking piece of plastic garbage.
3,El adaptador es bastante bueno en mi caso temía que no pudiera conectar el adaptador de audio porque la entrada está al otro extremo de la computadora pero no tuve problemas.Lo que me molestó es que el adaptador venía con rayones y además se siente mucho más frágil de lo que esperaba. Aún así cumple con su propósito.
3,Solo siento que el material del conector vga es muy debil.
5,Best part was the video that shows exactly what you have and where to plug it in. I could see this is what I was looking for. Great video.
4,I can't really give you an honest review about this product because I have an old computer which is on its last legs. As soon as I get a new one I will update my review
3,Not the best quality. The USB attachment is flimsy and easily broken. Otherwise works well.
1,Pas une belle image
5,This works very well on an older laptop to a newer HD monitor.
5,Perfect for computer that not have HDMI port. Do not underestimate the audio wire so useful
5,I had no issues at all with this cable it works very well.
5,Works perfectly to connect SVGA OUT only DVR to HDMI IN only TV

5,it works
5,Item worked as described
5,Good product
5,Pretty neat little thing. Works great
1,I have contacted service and told me it was my TV that was issue...Changed picture settings as instructed...still does not work...

5,Works good so far !
4,Yes
5,This cable works awesome.
5,Good
5,A pesar de tener los tornillitos en el cable que en el portátil no tiene para sujetarlos el cable funciona de maravilla. Lo bueno es que el del sonido llega al otro lado sin problema y pensando que era más corto compré un alargador que he devuelto. Teniendo en cuenta que el portátil es verdaderamente antiguo el cable sirve perfectamente para poder reproducirlo en la TV.
1,Dosent even work. No picture at all. I purchased one from my local electronic store for double the price and it works great. Poorly made.
1,One star cuz I had to... audio doesn’t transmit
1,Why don’t you put it in the discription that a VGA to HDMI  converter is also needed to use this cable!
4,ノートパソコンでは見づらい電子書籍の雑誌の文字を拡大したく、３２型テレビとの接続に利用。結果、電子書籍の雑誌の小さな文字は３２型テレビでもぼやけてしまって、あまり活用はしていない。ノートパソコンのVGA端子と音声出力端子をつなぎ、３２型液晶テレビのHDMI端子と接続。別途、HDMIコードを用意する必要がある。本機の端子は金メッキ処理されて、なかなか質感は良い。Miracastでは映らなかったDMMの動画も本機では映りました。ただ、画質は甘いです。耐久性はこれからですが、机と本機の間に空間ができて無理な力が掛かりやすいため、スペーサーを挟むつもりです。
5,Trois écrans sur min pc grâce à cet outil
4,L'ho acquistato e provato. La qualita' e' ottima il cavo audio lungo a sufficienza per connettersi nel lato opposto del portatile ma il cavo usb purtroppo no. Restituito e in attesa di poterlo comprare  con 2 cm in piu' di cavo usb anche se naturalmente avrei potuto prolungarlo e non restituirlo ma non mi sembrava coerente non offrire uno spunto di miglioramento cosi' semplice da attuare.
4,Working fine for me might be particularly suitable if your computer and television are not close together.
4,It works as advertised (don’t forget to connect the USB cable at the HDMI end to a power source). However it does some sort of scaling so the output of my VGA computer is cropped which is not ideal in text / console mode. Also there is a delay of a few seconds until my monitor picks up the signal so if for instance you have to enter bios / boot menu by pressing a key you might miss the moment to press it because of this delay.All of the above however could be monitor specific. With my Eizo I had to spend (significantly) more on an alternative solution. If you can live with the issues above this is a very affordable solution and it works well.
4,私の問題はUSB給電元でした。USB給電元をPCにしたらダメで、コンセント接続等の外部USBに切り替えたら映りました。電力も重要のようです。
3,画像をHDMI直差しと変換アダプタと差して比較をした所、やはり変換アダプタの画像のほうが悪かったです。まあ本来の使い方としてはHDMIの口が無いPC等からVGAを利用してディスプレイに繋ぐのが目的だったので目的は達しています。VGA→HDMIの変換アダプタを買ったのがこの製品が初めてなので他製品とは比較ができませんがいい製品です。
4,Ｐ社のパソコンを利用モバイルモニターを2台接続1台はHDMI接続し、もう一台接続用に購入パソコン左側にコネクタがあるため、電源コードの接続部が手前となるため、電源側と逆になるため、コードを折り返す形になった。逆だと綺麗にコードが収まるので残念
4,流石に４Kディスプレイに繋ぐとVGAの絵はぼんやり気味ではあります。但し、ちらつかないぼんやり画質なので仕事する上では必要十分だと思います。というかこの値段でアップスキャンコンバーター相当の機能が手に入るのは有り難いことだと思います。最近のディスプレイってもうアナログRGB端子が無いので助かっちゃいました。
4,Aansluiten en gaan. Heb de kabel gebruikt om een visueel gehandicapte toch met laptop op 60" TV haar e-mail te lezen.
3,Loose connection or something means you have to wiggle it to get the colours to show up properly.
2,安くて良い製品だった。
4,Item arrived on time. Was not just plug n play! Maybe because my pc is not a new one but when first plugged in nothing happened.Mine HAD to be plugged into a USB plug (phone charger type and minimum 5v) then a wall socketThe resolution on my pc HAD to set to its lowest THEN slowly put back up 1280x768 then the picture seemed ok. Lost connection  came back on.Few emails back and forth to there tech bods (they were excellent. Quick replies very help full) they Sent a new one and bang  all up and running. So I'm happy
5,If you have a new tv and old tech to plug into it buy a converter.Easy to use and the picture is better than my old tv.
3,PC側のコネクタの間隔より幅が若干広く、取り付けに苦労する
4,Le câble VGA/HDMI remplit parfaitement sa fonction. L’image est impeccable et le câble est suffisamment long pour emprunter le chemin derrière mon bureau jusqu’au 2d écran.Par contre le branchement du port VGA me paraît assez sensible (flottant) au moindre mouvement et pourrait se débrancher à tout moment. Le bon vieux câble VGA me paraît plus sûr au branchement.D’autre part les connecteurs USB et VGA ont des cordons particulièrement long et encombrant pour moi. Je travaille sur 3 écran dont un avec la connectique DisplayPort. Je n’ai donc pas l’utilité de ces connectiques. Je ne pourrais donc pas confirmer leur bon fonctionnement.Pour mon besoin c’est presque parfait. Dommage que ces connectiques soient aussi encombrants.
4,Prodotto che assolve appieno all'utilizzo per il quale è stato acquistato
5,Arrived in two days works perfectly
4,Very pleased so far with the VGA to HDMI cable. I bought it because I kept getting a blue tint on my smart tv monitor when using VGA to VGA cables.My 2nd day of using it and no blue tint so far. The only thing I notice is that if I am viewing something with a white background I notice the brightness on the tv monitor occasionally slightly darkens and then brightens again.Not a major issue as long as it doesn't get any worse.
5,Spedizione: veloce e nei tempi stabiliti.Imballaggio: busta per il trasporto in bolle resistente e plastificata. Busta confezione del prodotto resistente.Contenuto: il cavo da VGA a HDMI della lunghezza in descrizione le estremità della presa VGA e di quella HDMI dorate avevano un cappuccio plastico da utilizzare per non farle ossidare quando viene riposto. Nella confezione è anche disponibile un cavo commutatore da uscita Stereo (Bianco-Rosso) a mono comodo quando si vuole collegare unità dotate di questa uscita audio.Esperienza d'uso: il mio vetusto notebook perfettamente funzionante ha le connessioni VGA USB ed Audio nello stesso lato quindi nessun problema ad ogni modo i cavi USB (fondamentale per alimentare il convertitore VGA-HDMI) ed Audio sono abbastanza lunghi in caso di altre configurazioni. La presa VGA non scalda mai eccessivamente. La qualità video è eccellente.Rapporto qualità prezzo: ho messo solo 4 stelle perché  il prezzo  dovrebbe essere inferiore in virtù della conformazione dell'oggetto avrei preferito che i cavi fossero più spessi e le plastiche di migliore qualità.
5,Lo usé para conectar un portátil a una TV. Todo perfecto conectar y listo. La toma usb y la de sonido con suficiente longitud para llegar al otro lado del portatil ya que no está junto al puerto vga. La imagen llega en calidad 1080p sin distorsión ni pixelado.Llegó un día antes de lo indicado en el pedido.Dos pegas sin importancia al no tener el portatil agujeros para los tornillos junto al vga hay que tener cuidado de no golpear el cable pues se afloja y dos el portatil no reconoce la tv como Sony si no que reconoce como pantalla "vga to hdmi".Encontré alguno cinco o seis euros menos pero no se su calidad y me decidí por este que ya lo conocía.
5,コネクターの向きが逆という不具合は解消されてます(本当はレビュー通り逆だったら良かった)。外部出力がVGA15pinしかない古いラップトップPCでHDMI入力のヘッドマウントディスプレイを使うために購入しましたが、本体が少し熱を帯びる以外は特に不具合もなく普通に使えてます。問題は耐久性ですが使用頻度としては仕事中に発生する長時間待機の際に自分で撮影したビデオを鑑賞する程度なのでぼちぼち使っていって何かあったらその時正式に評価したいです。外見だけ見れば作りはかなりしっかりしてるようです。
5,Super soddisfatta!Finalmente sono riuscita a collegare il mio vecchio LAPTOP alla TV assicurando ai miei studenti in aula audio e video di eccellente qualità!Avevo comprato un cavo di direzione DMI -VGA e l’ho reso. Leggendo le caratteristiche di questo cavo che spiegavano per bene il circuito VGA a DMI  ero fiduciosa che avrebbe funzionato e così è stato!!!!Anche il jack audio ha una lunghezza sufficiente a “ girare dalla parte opposta “ del PC dove vi è la porta VGA ( temevo fosse corto e dovessi acquistare una prolunga jack)Spedizione Super veloce in 24 oreMmmmmeravigliosooo Ritorno in aula
5,Prodotto buono davvero pratico e decisamente reale la sua presentazione.Graze
5,Bon produit
5,Very happy with this. Works as intended and no apparent degrading of the video signal.
3,きちんと使えますが、発熱がとても気になります。
3,以前使っていたものより一回りコンパクトで、商品画像の雰囲気より軽く、そこはとても良かったです。動作も今のところ問題無し。ただ、他のレビューにもありますが（購入前に気付けば良かった…）、商品画像と上下が逆でした。せっかくのロゴ隠れてしまう…のは別にいいですが、端子類が反対向きになってしまうので、これを見て向きというか、配置を考えて買うと、「えっ？」ってなるかも。小さいデバイスではUSB等と隣接しているので。写真をアップしておられる方がいなかったら、不良品だと思って返品していたと思います。
2,いろいろトライしたがモニターが映らない何故？教えてくれぇ～
2,仕様違いだったため、返品・返金させて頂きました。物塩体はいいのかもしれませんが、分かりません。
3,接続が簡単
5,Worked perfectly for what I needed. Not much else you can say about a cable
2,給電のためのUSBと干渉しないかは事前に確認が必要ですね。個人的には、画質が悪いので使う気にはなれませんでした。
4,問題無く使ってます。満足です。
4,手元のPCがDisplay PortとVGA出力を持っていたので、VGA側の画面を拡張するために購入。VGAなので、画質的にはそれほどクリアではないが、PC側の問題でこの商品の問題ではないと思われる。普通にHDMI接続すればゲームの画面や音声が、15インチの表示で出力されるので、かなり便利に使えると思う。特にノートパソコンの隣に並べれば表示エリアが2倍強になって生産性はかなり上がるのではと期待している。
4,思ったより大きめですが、問題なく使えます。
3,Tremolio delle immagini e ogni tanto un salto di frame
4,テレワーク用にモニターを購入したが、VGA端子しか貸与PCになかったため、VGA→HDMIに変換するため本品を購入。USBタイプBによる電源供給が必要で、PCとは別の電源としている場合は、PCの電源を落としてもコネクタへの電源供給は続くので、コネクタ部がほんのり暖かい状態が続く。本来のモニターへの映像描写は問題無い。
4,Tengo un portátil HP sin conector HDMI. El cable funciona perfectamente tanto imagen como sonido conectado a una Smart tv Sony o LG. El conector VGA está preparado para atornillarse al pc pero el portátil no tiene esa posibilidad por lo que con un leve movimiento se suelta y se pierde la conexión. Por lo demás todo perfecto.
5,Ich benutze immer wieder verschiedene Server in einem Testgelände. Dabei stehe ich immer wieder vor dem Problem dass die Geräte lediglich einen VGA Ausgang zum Monitor haben und daher nicht an moderne Monitore angeschlossen werden könnnen. Aktuelle Monitore haben meist nur noch hdmi und DisplayPort Anschlüsse.Um dieses Problem zu lösen habe ich mir diesen Adapter bestellt. Er wird am Monitor mit dem hdmi Anschluss verbunden. An der Seite des Computers benötigt man neben dem VGA-Anschluss auch noch einen USB-Port für den Strom und einen Klinkenausgang für den Ton wenn man den braucht.Ich habe das Kabel mittlwerweile benutzt um diverse Computer an meinen Monitor anzuschließen. Das hat immer reibungslos funktioniert. Auch der zweite Adapter den ich zwischenzeitlich gekauft habe funktioniert ohne Probleme.
1,末尾に重要な追記ございます。デスクトップ一体型のパソコンがイカれて、予算から古いパソコンのコンテナに新品SSDなどを入れた再生パソコンを購入。しかし、22インチの画面に慣れていたので、小さな画面で目がショボショボになって、壊れたデスクトップ一体型をモニタとして使えないか？と思って購入させていただきました。きちんと写って一安心です。ただ、音声のケーブルを挿しても意味がないようなので(不良品？)星ひとつ減らさせていただきました。2022/07/25追記１ヶ月で壊れました。写りません。他のケーブルで映ったので、この製品の故障でしょう。おすすめできません。買うかは個人のご判断にお任せします
4,リモート会議の際にThinkPad X250 と SHARP製60インチテレビを接続して使用しています。普通に使えます。USBを接続しないと使用出来ません。私の用途としては十分満足出来ます。まだ壊れていませんが、耐久性は分かりません。
5,40インチTVをモニターの代わりに使用するために購入しました。PC側Dsub-テレビ側HDMIUSB等のスピーカーが接続されているとテレビから音が出ませんでした。USBスピーカーを切断したらテレビから音が聞こえるようになりました。モニターが40インチだと大きすぎるかなと思いました。画質はPCモニターと比較すると体感で、若干劣るかな。そこまでの画質を求めていないので充分です。耐久性はわかりません。安定性は今の所、ちらつき等はありません。Dsubに接続する所のネジが回しにくいので改善してくれるといいですね。
5,My reason for buying it was to show our digital pictures on out TV. As it happens I used Microsoft PowerPoint to do this. It worked a s 'plug and play' on our ordinary TV without having to change the source. However on our smart TV it was a bit of a rigmarole to go through the menu set up (on the TV) to get it to work.It does what it's supposed to and I only gave it 4 stars for installation because it may not always be straightforward.
4,さっそく繋いでみて、何も映らないのでガッカリ。これは失敗だったと臍を嚙んだのですが、ふと思いついて、VGA切替器を間に挟んだところ、どう云う訳か、しっかりと映りました。何事も簡単にアキラメナイ事が大切だと痛感した次第です。不良品（？）という評価もありえますが、結果的に満足のゆく状態となりましたので、★４つとさせて頂きました。
3,32インチTVをサブディスプレイにする用に購入しました。機能的には問題なく使えていますが、電源供給用のマイクロUSBの端子が側面にあることで、隣のHDMIケーブルに当たります(干渉します)。干渉を避けるためのL字型のマイクロUSBケーブルを検討していますが、できれば最初からマイクロUSBの端子はケーブルの出る方向に合わせていただきたかったです。
4,working fine will update later
5,Anfangs skeptisch dann aber eines besseren belehrt...alles top Bildqualität top
4,a bit more expensive
4,RGBからHDMIへの変換であることを考慮すると画質が落ちることは想定内ではあるが、細かいものを表示するのは不向きなので、サブディスプレイなどに使うのが向いている。一日つけっぱなしにしているとそれなりに発熱はしているが、落ちるようなことはない。給電にUSBを使うのでPCに空きポートがないと別で供給する必要があるので少し不便かもしれない。自分の使い方では概ね問題ないので満足している。耐久性については長期間使ってみないとなんとも言えないが、今のところは元気よく動いている。
4,本体に問題はなかったです。当方のはディスプレイが古過ぎて、対応したドライバーがなかったので映りませんでした。10年以上前のディスプレイは性能からも新調した方が楽です。
4,テレビまで10メートルのケーブルを使用していますが、音声、画像とも問題なく良好で大変満足しています。固定ピンが挿入できないノートパソコンだったので安定のため下部にライナーをひいて使用しています。パソコンとの挿入方向（天地が逆）が気にはなりますが、機能上は問題ありません。
4,War nach der Bestellung recht zügig da. Habe es gleich angeschlossen und es läuft einfach. Das einzige ist das der Ton mit einem leichten pip Ton am Fernseher ankommt de. Denke es ist dem alten Gerät geschuldet. Mit einem neueren Model würde es sich erledigen.
5,Easy to install does exactly what I wanted i.e. Convert a VGA port to HDMI so I can use a pc tower on a big TV. Just make sure you have all the ports required headphone USB and VGA at the computer end and an HDMI at the other. Then just plug and play.
3,画質は満足、耐久性はこれから使用するため不明唯一難点は、USBの給電コネクタの口が横向きである事ノートPCを使用しているがノートPCのVGAコネクタに接続する際に、VGAの隣にあるHDMIと干渉する。購入時には、使用するパソコンのVGAコネクタとその隣のコネクタと干渉しないか位置関係を確認する必要あり。
4,VGAポートに付けるには少し大きすぎる。耐久性は不明だが、短時間でも熱を持っているのが気になる。画質はピントが甘くぼやけているのが残念。
5,以前に某国の商品を買って騙されました。この商品は無事一発で変換できました。古い機器を綺麗に写すことができました。どうもありがとう！
4,Einfache Lösung um alt mit neu zu verbinden. Die Angaben des Herstellers zur korrekten Verwendung sind sehr hilfreich gewesen da die Anschlüsse nur in "eine Richtung" funktionieren.Ein Tip: Darauf achten dass ein Anschluss für 35mm Klinke vorhanden ist sonst hört man keinen Ton über den/die TV Lautsprecher
5,Fonctionne impécable
5,Adesso posso collegare il mio vecchio portatile al proiettore tramite HDMI. Ottimo acquisto.
3,熱がかなり出ますね。あと、コードの繋げる順番が違うと映らないので注意が必要。画質はこんなもんなのかな？ぼやけますね。
4,かなり熱くなります
5,Für mein alten lenovo Laptop und ein neueren Fernseher mit hdmi Anschluss
4,ノートＰＣのモニターが突然真っ白になってしまった為、外部出力でテレビに映す為に購入。画も音もちゃんと出ました。滲みもなく思ったより画質がいいです。しいて問題点を挙げるならばＶＧＡのコネクタがゆるくてすぐに外れます（特にノートは固定するネジがない場合が多いので）。ただ、これは自分のＰＣとの相性かもしれません。
4,ノートPC+HDMI接続のディスプレイ2台でトリプルディスプレイを実現したいが、PCにはHDMIとD-subのVGA端子が一つづつしかなく、D-sub端子を変換するために購入。映像の出力という点では問題なく使えているが、一つ問題はD-sub端子がこのページの商品見本と上下逆についていること。D-sub端子は台形をしていて商品見本では商品のロゴがある側が台形の長い辺の側になっているが、実際に届いたものはロゴの側に短い辺がきている。これの何が問題かというと、電力供給のUSB端子が見本で想定していた向きと逆になるということ。おかげで自分のケースでは本来ノートPCの奥に向けてUSBケーブルが伸びるはずが手前側に伸びることになってしまい、(本来干渉しないはずだった)隣のHDMIケーブルと若干干渉してしまった。当面使えてはいるが、そのうちUSB端子に力がかかって接触が悪くなるなどのトラブルがあるのではないかと心配している。とはいえ、それ以外は問題ないのでそれさえ気にならなければまずまずの製品。
4,繋げ方を見て、映像はすぐにテレビに映すことができたが、音がなかなかテレビから出す事ができなかった。パソコン側の設定を色々いじって、最終的に出す事ができたが、その設定方法も説明書に載っていると親切だと思った。納期や配送に関しては特に問題がなかったので☆4の評価にしました。
4,モニタの壊れたノートＰＣをこの製品を使って、ＨＤＭＩでテレビ接続して使用しています。特段問題なく使用できています。
4,別の方のレビューにもありますが、USBの給電ポートの出る向きが、出品写真と逆です。私は、こちらの向きが良かったので結果オーライです。映像は、ちゃんと出力されますが、挿してからディスプレイに表示されるまでの反応は遅いです。あれ？ちゃんと刺さってないのかな？と思うくらいです。表示されてからは、綺麗に写ります。耐久性は、これからなので分かりません。壊れたら追記レビューします。
5,preis leistung passt
3,電力供給が必要
4,aucun souci avec .
4,問題なく動作していますが、結構熱を持つのがちょっと怖い。
4,Enstspricht den Erwartungen Bildqualität gut.
3,j'ai était obliger dans racheter 1 car le coté cdmi très fragile
5,Fácil conexión y perfecto funcionamiento.
4,Buon prodotto
4,Insgesamt ein gutes Produkt und eine gute Investition. Ein Stern Abzug da dass USB Kabel sehr kurz ist. Mein VGA Anschluss befindet sich links am Laptop und die USB Anschlüsse rechts so dass ich das Kabel über den Laptop legen muss und es dann grade so passt. Habe Angst vor einem Kabelbruch deshalb habe ich (und würde ich jeden empfehlen) eine USB-Verlängerung im Nachhinein dazu gekauft.
5,alles bestens
2,以下3機器からのVGA(D-Sub)出力を変換してみたところ出力機器との相性があった・ASPEED AST2500→出力問題なし・VideoCore IV→HDMItoVGA変換後(再度VGAtoHDMI変換)→出力問題なし・intel UHD 605 →変換できず（HDMIの出力なしとなるUSB給電が必須の製品であるが、本体側面に接続口があるため、切り替え機や小型の機器などのVGA端子付近が狭い場合には物理的に使用できないことがある。
5,I didn't buy this for myself but my son says it worked perfectly. Good if you own an old comp without HDMI.
5,Tutto
5,映像も安定して使いやすいです。
4,Good when you need to extend your screen but quality is not a really good one.
4,Perfetto per collegare un vecchio pc vaio alla tv recente con presa hdmi l'ho preso per vedere sulla tv le partite di dazn. Buonissima risoluzione efficace presa USB e soprattutto cavo hdmi integrato e lungo. Da segnalare per completezza che  su un altro mio vecchio tv led sharp però non è  stato riconosciuto ( ma per chi ha gli sharp questa non è  certo una sorpresa).
5,xpのpcからvga出力したのちhdmi端子しか無いタッチパネルモニターへの出力へ耐久力についてはまだまだだが使い始めて1週間、画像も良好タッチパネルの反応も良好追記、その後ブラックアウトする現象が増え試行錯誤の結果、microbのケーブルを別の物に変えて今のところ正常に
5,The converter worked fine. The picture quality and sound quality are  both excellent. We've used it with both zoom and Skype from our Dell latitude laptop and it's worked really well
2,全然ダメでした。
5,Ho usato questo cavo/adattatore per collegare un PC del 2006 con Windows XP a un monitor-TV LG privo di porta VGA.L'installazione è avvenuta con assoluta semplicità.Tanto il video quanto l'audio vengono trasferiti dal vecchio PC a una delle porte HDMI del monitor con ottima qualità.
5,I've turned my 32" tv into a monitor for the desk top computer really impressed by the large screen I now have and I can use it as a tv too.
5,Acquistato per collaborare un vecchio PC al TV LCD dotato solo di ingressi HDMI e funziona benissimo.
1,NON FUNZIONAVA LHO RESTITUITO
5,Acheté ce câble pour relier une Dreamcast en HDMI (via la VGA box Dreamcast vendue a l'époque). Fonctionne directement du premier coup image et son au top.Seul petit bémol le câble USB est un poil court (pas mesuré exactement mais a vu de nez environ 30cm) ce qui est un peu limite quand on utilise ce câble avec du matériel ne disposant pas d'un.
2,ノートパソコンに接続するため購入。HDMIとVGAと並べて接続した場合、給電用のUSB-Bケーブルと、HDMIケーブルが干渉してさせません。強引にやると、接続部分が壊れそうな感じです。他の方も書いてましたが、給電の差し込み口が逆なら良かったなと思う。たまに、ディスプレイに映像が出力されない。はじめは焦りましたが、ケーブルの抜き差し、給電USB-Bの抜き差しで、なんとか表示されました。使えないわけではないですが、結局、ノートパソコン→VGAの延長ケーブルからのこの商品ってことで、微妙に無駄金使いました。
5,Was looking for this cable for a while happy to finally find it. You need to plug in the USB for it to work which is a bit of a pain but sure look....
5,I wanted to project an old win 7 system in our pcb fab lab. That had a VGA connector for alternate screen dual screen or transfer. This adapter was fantastic. Simple plug in and it was powered from a USB port. Really glad i went for this product as the results were really good. Recommended. Andrew
5,Je suis satisfait d'amazone
5,Good quality after an operational glitch with my laptop it worked perfectly and able to operate in a Zoom meeting on my large screen tv. Very pleased with the lead sound is excellent too.
5,Es el cable idóneo para visualizar la imagen de un pc de sobremesa a una smart tv.. Fácil de instalar y definitivo.
5,chose on this occasion to go the complete cable route to connect PC display port on Dell to HDMI on TV. Really helpful piece of kit.
5,Très fonctionnel il joue son rôle bonne transmission du son et de l'image  attention de penser à brancher le Jack pour le son.
5,This product is stright forward to use plug and play and the picture is full size and it just works.If you need to use a VGA to HDMI lead use this one.
1,何度か出力方式を変更したあと気づいたけど、音左右逆だから！ｗ出てないわけではないし、ググってステレオ逆相とか変換アダプタやソフト、しまいにはソケットに突っ込むケーブルに延長かましてハンダで再接続とか考えたけど、ステレオ逆出力とか情報的にあり得ないらしい。ハンダでケーブル逆付けもミニプラグの絶縁はがして知ったけど、中で３芯になっていて細すぎて加工難だし出来ても圧損的に音に絶対影響すると思い諦めた。　この手の部品は無理してもアキバ秋月とか行って国産弄った方が正解もしれない。
4,A little pricey and early days but so far so good works well so far ( used it for only 24 hours ) the audio being built in is very usefull! Thankyou!
2,実は他の製品を購入して使えなくて再度この商品を選び購入してみました。使えたのですがモニターを二台で使おうとして、出力を二か所からしようとしたら私のPCだと電源供給するプラグが横の配線と干渉してしまいつなげなかったです。L字のプラグでなるべく背の低いやつを買ってためすしかなさそうです。ちょっと残念
5,I'm not a tech boffin like the people at Currys PC world who sold me 2 products that failed to do the job that this product does but I found this very simple to attach and it worked as soon as it was connected. It costs less than the 2 incorrect products from Currys too.
5,ノートPCのHDMI端子を破損してしまいました。替わるものを探していてこちらを試しました。なんだか沢山コードが増えてしいますが、接続して直ぐに使えました。映像も音声も今のところ問題ありません。満足です。
5,Tut was es soll. Meine Rettung. Bei einem deutschen Elektronik Discounter (M**** M****) wollten sie mir zur Lösung meines Problems 4 Dinge verkaufen (1Kabel VGA Kabel männlich/männlich Adapter VGA weiblich auf HDMI männlich ein Apter HDMI weiblich/weiblich ein Kabel HDMI männlich/männlich) Kostenpunkt 79.90€. Da ist diese Lösung schneller und effizienter und mit 20€ zudem günstiger. Kann ich nur empfehlen.
5,Good picture and easy to fit.
2,相性もあるのでしょうが、ウチのpcではどう設定しても対応していない信号だと表示され、映像が出ませんでした。これの後に購入したサンワプライの商品はきちんと映像が出たので、pc側には問題があると思えません。また、イヤホンジャックからの音声は認識されていたので、きちんとVGAの信号をHDMIに変換できていない可能性も有ります。相性問題も加味して、一応評価は星2ですが、私は返品しました。
5,Se devi collegare un vecchio pc come il mio ad un tv a led di nuova generazione questo cavo fa al tuo caso. Potrai vedere tutto quello che fai su un grande schermo e soprattutto sentire la musica in alta definizione ( io ho collegato il tv al Bose !! )Se non funziona subito dopo il collegamento devi impostare l'audio del pc e fare in modo che "esca" dalle cuffie (earphone)
5,Nessun problema; effettuati i collegamenti è stato possibile proiettare subito da PC.
5,Tried this cable on an old laptop with VGA port to a television with an HDMI port.  It worked great.  I would recommend.
2,Video feed works fine without audio. However when I plug in the audio adapter 40 seconds into any video it reverts to slow motion! So it's pretty disappointing if you want both video and audio from your TV.
5,XPのパソコン画面をTV出力する必要があり、対応する変換アダプタを探していました。試してみたところ、うまくいきました。
5,Connects my laptop to Samsung TV. Picture HD quality. No setting up just connect and select correct TV hdmi channel.
5,Kabel erfüllt das was ich mir erwartet habe. Von VGA am Laptop zu einem anderen Bildschirm mit HDMI Eingang.Habe 4 Meter Länge gewählt. Verarbeitung sieht recht gut auswird sich aber erst nach längerem Gebrauich zeigen.Funktion auf jeden Fall einwandfreifür einen guten Preis
4,Sehr gut
4,Besoin
5,attenzione a due cose: uno a non confondersi il cavo non è utilizzabile a rovescio. Puoi usarlo solo da PC VGA a HDMI del televisore o monitor. Seconda cosa in uscita da pc ci sono 3 connessioni VGA plug per audio e USB USB e VGA devono essere sullo stesso lato perché altrimenti il cavo usb è toppo corto. Il plug audio invece è lungo abbastanza per andare dall'altro lato del pc. ho dubbi che si riesca ad andare da fronte a retro eventualmente di un pc fisso
4,It is not the best value for money.
5,HDMIとVGAが出力端子の古いサブPCからVGA入力の無い新し目のPC2台にデュアルディスプレイ接続する方法を検討していました。HDMI・VGA変換コードはHDMI→VGAの向きのため、この変換アダプタにたどり着きました。最初接続したときにディスプレイに表示されずに焦りましたが、付属のUSBケーブルをPCに接続したら電力充分となったようで出力されました。画質も特に不満を感じません。
5,Excellent product. Nicely packaged and yes - easy to use! Let me repurpose an old PC that's still got plenty of life left. New OS (Linux flavour) cheap but new flat screen - this cable solves the incompatible connectors.
5,Adaptateur VGA/HDMI très pratique pour profiter de l'écran de la TV à partir d'un "vieux" PC installation très facile et très bonne qualité d'image
1,デュアルモニター用に購入し、接続したが、パソコン側は認識しているが、モニターには、何も映らなかった。信号がキチンと変換されていないようである。期待していただけに残念。
5,Produkt mit guter Qualität Preisleisungsverhältnis gut schnelle Lieferung bin sehr Zufrieden.
5,このような製品はきちんと使えるかどうかが懸念事項でしたが、普通に使えております。
5,cable length a little longer than needed  otherwise perfect
3,Bien la qualité du son petit souffle
5,Prima di ordinarlo avevo qualche perplessità sulla lunghezza temevo perdita di qualità del segnale.Ottimo prodotto funziona egregiamente sono molto soddisfatto.
5,Es un buen cable para conectar el ordenador con la tele.
5,Worked immediately and you can't say that for all of these cables!

4,Justo lo que buscaba
5,Good product fast delivery
5,Lo use para conectar el Portátil a la tele se ve muy bien la imagen
5,Das Kabel erfüllt genau seinen Zweck. Vom Laptop VGA zum TV HDMI. Bin sehr zufrieden.
5,does what it should no problems
5,the leads were exactly what I needed to use a 26 inch Samsung television to my desktop.thanks I would not hesitate to order from you company again.
5,Il convertitore funziona perfettamente comprato per un amico che doveva guardare il contenuto del PC vecchiotto (con sola uscita VGA) sulla TV già aveva acquistato altri apparecchi per il collegamento wifi che non funzionavano con questo gli ho risolto il problema istantaneamente.
5,Top Service und schnell
1,funktionieren ist was anderes .. aber nette Idee.. voll der Dreck!
5,Jetzt kann ich mit meinem alten PC locker auf dem 40Zoll TV-Monitor arbeiten.Sound kommt auch gut rüber.
5,Conecte mi viejo portátil a la TV con este cable y funciona muy bien. Lo recomiendo
4,Tutto come da descrizione funzionante al primo collegamento senza nessun problema
5,MEGA!Super schneller 1-Tages Versand und es läuft genau so wie erhofft.Auflösung von meinem alten PC auf einen OLED TV von Phillips in Full HD ohne Störung bislang👍
5,Assolutamente rispondente alle aspettative. Ottima fattura. Non servono driver. Lo uso quotidianamente per le presentazioni con pc portatile che supporta il 1920x1080. Anche l'audio è garantito con ottima resa di convertitore analogico/digitale
5,gesucht wurde eine Verbindung zwischen einem "alten" Laptop mit VGA und einem neueren Fernseher mit mehreren HDMI Anschlüssen.Produkt angeschlossen wie auf der Dokumentation beschrieben.Funktionierte direkt !
4,VGA vers hdmi
4,Easy to use.
5,Easy to use prompt delivery.
5,Thank you
5,Das Kabel tut genau das was es soll. Es verbindeet meinen alten LAptop mit meinem neuen TV. Die Bildqualität ist nicht "high end" aber für einen VGA-HDMI-Adapter zu dem Preis des Kabel völlig o.k.
4,passt  wunderbar
5,Works perfectly  very happy
4,is working
3,Arrivato nei tempi giusti e intero.
5,Easy to set up.
5,fonctionne correctement
5,Funziona io lo uso con Linux ubuntu mate occorre abilitare il monitor e fare molte prove ma funziona !Credo che lo stesso problema ci sia anche con Windows 10.
5,Weighed up cost versus having a DVI  put in my desktop. This VGA to HDMI Adapter Cable  did the job it was designed for at minimal cost.
1,気に入って選んだものの、見事にハズレの個体を引いてしまったようだ。信号が伝わらないという基礎的なトラブルです。個体差があるようなのでハズレたらすぐ返品するしかない。
5,Funciona correctamente para unir un pc portàtil hp de hace diez años con una tv de gama alta del 2020.
5,ho risolto problema di collegamento al tv
5,exactly what I needed. 100 % satisfied. Thank you!
5,Ottimo prodotto  arrivato praticamente subito  lo uso per trasferire le immagini da un pc con uscita VGA ad una smart TV con HDMI  le immagini sono perfette e senza perdita di qualità e con un buon audio.Lo consiglio
1,認識はしているのか、つなぐと画面が切り替わったような反応はするが、真っ暗なままで何も映りません。
5,Alcune persone "esperte" mi avevano detto che non era possibile trasformare una TV lcd in smart TV; invece con questo cavo ho finalmente potuto trasformare una TV lcd relativamente nuova in smart TV accedendo ad internet e utilizzando la piattaforma Netflix senza alcun problema. Acquisto utilissimo.
5,Bought to extent an old CCTV monitor to a new (HDMI) screen.Arrived when promised seems good build quality and worked fine. Great value.
5,たしかに隣のUSBなどのポートが使えなかったり、狭いところで使うとダメかもしれませんが、配線ができれば使えています。VGAポートのみでHDMIポートのないPCからテレビに映すのに重宝しています。
5,Sono contenta che ho acquistato ciò che cercavo nonostante le mie scarse competenze in materia tecnologica sono riuscita a collegare il mio vecchio pc alla mia Smart tv
5,It's verey good for old laptop to conected to TV's
4,Ottimo prodotto funziona egregiamente... Bravissimi cercavo questo adattatore da un po' e leggendo le recensioni precedenti mi sono deciso..! Grazie Amazon
5,vous permet de vous servir de votre tele comme ecran d ordi
5,Unico prodotto che mi ha permesso di portare video e audio su un tv con hdmi
5,パソコンからHDMI出力ができなかったので購入しました。綺麗に映ってます😊
5,Works perfectly
3,Respinto ma forse la colpa è mia che ho sbagliato "qualcosa" nei collocamenti
3,Alles erfüllt seinen Zweck.Endlich kann ich meine Spiele auf dem TV spielen.
5,Cable arrived fast and is working fine.
1,We couldn’t get the cable to work we tried two different laptops they are both running W10 they were all running up to date systems we altered resolution and whatever else we could but no joy. We bought a vga to vga cable in the end and that worked perfectly.
1,Schlechtes Produkt. Zwar empfohlen bei Chip jedoch völlig ohne irgendeinen Sinn. Angeschlossen an Notebook mit VGA und Sound nach TV mit HDMI. TV findet keine Quelle.
5,テレビをパソコンンモニターとして兼用するために購入しました。問題なく使用できました。
5,古いMacに繋いでHDMIで問題なくきれいな画質で画像が出力されました。安心して使用しています。
5,Tutto perfetto grazie mille
5,This helped out with sound with the setup I have. Brilliant
5,Fast service excellent product perfectly described.
5,lo utilizo para ver en una pantalla las imagenes de un dvd grabador. facil fe instalar y funciona perfectamente
3,Utilissimo ma il cavo audio non funziona. Ho sopperito in altro modo  ma resta il fastidio.
5,Very nice.
5,Andaba buscando un dispositivo para conectar la salida VGA con la salida HDMI para aprovechar los ordenadores de mesa con salida VGA y las pantallas nuevas con entrada HDMI.
5,Ottima soluzione quando hai il PC un po' troppo vecchio e il tv troppo nuovo. In pochi passaggi di configurazione si possono vedere i video dal PC alla tv
5,Répond à mes attentes
4,prodotto ottimo come richiesto spedizione veloce e ben confezionata  peccato che le informazioni cartacee siano in inglese comunque soddisfatto al 100
1,PC　VGAよりTV HDMIに入力してPC画面を映し出そうとしたが、何もでなかった。接続、設定が悪いとは思えない。素直にPC VGAよりTVのVGAへケーブルで接続した方がよかった。簡単に映った。
1,3回使ったら認識しなくなった。このアダプタを接続したままだとパソコンが起動しない。外すと正常起動する。今まで購入した中でも最低の部類の商品です。
3,Geht so
1,接続がショッチュウ切れる腹立つ
5,問題なく使えている。VGA→HDMIですので、そこだけ気をつければいいと思います。
5,Excellent does what it says on the advert well pleased couldn’t believe how quick it was delivered.thankyou TC.
5,Grazie a questo cavo posso mandare le immagini dal portatile al televisore 40 pollici. Ho trovato il prodotto perfetto per le mie esigenze. Consegna nei tempi stabiliti.
1,4月1日に受け取って、実質2日半(稼働20時間弱)の今日、突然モニターに出力しなくなりました。返品か交換の希望を「問い合わせチャット」みたいなので送ったけど、これで連絡できるのかな...？
5,Es práctico  para conectar un ordenador mayorcito con una tv jovencísima
5,Ho ordinato questo accessorio per adattare un vecchio schermo è perfetto qualità/prezzo adeguato.
1,Bonjour à tousAcheté pour raccorder un ordinateur portable avec une prise VGA à un projecteur HDMI pour diffuser des powerpoint dans une école ce câble ne fonctionne pas. Il détecte le projecteur envoi l'image du bureau celle-ci reste quelques secondes puis disparait et le système tombe dans une boucle où l'écran apparaît puis disparait tous les 5 secondes.J'avais un doute sur la conversion d'un signal analogique en numériqe mais mainteant je sais que cela ne fonctionne pas.A éviter.
1,音声がでない。
3,convient parfaitement à ce que j attendais
1,私のPCでは、使えませんでした。ちなみにHP
5,Compre el otro adaptador que sirve para lo contrario solo de vga a hdmi asi que no me sirve y lo peor es que parece que no tiene devolucion. Este producto es genial aunque la señal pierde 1  poco
5,Commande reçue dans les délais !Installation rapide et tout fonctionne merveilleusement !!Super contente de mon achat !je recommande le produit.
2,Cela ne servira donc pas
5,Der Artikel ist wie beschrieben.Ich kann diesen Artikel auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.Und der Preis ist auch OK.Empfehlenswert !!!
5,Fácil instalación. Conecta PC antiguo con TV Smart
5,thank you!
5,Tut was es soll. Für ältere Rechner ohne HDMI einfach gute Lösung.
5,J'ai utilisé ce cable pour connecter un vieux PC (sotie VGA) à ma télé (Entree HDMI) sans probleme.
5,Gut
5,Did exactly what it says on the box. Works well
5,Hat die Erwartungen voll erfüllt und funktioniert einwandfrei.
5,Das gerät tut was es verspricht. Da kann man nicht mehr viel dazu sagen. Bin sehr zufrieden und würde aufjedenfall nochmals kaufen!
5,Problema risolto. Ottimo prodotto. Spedizione top. Ordinato giovedì 9 aprile consegnato sabato 11. Top
1,使用してみて気になった所ですが、PCにもよりますがVGA端子の位置によっては電源用のUSBケーブルが邪魔をし、隣のコネクターが使用できない場合があった。又、この電源ケーブルの配線によって音声出力にノイズが乗る事もあった。現在、VGA切替器の出力にこの変換コネクターを使用し接続しているが、電源ケーブルの配線を変えてからは音声出力にもノイズが乗らず使用できている。耐久性についてはまだ使用を始めて約３週のため様子を見る必要があると思う。
5,Does the job it's intended for & working well at present
5,trés bon produit merci
5,Cable que cumple con lo que se espera de él poco mas se puede decir funciona es correcto le pongo las 5 estrellas porque en definitiva hace lo que tiene que hacer.
1,この商品は不良品で使えませんでした！皆さん気をつけて下さい！最低、最悪の商品！
5,Easy to use works a treat.
1,パソコン画像をテレビに映すために購入したがいざ繋ぐと画像が映ったり消えたり雑音もひどい。接触不良ではないかと思われる。ほんの数分でも相当熱をもつので火が付くのではと心配。返品して違うものを買うことにします。このような商品の中ではレビューが良いほうだったので残念。
1,使用して2回目で音が出なくなりました。
1,This item was faulty it's a pity that they don't check to see if this/these VGA to HDMI adapter cables work before shipping them out?! It took quite a while for it to arrive and then for it not to work was so frustrating.
5,Installato nel mio computer abbastanza datato e funziona benissimo. Molto soddisfatto.
5,OK
5,very good
5,Sehr gute Lösung. Praktisch.
5,Producto ideal para pasar la imagen de un pc que no lleva salida hdmi a una television moderna con resolucion 4k.

5,Thanks
5,Funziona perfettamente. Cavo ben realizzato

4,Fonctionne bien et est pratique mais il ne tient pas bien. nous l'avons depuis quelques années et il est encore efficace. bon achat
5,As soon as I connect it it worked without any problem.
2,Did not work no image! I think it’s a resolution compatibility problem with my DVD player.
1,It works on neither HP Elitebook 840 c3 nor Thinkpad X61 both VGA & USB are connected and all possible resolution were tried (1366x768 1280x720 1024x768 800x600). Display tried monitor LG 32UK550 and TV LG 55LA6900. Nothing happened on laptop and "No signal" on TV/monitor. I asked for return
5,Works as perfectly as described. And the delivery was swift and easy to track.
5,Very nice compact converter.  Works perfectly on my 7 yr old laptop with no flicker at all at 1920 x 1080 on either my 32" Curved Samsung or 27" Asus gaming monitor.
5,Ok
