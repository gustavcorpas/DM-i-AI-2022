5,So I've been looking for my do-it-all BT speaker for a while without spending too much and of the ones I have owned the Sony SRS-XB33 is the clear winner.  Scroll down if you want to read the direct review of the Sony speaker. Previously I've owned the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra and briefly the Tribit Maxsound Plus and JBL Charge 4.  The Oontz speakers I still own (two in paired stero) and they are a great value for the money especially as a pair in stereo.  That would be a clear winner for me for under $100 (for both!)  However as you might imagine the small size and overall build prevents this from really producing deep resonating bass and the overall sound is a little thin without a ton of range.  However for a lot of people these would be a perfectly acceptable choice for on-the-go music.The Tribit Maxsound was just not very good.  I don't know how it seems to receive such high praise as an affordable but great sounding speaker.  It just isn't very good very tinny and the bass is really lacking.  The Oontz speakers are a much better sound profile and even slightly better bass.  That model also cannot be paired in stereo (AFAIK).  Not worth purchasing IMO.Now for the XB33 and how it compared to a worthy competitor the JBL Charge 4.  The two speakers are of similar size (I didn't get exact measurements but are more or less similar) and larger than I might have though.  Perhaps because I was used to much smaller cheaper BT speakers...  These are definitely not as portable at least for things like packing in luggage.  Probably fine for road trips but I would not want to pack this in my airplane luggage.  In the box comes the speaker a charging cord and some (terrible) instructions.  The instructions now look like IKEA assembly instructions just confusing pictures.  The pairing process is pretty easy.SOUND:  The sound quality of this speaker is outstanding.  The overall sound profile is very rich and it seems to carry farther than the volume would indicate.  Meaning some speakers are loud but when you walk further away from it the sound dissipates quickly.  The Sony speaker's sound carries farther I don't know why that is or how that is quantified other than when I walk away from it the volume I hear decreases much more slowly than some other speakers I've had.  Again that's one of those possibly subjective things but it's definitely true based on my experience.  The bass is very robust and resonates well without simply thumping for the sake of being the deepest hardest bass.  The Charge 4 has deeper bass that hits harder but this one just sounds better.  It complements the mids and highs much better than the Charge 4.  Speaking of which the main issue I had with that speaker is the lack of clarity in the mid range.  The profile was just too one-dimensional for me.  Thumpy bass and decent highs but there was no depth to the sound.  I just could not get into the sound profile from that speaker.  You'll see a common complaint about the Charge 4 is the mids and it absolutely is true.  A good speaker with very good bass but no depth and dimension to it.  Back to this speaker the overall sound profile is the key point.  The bass is very good but the speaker isn't just a slapper.  The mids and highs are all excellently rendered in a very three dimensional sound that works well together.  There isn't one aspect of this speaker that is "the best" but as a total package it's the best sound I've heard from speakers in and around this price point.  Recently I purchased a second to pair in stereo and I'm even more impressed now.  One speaker by itself sounds so rich that you may not need a second but you really can hear the difference in two of them.  Hands down this is the winner vs the Charge 4 and an excellent value in this price range.  Oh I forgot to mention the lights!  They are customizeable in the app and really add some additional flare to a great sounding speaker for those big house parties.A few minor complaints I have.  One is the volume of this speaker is surprisingly low.  I have sensitive hearing so I generally don't need extreme volume but I find myself usually at about 80-90% volume outside and maybe 70% inside and that's just to listen at a decently loud but comfortable volume.  If you turn it all the way up it's loud but I could easily leave it turned up all the way without feeling like my ears would start bleeding immediately.  Even my small Oontz speakers can get louder.  Again as a stereo pair the overall volume is much louder and that might be a solution but as a solo speaker some people might find the volume a bit low.  Also the battery life is pretty poor.  Maybe I'm not used to these larger speakers but I find myself charging the thing every few days using it several hours a day.  It is probably within spec but it sure does seem like these need to be charged quite often.  However apart from that this speaker is fantastic and highly recommended.
5,The Sony SRS-XB33 lives up to the hype and then some. In fact I can’t find a thing to criticize. As a matter of  fact I’m about to purchase another right now. And I’d be lying if I said I’m going to gift it. Nope. It’s for me me me. A number of similar Sony BT portables have the ability to pair with another for stereophonic listening bliss. This is a pleasure I’m certain you’ll want to experience for yourselves. Treat yourself!
3,I purchased this speaker in December of ‘21 and have genuinely been waiting to give it a review to see how I actually like it. Unfortunately I’m less than impressed with this speaker. The speaker does have a decent sound - as in the speaker works. However I don’t feel like I can figure out the right sound settings. It’s either too much bass and not enough voice or too much voice and no bass. This speaker also has a very forward sound. If you are standing to the side or back of the speaker you can hardly hear the sound. I used to have a JBL and switched to Sony. The JBL has a very 360 sound where you can set the speaker anywhere and hear it everywhere. With the Sony I’m constantly having to move the speaker with me so I can hear the sound. The Sony Music Center app you use to adjust the effects is also kind of odd and pointless. The speaker itself doesn’t have a great sound like the JBL does so it’s hard to pinpoint what settings you need to make it sound better. There’s also a ‘Live’ button on the speaker itself that Sony touts should fill a room more with sound and be a more ‘live concert’ feel. I unfortunately don’t hear much difference at all between Live on and Live off. Overall I should have stuck with my gut and JBL instead of switching. Again in my opinion? not a terrible speaker but also not great.
5,I dont' have a picture but this product was the perfect gift for my husband.  He loves his music and carries this speaker everywhere he goes around the house outside on the porch to the garage etc.  I just might have to get he a couple more so he doesnt' have to carry it around.
5,This is the BEST Bluetooth speaker FOR small groups and back patio gatherings. It is pretty loud in a bedroom or bathroom.Bought it for golfing and swimming pool gatherings of 6 people or less. I use it when I play golf. It has rubber bottoms and sits against the windshield of the golfcart perfectly. The sound is balanced with heavy bass. This is my second Sony speaker of this size. My first sony speaker was stolen! I loved it so much that I bought it again. It has excellent sound balance & terrific sound quality!! The bass on this is the best I have heard ever for this size speaker! I keep my iPhone in my pocket when golfing and control the volume/songs playing through the speaker from the putting green. So the Bluetooth range is reliable. Great speaker for GOLFING!!
5,Amazing quality looks good I used it also in my car while my car system was down for a bit and it worked better than my car speakers  super easy to install and there are some supplemental apps you can download too from Sony to enhance the experience
5,All I have to do is turn it on and it connects to my phone via Bluetooth immediately. Press play on my phone and I'm suddenly listening to my favorite Playlist from Spotify. Currently this sits in my kitchen. I have taken it outside for my listening pleasure while working in my yard. The sound quality is much better than I've ever heard from a small portable speaker. I'm pleased with this purchase.
5,I really enjoy good quality sound (not to the point of an audiophile) and this speaker is great. Good base and also with violin and piano. The lights are also a cool feature but I havent found a time they were so practical so they are off most of the time. Ive also listened to some friends JBL speakers like the charge 4/5 and flip 6and there is a slight difference but neither are better than the other imo.
4,I am giving this product 4.5 stars.  I received it yesterday and connected it within minutes.  So easy to pair with devices.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It is not as loud as jbl speakers in its price range but it is loud enough to be heard several feet away outside. I work outside in urban community gardens and there is a lot of noises competing on being the loudest.My usual work day is shoveling stuff and so sound of several shovels scraping can be pretty loud. I keep the xb33 at 100% and the music is not drowned out by outdoor sounds. The speaker last about 8-10 hours at full volume on live mode or extra bass mode. Stamina mode can last 24 hours but it feels pointless to drop that much on a speaker and not use it's full potential.One of my coworkers has a jbl charge 5 but everyone prefers my xb33 despite it not being as loud. The xb33 makes up for its lack of loudness by having a much better balanced sound stage. You can hear every instrument and detail clearly and it doesn't get lost when you turn up the volume. The jbl speakers aeem to only focua on vocals mids highs and booming bass. The same songs can sound noticeably different on each speaker.Regarding music this speaker is versatile. I use it to play trip hop hip hop drum & bass jpop rock metal soul funk dub Latin jazz orchestral house and pop music and it all sounds great on it. The speaker doesn't have bias for any genre or elements but with the equalizer app you can get some customization. I have a video showing off the different songs I have playing on it.The range is fantastic and lives up to marketing. I had coworkers pair to my speaker and the walk offsite to do something else. Their phone would still be playing music through the speaker after they left but once they left the 66 feet range then it would disconnect.It lives up to being waterproof I used it in the rain and it worked perfectly fine. I spilt soda on it and ran water on it and it wasn't damaged at all either. I never worry about getting the speaker dirty because I know I can rinse the dirt off.I bought mine used for $60 and was surprised by how new it looks and perform. Don't be afraid of buying these used if you wanna save some money.
