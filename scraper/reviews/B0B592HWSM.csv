5,This thing is exactly what I needed.I have internet probably about 30-50 yards away from my RV. Yes I'm RV living. So the wifi only reached (with a weak signal) to the edge of the RV. I put the extender inside and it couldn't grab the signal so I put it outside on the edge of where the signal stopped. Now I have wifi inside and on most of the property with excellent service. The RV is covered from the elements so the extender doesn't get wet.On e plugged in it took a little bit to turn on and figure out since the instructions are kinda vague. However this thing is highly recommended and saved me from getting an extender that was going to cost way more from a friend at the wifi company.Note: it's best to use it where your wifi ends or stops to extend the wifi out if you are quite a ways from the router. I could see this being great for RV travelers to get that strong full signal.  Or anyone that can't get wifi in certain parts of your house or property. Definitely buying more in the future.
4,I bought this specifically to reach a smart TV in a back room that could not connect to my WIFI. Initially the extender would not connect as accessing the required website was not working properly. I was very hesitant to log into this website as my computer showed it was not HTTPS protected. This concerned me but even more so having my computer possibly exposed to outside entities including the maker of the product. You have to exit your password protected router connection on your computer (or smart phone if you choose that avenue) to access this extender; to make the initial connection.I backed away from utilizing it but after not finding any reviews noting the same concerns I tried again a few days later and the site worked. I obtained the connection desired on the extender and connected it to the TV in question. I then exited the connection made on my computer and re-connected to the main router. I feel better about this but I am no tech guru and could be completely off base as to whether my computer was / is / has been potentially compromised.As for the connection to my TV - I now have an "excellent" connection when before it was "poor" and unable to stream.I plugged this into a wall socket about 70 feet away and just around a wall corner leading into the rear bedroom; and it communicates.So far I am happy with the increase in connectivity but admittedly still a little leery overall. Trust is difficult at least for me when it comes to this type of stuff. Just being real...
5,My husband works out of state and lives in company campground. Wifi is available but since he is the last camper he cannot even pull up the network to log onto wifi.  Researched read reviews and purchased this with the thought that - if it doesn’t work no problem we can send it back.  Plugged it in and within 30 seconds WE HAD WIFI!Awesome signal with no lag at all.  Very easy setup!  I would suggest this for anyone trying to boost their wifi.  As I said We couldn’t even pull up the network before to enter password.  Now we have 3 phones iPad and tv all on the network with perfect wifi!!!  BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW!!
4,Well the first time the order never came I had to call to get another one shipped to me........It did help a little I had a poor single in the back bedroom.......Before the signal was always poor to medium with this booster I do get a continuous medium signal............... my home is only 1500 sq.ft. and they say this should cover 8000 sq.ft so I was hoping for a lot stronger signal in the back bedroom
5,Super product!  Very happy!  Installed and running in 5 minutes!  Now have an excellent signal throughout the house.I've fought my internet provider for years with poor signal in parts of my small house.  In order to fix first they said they'd send me a free extender if my signal didn't improve.  We look it didn't improve and they refused to send a free extender instead this me to purchase one for $150.  Thought I would give this one I found a try so glad I did!  Thanks have a great signal all over how.
5,Ordered this product because I wasn't getting much of a signal with my current WI-Fi in the back rooms of the house and out near our lake.  I received the product quickly and followed the instructions that were in the package.  I also watched a movie they had about setting it up online.  Got it all set up in minutes and went outside to test it.  I signed into the network for the extender which took a minute or so then I was receiving a signal out near the lake.  Had been wanting to buy an extender for awhile and after researching for about a week I decided on this one.  Good choice in my opinion.  I'm no tech person but if I was able to set this up so can you.  Happy with my purchase to date.
5,This extender is perfect for any home.  I have a 80 ft long house and the modem is at the opposite end of my grandson's gaming PC. He placed the extender midway of the house and everyone has excellent signal for all our electronic needs!! Perfect piece of equipment!!
5,I bought this wifi extender to extend the wifi signal from my router (located in my basement) to a shed about 90 feet behind my house that has a TV and online gaming.  It works great.  The extender is situated under a covered porch in my yard so there is no problem with the weather.
5,The Wi-Fi extender was easy to setup. I plug it in. Connected to the extender with my cell phone set it up andit was ready to use.Solved my dead stops issues and the 2.4ghz resolved my issues in the back yard which is about 140 feet from the router. The Wi-Fi is now useable all across my property. which is 70 ft by 198 ft
5,I have tried several Wi-Fi expanders and had no luck or very poor signal. Now I have great signal and service without interruption. No more searching or waiting for the signal to load. I recommend this product 10 out of 10 times.
5,Was unable to pick up Wi-Fi on my back porch. Bought this extender and placed in the room leading to the porch and was immediately able to receive signal when on the back porch and not just one bar but multiple. Good product worth the money
5,This product was exactly what I was looking for. It sa a long range is easy to set up and works with older technologies. I put it in the main hallway of my house to boost the signal for my television. I no longer experience any lag or dropped signal. 100% buy this product.
5,This works great within your house. I needed it to extend so I could put a camera on my mailbox. It did not do that. The mailbox is 150 feet from our house.
5,This item works perfectly to extend my home WIFI to my Un-attached Pole Barn/Garage.I purchased this WIFI Extender to get WIFI in my garage.  Now my Amazon Echo has great connectivity for garage tunes and my phone connects when I need to look up parts and or how-to videos.Great Value and does exactly what I need it to do.
5,This was the 3rd brand of extender that I purchased.  The first 2 frequently had to be unplugged and replugged to work.  This one works great and was easy to set up.  I have been using it for 2 weeks and have not had any problems with it.  I definitely recommend this Extender.
5,We used this product to help us receive a better Wi-Fi signal in all areas of the home. It significantly helped in some spots that periodically does go out and has to be reset. Minimal instruction book. Could use more detailed information. Super simple to set up.
5,Before my Wi-Fi use be really bad until I got  this product it can go really far and it has its own password you can set up I would really recommend product.
5,Love it! It works great and you can’t beat it for the price. Instructions could use a little work for us non techies but it was still relatively easy to install
5,Very powerful signal compared to my old extender. I had a problem setting it up. In the end I went to my wireless router and changed the passwords of the extender there. Then went back to my phone and finished the install process using the new passwords I had created in my router. After that everything worked great.
5,This product has a great wifi signal clear out to my garage. There isn't even any lag with it either. It was easy to install and was a great price.
5,I was skeptical about whether this could really work. I have an upstairs apartment and I got pretty sketchy Wi-Fi service up there. ALOT of buffering. It now works amazing! Well worth trying!
5,I needed to extend my WiFi signal into my backyard so that I could stream to a projector. (Kinda an outdoor theatre). I was always buffering before I got this.
5,Boosts signal from main floor to the basement through a metal ceiling.  Four firesticks operate good from this booster.  Instructions were printed in a very small size.
5,We are using this in our camper and if you know anything about camping sometimes the wifi can be spotty at best. This unit was super easy to set up you pretty much plug it in and you are done. We were able to use our phones and watch the games throughout the day without interruption. We highly recommend this product for the price you can't beat it.
5,I bought this device to use in my motorhome parked outside of my daughter and son-in-laws house. My home is being remodled so I'm living out here and using the internet insie the house.On a good day I would lose my connection 5x per day. Sometime 10x. I bought this device plugged it in roughly 3 weeks ago and haven't lost connection once. And I'm outside the house 70 ft from the door.5 Stars!

5,It arrived on time and was super easy to set up I had it set up in mins and my signal strength is a lot better
5,The instructions were not written in a manor that is easy to understand setup was easy after selecting the network.This did not have to be plugged into the router and I did the setup on the second story away from the router.Set up was easy once I selected the 5g network it connected
5,The wifi repeater did not take long to connect it was rather simple. After connection the wifi had a full connectivity in my detached garage. I would recommend this repeater.

5,We had gotten new internet service and the signal just wasn’t getting to the back of our house.  This changed that and we haven’t had any big issues since getting it.  The one the company wanted us to buy was crazy expensive so this also saved us money that way!!!

4,Our cell service and Wi-Fi is terrible this helped give us a bit more range. Easy set up
5,This extender does well if you are really close to it.  We placed it in our hallway between two bedrooms (the bedrooms share a wall) and the extender did not work.  We had to place the extender in the room that we wanted to use the wifi in.
5,This is a wonderful product. Worth all the money spend on it.
5,Just what I needed for my house. Works well so far.Was supposed to have gotten a $40.00 Amazon gift card but never recieved it.
