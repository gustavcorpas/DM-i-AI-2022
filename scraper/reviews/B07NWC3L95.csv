5,I bought this to record my daughters indoor volleyball games from the comfort of the stands. I am able to protect the tripod if a ball flies our way but I would not recommend leaving this tripod unattended as it is not sturdy enough to withstand a direct hit. If you are looking to live stream games that you leave unattended then Iâ€™d suggest buying a shock resistant sturdy tripod.This one fit my specific needs. Itâ€™s compact and I am able to carry it with me everywhere with ease.It fits inside a regular sized backpack but not a smaller or mid-sized one. Something to consider for those that do not like to carry bulky bags. I donâ€™t but donâ€™t mind carrying this tripod in my hand.
5,I am quite the Instagram addict if I say so myself. I love taking pictures of others and itâ€™s great to have someone return the favor. The only problem is that I usually never like the pictures others take of me. Itâ€™s always either too much ground or too much sky or they catch me right when I am about to switch my pose. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the phone my face or the personâ€™s inability to find good angles. Weâ€™ll never know. Anywhoâ€¦I eventually decided to just start taking pictures for myself. So I invested a few hard earned dollars into this tripod.This is the first tripod that I have owned. I think for the price it is great quality. You can adjust the height considerably. The remote control connects to my phone in a matter of seconds. You literally just turn it on and BOOM! Start clicking away. I love that I donâ€™t have to run back and forth to set a timer for each picture. This allows me to focus on the picture itself to make them more natural. I donâ€™t have to start the timer and then think of a pose. I guess you could say itâ€™s a lot less manual. The one downside is that if you are someone like me that takes at least 300 pictures before picking the 2 good ones you have to remember to not go crazy with the clicks. Give it time so the pictures are clear. Otherwise theyâ€™ll turn out all blurry. Take your time with the shoots. Also because the remote is very small it can get lost easily. Try to keep in the same place so it doesnâ€™t get lost.The tripod is relatively compact. I carry it in a tote bag and it fits well. Itâ€™s super light weight. When itâ€™s getâ€™s windy it can get flimsy swaying back and forth and even fall. Always set it on a flat surface to prevent phone damage.Overall a great product for recording videos taking group pictures or taking solos when you see an aesthetic location and decide to pull over. Allows you to enjoy the moment without focusing too much on capturing it :)
5,I love the remote definitely helps when taking your own photos or videos! Itâ€™s tall but does break easily if not careful. This is my 2nd one but beats the other over priced stands! Gets the job done!!
5,It seems to be well built for the price. Holds my phone and a tab4 well. Compact easy to use. Remote works range seems to be pretty good. Never had it fail but do wish it only had 1 button.
5,Iâ€™ve had this tripod for 3 months now and everything still works great never have trouble with connecting the Bluetooth remote to my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Itâ€™s built sturdy for sure also
5,I gave this a five star because of the functionality and customer support Amy! We had a funny misplaced part that our youngest son had moved because he thought it was my wife's car key fob in turn it was what we thought a part was missing. We  contacted Ubeesize customer service and within 6 hours Customer Service Team Amy contacted us to replace the missing part. Our Family had a laugh in turn we were embarrassed that our child had moved it (doing the right thing) setting it where he believed the key fobs are supposed to be. Our apologies to Amy and our Thank Yous all in a same day in which is un heard of. We recommend UBEESIZE products 1000%.
5,This is all you need. Donâ€™t waste your time going through other tripods looking through reviews and doubting it. Just get it and thank me later. Itâ€™s freaking amazing. I had originally bought a $14 tripod at Walmart but I returned it because it was only about 3ft tallâ€¦ Iâ€™m glad I did. I was super desperate and wanted to just get another one at Walmart for a higher price but it didnâ€™t come with a remote!! Iâ€™m so glad I chose to buy this tripod on Amazon. Itâ€™s 6ft tall (reminds me of my ex.. ima call him after this) it has a Bluetooth remote!!! The phone holder flips and is super secure on the phone without being too Aggresive. I just love it. Take my word for it BUY IT NOW
5,Me and my friend had a mini photo shoot sesh outside her house at night and this is how the pics turned out! At first they forgot to send the adapter and remote but once I emailed them they sent a replacement and got it within 3 days. I need to start taking more of my own pictures which is why I got it!! Definitely motivates me to take my own pics ðŸ˜Œ
5,I absolutely love this tripod. I've taken several pics using it. It is very easy to use. Very happy with it. I do wish it came with a little bag so I could easily take it around.
5,INFLUENCERS !!!! You need this Recommended by Monique SMITH ! We love her
5,Easy to use and affordable very sturdy and easy to carry
5,if you travel or want consistent content for your social pages this is the tripod for you. I took a solo trip to LA a couple months back and it came in handy to get vacation shots of me at local tourist spots without having to ask people to take my picture. The fact that I get to see me while taking a picture and having the ability to control how many pictures I take from a far is great.this was also amazing tool to have when I was in Utah and wanted a landscape shot with me in it from far away. The Bluetooth reached and I got some killer photos because of it.
4,I like this item to use only as a tripod. Its advertised as a selfie stick also however it is far too heavy to be used as a selfie stick.
5,Easy to use and program
5,very convenient
5,works well
5,This is such an easy and light weight tripod. It holds my canon rebel camera perfectly. No wobbling or uncertainty. Itâ€™s very sturdy! My only issue is you may lose the remote. Iâ€™ve missed place it many times because it is so small. Needless to say itâ€™s a great gear to have.
5,Easy to use with adjustable features
5,The height of this tripod is quite nice and having so many height settings was helpful. The clip that holds your phone is quite flexible so you can angle your phone in quite a few different ways which I like. The remote has the option to either press the button once for a photo or hold it down for a video but it wouldn't make sense to hold the button down the entire time for a video so I wish there was a separate button to stop and start videoing. Otherwise I think this tripod is pretty good.
5,This little guy does the trick. When itâ€™s folded up it takes up little room but once you open it it gets up to a good height. The remote is easy to sync with your phone whether itâ€™s an iPhone or android.  The adjustable base it easy to take phones in horizontal or vertical mode.
