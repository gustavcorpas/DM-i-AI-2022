5,This is a sleek light and premium-feeling laptop! Performance is solid too.A really good choice if you game do creative work and also travel a lot.
4,lets get to the point it gets HOT just by light gaming anything with ultra setting it get uncomfortably to touch. Normal browsing internet youtube netflix word excel this device doing great job keeping it cool as long as you get intake fan little room to breathe (my solution was using laptop tray with build in fan). Battery life with Ryzen 9 hype and all that doesn't help much it still have room to improve in the future hopefully (Razer hope you read this) plugged in all the time no big deal to get best performance out of this laptop for gaming or productivity work. Yep its 14 inch and ultra lightweight design itself undeniably great and have the premium feel and solid. Keyboard lights up help when typing in the dark. Screen refresh rate great for FPS and other game. Processing speed great and fast thanks to Ryzen 9 DDR5 RAM and M.2 Nvme SSD that build-in. RAM soldered-in (cant be upgraded sadly) SSD just your typical swappable with bigger capacity if needed (1TB by default). Hope this help you making decisions before purchashing.
4,Good laptop should have option for 32 GB upgrade or offer it from the beginning
2,I've used a Razer laptop for over 10 years now. It's been my favorite laptop I've ever had. After 10 years it was time for an upgrade. I was excited read the reviews love the hardware (no issues there with a couple exceptions).Build quality (Or feel) is exceptional love the size the weight. Keyboard WOULD be excellent - but it had keys that wouldn't depress - or would be semi-constantly depressed (control key for example).Screen was excellent (although honestly I'm surprised that Apple continues to have brighter clearer screens than anyone). I'd say it was 8/10 compared to the highest end screens I've seen - also with it being matte.Wifi - unfortunately there was a major bug with mine where the wifi would disappear for.... who knows how long. At first it was just a minute - restart and there it was. By the 4th week - it would disappear and not reappear upon restart. No idea what caused this - even after a few full resets. Thinking it's firmware or hardware issue.Ram - In using photoshop on the 1st day it ran out of ram. Personally from a numbers perspective this machine has far too little ram (my one actual criticism of the overall product - despite the numerous issues with this one in particular). It needs a minimum of 32gb. I couldn't figure out what was causing this (windows 11 ps or the machine itself) but whatever it was made it completely unusable for my main tasks.Windows 11 - seems interesting but seems to be another BS update by microsoft. The inability to setup without an internet connection is a deal breaker for me as well (I live in a rural area with no internet connection). Windows continues to have multiple interfaces for settings (Some as old as windows 2000 days). I hate windows so much at this point. I'm no apple fan boy but they just can't seem to create anything cohesive.Overall I had some major problems with my old laptop and would have hoped that 10 years later (or 7 if you count when I was working with Razer to resolve) Razer would have over come their manufacturing hurdles. For a nearly $4k laptop I expect perfection. This was a horrible joke on many levels and I can't recommend Razer products moving forward from this experience.
5,What more can I say? It's sleek and slim doesn't have an overbearing gamer aesthetic to it like most powerful laptops with good dedicated GPUs in them. It's incredibly powerful as well tested out Elden Ring on max settings and it ran perfectly all while managing to stay very quiet. Haven't tried any more powerful games but I feel like so long as you tune whatever you play back a little (and make some other tweaks like turning off Turbo Boost on the cpu) you've got yourself quite the powerful laptop with minimal noise compared to other gaming laptops.
5,Build quality is top notch.  The feel of the laptop has that same attention to detail that an apple product has.  It'll run any game smoothly and most at relatively high graphics settings.  They also make an effort to let you know that they used soy ink for the packing when you open up the box for the first time.  I will definitely buy another blade 14 in the future knowing that they use soy ink.
5,Just an amazing laptop. Really having a good experience. Was not expecting to be this good!
5,Great laptop. Just what i needed. Delivery was faster than expected.
5,Yes! But only on cable mode.
