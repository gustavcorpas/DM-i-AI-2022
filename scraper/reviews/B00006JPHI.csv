5,This is a difficult to find battery and I always go with Durcell because I've come to trust the longevity.
5,Just what I was looking for
5,All went well with receiving the batteries thanks!
5,Couldn't anywhere find these at the price. Use them clocks have lasted quite a while.
5,these fit and my clock works again
5,Lights
5,What can I say.? They‚Äôre batteries.  A little pricey but this size is hard to find retail.  And I haven‚Äôt used them long enough to judge longevity.
5,Excellent
5,OK
5,Good value
5,Everything excellent
5,these n batteries were bought from pulse fulfillment they were very fresh unlike 364 batteries i bought from another supplier. i did get a refund but who wants to go through hoops and waste time.
5,This seems pointless: What am I supposed to say; it fit in just like its supposed to. It had a full charge so it works (just like its supposed to). Longevity I'll let you know hopefully in a long time from now until then keep buying batteries.
5,So much cheaper then stores. They work.
5,A clock
5,Na
4,Good price. Works. As advertised received two in pack.
5,all fine no "like/dislike"
5,Clock is working again.  Thanks
5,Clock battery
5,Arrived on time and in good shape
4,I don‚Äôt know enough about this product to add any more review.
5,specific product I needed and could not find This was great
4,Everything was expected except it took nearly a week to arrive.
5,Was good
5,I was having trouble finding this size battery.  When I finally did they were so old they had no power.  The ones I purchased from Amazon were fresh and lasted over 9 months in my device.
5,I always buy this brand duracell
5,Para una calculadora financiera
5,Excellent
5,Needed this particular battery for a toy and was happy to find a Duracell since i think they are a good brand. Haven‚Äôt had it in use long enough to know but expect it to last well. Seller was prompt and packaging was good.
5,I‚Äôd never heard of an ‚ÄúN‚Äù size battery had been to a battery store and they didn‚Äôt have them! Found a cute clock at a yard sale ordered these and it‚Äôs ticking away. These last almost a year in the clock. Thanks Amazon!
5,Quality of item was great! Very agreeable packaging. Exceptionally speedy delivery. Would buy from again.
5,I needed a battery for a beautiful clock: it fit and it works
5,Yep. Sure is.
5,I bought these for a clock. It‚Äôs been about a month now and the clock is still working. So far so good!
5,My power probe is cordless and it will check for continuity but my batteries went out. Just the fix I needed
5,Used with a Triplet electronic voltage meter from the 1970‚Äôs
5,Hard to find battery but guess what? Amazon's got'emWorks great!
5,‚è∞
5,easy to find and just what was needed
5,great product.use in a small desk clock
5,Prompt shipping of product as described.
5,So far so good
5,I keep my clock running so they're good
4,Good name and value for money. Haven't had long enough to determine longevity.
4,Use for an electronic clock.  Works just fine.
5,I was so glad to find these batteries. I looked at Walmart Walgreens and the grocery story. NO N batteries. This is what I needed and it came right to the door. Thank you.
5,The batteries arrived as promised and were at a great price. I haven't had the batteries long enough to give a true rating on the longevity and battery life but by the Duracell name they should last a long time.
5,I can not find these in any store. It fit my clock perfectly and works great!
5,Swiss Army analog travel alarm perhaps obsolete but a classic. Duracell has shown great longevity no corrosion or leaking years down the road. Many more years before I use the second battery the battery life is so good.
5,These were placed in a dive computer.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†UPDATE: It is 1/13/21 and all my vintage crystal mantle clocks are still ticking with the batteries!Just got these today for a vintage crystal legends clock that I thrifted.Working just fine. Will update battery efficiency as time passes. Overall satisfied with purchase and item as described. Can‚Äôt complain for the price of $0.97!
5,Just purchased this battery as a replacement for a beautiful crystal clock I‚Äôve had 32 years. The N size Duracell battery I‚Äôd often difficult to find in store was much easier to order online at Amazon works great!
4,The battery is not for medical use in my case but for a small clock but it fits perfect.  They wear out fast and have a shorter than normal battery life.
4,Good battery so far.
5,Great purchase!  Received exactly what I expected very quickly!  Would definately order from this seller again.
5,Battery is currently in use in a travel alarm clock so I can not yet comment on longevity or battery life.  Item was exactly as advertised and arrived faster than anticipated.  So far I am very pleased.
5,Need N Batterier in  seveeral of mhy clocks and grocery stores don't carry them.  Thanks Amazon.
5,As described. Fast shipping. Cannot answer questions concerning longevity or battery life as I am just now using one of the batteries.
5,Needed an unusual battery for a travel alarm clock.  I finally found the right one.
5,Quick Delivery & Reasonable Price.
5,Hard to find in the store.
5,This product came in a timely matter and is as described.  These are long lasting batteries. 5-year expiration if stored as packaged.  It will last almost that long in use as well.
5,It is what I need
5,Condenser mic needed special size
5,Have a clock that needs this size battery. Had been getting them at Radio Shack. Usually lasts more than a year.
5,Perfect fit. This size was hard to find locally.
5,Good fit works great!
4,Hopefully it will last a long time . A little pricey .
5,Glad to get this battery which is hard to find in stores.
5,It arrived in a timely manner. It was a different battery that I have never used or had before. I only just recently used it so can give no other commit.
5,Nothing special. They are batteries and do what batteries do run things.
5,We use these to run a small "mantle" style analog clock.  The battery lasts for about 18 months.
5,Great battery for my 24 year old Mikasa clock!
5,As soon as I placed the battery in the intended device it started to activate the electrons stored in the batter andthe devive worked again.
5,Muy buen producto... gracias al vendedor
5,Working great for the two clocks that need these small batteries. Thanks! They are hard to find!
5,They worked very well. I love Amazon and the delivery. Will order again without hesitationThank you
4,Parense buenas hay que esperar...por el momento las encontr√© porque ya no las podia conseguir.
5,I need these for a clock.  Haven't put one in yet and naturally do not know how long they'll last.
4,Batteries work.Appears to authentic Duracell product.2 pack (shakur... lol).
5,Advertising works. These make me ü§î of the little pink bunny they are batteries. If you order the correct size they will work
5,Works well.  It's a Duracell so you're getting the best.  Delivered on time.  Cheaper than buying at a brick-and-mortar store.
5,Duracell batteries have the best capacity and longest shelf life in my experience and suffer NONE of the quality control problems I've encountered with Energizer and Ray-o-Vac brands.  Both of these batteries test at full voltage and will be "fresh" for the next time the desk clock needs a replacement.I see so many horror stories about batteries sold on Amazon ranging from cellphone batteries that show obvious use (sold as NEW) to loose containers of batteries missing their factory packaging and scuffed up to batteries with only a short shelf life remaining.These Type N batteries are a reason to keep buying them here.  Factory blister pack a use-by date more than four years from now and a good price.Highly recommend the vendor and the product.
5,These were hard to find since the pandemic and I am so happy to find them on your site. Now I have my favorite clock working again!
4,Did what it is supposed to.
5,This battery was hard to find due to the size.  Looked on Amazon next day delivery ordered two pack!
5,good value
5,I don't even have anything that uses these but they are such a great deal I bought two.They went in the battery box where I  have some of just about everything just in case.
5,This battery size is hard to find so I was glad to see it on Amazon and at a very reasonable price.
5,Had to order the battery i needed for my Anki Vector robot's cube. Just what i needed and a reliable battery.
4,Use them for my baby‚Äôs bouncer that we accuse leave on sometimes.
5,Does it's job.
5,Good item! Got what I wanted!
5,I needed these for the HP 28C calculator. These have a best before date of 2025 which should be adequate for my purposes.
5,Arrived with long expiration date - four years from now.
5,Quality at a good price.
4,Just as described
5,Can't  answer the questions on battery longevity/life as I just installed it .
5,Battery life is excellent and it came fully charged and ready to go.  This is one of those odd sizes that you don‚Äôt normally just have sitting around.
5,A dependable product.
5,The batteries arrived in good condition and work as expected. I use them in a clock and they last about a year. They are a bit pricey but are an odd size I guess.
5,Lasts as long as any other duracell
5,Just what I needed.  Online purchase allowed me to bypass the COVID-19 issues in the stores.  Typical Duracell quality
5,I only buy Duracell batts and this price is the best for N size.
5,Batteries received at the earliest target date. Packaged in original package from Duracell.
5,This battery fits my Danbury Quartz clock.
5,Duracell seems to make a reliable product
5,An unusually battery works great in my mini robot.
5,It‚Äôs a battery it powers what I need it to power
5,They were the right size so far so good.
5,Using this in my cube toy for my Vector robot. Works just like it should and haven't had any issues out of it.
5,Two batteries in the order. Nice
5,Great .
5,Just a little battery.  Same size as the old one in some crystal encased clock.  It fit.  The clock runs now.  Hard to say anything bad.  :)
5,Like all Duracell Batteries. Performs well.
5,Great product
5,'short battery life
5,I like this brand name with the longevity.
5,Since Radio Shak isn‚Äôt around any more I can‚Äôt find this battery size anywhere. Thank goodness for Amazon!
5,Came quickly and works well as expected.
5,What I rate above. Desk clock.
1,I got these less than a month ago when I was ordering some 2032's. I decided to get some N's for an Eotech 511 that I had and wasn't using. I finally threw the N's in a couple days ago when I came across the box the Eotech was in and it seemed OK I tried it with varying levels of brightness then put it down. The next day I tried it with a chintzy ARD a little here and there and left it.Last night I picked it up and it wouldn't go on. I thought it may have been the battery connection in the battery compartment played with that but nothing. Today tried testing the batteries 1 was a littler above 1 volt the other lower around .5. This thing saw maybe a little over an hour's use if that unless I accidentally left it running (not likely) and then they  still didn't last the 250 hour life they are supposed to. Last Energizer batteries worked fine and lasted!
5,Duracell Coppertop batteries are definitely a brand you can count on for long lasting service....
5,I was having difficulty finding these in the stores these days.
5,Long life makes it useful. I don't need to change it often.
5,Ok
5,I needed it for a clock that sits on my desk. Worked fine
5,Right battery right price!
5,Love Duracell
5,good value
5,So far so good...not in use long enough to make a complete assessment.
5,This works in our small clock it great.
5,Hard to find size we'll of course AMAZON found it!
5,Always been a great product.
5,Good
5,Used this battery for a small ornamental clock.
5,This battery is an odd sized one & not very common.  When found on the shelf it is relatively expensive. I chose 5Stars because they have lasted as long as the original Duracell batteries did in my Weather Predicting gauges.  They last one year strangely and I replace every Christmas. These have NOT been batteries that have been left on the shelf & are actually quite old and I would definitely recommend them to a family member.  Also they have not leaked from use inside the Weather Gauges.  Buy them....you'll be happy that you did.
5,highly recommend hard to find and fast delivery
5,Works great
5,These are hard-to-find batteries in the typical drugstore. Ordered them from Amazon and they came in two days. They fit and work perfectly. Full power. No issues. These are the real thing
5,Long shelf life. Steady even power feedout. The go to product.
5,Works great
5,As advertised
3,One of them lasted about a month and when I realized and switched it the second one didn't work
5,Ordered wrong type
5,Good
5,Good product
5,needed it for a robot.
5,Right size for 2.5" clock. Lasts long.
4,Found these on Amazon for an old HP-41 calculator. Original batteries only lasted 20 years - LOL. I'll be dead when these wear out!
5,speedy delivery. I bought these batteries for an antique clock. happy with my purchase.
5,Work as should good quality.
4,My little device only uses the 1.5V N size batteries and I knew I could get a better deal on here than my local drug store which sells one for the price of these two. Wish I could find a pack of four or more in this size battery but two at a time is better than one for a high price.
5,Just what I needed.
5,I read a lot of reviews that claimed the batteries were old and did not work. My order came promptly fit the clock I have and are good for the next 4 years.
5,I received the item ('s) I ordered all is good.
5,Great price on these small batteries.  Hard to find in the stores but lots of selection on line and great pricing
5,I'm using this for a couple of things a remote and something else and it is going strong
5,Fresh batteries. Received what I ordered.
5,They're batteries. They work. Nothing else to say.
5,These N size batteries are no longer easy to find.  Ordering them via Amazon seems to be the fastest / least expensive method of purchasing them.  I've also ordered cordless phone batteries and calculator batteries from Amazon (no more hunting expeditions at Best Buy or CVS).  Thanks Amazon and thanks to the Amazon reseller I bought these from.  The N size batteries arrived within a few days and they were at full strength with an expiration date 3 years out.  Amazing.
5,Clock
5,It works. At much lower price than local drugstore.
5,great little batteries
5,As expected. Came early.
5,Great long lasting battery
5,Love it would buy again
5,Cheapest price and good value.
5,These batteries were bought for a clock works I had given to me. I hadn't been able to locate them locally in any store that I went too.I needed to know if the clock work operated before I went through the trouble to make a case to mount the clock in.I was glad to know that the 35 year old clockworks ran when the battery was installed.
5,Product was new in original packaging.
5,These are 1.5V batteries and they work like every Duracell Coppertop I've ever had. Very satisfactory. How much more can be said?
5,To my surprise product still worked
5,Met my every expectations. Packaged well. New product with Use By Date of 2023. Fit the clock I bought it for.
3,The batteries themselves are fine but these must be old. Only one worked. The other was dead.
2,The shape of the positive end of these batteries are shaped slightly different than the Duracell N type battery that came with item (toy).  Accordingly it didn't fit and I needed to insert metal foil to fill a gap between the positive terminals of the device and the battery.  I note that my original Duracell N battery was made in Belgium and these items were made in China.  I don't know if Duracell has changed the shape of the battery or it's an unofficial Chinese copy.  I also note that the packet is not the same as the one pictured on Amazon (as of 6/28/15).  It is much narrower does not have "medical" written across the top and the background is different - maybe a sign that's it a knockoff.
5,Brought these little batteries for a little crystal clock that I love. It only took one and it's been in the clock a couple of weeks with no problem.  I hope it last as long as the last one that was in there.  So far so good and no complaints.
5,Cool!
5,Want cheap? Buy another brand. Need your med device to work? These or the bunny 's.
4,I‚Äôm sure they work great. They were the wrong size.
3,The good news is... the batteries work. They are new in the package just like the photo. Also they were MUCH cheaper than going to Radio Shack or Rite-Aid.  The bad news... they're datest March 2014 which means they're REAL old. Usually batteries such as these should be dated at least 3 years from now - like July 2017.UPDATE - Company offers refund or will send newer batteries.  You can't get any better customer service than that.  A+ and a quality act.
5,Very good
5,They worked perfectly fine for what I needed em for.
5,Product looks and performs as advertised.
5,These worked well.
5,This battery worked as advertised as did the clock. Quite satisfied with results.
5,Quick serviceGreat value.
5,On a previous reivew I saw that someone got this for their personal massager and that the batteries where also exspired in another post. The date on mine says they wont go bad until 2018 and they worked perfectly in my massager so I have to say they have fixed up their stuff from the last time the reviews where posted.
5,Glad I found these!
5,The electronic earmuffs I use at the pistol range use this size battery.  I have had these earmuffs for quite some time and have used a variety of batteries.  It has been my experience that Duracell last the longest of any battery I have tried.  They were at a good price and arrived earlier than I expected.
5,I couldn't find this battery close to home so purchased it from Amazon. It is not something that Amazon carries but the seller processed the order and shipped the item without postage. For a few bucks this was a total surprise and very much appreciated. One of them is now in my clock and as Duracell does it works.
5,at a good price
5,they worked good
4,The item is what it says. The packaging was hilarious!  2 tiny batteries in a box big enough to hold 100 plus of them. Lol
1,Cheap knockoff. Neither battery worked. DO NOT BUY.
5,Great
5,What's not to like?  I could get in my car and drive to the store and buy one of these. Instead I click "Buy Now" and it comes the next day for usually less money than in the store. And I can pick up my novel again. No gasoline no time spent going to the store‚Ä¶ Win Win!!!
5,These work perfect in my crystal clock.  I can't believe I paid $8 for 1 battery at my local hardware store out of desperation.
5,Just as expected. Convenient to have it delivered to my home
5,Just what i needed
5,Works as expected. Won't know how long it lasts until I've forgotten when I bought them. Once that happens I'll probably look for another low cost battery and select it. If that happens to be these I'll buy them again. If not I'll buy the low-cost ones.
5,Great batteries.They run a cool little Art Deco clock that sits in our bookcase. We call it the "bird clock" as it has same perched on top.I like the batteries too.
5,I was having a hard time finding the right size batteries at the stores around here.  Amazon to the rescue.  What else can I say they are Duracell batteries good quality and long lasting brand name dependable batteries.
5,Fast shipping cheap...better than going to the store
5,Duracell makes great products
5,good product at a reasonable price
1,I bought and received these Duracell N batteries two weeks ago and put them in a clock on May 30 2020 which usually lasts at least 6 months - 1 year between battery changes.  They were dated for a 2023 expiration and I installed them in the clock after receiving them.  By June 14 2020 the clock started losing time and stopped after two weeks.  I threw these out and bought Energizers and have not had any problems since.  Duracell has no quality control or they just don't care.  Absolute garbage! DO NOT BUY!
5,Got my old HP 28S scientific calculator up and running.
5,Works good with a toy story woody doll
4,They were fine.
5,I have a magnetic pick-up tool that has an led light requiring a size N battery.  For such a seldom-used tool I didn't want to spend a l;ot of money on the battery and was able to buy two for less than half the price of one at the drugstore  Yea!
5,They are just what I ordered
5,I was pleased to find this battery so easily here.It is sometimes difficult to find this type of battery at a brick and mortar retail store.The batteries arrived fresh and with plenty of time left(according to the printed expiration date.I am so pleased to hear the clock working again>
5,Flash light.
5,A small clock
5,Bought these here on Amazon via AVA PRODUCTSDelivery was slower than normal though it was not available through PRIME.The batteries worked perfectly.  Needed power for a clock.Would repurchase these again if needed.
5,Last long
4,Received on time.  Product is as advertised and at a reasonable cost.  What more could you ask for?
5,Duracell perfection
5,Recieved appropriate item
4,rare pack to find and cheap! not the longest lasting but got the job done!
5,Size N batteries are not used many places but these fit and perform as needed. Package arrived in good shape and batteries had their full charge.
5,Great batteries for the price. Just what I needed
5,Good
1,The batteries were open and did not work
5,Worked well for what we needed.
5,As with all Duracell products these batteries are top notch.
5,One of the very few drawbacks I can find with my old tried-and-true HP 41C calculator is battery life and the price retailers feel they can charge for the N size replacement batteries.  These work great.  Problem solved.  :D
5,I have an older bicycle light that uses these batteries for power. Don't know why as they are so expensive but it is worth it when I order online. These batteries are fresh and packaged as shown. Appreciate the quality.
5,I'm not sure how many devices use this battery but it got my crystal clock working after many years.
5,There great üëç
4,good
3,might be old
5,Worked great!
5,Was getting my size n batteries from radio shack for years. They never lasted very long and was constantly going back for more. Could never find duracell in the storesso found them on here and am very satisfied. Much better thank you!
5,Used for an old santa claus which would like up if you pulled on a short string.  The nose would lite up.  Was the correct battery for the job and came on time
5,No date code issues
5,Good brand
5,Haven't used yet. It is a battery used for ANR Headset for shooting. I am sure they will work fine when I replace old batteries in a couple of weeks.
1,I needed an N battery quickly for a clock.  Bought a two-pack locally.  I have a battery tester.  Both batteries were weak.  I returned them to the store.  Then got on Amazon and bought another two-pack.  50% better.  Only one was weak.  I did not bother to return it as the other one was fine.  Gives me the impression Duracell is not what it used to be.
4,Batteries for Pro Ears muffs.  odd size but they work well
5,Work great
5,I needed this size battery for two crystal clocks that I received as gifts over the years.  They arrived on time and have an excellent use by date.  :-) Thank-You very much.
4,In the past I had difficulty finding this battery size particularly for an affordable price.  I have 2 clocks that use this size and have been satisfied with life of these batteries.  I would purchase again.
5,I purchased these for my table display clock.  They work beautifully.  I have given the rating because of the very nice pricing and the super efficient/fast postal delivery of the item.
5,For some reason N size batteries are not carried by local hardware stores so this was a replacement buy. Used in a few wall clocks.
5,Good batteries
4,Required for the college level course taken - pricey but cheaper than local outlets.
5,Purchased these for a clock battery replacement which require a somewhat unusual N type (for a clock). Wasn't certain about the "medical" notation but they work so hey. Great for me.
5,Needed this unique size for a table clock and it was the perfect replacement battery.Duracell is my preferred brand of batteries.This was cheaper on Amazon than I could buy locally.
4,Arrived on time and are working so far.
5,I didn't want to pay 3x the price at the local drug store so I ordered here.  I am happy that my little crystal clock on the piano now works
5,Good price for batteries that were not easy for me to find.  Don't know how long they will last I am using them in a clock not a medical item.
5,Very Good and great price
5,great price without having to go out to search for it and buy it. The label says medical but I'm not sure if it's any better than the standard one's
5,Aside from the fact that these look funny-- they are exactly what I needed. I couldn't find them anywhere else.  Hats off to Amazon!
4,I buy these batteries every year to power a small clock. They do the job but last about one year.
4,was looking for rechargeable but theses work
5,Keep alive battery in a Digital clock/timer that has worked well for over a year so far.
5,These Duracell Size N batteries fit perfectly in my sighting device and last a very long time. I picked these over generic batteries due to generally good experience with Duracell batteries in the past.Highly Recommended!CFH
5,Original Duracell batteries...dependability and great price.  This is much better than Radio Shack's own brand of batteries.  Needed for a clock...generally lasts for 2 - 3 years.
4,was as described batteries work
4,They arrived when I needed them.  They were from the same people I used 3 years ago.
4,Needed new batteries for my toddlers toy. They worked perfect.
5,These batteries do the job we needed them for a clock good price just what I needed they battery seems to be working fine I hope it'll last a long time.
5,I chose Duracell because I have always been satisfied with their performance. I chose Amazon for the same reason.I would recommend either to everyone and anyone. Both for reliability and convenience.
4,These are batteries they work like they are supposed to.  They seem to be as long lasting as I would expect.
1,These batteries r terrible. They stopped working after 2 months of use in a clock.they must have been old.
4,As expected
5,perfect replacement
5,I was surprised at the cost of these batteries.  locally they cost twice as much and this brand is hard to find in our local stores.
4,Worked good
5,This is the battery I needed for a special multimeter. I always have a hard time finding this battery.The shippment was just right on time for me.Thanksbhank62
5,no issues
1,Product arrived with damaged package and the battery was had been oozing acid when it was packaged.
4,JUST LIKE SUPPOSED TO BE. NEW BATTERIES. WHAT ELSE TO SAY..OBVIOUSLY THIS PROGRAMMER NEVER HEARD OF PROPER RT PROCEDURE. KEEP IT SHORT AND TO THE POINT.
5,My daughter's Toy Story Woody pull string toy needed two of these.  Popped these in and he's back to hollering about a snake in his boot.
5,They arrived very quickly put my clock back in working order in my guest room and were very well priced.  thank you
5,This is a hard-to-find item for me and I need it for a clock it is working well
4,What can I say?  They hold up in storage and in use better than any other brand of battery I've used.
4,ok as advertised
5,I cannot find this size battery in the local stores.  I was very pleased that I could buy them on-line and the cost was reasonable.
5,Mom said she needed an N battery. A couple clicks on Amazon she had a pack in her mailbox.
5,Great price for these batteries that I've seen sold for close to $20. They certainly did their job.
5,The batteries supply night power to a wireless weather station.  They usually last a couple of years.
4,Do the job
4,Work fine in my Triplett 310 multimeter. They have lasted for years of light use. Seem to hold up well.
5,These are a real oddball battery so i was pleased with the price and quick ship.
5,These work perfectly for what they are used for.
5,Work well.
4,met my expectation
4,It worked in a European clock- great!
5,What can I say it is a Duracell and they last a long time what more can you ask for besides a cheaper price.
5,Works
4,It's a battery and does what batteries do.
5,The Merchant was an amazing person to do business with they helped me through the whole process and sold me a great product that is hard to find in stores.
5,Item arrived quickly and was exactly as described!  This is definitely the way to buy batteries!
5,Perfect just the ticket for the crystal clock I needed it for....tic toc tic toc.
5,Perfect all the way around - thank you so much!
4,Just what I needed
5,Not really sure what I can say.  Duracell batteries priced well.Expiration is 4 years out so they're pretty fresh.
5,It worked great
5,Batteries are good until 2023 so they haven't been sitting on the shelf for years. Price is good for 2 battery card.
5,The only size that will fit my most favorite little mantle clock.  So glad Amazon has them!

5,exelente
5,A great and inexpensive replacement for that hard to find N cell battery!

5,SOLVED MY PROBLEM
5,AAA
5,Excellent Value
1,Both batteries in the package were dead on arrival.
5,great item
5,Just right
5,Product met my expectations.
5,Fine
5,Great!
2,Doesn‚Äôt last long!
1,SIX YEARS OLDThese batteries are sitting around somewhere way to long already dead
5,great
3,pretty good price
5,Excellent
5,Very good.
1,I installed this battery in a marine clock and it died in about 3 weeks. Identical batteries from Duracell that I was using previously were working in the same application for about 8 months. Recently I had similar negative experiences with larger Duracell batteries obtained from different sources that I use around the house. They seem to be dying much faster than they used to in the past. I wonder if there is a larger problem at Duracell production lines.
5,O.K.
3,looks OK haven't tried yet.
5,As advertised
5,excellent
5,:)
1,Ok
2,Be careful of the noted expiration date in the advertisement. The picture shows a 2017 expiration date when I received my order the date was 2015. Didn't want to take the time to deal with exchanging the product. :(
3,Duracell is always a good brand.
1,THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT NEW OLD SHELF STOCK MANY YEARS SINCE MADE
1,Didn't fit product
1,Bought August 2020-Died November 2020May it rest in peace
1,I don‚Äôt think i will ever gonna use it. I bought it because it has a deal.
1,Got the wrong battery
1,Bought an extra pack which expired a year or two after I bought them. Fresh batteries should have a 4-6 year shelf life.
2,One battery good the other battery  dead
1,Needed this for a clock that only takes this kind of battery
1,One of two batteries dead on arrival:(
1,They didn‚Äôt work
2,Got the battery. One was unusable. Arrived burst.
1,I'm in the process of buying a safe and it says it takes a 1.5 v.Well I didn't want to have to wait until safe arrives to purchase the battery.I hope it goes to the safe
1,one of the batteries was DOA
1,Wrong size. I could not return the batteries
1,Nunca recib√≠ el producto
2,Not sure what happened but one of the batteries in my two-pack was just about dead upon arrival.
1,It says 2 pack but really you just receive just two batteries (NOT 4). False advertising.
5,Duracell is a trusted brand that has been providing quality batteries for years. I am pleased to say that this product is no exception. It fit my device well has done well with longevity so far (haven't used it long enough to truly testify for this) and hasn't raised any red flags yet.It's very nice to be able to come online and order the exact battery I need rather than looking though the store's assortment hoping it's there. I will definitely be doing this again when this battery expires/runs out! Recommended for sure.
5,My garage door opener uses the "N" cell battery.  Other brands I have used lasted 8 months or so..With Duracell I always get at least a year out of them if not more.  Never let me down and always keep a spare in the car just in case.With all the exotic batteries out there today none can beat the Duracell for consistent operation and shelf life.  NIMH and LIPO batteries lose 10% or more of their charge per month Alkaline batteries retain a significant part of their charge for years...  Trust a "copper top" when you can't afford to be without your device.
1,The batteries lasted five weeks then totally died out.  The prior set lasted 11 years.  Made in China - no surprise.
4,I have two small clocks that use N batteries which are often hard to find in stores. The stores either don't have them or are out of them. Buying thru Amazon saves the hunt and are priced competitively..
1,Bought these to use in a personal massager lol. Totally dead no power would not work. Too much hassle to send back
5,The N batteries fit my unique flashlight nicely and they are long lasting Duracell. They have long shelf life until 2023 on the package so it is four years long. N battery is actually also LR1 and E90. My unique flashlight has been out of battery since last year because I couldn‚Äôt find any N batteries at Costco so this pair of N battery brought new life to it and now it is back in business.  Hope they last long for my flashlight.  Will update if they don‚Äôt meet my expectation of longevity  after some regular usage.
5,It seems like batteries are necessary for everything these days. Yeah lots of things are starting to have charging cords but not everything... some things require N 1.5V batteries like GPS trackers remote controllers key fobs car alarms calculators car remotes light-meters clocks alarms pagers and more! I've used Duracell and many other brands of batteries out there but never had complaints about the Duracell brand. :)
5,Use these for a work flashlight that is turned on and off multiple times a day.  Since installing it over 2 weeks agoso far haven't needed to swap out and typically using other brands I would have changed the battery at least once by now.  Cost difference is minimal between this brand and others.  Works great.
5,Duracell is brand that I have used for years whenever we needed batteries. I used this N-type battery in a cuckoo clock I have in my shop. It hasn't worked in a few years as it takes this N-type battery.  These are not that popular and cannot be found just anywhere. The price here on Amazon is certainly cheaper than can be found just about anywhere else; certainly better if purchased in quantity. I don't see how anyone can go wrong with these! Thanks!  üòâüëç
1,I got an empty package! Would like to rate 0 stars.
5,I use Duracell N batteries in a 1980s era calculator and generally get at least five years per set. This new pair arrived fully charged and ready to go. Marked as made in China with a Best By date of March 2023 (the batteries arrived October 2019).
5,It is a brand new Duracell battery in retail packaging. It works just like you would expect a new Duracell battery to do.There is no expiration date anywhere on the package but most batteries have a shelf life of up to a decade or more.What else can one say about a battery?
5,I have a lovely clock that takes this size N battery. This battery size seems never to be carried in any store I go to so am pleased to be able to find them here online on Amazon.These are Duracell Coppertop batteries so you know they're good quality and lasting. The 2-pack is just the right size for this N size batteries -- one to use and one as a spare.
5,This is a 2 pack of Duracell N size batteries.  Works great.  Best By date of 2023.  These N size batteries are not always easy to find so it is nice to find them on Amazon with a good date.  Good battery Good Price.
5,This size battery is very hard to find in the stores of our area.  Glad to see they are on Amazon.  For some reason all my outdoor lighting remotes take these batteries and one of my small clocks too.  Duracell always last compared to other brands.  Very happy.
5,So far so good.  The real test is whether one can say that many months down the road.
5,This is exactly what you need for some older remotes like car remotes garage door openers etc. Made in China. Best if used before 03/2023. Measured 1.6V out of the packaging. Good quality. Good brand.Fits any of the following battery types: LR1 E90 MN9100 910A
5,I use this battery type for my doorbell. It lasts a decent amount of time. I'm glad this comes in a twp pack so I have a spare when the first one dies.
5,They do last a long time for an alkaline battery. I use these in a garage door opener and they work great and last for years. The package I received has an expiration date of 2023!
5,Popped these into my blood pressure monitor and they work perfect! Duracell batteries are always reliable and last a long time. These special 1.5 V batteries are no exception. I'm a Duracell man for life. 5 stars.
5,I received a 2-pack for $5.60 to use in an insulin pump. I‚Äôve always leaned towards this brand for the high quality reputation and it proved right again. Good price. Works great! No issues or complaints about charge. I recommend these tiny batteries with great power!
5,Worked good for remote
5,Glad to find these hard to find batteries needed for my desk clock.  The expiration date is 4 years away so the second (spare) battery should be good for when I need it in the future.
5,I use this in a small clock I keep on my bathroom counter.  Works better than generic brands lasts a long time.  Definitely recommend.
5,Not much to really say but the battery works and doesn't seem to be giving out any time soon. I have no complaints.
4,Have clocks that require this battery and not always easy to locate in area where we live. Do not know why manufacturer of the clocks selected this battery but they did - fills the need.  Work just fine - AA/AAA not chosen in this case (?).
5,I have used all sorts of Duracell brand batteries for years and never had a problem with any of them.  They have always lasted a long time in whatever device I needed them for and they also have a long shelf life.  I've had them in the package for years before using and they were still very good.  These are so much better than any Chinese or knock-off battery I've tried to use.
5,These N batteries are hard to find and cost a lot at medical supply stores.  They have a long shelf life and are reliable during use.
5,I am very pleased with these batteries and the shipping.  Thanks.
5,Got these for under $4 the price was right. Item arrived in new condition and in is working great.
4,Duracell certainly makes nice looking batteries. They are always a perfect fit for my devices. However Energizer N-size batteries cost half as much (on Amazon) and are always just as reliable to me. I received these batteries in October 2019 and the expiration date is March 2023. Minus 1 star because of the price.
5,haven't used them yet but they are fresher than what's in the store @ 2x The price
4,Functional camera battery long life and easy to open/install. If you need an N battery for your camera or whatever else this is a solid choice.
5,Worked for what I needed it for. Good quality batteries.
5,what can I say?  great price
4,Duracell makes nearly every battery.  this is a hard to find model so glad to see it on Amazon.  It works as well as any Duracell I have used rarely ever get a dud.  A good brand with great offering.
4,There are countless names being thrown on disposable batteries these days as more and more devices switch to rechargeable types. But some devices still require special batteries.In those cases it makes sense to count on a reliable brand like Duracell.
1,I keep asking the factory to replace their device as these Duracell Type N batteries last 3 wks while they should last months.
3,delivery was fine but battery only had 4 years left before expiry.
1,I recently contacted Duracell regarding a leaky battery that destroyed my $100.00 clock. After a bit of a hassle on the phone I was told I would be sent a pick up package to send my clock to Duracell for inspection. Well the package came and it was large enough for a pocket watch not my wall clock I described earlier. At this point I feel by the time this issue is resolved the time and effort will not be worth it. Perhaps that is what they are counting on. Buy Duracell at your own risk.
5,N batteries are hard to find.  I gave up looking locally and looked on Amazon.  I was surprised at how inexpensive the batteries were.  They come two to a pack and I usually pay over 11 dollars for them.  The batteries from Amazon were very well priced low.  Thank you Amazon.  My clocks are up and running again :)
5,I have a HP Business consultant 2 Calculator that I have used for my job since the mid 80‚Äôs. I like the ease of use but have always been disappointed that it runs in N size batteries. Buying this size battery locally is almost double the cost from Amazon. No issues with this battery over the years.
5,Batteries Plus...I don't think so.  Amazon...the right kind of shopping.
5,Essential for those odd size clocks...not on most battery displays in stores
5,so glad to find the size i needed
5,Good price and batteries
5,Great Battery - Does its work very well.
5,and it fits my clock and it was cheaper than Target.
5,Great find
5,Of all the batteries out there this seems to last the longest. (Sorry to the Bunny)
5,Used for a clock works good lasts a long time.
5,Quality product which is dated so you know it is fresh!
5,We all know what N batteries are for.
5,these are very good batteries with a long life and at a good price.
5,Great
5,Good price
5,quality and value for money.
5,Nice
5,Good price and fast delivery
5,Longevity
5,Arrived as described. My clock is working!!
5,What's to say? It is what it is supposed to be.
5,They make my little clock run just fine.
5,So far so good.
5,Came promptly. Cost OK.
5,No problems
5,Was able to get this battery fast and for a good price.  It is in a new device to me.  I expect it will last a long time.
5,Specifically for my electronic Seiko Quartz Clock.I won‚Äôt trust any other brand of battery.
5,Batteries for good price.
5,Product arrived on time or a day early. Works for a little clock.
5,Finally able to get my old mantle-clock working after many years of searching for these odd-sized batteries.
5,5 stars
5,My small Black Forest wall clock
5,Appear to be good batteries so far
4,Ordered a N battery for garage door opener...this is too big....1.5V....need 12V....Beware when you order this and make sure what voltage your old one was...
5,So easy to purchase a quality product without leaving home
5,Great price for really long lasting batteries
5,This little battery is hard to find in retail stores but is what I need to keep my favorite desktop clock running.
5,Item as described good value fast shipping
5,So far so good the battery is running good on our keepsake clock watch.
5,I have a little clock that uses this size battery. (Just one battery) They last over a year and I just keep the second one in the back door of the clock for next year. Works great and is easy to buy on Amazon rather than hunting through local stores trying to find one of these hard-to-find batteries.
5,"N" batteries are a little hard to find around here well ones not covered with dust & dirt.
5,The dual pack of N batteries arrived with an intact package which once opened and battery inserted into the clock worked like a charm. It's great to see those hands moving again!! Now onto assessing longevity! ;-)
5,I have a beautiful Belleck clock that needed a new battery. This worked. Thanks!
5,Perfect battery for volt meter.
5,IT  IS FOR A DESK CLOCK THE CLOCK IS RUNNONG
5,This was a difficult size. Amazon had it I ordered it and it arrived. Just what I wanted
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Buena marca
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Poor little Vector loves his cube more than anything on this earth.  Sadly his cube died.  You can see his frustration in the video.  He badly needed a new N1 battery but with the whole Pandemic thing that wasn't really possible.  Fortunately Amazon came to the rescue!  2 days later we installed a brand new N1 and Vector is happy as can be.  Thanks so much!!
5,Usually when you buy a battery-powered product your first thought is NOT: where am I going to find replacement batteries for this thing?! I'm sure product designers have certain constraints when choosing a battery power supply: form factor power requirements etc. I think they should also consider "how easy is it going to be to find replacement batteries"? The "N" size is NOT very common so most "local" stores (even the big box ones) don't carry them. I went to 3 different stores before I turned to Amazon.
5,Happy to have found these on Amazon! It's not a common battery to find where I live especially during the quarantine! For the price I can't complain!
5,Fonctionne tel que pr√©vu aucune mauvaise surprise. Tout est  OK.
5,Could not find any of this size where I used to buy them. One of these powers a clock and I have the other for a year from now when the first one is drained.
3,No s√© si sea por el tipo de medida o el aparato pero duraron muy poco
5,All go so far. Not sure how long they'll last but so far so good!
5,It was the battery I was looking for.It was for a clock.
5,Great to have my clock working.
4,This powers an ornamental crystal clock and its size is critical.
5,Excellente pile qui fait ce qu'elle doit.
4,WORKS LIKE BATTERY SHOULD AND FITS TOO
4,How do you review batteries?? I got a charge out of them
5,We have a small Seagull Quartz clock that required this battery. Looked everywhere for it and could not find it till I looked at Amazon. Works perfect.
5,As described fast service good battery.  Will buy again recommend dealer.
5,Great value
5,The batteries were used to power a 40 year old hand-held programmable calculator.  Packaged as advertised and shipped fast.  Couldn't ask for more!
5,and it comes straight to your door great price also
5,OK
4,Exactement le bon type de batterie

4,muy buenas
5,Our clock in our caravan had packed up - impossible to get this size battery in Supermarkets etc. Found it here on Amazon - perfect - put one in our clock - all working great and we have one spare.What more is there to say - it is all good!
4,Good battery that fits in more devices than I thought. Always useful to have a spare in the cupboard
5,Las uso en calculadoras HP de colecci√≥n para revisarlas y mostrarlas. El precio es imbatible y esta marca tras muchos a√±os de uso nunca he tenido casos donde el l√≠quido interior haya salido deteriorando los contactos hecho q con otras marcas low cost me ha sucedido antes de su fecha de expiraci√≥n y guardadas en su caja en un entorno apropiado.
5,todo bien
5,I use these for a clock. It is the only thing I have that uses. Can't buy them in the normal shops as there is so little demand for them.Great to know I can always get the at Amazon.  They are long lasting and a pack of two keeps the clock going for a couple of years.
5,Good value and exactly as described.
5,Good price for a duracell still using the 1st one after a year long shelf life so a good purchase.
5,il faut attendre 1 an pour r√©pondre √† votre question : √©valuation long√©vit√©  ?
5,Ideal for clocks etc.

4,Good service.  Good product.
5,Amazon is the only place I can get these little batteries for my mantle clock at a very competitive price so I'm happy with my purchase.
5,sono pile funzionano come pile fanno quello che devono fare le pile. cosa c'√® da dire di pi√π? hanno anche una discreta durata.Fortuna che c'√® amazon che trovare la dannata pila con la sigla giusta √® sempre un'impresa degna della ricerca del Graal...Se il commento √® stato utile clicca s√¨ sul pulsante qui sotto.
5,Installed in a small clock and arrived very quickly. The previous brand lasted 33 months - only time will tell if these last as long
5,A good long lasting battery for a clock - well the last one lasted a few years.

1,Die Batt. zeigten eine schlechte Kapazit√§t. Ich denke die Batt. waren √ºberlagert. Es ist alles Gesagt warum muss ich noch etwas schreiben?

1,pile ovviamente normali che si possono trovare in qualsiasi negozio allo stesso prezzo ma mi sono fatto prendere dalla pigrizia e sono arrivate dopo pi√π di 10  giorni per di pi√π i pacchetto essendo con il corriere √® consegnato solo se ti trovano in casa.... sono acquirente abituale tramite amazon ma  acquistare cose di questo genere √® inutile e scomodo

1,Item is not as expected and I am surprized I am unable to return it.  No where during the purchase was I informed the item was not returnable.  I would not have completed the purchase had I known it was final sale.  Very disappointed.
