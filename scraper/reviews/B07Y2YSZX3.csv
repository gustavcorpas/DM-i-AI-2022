5,If you have battery powered cameras these save you a ton of work having to constantly charge your batteries. I bought the 3 pack and two of the three work perfect keeping my camera batteries charged to 100% or near there for 3 months now. The third one although it was slowing the battery from dieing as fast as it normally would... It was still declining faster. We checked all connections and angle of the solar panel.. But it still failed the charge after 3 months my camera battery was low. I reached out to Wassertein and they were excellent! I got prompt and ongoing communication from them and they sent me a replacement at no charge. They did not have to do this it was outside of the warranty... But they did and customer service was awesome. The new one is working great so far. Love these panels they are easy to install and are not very noticable or an eyesore.
5,These were easy to install.  They keep the batteries in my Ring Stickup Cams charged even though I don‚Äôt have direct sunlight but for a couple of hours a day.
5,Love the pack of three sun chargers for my ring cameras - don‚Äôt need to change them anymore and all them folios trying to come up to my house ‚Ä¶ I see you!  You can‚Äôt hide from me - I‚Äôm all charged up my  boy - get yourself a three pack and let the sun do the work work work
5,Very good product.  Easy to install and plugs directly into the camera. Make sure you know what direction the panel will get the most sun for the best results. My battery went from 80% to 95% within a day.
5,Don‚Äôt have to worry about changing batteries. Will see how they work this winter.
5,Work perfect with Ring product
5,I had the panels for a few weeks. Very easy to install and works as advertised. We had some monsoon rains and they didn‚Äôt affect the panels nor the connection to the cameras. So far I‚Äôm very satisfied with them.
5,Perfect
5,These couldn't be any easier to install or use two screws to mount it one plug into the camera. Now my cameras stay at 100% nearly all the time! I wish I had bought these sooner I completely recommend these solar panels!
4,Works good the cameras never seem to get to full power but it stays in 80% or better and i'll take it. Plus the added benefits of green energy and not having to get on the ladder to change batteries is a win win
5,I installed these on my ring stick-up cameras. All cameras have been able to get 100% charge in only 2 days. When I buy more cameras I will definitely be buying more of these. Install took only about 5 minutes per camera and only required a few tools. Results may vary depending on your setup.
5,I'm a domestic abuse survivor and safety plus evidence for stalking are a huge concern for me. I currently have 11 ring cameras all over my property and pulling batteries to charge them is just not an option for me. I had concern that the solar panels would not perform well with the cold midwest winters and snow. These worked perfect. I have them mounted on my gutters (with special gutter mounts) or on my siding using non-drilling siding hooks. They mostly maintained between a 98-100% battery charge even on the coldest gloomiest days. If we had multiple exceptionally cold days they would sometimes drop into the 80% range and a few times in the 60% range but not for long. Some are facing the west and some the south. Either side provides plenty of sun. I've been using them for 6 months now and they are still going strong.
5,What can't I say good about this product
5,Easy to install sufficient panels for ring cameras.
5,Great for charging
5,I bought the batteries towards the end of winter for my cameras. I was hesitant at the beginning but after reading the reviews I gave it shot. I love them! The battery life are always at 99% even in gloomy winter weather. I attached a picture with the current battery life of our front camera which gets more traffic than the other cameras. Totally worth it!
5,Solar for changing my wireless cameras from Ring !Really happy with there product. Time will tell allHaven‚Äôt had them up more than a day ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3,I haven't put a meter on these to compare but I've tested the same ring stick up cam with one of these and one of the smaller ring solar panels.  These seem to charge at 20% the rate that the ring solar panel does. For full sun exposure areas.
5,I have just recently set up a whole new ring system and installed 3 cameras with it. Fortunately ring tells you up front they have connectors for solar panels so I was able to install them up high so nobody could grab them and either steal them or damage them. They are also high enough it would be a pain in the backside to change out the batteries. I bought these panels and got them installed and when I check the health of the camera and the battery it's almost always at a 100%. The lowest I've it has been 96% first thing in the morning before the sun comes out. These even charge well during our very cloudy NW weather. The only thing I don't really like about these are the mounts. They are very limited in that they can only be mounted 90 degree with anything. The only variable is moving the panel itself which isn't much. The mounts need to be 4 to 6 inches longer with an elbow in the middle. I had to get real creative to get these in the right places. Other than the mounts these are excellent solar panels.
5,These panels were very easy to install and came with all the bits needed. I installed them at my Carribean home over a month ago and they have kept all my cams at 95% or above the entire time. I don't know what the long term performance may be but so far so good.
5,Perfect in every way set up price.
5,I Purchased the 3 pack great value first of all but the big question is does it work with the Ring Stick up cam answer is so far so good batteries have been 100% sure beats climbing the latter to bring them down to charge them and now I can use all the settings on the camera to its full potential without draining the life of the batteries. The only concerned I had was the mounting stand it look a little weak I live were there's really high winds but i have been pleasantly surprised they have hold up no problem.
5,Works perfectly with the ring stick ups even in cloudy PNW weather.  Within days the batteries showed a recovery from 68% to 88% health so now I can use the more aggressive features on Ring app.  First sunny day all cams went to 100% at the more aggressive settings.  Yay!!!  No ladder climbing to charge batteries.  Worth the effort to install
5,Works well and best match for Ring stick up camera
5,They work perfectly! I haven't had any issues.
5,The batteries on our Ring cameras drain very quickly so we were looking for an alternative to re-charging them all the time.  These solar panels work great! My husband installed one on the back of our house which faces south and within several hours our battery life went from 40% to 70% and then went to a full 100% fairly quickly after that and have remained at 100% since installing the solar panel.  It worked so well we bought 2 more for our vacation home in Florida.  Since we're not at this home as often it was very difficult to keep our cameras going with the batteries draining all the time.  These work great for that situation as well.
5,I bought the 3 panel deal because I have several Ring Stick-up Cameras outdoors.  After initially using my cameras for a while I realized that the battery life may be somewhat short of initial expectation.  And since I didn't want to replace the batteries in a difficult-to-reach area I decided to look at solar alternatives.These panels are wonderful!  The mountain bracket allows me to put them where ever I want (in the sunlight of course) and it has enough cable to be able to nicely route to the camera.  And since the price is a fraction of the Ring version its a no-brainer.Before buying I checked with a few friends that purchased these previously and have verified that they hold up the through the test of time.  3 thumbs-up!  I had to grow a third one just cause these things are THAT good!
5,Reasonable price for a for an alternate way to charge Ring Cameras.These panel work exactly the same as the o.e.m. Ring chargers.Measured output exceeds Ring Solar Panels.
5,This product works great.  I have one Ring solar panel and purchased these for my other cameras and they work just as good.  It has been 6 months now and all battery‚Äôs have stayed charged 100%.
5,I love these. No more having to climb ladder to recharge the batteries. Definitely worth every penny. Easy to install if you have a drill and drill bit.
4,The product was well priced and effective as a whole.  The issue for our use was that there wasn't enough mounting bracket versatility.  I needed to add distance and height due to the limited length and depth of the mounting post.  The swivel worked well however I needed to add distance from my roof tiles and height to  over 8" of height to clear and have rotation and angle ability.  Also the product was delivered in the logo box however there was no shrink wrap or tape to secure its contents.  I almost lost the contents when I lifted it from the porch. Hope this helps.
5,At first I was very dubious about this because I had set this up on two different ring cameras. The first one had a charge of 50% the second one had a charge of zero. The first one started to charge really slowly but it did eventually charge from its initial 50% 2 / 80% in about a week and a half. The other one never increased at all. Before returning the contraption I thought maybe the battery has to be at least 50%. So I swapped out the battery and it worked. So the lesson is at the battery cannot be completely drain otherwise this will not work. Now I don't have to go climb up on ladders and change out the batteries. I love this solar panel system
5,So I purchased 2 set of 3 pack of solar panels for my rings security cameras. They are the best thing ever.Easy to install extra long built in plug to plug into camera. I purchased white to match my ring cameras.They keep all my cameras charged from 94%-100% depending on when the sun hit the solar panels on the time of day.I have no complaints what so ever. They do what they were made to do keep my batteries charged. I am extremely happy with them. I am so excited that I have told myfamily and friends and they have purchased several for there homes.I recommend buying the value 3 pack if you have several camera. They are the best value out on the market.I totally recommend this product.
5,I debated whether to but these panels over the Ring-branded panels but ultimately decided to give these a try as a three pack of the Wasserstein panels are the same price as two of the Ring panels. I'm glad I made this choice as these panels work well.  All three of my Ring stick up cams were at 100% charge within 2 hours of installing the Wasserstein panels. So far so good!One important point about fit. The connectors on these panels are designed to fit the Gen 2 stick up cam. I have Gen 3 stick up cams and while the connectors on these panels work note that the two "wings" on each side of the connector plug aren't needed on a Gen 3 cam (and in fact don't fit since Gen 3 is a different design). The plug still works however but be sure to put the small clear O-ring on the male plug end to ensure moisture does not get into the power connection on the camera.
5,This is something you should buy if you have ring spotlight cameras (not wired battery only). You will never need a ladder to get to your cameras again to take the battery out & charge them again (until the batteries go bad in 5-10 years)
5,El producto es bastante liviano f√°cil de instalar y tiene bastante cable lo cual permite instalarlo a gran distancia. Lo utilizo en las c√°maras Ring y ha mantenido las bater√≠as de las c√°maras 100% cargadas. Llevo poco con este producto pero hasta ahora me gusta.
5,One of the panel only gets maybe 4 hours of afternoon/evening sunlight each day and it's enough to keep it fully charged. I've been able to keep all of my cameras on the most power consuming settings with no issues of running out of battery.
5,Bought the 3 pack for 3 ring cameras. These panels started charging my cameras right out of the box and had them installed in no time.They had my camera batteries  charged quickly.It was actually faster than charging the batteries separately with usb device the cameras come with for charging at home inside.We also used the ring pol mount and it worked perfectly with this solar panel.Very happy with my purchase.The trio will save you money versus buying the ring brand solar panel.
3,I have not been able to install these yet so I am only rating this based on the ability to mount the solar panels.  The mount only allows the panel to be adjusted up or down; or side to side; but not both.  I would think that for maximum performance a solar panel should be able to be mounted and adjusted both up and down and left and right to allow for maximum solar exposure.  I will add to my review on the actual performance after I find a way to install these properly.
5,These are priced much more competitively than others with the name but work just as well. It took a software reboot for the cameras to recongize them in the app but were still charging. The only down side is the very long wire provided I would say that since most cameras are mounted high that having a 10-20 feet of wire is overkill not really sure that is a down side couple of zip ties and the wire is coiled and tucked out of the way. These are great I will be getting more once I have a few more cameras.
4,It‚Äôs only been 2 weeks since I set it up so far so good it does what it‚Äôs suppose to do keeping my ring camera charge ;-)
4,I found like many items this product is part of whole product.  You have to buy more and more pieces to to make the product work.  I bought an electric gate opener like this.  I think they need to explain up front that this is not an all in one product.  I prefer to get items that have parts I may not need to use rather than a product you have to keep purchasing things for not to mention the 'recording' subscription.
5,Wasserstein Solar Panels are amazing!  I bought the bundle of 3 for my Ring outdoor cams and they have been 100% charged since the day installed them about 4 weeks ago.  I should have gotten this solar panel months ago.  100% recommended seller and product.
4,These solar panels are the real deal. The quality is fantastic not cheaply made like the Ring Solar Panel. Buy this instead you wont regret it.
2,They don‚Äôt seem to charge very well.
5,These actually work better then the expensive ones. Definitely worth buying
5,Not having to remove + charge batteries  make it so extra nice - worth the money to me. Exelent
5,I set these up a month ago and ny c√°maras are always at 100% definitely would purchase again if need be!
5,UPDATE 8/2/21:  About 1 year of service.  Worked well through the winter and work even better in the summer months.  Batteries are usually charged in the 90% range in summer high 70s to 80s during winter.Got the 3 pack of panels for my Ring Stick Up Battery cams.  All 3 have been kept at 100% charge.  Good value.  And yes I am a real customer.  I will add to this review in the winter.  Lets see how they work in the North-East cold.
5,Works just fine for powering Ring cameras  I've got 6 ring cams running 6 solor cells so far never have a dead battery
5,The product is as described.  I used them in conjunction with a Ring gutter mount that was made for the Ring solar panels.  I had to do some minor modifications to the gutter mount to accomodate these solar panels. Wish Wasserman would include a gutter mount that would also attach to the cameras as part of the package but they did not.  Otherwise product was as described and work well.
3,The product works well with Ring stickup cam and installation is easy to follow. It is too early to talk about durability but a negative experience during installation ia that the screws are too weak and two of them had stripped threads and I could not screw them all the way down nor remove them. The panels are installed but got stuck and misplaced. That is such a poor product decision to cut cost with bad quality screws and frustrate the customer as a result.
5,I bought 3 of these a few months back for my Ring Stickup cameras and they do a great job! They keep all my cameras fully charged without issue. It took them a few days to get the camera battery to a full charge from about a 30% charge and now they stay between 90%(in the morning) to 100%(by 9am) everyday including cloudy days.
5,All 3 outdoor Ring devices charge up every day.  It may take a little long for a partial sun spot but it will catch up and stay 100%.Why pay more?
5,They arrived on time and work perfect!  Best value for the money and better then buying the name brand. I have 4 of them total and they all work great.
5,Works great with my Ring Stick Up Cam 2nd generation.  No more changing out and charging the batteries.  It even maintains a full charge in the Washington rain.
5,I setup three ring systems in the last year.  One for my mom one for my grandma and one for me.  The wired cameras worked great but keeping up with the constant changing batteries was time consuming. After installing these solar panels the batteries rarely drop lower than 95%.  I have a mix of these panels and ring brand and they seem to work the same.
5,I'm very pleased with this purchase!  It's going to allow me more time in my week because I won't be climbing up and down the ladder to replace the batteries.  I installed the solar panel yesterday and this morning I checked the battery life status.  Both batteries were at 100 % and they stayed between 99 and 100 all day.  Exactly the outcome that I was looking for.
5,Timely delivery nice packaging easy to install and they work great!
5,Thank you easy to install
5,Works on my Ring cameras. You need to restart/initiate camera open & close device settings for the app to recognize it. The panel were smaller than expected but fully recharged my battery from ~20% in two days. No more battery charging for my stick up cams.
5,Cost effective way wo add solar panel to Ring cameras
5,fast and easy i installed all 3 in 1 hour !
5,Very good
3,To be honest the way I rec'd the product really bad !!!No shipping box at all they left the product open it look like someone opens it up. no protective film for solar panels either. I leave at my garage for a couple of days and using alcohol to spray the box and prodct to be safe. Now I just put it up and see if works or not if not I will return it. The price is good but everything else sucks!!!
4,Only issue was picture shows units to be black items delivered were white which shows up more against the house.  Other than that the items work to keep ring camera charged.
5,Great for the price
5,I love mine.  I used that at both of my homes for my Ring devices.  They keep the battery powered cameras charged.
5,Good quality easy install. Camera batteries are now staying at 100%
1,Changed batteries   checked connections etc.  Gets Florida sun most of day. Ring shows the item is attached to solar panel but batteries keep discharging. Worked good at the beginning  Lasted less than a year. Too expensive to last suck ha shot while. Bought 6 units 2 have failed already.
5,We purchased 3 Ring Cams and after just 2 weeks they needed recharging. I went on Amazon and bought these solar panels because they were more affordable. They were easy to install and within an hour the Cams had juice. We're going to buy more for our daughter.
5,I didn't even charge my batteries (which were at about 5% charged) before installing these 3 solar panels. In about 3-5 days they were 100% charged and are staying at 100%. The panels are not even under direct sunlight for most of the day.Great product!
5,I used these dolar panels for my RING CAMERAS. These were so easy to use and connect.
5,Works  great and charges my Ring cameras as good as the Ring solar panel.
4,The clip on the mounting bracket where the solar panel attaches could be a little more secure
5,This value pack of three saved me a lot of money and worked as well as the singular one I purchased.It fit the back of my ring outside camera just fine.
4,Definitely better than having to replace batteries! I would recommend this investment!
4,These solar panels are easy to install and start working immediately.
5,They seem to work great with our products.
5,The second shipment we received was better then the first one.  It looked like they had not been used .  We returned the first shipment  and they gladly send a replacement
5,I use this for my ring stick up cam couldn‚Äôt be happier my battery was going dead just hooked up the solar panel and by the next day it was charged.Very easy to install.
5,So happy we purchased. It keeps our ring cameras fully charged and it was so easy to install. Their customer service is awesome also. I had a defective one and they sent a replacement right away no questions asked.
5,It took time to arrive but it works great. Easy instalation as good as ring originals
5,I used on my ring cameras. Simple install and seemed to charge batteries on cameras rather quickly. Thinking of buying three more cameras soon. Great product so far.
5,These work just as great as the regular ring solar panels except they are much cheaper absolutely love them!
5,Easy to set up and it keeps my batteries charged with no problems. Great deal for the price!!
1,1st setthat showed up was used and had scratches and dirt all over the panel already..  Sent back and got replacement set and the cameras have not even been up but maybe 3 weeks and 1 of the panels is already not charging!!  Dont waste your money!
5,Easy to install
4,The mounting bracket could use some modification that could be easier without having to screw into something...I know they make one for it that attach to the gutter.. it should come with it
5,Me encanto porque ya no utiliso mi escalera para cargar las baterias de mi camara  lo recomiendo gracias
5,Initially ordered the wrong solar panels for my Ring cameras; return was easy and got the correct ones! works fine thus far!
5,Outstanding product and performance at an excellent price. Easy to install connect and mount. Keeps sensors fully. Works with indirect sun an partly cloudy
5,No trouble installing battery remains fully charged even in So Cal hazy conditions.I‚Äôm grateful for the better priced panelsand both gutter mounts for the camera and solar panels.
3,The product is light and flimsy. I‚Äôm worried about it surviving a storm. It was shipped without being packed in a shipping box. The cover of the box was secured with one piece of tape allowing the box to fall open on its own if not handled carefully in shipping.
5,Works great.  Why buy the ring version.
5,Worked very well.  Works very well with Ring stickup cams.  Have had about 2 months.
5,Wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be anything spectacular- but pleasantly surprised. Easy to set up and keep 3 Ring batteries at 100%. Sure beats climbing on ladders to change them out!  An ER deductible alone is a lot more!
5,great product does as described.only issue was shipping. basically shipped as an open box no tape to close.
5,I have these on 14 Ring cameras and they work great. Never any problems.
5,So far so good.  Charging as it should.  Price was awesome!
5,We bought these as they were less expensive than buying the ones sold by Ring they are working great.
5,These work great with my ring cameras. Easy to install.
5,Very nice product. Easy to install I installed all six in one hour and they are working practically.
5,This product suits the Ring camera works well and easy to install.  Save some bucks too.
1,No funciona  delos 3 solo uno carga no retiene la carga no tires tu dinero
5,It arrived in time for the Geek Squad to install them two days ago and they work. The rest is yet to be seen.
5,Very easy to use. Read other reviews on how to make this work properly. Also remember solar panels only work in direct sunlight this does not work like it‚Äôs hardwired in and consistently 100% powered and charging.
5,Nice product easy to use works well
5,Works with Ring flawlessly at a less cost... good product!
5,Great value! Worked perfect with my Gen 3 Ring outdoor stick up cameras.
2,Two of my panels seem to be working great they are all pointing in the same direction. Settings are all the same. And still one don‚Äôt seem to be charging my camera. I am not happy with my purchase only because all 3 of them are not working properly.
5,Works great keeping my batteries charged
5,Great sonar panels and it looks good also!! Def would recommend this to anyone.
5,Great product. Arrived on time and without any issues.
5,These work perfectly with our ring cameras outside. No complaints and much cheaper than the ring brand.
5,Great product! Works well! Easy to install
5,So far so good it is definitely prolonged my battery life in the areas that it gets full sun. I‚Äôm not so sure about the shaded area yet it‚Äôs too soon to tell.
2,The box was complete opened when received .One of the solar panels was full of fingerprints.I have no idea if they where used.
5,Great solar panels. Right away my stick up cams started charging.
5,Easy to install
5,Works great easy to install good price
5,Great product keeps ring batteries charged everyday.
5,Fully compatible work excellently
5,Nice product
5,Security
5,works great
5,Very happy with these solar panels. Had someone else install but seem reliable and in good working order. I cannot speak to the ease of installation
5,Easy to use and easy to install
5,The price was very fair
5,Everything pretty straight forward.
5,Plan and simple they work.  Keeps battery charged.
5,Product works very well  even in low sunlight
5,It was easy to install and it keeps the battery fully charged. I'm very satisfied with this product.
5,Works as stated. Batteries stay fully charged.
5,For charging
5,Works great arrived new easy installation and set up. Make sure that solar panel gets direct sunlight.
5,It works as expected! Installed and forget. No worry about out of battery again.
3,The solar panels don‚Äôt even trickle charge when cloudy or rainy as said in the video. They only charge when there‚Äôs direct sunlight.
2,They don‚Äôt charge well at all. They work during the day but they don‚Äôt recharge the battery so at night the ring camera is off.
1,The pictures and description for this product show that the solar panels come with a plug that is compatible with my Ring devices but what I received was different and not compatible. The picture I've included in this review shows that the cable has a different plug than what is advertised. I will be returning this and finding a compatible option.
2,These do not work with 2nd generation stick up battery cam. You need 3rd generation of you want to use these.  Thankfully the return process is easy but it would be nice if the item description specified this!
1,I was excited to get a good price on multiple panels And all 3 don‚Äôt fit the dc adapter input on the ring spotlight camera. Will have to return snd purchase 3 ring branded ones I suppose I looked like a goof in front of a client!
1,Have been installed for 3 months. One has quite working and no longer charges my device. Its past my return window. Extremely disappointed.  They did work great when working. No problem charging the device to 100% when working. Wesserstein do you have any explanations or warranties?
1,Doesn‚Äôt even charge me ring cameras even after being in the sunlight for multiple hours my battery actually went down. Box came in looking like I got a used product
1,When I opened the box one panel was missing and one of the other one looks like it had been used before.
1,Doesn‚Äôt have a waterproof plug in gets wet from rain and doesn‚Äôt charge
5,I'm very happy with these solar panels my Ring cameras stay charged between 98% to 100%.
1,Worked until it rained and then died.
1,Did not work with my stickup cams
1,Product came scratched up and wires connecting it were cut and exposed.
5,I‚Äôm SUPER pleased with these solar panels. They‚Äôre a fraction of the cost of the Ring panels and work wonderfully. YES these fit the Ring Spotlight outdoor cameras. There‚Äôs a panel on the back of the cameras you need to slide down to remove.I live in Southern California so the sun is shining most of the time but even through this past December when we had record rainfall  the battery was never less than 90%. Ive had these for at least 6 months and I‚Äôve never had a problem. I just checked the battery life on the cameras (on a beautiful sunny day) and they‚Äôre 100%.Crime is out of control in California. NUMEROUS catalytic converters stolen in and around my area.I feel better knowing I have cameras pointing to my cars and never have to worry about the batteries dying. Plus I‚Äôm a BUSY RN. Having time to change out batteries every week is just not an option. These were a wonderful solution.
5,Solar panels keep ring camera batteries at 99 to 100 % full charge
5,I bought the panels because I have the cameras outside my house and I read several comments or they will not be negative and others will be positive but I placed them yesterday And now it is 100% charged at the moment I am very happy with my purchase
5,I had 1 spotlight and 1 stick up cameras that I wanted to place in an area by my garage to protect against it broken into.  The Wasserstein solar-powered is an excellent product works great easy to install. When I originally installed it I didn't think it would get enough light to charge the unit sufficiently but in about 4 hours it charged to 100%. If your monitoring the charging through the application be sure to wait a couple of hours and you will see the percentage has gone up.
5,I have these at rental house bought 3 more for new house after 1 year still charging hopefully these new ones will work the same time will tell but overall good product
1,Bought these and they worked fine until it rained. They stopped working completely when it rained. My Ring cameras with the Ring solar panel worked just fine in the rain.
1,I bought these panels to keep from having to changed batteries in the spotlight cameras & these panels do not charge nor keep the dual batteries charged fast enough 2 days after put up the panels & putting 2 fully charged batteries in all 3 spotlight cameras they were all 6 batteries dead.  The RING BRAND SOLAR PANEL i have on my other 4 spotlight cameras & 2 stick up cameras keep the cameras running 24/7 & only have 1 battery in them & they never get below 60%!In short this knock off brand is not equal to THE RING BRAND & doesn't even compare in quality or functionality. Spend the extra 10$ per unit & buy name brand until Wasserstein figures out quality & operational efficiency
2,Only two or of three panels that I purchased worked!
5,liked
5,Everything is great but for some reason when the package arrive it was not tapped up so I was not sure if any parts were missing. But everything was in the box and it only took about 45 minutes to get them set up! Just double check your packaging!
5,Easy to install. Is compatible with my Ring stick up cams.
5,When I ordered four Spotlight cams I also ordered a couple of back up batteries I assumed I would need after reading the reviews. I rarely get below 95% with these panels sent the batteries back because I won‚Äôt need them. Great quality plastic I assume similar to the name brand but three for 100 instead of two for 100. Unless you get them cheaper ‚Äúused‚Äù like me received them perfect box & perfect condition.
5,What a relief not having to charge the batteries in the ring cameras. Easy to install with gutter clips that you can purchase as well instead of putting holes in your house siding.
5,I was surprised how fast my ring cameras ran out of battery. Also the cameras are not easy to reach to get the battery out so I decided to try the solar panels. Boy am I glad I did. Of course it keeps the batteries charged but also the cord from panel to camera is long so you have the best chance to find more sun. Super easy to set up. Great product
5,Work great so far haven‚Äôt seen the batteries below 100% since I installed them about a week ago
5,So far seems to work good and easy to install. Shipping was quick no delays or anything.
5,Arrived on time high quality and is really value for you money.
5,Works great no more charging the ring batteries it‚Äôs been two months and they are fully charged
5,I had one of these that weren‚Äôt
5,They work I update if I have any problems. The dolor panels are different on this then ring but they been forking for 2 weeks from this date
5,These solar panels work great. We use them for our outdoor Ring cameras. They keep the battery around 98% every time we check but we live in Arizona. It has made it through monsoon season with dust winds and rain. No issues. Very easy to set up too! If your hesitating to buy especially for Ring outdoor cameras don‚Äôt! These works great.  (Might need better instructions but they just plug into the back of the Ring camera when you take out the silicone plug)
5,Worked great for my Ring Stick-up Cams and for a much lower price than everyone else!
5,Works perfectly with Ring Spotlight cams from Costco.  Cheaper than Ring branded panels and works just as good.
2,Not keeping up with ring spotlight charge.  I purchased these as they say it will handle the spotlight however I‚Äôm still losing power.
5,Easy to use and put together
1,Should have bought the Original Ring Solar Panels wasted time and money. Came in original box that wasn't sealed (anyone could have taken one replaced it with another) one of the screw packets was opened one solar panel has damages in the cell
5,I am so happy with my purchased i don‚Äôt have to worry running out of power because my battery is always full. 100% compatible with my ring spotlight cam.
5,I tested them before plugging to the cam. Came at 5 V and up to .5 A in direct perpendicular sunlight so meets the rating. Mounted by screwing into the lip of the gutters with sheet metal screws and some heavy duty double sided tape as additional adhesive. Quickly charged the stick up cam. Can't comment on longevity.
5,I wanted to purchase solar panels for my ring light bars with solar built in because they do not get enough sunlight on their own. These were much less expensive than the Ring branded version but they are essentially the exact same panel.
5,Easy to install on our existing ring cameras. No more charging of batteries!!
5,Easy to install came with everything necessary for mounting. Been 1 month now and cameras have not triggered any low battery or anything. Ill change the cameras back to sensitive to see if anything changes. Easily a better deal than 100$ each.
5,UPDATE 8/15/22: panels are doing their job all green/fully charged as a result of these panels. Now if my doorbell can get one and have the same result...that‚Äôll do.JUST installed two of three yesterday 7/24/22. Will need to reposition the second....& install the third. So far so good. Definitely working well together...and hopefully saving me the charging hassle (it could‚Äôve been worst to do).Will update after all three are installed 30 days after that?
5,They keep all 3 of my cameras at 100% easy to install. I got the white color to blend in with the trim on my house & shop. Looks great and works perfect!
5,Perfect
5,Very happy with this product. Exactly like the Ring solar panel chargers I purchased in the past.
5,Oh wow! How many of us have to turn our ring stickups on and off to save battery or end up on a ladder once a month? üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Well not any longer! These solar panels had my batteries charged in two days and I have left my cams on 24/7 now. They haven‚Äôt left 100% charged since. So don‚Äôt pay for wired cams. Get stickups with solar panels and call it a day.
5,Easy to set up and use.  Less Hassel than having to take the battery in and out to charge
5,All gooy
5,Easy to install no more hassle with battery life again
5,Much cheaper than the Ring brand but they work well and we‚Äôre w easy to install!
5,we had these mounted with our ring camera and we love them.  We forgot to charge our camera before installation and that were at 27 percent.  In one day off reduced sunlight  the charge percentage went to 47%. By the next morning 67% and now they have stayed at 100% for the last 2 weeks. I love that they are not super huge solar panels and light weight.  They work amazing
5,Easy to install and works very well
5,I‚Äôve had zero problems batteries maintain 100% charge‚Ä¶ Excellent quality fabulous value
4,Die Panels haben sich schnell und unkompliziert installieren lassen. Die Kameras werden jetzt im Sommer bislang zu Tagesende stets bei 100% Ladung gehalten. Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t w√ºrde ich mit 2-3 bewerten. So ist z.B. auf einem Panel eine Unregelm√§√üigkeit bei der Solarstruktur erkennbar. Was Langlebigkeit und Ladeleistung (im Winter und langfristig) betrifft kann ich noch keine Aussage treffen.
2,I have bought these before and been pleased with them as they work really well unfortunately they are not described accurately. The latest stick up camera version 3 no longer has two screw holes on the back of the camera to screw in the adapter that had two flaps as you can see. The seller‚Äôs picture clearly shows an adapter plug with no wings or need to screw it in how this is now what arrives as the panels come with two tiny screws and the winged adapter to plug in. I had to use insulation tape as the plug does not fit flush and is not water tight and water can easily get in unless you put tape over the plug in. I contacted the manufacturer who weren‚Äôt great as said it is waterproof this is not the case at all unless you use tape. Saved ¬£50 instead of buying 3 genuine ring solars but not sure if it‚Äôs worth it. If you have ring stick up version 2 with the two holes in the back it will be fine but not for latest version.
4,simpledoes exactly what it should
5,Easy to connect to our ring battery cam we have two batteries in it and both are staying above 95% charge from charging in the day most times they are 100%. Really pleased with this saves us having to keep changing the batteries.
5,100% worth every penny haven‚Äôt changed batteries in 3 weeks  having a dog setting off motion sensor once a week charging 1 battery  .
5,They work great with my ring cctv cameras.
5,Excelente
5,Compatible with ring products
