4,Overall it is great I just wish two piece grab or hold the iPad were adjustable for depth to allow for thick iPad protective cases. It works but occasionally pops off brackets case it doesn‚Äôt allow for thick cases.
5,It‚Äôs not flimsy. plus it‚Äôs easy to install and move around
4,This product is great if you do not have a stock video player in your vehicle. I gave it a four star because it does make a slight rattling sound when there is no device.
5,My dudes if you were questioning whether or not to get this... get this! It's definitely made for front facing babes but I was able to make it work for my rear facing baby. We had a four hour drive down to Zions National Park the longest drive my 9mos old has ever been on. Not only did this help keep him from getting bored and crying while he wasn't asleep but it kept me from having to hold my phone for him to watch Ms. Rachel on it. Honestly if you have a tablet PAY FOR YOUTUBE PREMIUM! You can download tons of videos for your littles to watch offline and play in the car! YouTube premium + this device = happy baby. Can't recommend it enough!
5,Nice product I like it
5,The product videos don‚Äôt show that this easily adjusts to be visible by kids in both sides of the backseat. Long car trip saver. Fits a surface 3 tablet!
5,Easy installed in a few minutes.  Sturdy enough to withstand and last.
4,This is a VERY sturdy product.  I add emphasis because I was really surprised how strong and heavy it is.  My only issue is it does not quite compress enough to lock between the posts of the headrest on my 2015 Subaru Crosstrek.  I took the headrest off and squeezed (i.e. forced) the posts to spread an 8th of an inch to accommodate the bracket.  I then had to force the headrest back into the seat holes.  It works well but will be a pain to remove.  It does fold quite flat so I don't anticipate moving it much.  Measure your headrest posts if they are not wider than 5" you'll have issues.  Otherwise  it seems to be excellent.
5,just exactly what i needed to enjoy movies in the back seat
5,Se mueve a todos lados
5,Easy to swivel to adjust while being in the front seat. Great product ! Used on 24 hr drive and kids loved it.
5,I like the design of this mount and how simple it is to install. I had to return it since it isn't compatible with a 2022 Jeep Wagoneer.
3,Typically you buy this so your kids can watch their tablet in the backseat. But kids are clumsy and their tablets usually have sturdy cases. That‚Äôs where this misses the mark. The clasps are not big enough to accommodate a good case. It‚Äôs a pain the get it set up with the case on and slips out at the slightest bump in the road. If only the clasps were slightly bigger‚Äîor even adjustable‚Äîand could fit a kids case this would be a perfect buy.
4,Make sure you headrest lift. The second row on a 2021 yukon does not and the little bit if space available doesn't accommodate this.
5,Great for car rides & all the kids can watch the tablet without arguing over holding it properly.
5,Must have if your child is watching a tablet in the back seat
3,mesured the head rest before ordering and it should have been good but its just a little shot but works if you smash it between the head rest and seat
4,I love this product but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt fit in between every head rest. Got a new car (audi q7) and doesn‚Äôt fit.
5,Good stuff I like it
3,It didn‚Äôt work for my rogue but I managed to mess with it enough to hold up my iPad for baby monitoring.
4,Works ok holds ok
5,I use this iny car for my niece when I'm driving and she's in the backseat and she doesn't want to hold her phone or tablet and she doesn't want to constantly look down she can just look straight ahead like she's looking at TV.
5,Tight grip on your tablet or iPad so your child can't just rip it out. I have short armsso i  love that I can swivel it close enough to the driver seat so I can skip all the ads my toddler doesn't know how to. Definitely like the range of how close or far it can go to your child so that iis not close to his face and or so he can reach the iPad to change his videos or play his games.
5,We use this to hold a phone to play cartoons for our baby while we're driving. It's pretty solid so far. It is a little tricky to get into some head rest posts though and won't fit in one of our cars since the head rest isn't adjustable
5,Chose this on after tried a few. Unlike others shaking while driving this one is stable.
3,It would work great if it for the handles in the back but they are too small for the piece. I took it apart and slipped the steel headrest through the halfway point on the product and that works for now but I wish I had known it wouldn‚Äôt fit.  Besides that it‚Äôs great
5,Works phenomenal on the Samsung Galaxy tablet S7. Holds it Sturdy in one place.
2,some of the photos show no knobs... So if you purchase this based on several of the photos that do not show the knobs at the top you will be disappointed because those knobs are actually on the holder- and when you install the holder the knobs will be located underneath the headrestso when you slide your headrest down those knobs will cut into the Headrest.  This is unacceptable for me because I have beautiful leather seats and headrests... it would just be a matter of time before the headrests will be cut up from the knobs.
3,The mount works well how ever this attaches to the two metal bars on the head rest is at that point that some improvements can be made those bars are not made of steal so the flex under the weight of the tablet the bars that hold the mount and tablet to the metal rods of the head rest don‚Äôt lock in place there spring loaded Id like for a set screw to keep the bars from retracting cause like I said the bars twist under the weight ! The arm that extends its flimsy to I would have liked a more robust arm!The mount hasn‚Äôt failed and it works! I would how ever like to see some improvements to the design!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Can‚Äôt say nothing bad or good just did not fit in my Subaru Ascent‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4,We bought this for our upcoming 12-hour drive to Colorado in my husband's Chevrolet Silverado but the the back seat headrests are too narrow for this product so the springs will not fit within them. It will mount in my 2016 Nissan Rogue so we're going to keep it for use in my vehicle but will have to find a different product for our actual needs. Quality of the product is good & sturdy for the price but I guess we should have paid closer attention to the product specs.
2,Great product but already broke .  Bought two of them and both cracked while iPad was being put in it . Can anything be done ? Thanks
5,Perfect for the car and the tablets.
2,The posts on the headrests in a Subaru are too close together for this to fit. Fit's the wife's Elantr but is loose. needs some foam pads added to the grips. Shame really we were banking on this for a cross country drive
5,Nice space and fits great üëç
4,Se instala f√°cilmente y se ajusta seg√∫n la necesidad.
4,A bit wobbly when extended out not very sturdy at the angles. Does hold all sorts of devices but holding are could be a bit wider. Bought two but can‚Äôt use the second in the third row because the the part that compresses in to attach the mount only goes 4.5‚Äù. Seems to be ok but I can see with prolonged use that it will give out.
5,It‚Äôs sturdy and serves its purpose.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Planning to use fire tablet for our longer trips but an a bigger ipad or an smaller iphone would fit.I will say the pieces are plastic but feel sturdy and not flimsy.  It is very easy to install and adjust so that is a plus.  Have not tried it on the road yet but I feel as if it will suffice for my intended use.
5,These were were very easy to use put together & attach. I AM worried about the sturdiness of these though. I bought 2 for our twins to watch movies on upcoming road trip in a couple weeks & noticed with the slightest jiggle of the seat the tablet mount jiggle quite a bit. So on the road I'm assuming it going to be quite jiggly. I'm sure it can be fixed with some stuffing a wash cloth or something in there maybe. We'll see when we drive next.
5,This little contraption works great tightens easily and is highly adjustable well worth the price
4,Seems like a super cool product and I wish it had worked for me alas I don‚Äôt have the metal rods on my headrest - never even noticed til I tried installing this!  So if you have headrests like mine it won‚Äôt work.  The metal rod kind - it should be perfect and would recommend.
5,This has come in handy! It stays in place except when my baby tries to grab at it then it kind of becomes lose to where I have to tighten it but if my baby doesn't then it stays put just fine! Would recommend! Very easy to install and adjust! I love that I can pull this to face me while I'm in the driver seat to select whatever I need to on the screen instead of having to go to the backseat to figure it out.
4,I thought it was metal but its working great so far
5,Okay I am a police officer and I needed a way to mount my phone/tablet in the car where I can look over and see the map or other data without having to pick up my phone. I understand that they made this for the back seat yet why should they have all the fun. I would have like to see a longer arm on it yet for the application I am using it for it is not what its intent. Overall this product works and holds the phone steady.
5,Great for the kids or anyone stuck in the backseat. My daughter used it with her iPad on our 14 hour drive to visit family and loved it.
2,If it was able to squeeze a half inch more it would be perfect.
4,Seems sturdy but it would not hold my Kids Fire Tablet with the large case on it.
4,It‚Äôs a great product that does exactly what it is made to do
5,The product is pretty sturdy and works as described!
5,muy √∫til y f√°cil de utilizar
5,Finally found a mount that fits my 2019  Subaru Outback headrest. I‚Äôve tried about 3 and no luck. The headrest Width between bars are really small.  I took out the rubber inside to make it fit. Plenty snug and works just fine without them. I used a knife to get them out. üòâ now my boys can watch TV and not fight over who gets to watch the iPad.  It‚Äôs a really nice Mount. Heavy duty!
4,It is actually pretty well designed and fits well if your head pipes are between 13 to 17 cm. For example it fits on my front headrest but does not fit the rear seat headrest. It is perfect for phones and mini tablets however larger ipads are not secure and drop easily.
5,We got this and have used it on long car rides for our kids. Its ability to twist and turn is amazing. We love how it could extend further out or to the side which made it easy for both kids to watch something since the headrest is not very centrally located. It is very easy to install and it held my phone and surface pro because of the ability to adjust.
5,It was very easy to install on the headrest and my son loves it that it‚Äôs easy to maneuver around especially since he sits in the middle of the backseat and it makes it easy to move when he‚Äôs sitting on either side of the seats. It hold my iPhone very well even our iPad Pro and it‚Äôs very sturdy I would definitely recommend anyone to purchase one.
3,Had to return didn't fit on the headrest bars of my 2016 Tahoe. The minimum distance of the clamp was not wide enough to fit. The mount seemed well made for the price just didn't work for me.
5,Es muy f√°cil de usar puede colocarce en diferentes direcciones para una mejor vista
5,nice product  i love it
4,It works good except that it does not have a great angle if you try to extend between the two front seats. If two people are trying to watch it it does not tilt well for one side to see it easily.
5,I am impressed picked this up for the kids during a road trip. There is limited bounce or flimsyness they watched movies on their iPad and even worked for the boys Nintendo switch. Worked out great not the cheapest but worth it.
5,I was looking for something to hold my daughters new iPad 12.9 ‚Äú and this was a perfect fit . We are beyond happy with this purchase .
5,My kid love this!
2,This holder worked well for our iPad when we first bought it. It was sturdy and held the iPad in place well. Our iPhones have cases on them so they don‚Äôt fit in it. After six months of use the holder has gotten loose. Now my son‚Äôs iPad jiggles all around while he tries to watch it even on smooth roads. We are having to order a new and different holder now. Hopefully this new one will stay sturdy for longer than a few months.
5,El producto es excelente para losNi√±os en el carro ! Es muy pr√°ctico f√°cil de instalar y el mismo lo acerca y lo aleja ! 100% recomendado
4,Had to remove my headrest to to get it on
5,Great product.  Fits nice and compact in both my vehicles.  Has great flexibility and is easy to use.  Will hold a Fire tablet but is a little hard with the thicker tablet case.  Still works but would be better if removed from thick rubber case or used with a thinner case.
4,Not fit in between the headrest
2,The holder seems to be well made and I was impressed with quality when playing with it out of the box. The problem is the actual use. All adjustments and extension arms make the thing flimsy and wobbly when  attached to a headrest. Even lighter devices are shaking badly when vehicle is in use. Great idea - poor execution. It will be going back.
5,It really works. Among the many cupholders we use it to save our maps and GPS iPad. Even if you're running up and down the dirt road it's safe to drive around it. We've used four or five other devices to hold phones and tablets but none of them is more effective than this one as long as you have a cup holder to put in. With a little tweaking it will fit perfectly into my Google tablet
5,Strong material  good design
4,My problem is not fitting the device the problem is fitting this onto the driver‚Äôs head rest. I tried several times both taking off the headrest and trying to squeeze between the metal bars. Just didn‚Äôt work. If only a few centimeters shorter.
5,We live almost an hour from family and make several trips a week to their area. Our 18-month-old son would get fussy and cranky the last 15 minutes of being in the car seat. This headrest mount works perfectly for those long trips when we need to keep our son entertained. Snapping my phone into the holder is super easy and it fits snuggly. I would definitely recommend.
5,Overall really good product. Carful with larger iPads as the weight will pull down the arm. It won‚Äôt pull it off but will mess with the angle of view. In this case we just kept the iPad close to the chair or in a closed position. Otherwise worked great.
5,Perfect!!! On a road trip cross country and fits ipad perfectly and it was so EASY to install took less than a minute!  Very strong and sturdy. Buying another for other side for our return trip.
5,Worked great in my car but not my truck. The headrests in the truck were too close together for it to be used but it works fantastically in my main vehicle! Easy to set up and the tablet stayed put even going through my rough driveway!
5,Stop looking and just buy it. Yes it‚Äôs that good!
5,I was overly impressed with this thing. It goes on so easy and holds my son‚Äôs iPad or switch easily getting it away from his face.
5,Have had trouble finding a good fit for our iPad Pro but this perfectly made our 12 hour drive with our kids a breeze so they wouldn‚Äôt be fighting over someone hogging the screen.
5,It holds perfectly for my iPad 12.9. My daughter now loves to ride in the car
3,Bought this to hold my surface which it does... However it's a TIGHT fit. It held the weight tho for the 18 hours trip and again back. If you don't mind clamping monster jaws on your laptop/tablet then this is for you.
5,My douther likes it very much!
3,I drive a Subaru Ascent and these do NOT fit in the headrest. They do seem to hold quite a range of electronics though. They also seem to be very well made.
2,I really loved this product at first but it broke apart completely!! Lasted a good 2 months.
4,So far so good. Can‚Äôt be rough with it. kids are rough so it‚Äôs not really a great product as far as lasting long. Good for what it is. I‚Äôm ok with it.
5,Me gusto mucho este producto lo recomiendo y le doy un 5 ayuda a nuestros peque√±os y se adapta a ellos
5,We loved this for our trip! Used it for our IPad Air and it was incredibly help! Really easy to maneuver around and position for both our kids to see the screen.
5,If you have a child buy this!  It‚Äôs worth every penny.  Works great!!
5,I use this to hold the PlayOctopus tablet in my rideshare vehicle.  Passengers across the back seat can play the games comfortably.  It holds the tablet very securely.  Would also work for the kids iPads on long trips.
5,Perfect for toddlers! Super easy to install no tools took literally 10 seconds if even that! Sturdy. It wraps around the headrest and Velcro‚Äôs in place then you put the phone or tablet in the stretchy bands. There‚Äôs one band holder for phones and another larger one for tablets. This is a game changer parents buy it now!!!!
5,i got this cause we travel alot with the grand kids who fall asleep and lose their tablets so nice for the long road trips
5,Tab S7 works great for the kids I have tv DVD players for wifesbtruck and the kids like the tablets on mine better. You can compress about 30 movies on a 128gb card and not have dvds sliding around the cab getting stepped on
5,I have a minivan with headrests bent forward so this product spins well because it means my tablet doesn't point to the ceiling! Putting it on a headrest means it's high enough not to be kicked by a toddler. Hold the tablet firmly and adjust it according to the size of the tablet. Easy to set will recommend!
3,It‚Äôs not very sturdy and does not work good with a case on which doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because when I see this I think about kids in the back seat of a car watching their ipad which should be in a protective case.... maybe it‚Äôs just me but it‚Äôs trash for what I was expecting.
5,Love this product. It was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping time frame was great. It came in just in time.
4,Needs more stability in the joints. It's very hard to keep it from leaning down from weight or getting loose.
5,Our kids absolutely love these so easy to put in the car and to put iPads in
2,The tension bar does not fit on a Subaru Forester. Quite disappointed
5,This thing is awesome for keeping toddlers entertained. Especially if your going on a long trip. Highly recommend!
5,Have a Caravan that has DVD player however Ipads and Tablets are what kids are into now these fit perfectly on back of headrest seats! Kids like them.
5,Fit perfectly in my 2019 Chevy Silverado. It also fit my iPad Air(4) with an otter box on it. It moves a little because of bumps but definitely worth my money.
5,Used on my 24 hour trip and I loved them did everything I wanted and more. I wish it was a little bit better to get on a bigger tablet
4,Fit perfectly on my 2011 Sienna headrest but needs a little cushioning for my 08 Pilot headrest. Works perfectly for the children playing the switch while I'm driving.
5,Best thing ever omg üò≥ I wish I would have know about this like forever ago my daughter loves it and just chills in the car now when we go places. Worth every penny
5,Awesome!  No more car sickness and the kids can watch what they what and not fight. Easy to install easy to move between vehicles.
5,She loves it in the car
5,Works well with our iPad. Enough extension for our toddler to change the videos on YouTube. Very study!
5,super util. muy bonito
5,I‚Äôd say these are great! Even a full sized iPad fits with an otter box case on it. 10 stars if I could leave that many. Happy kids
5,The quality is great and mounting was a breeze.I love it.
5,This product is a life saver for my kids. It holds my 12.9 in iPad Pro with ease. Definitely recommend.
5,Excellent car cellphone holder and so easy to install even an 11 year old can do it - and he did.
5,It is great to use on long trips in your car.
5,Extremely easy to install and use. It‚Äôs ability to hold a phone or tablet stable is amazing. Great product for my backseat passenger on trips!
5,Just as described. They are steady flexible and has a firm grip that holds tablets in place. Highly recommended!
5,I am glad we went with this! It holds iPad Switch as iPhone. It is sturdy and haven‚Äôt had issues with it.
5,Was very ez to install.  Does as advertised.  Purchased for 5 yr old in back seat.  Work out great.
3,Will test over the next 30 days and update.
5,Bought these for vacation..worked great for ipad and note 8 phone
5,Super easy to use very sturdy and the perfect holder for my son's Amazon tablet. I am excited to use it in the car so far we have only used it around the house. Great product for the price.
2,I was not able to use it in my Ram. The screws came off the first week. Wish I could return.
5,So great and has saved me many a breakdown for both me and my toddler
5,Wish I had bought this sooner! Love for road trips so my little one can watch a cartoon. Hated restarting the show over and over on fire tablet because it doesn‚Äôt have guided access like an iPad. Easy install.
5,The kid loves it.
5,We purchased two. This is a great Product.
5,The workmanship is very good very meticulous. It's easy to install. It's done in one card. This time the children will not hurt their eyesight when looking at mobile phones and it will save a lot of effort.
5,It was installed immediately after receiving it. The workmanship is very good the material is also very strong and the texture is good. It's used to coax children by driving. I hope the baby can be obedient and quiet when traveling
5,Installs easily fits snug keeps my Samsung S8+ and 8" tablet study during driving too. No bouncing screen.
3,The holder isn't horrible but it could use spacers to take up the gap from the headrest bars and the u shaped pieces.
1,The brand advertised that it is a universal fit but it doesn't fit on Subaru.
3,It make a lot of vibration and can not focus on whatever you are doing.
5,Re√∫ne mis expectativas
3,Good quality but.... will not fit on 09 silverado head rest. Spacing is to big on headrest.  Might work with some type of spacers.
3,So I have a Subaru and this didn't fit in the bars between my headrest. I had to Jimmy rig it but it's a good product nonetheless.
5,These are Awesome! I actually had to give mine to my daughter...I‚Äôm ordering 2 more!
3,Make sure it fits in between the head rest post. Only fits in one out of 5 car head rest I have.
5,This will come in so handy since it can hold so many different devices
3,Doesn‚Äôt fit Subaru 2021 Outback headrest.  Cool but had to return.
5,The installation is fast and stable. After the mobile phone is put on the angle can be adjusted and the child can finally sit quietly in the safety seat.
3,Doesn't fit full size truck seats needs to be at minimum of 1-2 inches wider on the mounting bracket to fit snug.
5,Es s√∫per c√≥modo y pr√°ctico para los ni√±os
5,It's very good. Children like it very much. In the future you can see cartoons by car. It's a small object suitable for long-distance travel and promoting happiness
5,My son loves this thing!!Works great with iPad Air and switch
5,Great product. I like it tilted. My son let my son watch the show on ipadmi which is a great accessory. It's strong enough to support the iPad.
5,Good stuff to buy. Really happy to have it
5,Tasteful  sturdy easy to use
2,The device that fits the head rest support poles is not universal and cannot compress enough to fit Subaru 2020 model Ascents‚Ä¶ maybe all Subaru models.
5,I like that it is sturdy and very movable.  Even when the road got rough it did not move out of place.
1,Great unit just doesn‚Äôt fit my wife‚Äôs 2018 Honda Odyssey.
5,It's really self-explanatory it was easy to use and it has been able to hold all the devices that I have it was a good investment for the small kids in the back seat
1,I was excited about the clean minimal lines and ability to extend iPad toward my daughter.  But the arm is not sturdy as soon as you start driving the iPad bounces around.
5,Mobile phone tablet can be used put in the back row to baby to see animation is very easy need to buy next time satisfied.
5,It's really like the description of the business that things don't fall off. The distance is very suitable for children. It's very convenient to install
5,This was easy to install  and very affordable
5,My son love it
5,Very easy to install no tools necessary. Holds the ipad just fine.
1,Realmente no tiene la firmeza para quedar sujeto el dise√±o es perfecto el material y la precisi√≥n  p√©sima no sostiene ning√∫n peso y el resorte demasiado suelto como para quedar bien sujeto lastima el dise√±o era bueno el material no es adecuado.
1,Not large enough for iPad Pro 12.9. Website description is not accurate.
5,We put TVs installed in one vehicle and decided to try these in another and I wish I tried this first.
5,I bought it for my 6 yr old granddaughter to use on trips. Loved it so much we bought another one.
2,Doesn‚Äôt fit my headrest I had to jam it into the middle of the headrest. I had to remove the headrest pull apart the metal a little just to compress it completely to get it into space. It does hold a small tablet ok or a phone. Conceptually a great idea just didn‚Äôt have any luck in my Ram 2500 truck.
1,Too bad it isn't small enough to fit between my headrest (Chevy Impala). Therefore it's not secure. Also the pivot joint that allows for screen rotation doest screw tight enough and the arm that extends forward is way too loose. So depending on how heavy your device is it will constantly move/extend frustrating little ones if they're unable to fix and reach. If you're on a solo road trip this is not what you want. You'll find yourself constantly pulling over to adjust and restart your show/movie d/t accidentally pressing the screen while trying to fix. It's a total headache. However if your child is old enough to adjust themselves you'll be fine but don't waste your money here.On the plus side it was a 1-2-3 easy install and it sort of hides itself very close to the headrest when not in use. It's very compact and does not get in the way when entering or exiting the vehicle.
5,Fits Toyota Sienna
5,Good. Now the children can watch TV well. Know i urgent need careful you help me send out thank you ha.
5,This was an impulse buy for a trip. It fits our kids‚Äô electronics so well and was surprising adaptable. Highly recommend
2,So I may or may not have gotten a messed up one but I feel like there‚Äôs a silver piece missing to keep the clamp part connected to the rest of the holder. I feel like for the most part it‚Äôs sturdy but I wouldn‚Äôt really know if mines wasn‚Äôt broken.If it wasn‚Äôt broken I would‚Äôve given it a 4 or 5  star‚≠êÔ∏è
5,Muy versatil muy facil de manejar muy compacto no estorba nada cuando lo pliegas
5,AHK Car Headrest Mount Holder seems to work well.
5,The best!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Muy bueno lo recomiendo
5,Increible
5,Bueno
5,Easy to use works as intended
5,I bought this so our little could watch Disney+ on the iPad during car rides... AMAZING! Buy. This. Now.
1,Not sure if its just me but for my money I except a good quality item and that would last for sure. I bought 2 of these items for 2 tablet installs on a minivan the installation is very easy and straight forward but the quality feels quite cheap. I have to constantly tighten the ball in the back so it doesnt start to face downward also since it has these thin rods (which even bend) the item doesnt feel sturdy. I was hoping this would be something that would last but to tell you the truth I dont think that it will. You could always buy it and post your opinion it might be just me. Thanks.
5,100% Functional
5,Works amazingly well and well built
5,Works great with iPad Pro iPhone and Nintendo switch.
1,The part that holds tablet/phone swings with every turn made. It will not stay in one spot.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Very handy device. But when a tablet is not installed it makes a lot of noise when driving
5,Easy to use experience: suitable installation: simple workmanship: strong product material: strong
5,good quality. It is suitable for playing movies for children when driving.
5,Good product easy to use. Holds our Amazon Fire tablet well.
5,Easy to install and use. Holds tablet perfectly and angles so baby can see it in her car seat.
5,This was an impulse buy for a trip. It fits our kids‚Äô electronics so well and was surprising adaptable. Highly recommend
1,Short arms and doesn‚Äôt extend.Doesn‚Äôt hold the screen I bought it for because the clips on the side are too short.I can‚Äôt even return it because I only tried it by my next trip which was after the window. Money down the drain.
5,good quality and easy to use
5,good
5,Easy to use..
5,Me encanta muy f√°cil de instalar es super
1,Nice concept but not well made. The screw for the joint in the retracting arm broke/stripped after using it on 2 road trips.
5,LOVE THIS!!!!
5,Excellent
5,Awesome

2,the spring tensioner is to short for headrest on 2004 Dodge Ram 1500.It fits over my son's iPad's foam cover which I love but tension bar is too short for the headrest on a 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie Quad Cab.
5,Perfecto para nintendo switch
1,iphone and ipad for variety needs.Will testing out for few days if okay won‚Äôt return.  Arrived on last day 2021.
1,I‚Äôd place the iPad on here so my daughter can watch it while we are in the car. It falls forward and I always have to pull over to push it back up. It‚Äôs not steady at all- it‚Äôs very annoying
1,Broken
2,Tension arm doesn't compress short enough to fit. Disappointed.
1,I purchased this as an alternative to not installing a TV screen to my headrests. I totally regret it. It's way to small. It will not hold the complete switch nor stretch enough to fit the iPad pro as it says. I literally threw this away it was a joke to purchase.
1,It didn‚Äôt last a week before it broke when i moved it out of my car. The spring just popped off and now it‚Äôs unstable
1,I got this for my kid and he hates it because you can‚Äôt see anything on his iPad while it‚Äôs shaking in this thing
1,Cheaply made product. I have an iPad Pro for my daughter and it doesn't hold right. Doesn't do well to weight or pressure. Don't recommend.
1,I would have give 5 stars but it will not fit my headrest really wish it would have worked nice product just too small
1,Doesn‚Äôt fit on any of our families rear headrests. We have tried in all three of our cars (which are all different makes/models)
1,It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I tightened the screws as soon as a start driving it starts tilting.
1,To loose does not fit my car check your car first the peace that attach to the car is too weake
1,If it doesn‚Äôt fit they should refund with a penalty. It is false advertising
1,Looking for something to hold an iPad.  Brace that mounts to headset is too flimsy.  Don‚Äôt waste your money
1,Have to take tablet/phone out of case for it to fit
1,This did not fit the headrests in my Ford Expedition.
1,I think dollar tree sales better quality
1,Broke the first time used
1,Rattles constantly tried to tighten it but kept rattling
1,Very short arm. Does not extend much. My son who is in a car seat can‚Äôt reach it
1,I hate this it does not hold well my iPad 7 generation. It keeps falling it when I go over bumps. It‚Äôs more useful as a cellphone holder.
1,Weak springs don't hold much weight
1,The articulating arm is weak and tends to sad with the tablet
5,This performed exactly as I had hoped! You can customize the angle and position which is great for making sure there‚Äôs no glare. Also great for making it where two kiddos can see it well. It‚Äôs held up great over the past few months and I love that it stays in place wherever I position it.
5,This is a pretty nice device to have for road trips. The first thing I say about this product is that it definitely a very secure device for your tablet or even switch console. It is not a security device so be sure to not have the device showing in your car as you may actually get a car broken into. The clamp is easy to adjust and use. You can move this device 360 degrees. This unfortunately only really puts the tablet either higher or lower on the headrest. The clamp is pretty strong but padded so your tablet or switch will not be damaged or anything. It is case friendly to the thin case but any thick cases you may run into issues in the device not fitting inside the clamp. Another thing is to ensure you have the appropriate measurements before you order since you want to make sure your tablet fits. The device does rely on having a headrest on the front seat. It does elevate the head rest a few inches up to accommodate the stand into the head rest so ensure the driver or passenger is comfortable. It is pretty tight fit and you would need to loosen to make and adjustment. Another thing is that this is metal so if you leave the car in the sun be careful when touching the stand as it may actually have been super heated. The cushions as well may get warped overtime due to the heat. The holder definitely a great way to entertain the back seat passengers. The down side of this thing is that you cannot turn the holder to face an angle in any direction which can be a bit of a downer for the person sitting in the middle seat. I usually use this to hold my android device and we can basically play video games. It does have a secure safety feature but again I would still put the tablet away when parked to avoid car break ins. Overall I think this device is a great addition to the car and great for traveling.
4,This is a product that all parents would like for long car rides as it keeps your child occupied with whatever electronics. I did test the holder with different items before fastening onto base just to see if it would actually hold them. My cell phone and ipad(held on the short sides only) were extremely tight and were almost to the holders breaking point; I do have a case on my iPad so that may be why it was tight. The switch fit snuggly once you take both controllers off.I then took the unit to my car. It is a Kia Soul and the base barely fit in the headrest. I did end up fitting it once I put the stationary part in first and then the spring loaded side. It does put the headrest up higher than I normally use it so am not sure how comfortable that will really be.As you can see in the photos there is plenty of room with the unit  barely extended as well as fully extended. Your child should not have a problem being able to see the screen from any position.The only issue I have with this is the price. For almost $17 I feel it should be able to be installed in more types of cars. I didn‚Äôt try to install in my husbands full size SUV but I don‚Äôt anticipate any problems although other reviewers have had issues. The spring doesn‚Äôt seem to extend much for bigger headrests.
5,This was amazing for our drive from the northeast to Florida and back. All three kids could watch my iPad in our minivan at the same time. Only thing they could improve is to allow it to not just telescope side to side but up and down as well. But very good product and really so necessary.
4,This is a great resolution to children fighting in the back if you need entertainment to inspire them to be nice to one another.  If you don‚Äôt have an auto with a built in TV you can easily set up a phone or IPad with this in minutes.  So long as you have a headrest you can hook this up without any issue and it won‚Äôt bother the driver or passenger in the front.  I highly recommend keeping the arm somewhat close to the seat so children can‚Äôt try to pull this down.  The one downside for me is you have to remove any device from a case for this to work the best.  That tends to make me a bit nervous.  Overall we are happy with this since it isn‚Äôt used on a daily basis.
4,I wish it was a bit more sturdy
4,I thought this might work for a small dvd player but apparently not.  It will work for a regular tablet -Kindle fire Ipad etc provided it does not have a substantial case on it.  Thinner cases should be ok.Typical of these things  the further you extend it the less stable it is.  It will also work better for 2 seats that are adjacent rather than setups like mine where the captains seats are more outbound and not touching.For the price its certainly worth a try
5,The device seems fairly solidly built. With a little creativity it can rather easily be used in a number of other ways than just the headrest. Shown with my picture is how my husband has been using it while on downtime at work. He's also combined it with clamps or the carrying case we have for our switch for more combinations. It is great for use as a stand for the Nintendo Switch. We can see using it for tablets phablets and larger phones too. (He's also used it with a Pixel 4a successfully.) We'd certainly recommend this particular holder.
5,This is an especially great thing to have for long car rides. Or just any car ride. It was easy to mount in my car just make sure your seats have headrests that this can attach to. All you have to do to change the size is push one of the ends in put it between the headrest mounts and release the end that has a spring. So it's very easy to take on and off. The part that holds the phone mount can be pushed all the way down if necessary. The part that holds the phone can also be pushed up and down and tilted side to side. So it works for any viewing angle you could want. It feels sturdy and I have no doubt that it will never fail to securely hold my phone. I've used it with a 5.8" phone and a 6.4" phone and both worked great. According to the description it should work with basically any device. So what you see in the product images and description is accurate. I fully recommend this product as it does exactly what it's supposed to.
5,A mother/ grandmother's must have. This gadget has been a godsend when traveling with my grandchildren.  They use it to watch shows youtube games on the iPad while in the back seat.  No more hand holding and dropping the iPad  I just plop it in the holder they put on their headphone and I have a peaceful ride throughout town.The holder is quite sturdy and was very easy to attached (a little too easy).  My grand children love it.  It extends out it swivels and it adjust to cell phone or tablet size as well as grips and holds in place securely.
4,This is perfect for your kids in the back seat to keep them occupied.
5,Normally our daughter isn't in the car for more than 30 minutes at a time. But for road trips she can (understandably) start to get a little restless ‚Äî especially since she's still in a backwards facing car seat. So I picked this ipad mount up so that we could set up the ipad for her to watch sesame street and some of the Disney Jr shows when we're driving to visit family in other states. Easy to install and very secure.
5,This is perfect for my kids in the backseat so they can watch movies they downloaded on their iPad on long car trips. It snapped onto the headrest easily in my jeep and it adjusts and rotates enough that they can both see the screen. The part that holds their ipad can probably fit any sized phone or tablet. It seems to hold the device securely I don't think it could fall out.
5,This is great both my kids and I love it. First off it's really easy to install - my teenage son can mount it on the headrest in less than 10 minutes.I like that the arm can extend to bring the tablet or phone closer to the user. It also rotates so this this is quite versatile.It appears to be well made and of great quality.  We were able to fit out iPad mini and iPhones on it with no problems.
5,Works for my kids portable DVD player!! Works perfect for putting in the center for all the kids!
5,I use this to hold my tablet and play kids songs and videos in the car for my nephew for long car rides. It holds on well and can extend and adjust angle-wise. Just know if you extend it it will bounce with the cars movement but that's unavoidable. It's not say to put on and take off. Highly recommended.
5,perfect to have the kids entertained during long trips.very easy to install. Seems sturdy i hope it doesn't get loose after a while. i will update if anything changes but as for now sturdy easy great. we use it for my son's ipad.
5,Easy to set up. Holds my daughters iPad and she watches movies. Overall hold it great easy to install 10/10
5,This product is very good it is very convenient to put in the car the back row is just right to use I like it very much very good
5,This is perfect for keeping the kids entertained on long trips. You can install this in minutes. Very handy the way it extends out from the seat too. Kids love it!!!
5,can not wait till use
3,This will hold a phone or tablet or whatever if it is of the right size.This will fit onto a headrest.The question is whether there was a demand for another type of these or whether they were made because they had a lot of the components left over from something else.If you need one this seems pretty well made.
3,The concept of this device requires your headrest to be of a specific distance and size.  For my Prius Prime it didn't work.  The poles that held the headrest were too thick.  The stabilizers on this mount are not adjustable which to me is a major design flaw.  I tried a bunch of cars and couldn't find one that worked with this mount.
3,This product is easy to install but I have to say there is NO way this would hold a tablet (unless it‚Äôs a kindle). The extenders don‚Äôt extend enough to hold anything beyond a phone or MAYBE a kindle. That being said I do think that if you hit a bump with your phone in this it might fall out of the holster. I‚Äôm not impressed.
2,Might be alright if it actually fit the vehicle. This does not work on generation 2-4 Ford Expeditions as the tensioning bar does not fit the headrest. There is very little information listed about the tension bar on the product description.
5,This works pretty well.  It is easy to install on any standard car headrest.  It's pretty sturdy plastic and holds our Switch nicely.  Overall it works well as I hoped it would.
2,Apparently not all headsets are made a like. This did not fit my Subaru Crosstrek's headrest on either the passenger or the driver's side. It's a shame because it feels like a solid well made product. It's all plastic but it seems like it is of sturdy material that would last quite a while. Unfortunately it is unusable in my car.
1,Was shipped without packaging was flimsy and does not have a lock that would hold it in place while a car is in motion disappointed with product
3,Installation was easy in an Acura TL. The kids didn't car much for it because it was too far away for them to access the phone. This has become our backup holder.
3,This seems like a great idea.  Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt fit my car‚Äôs headrest.
5,Holds phone or tablet very well. The ability to rotate it and move in and that makes for great viewing. Sturdy versatile and very durable. Great for anyone in the backseat!Definitely Recommended
5,It am easy to use item and works great
3,Is very " sturdiness " BUT AS YOU CAN SEE is missing one part to hold it. I didn't realize on till I tried in the moment to install it. So 3 start from me
5,My kids love this gadget and so easy to put on the car. Love the fact that I can extend it out and it holds their nintendo switch as well as the iphone perfectly.
2,This product arrived in a plastic bag with a barcode on it.  I felt something was off from the get go because most items arrive in a box from  their manufacturer.  After opening the item I see tons of fingerprints all over.  I didn't really mind so I continued to try to set this up and guess what missing parts.  I could not even try this out.  I need 4 of these.  I guess I will try another brand.
5,MUY BUENO TODO
5,Effective tablet mount that has the ability to swivel L and R but also angle away from the sun. Since I have weak Internet at home I have to drive to university park in a lot near the library and use the university‚Äôs Internet and have virtual meetings from my vehicle. It‚Äôs a bit humorous but that‚Äôs what I have to do. I found this tablet mount that may be affixed in between a vehicle‚Äòs head rest posts. It works in my vehicle (2015 Ford Escape) but not in my husband‚Äôs (2004 Buick LeSabre). You do need to measure the distance between the headrest posts to ensure it‚Äôll fit in the vehicle in which you intend to use it. I leave the mount on the back of my headrest and have used it for a dozen meetings so far. As long as you tighten the knobs the mount works really well. One time I forgot to tighten one of the knobs and my iPad fell to the floor of my vehicle. Oops!
4,My headrest bars are too close together for installation.
5,Would definitely buy it again
5,The ease of use and the practicality of it makes it great product. Would recommend for long road trips.
5,Works great on my Toyota Taco but will not fit on Honda Accord. Like the arm extend out and at different angles. Overall I like it. I Bought another one for the accord.
5,Great value for the money ease of use if need to interchange for cars. Very mobile for toddlers to use and pull forward.
5,I like the design of this mount and how simple it is to install.
5,√ötil y excelente inversi√≥n
5,Ocupa poco espacio
3,Bought this to hold the iPad in the back seat for my daughter. It does not fit in the cross section of the headrest in the rear. It‚Äôs a Cadillac suv. It doesn‚Äôt collapse far enough. Needs to go about another inch at least. Fortunately I had some 100lbs test zip ties and just secured it like that. With 2. (In case of accident.) I was going to put it in the front and extend it out so she could watch her learning stuff but the arm doesn‚Äôt extend out ver far. So that didn‚Äôt work. Rigging it myself is what worked. Thank you fir I pad holder though! That spring is solid and holds it very secure.
5,I absolutely love this item. It fits perfectly behind my headrest and is a life saver for my grandkids!! They love it too!!
4,These things are awesome! I write reviews for bad products I dont write many good reviews. But this deserves it my kids love them and these things are a life changer! Highly recommend.
5,This is very useful and easy to use. However be sure to measure and see if it fits your vehicle. It didn't get short enough to go in our truck but it does work in our car.
5,I had 2 of these for my girls when we went on our road trip. It kept there tablets nice and sturdy and having the ability to extend was awesome. They didn't have to hold it rhe whole time and they could still have it close enough to them they weren't squinting to see the screen. Definitely recommend!!!
5,This is a great Headrest Holder for my kids iPad Pro I even have a thick sturdy case on the iPad but the Holder will still do its job. It extends pretty wide to grab any type of iPad or Tablet.
5,Easy to set up and use my daughter loves it so she doesnt have to hold it anymore.
5,This car mount is perfect if it ever breaks I would definitely buy the same one. I have a Samsung tablet S6 lite and it fits perfect.
5,Great product sturdy
5,My kids are so happy I bought this and they love it. It seems to be pretty sturdy for an iPad
5,Everything we needed. Thank you.
4,I'm an Uber driver and I use this with the Amazon Fire 7 tablet for passengers in the back seat. The material seems to be pretty sturdy not a lot of wobble. Does the job so far. The only thing to note is that the spring to hold it to the seat headrest isn't super strong some may have issues with that. Works for me though..UPDATE: It would appear it's not actually made for Kindle Fire the brackets hit the power button or the volume buttons and causes the device to reboot :(  And it's not short enough to fit on the long sides of the tablet. I'm now looking for something better..
5,Very good for phones and tablet in the rear seat of the car fot long travel with kids! So far so good it holds the I pad and the phones.
5,This is great especially for long journeys when children (or adults) are bored and want to watch a film. Using the iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù was always going to be a concern as the big questions was how would the holder cope with the size and weight? Luckily there is no issue whatsoever and now the front seat passengers can work/drive undisturbed!
5,This was pretty easy to install. I needed something for my granddaughter when she uses my phone to watch her shows in the car. This allows me to not be distracted because she can't throw my phone down on the floor. She's still very young and likes to push all the buttons. Now I can put on her show and she can watch it without having to touch the phone.
5,This was the perfect solution to managing a 2 year old on a 6 hour car ride. it easily fits any cell phone as well as largest iPad Pro with ease.
5,just was I am looking for my kids play on travelGood price qualityRecommend
5,bueno
4,Gave this (4) stars because it can hold Kids Kindle without having to remove case however have to be strategic about how kindle is placed on holder. The holder clips can press or mash the volume buttons or power buttons. Would shake a little while driving high speed on interstate.
4,I'm happy there is something out there for tablets in the car...well sort of.  The only complaint is the Amazon fire hd kids protector case for the tablet doesn't work so well.  The prong is a little too short for the kid protector case to fit.  We ended up having to take the tablet out of the case for it to work.  It's not so easy to take the case on and off is the main problem.  So it's a bit of a pain having to do it every time we're in the car ride and back into the case and back out again.But it works otherwise.  I wouldn't buy it again I would search for another one that has a longer/thicker prong that fits a thick case.
5,We used this for a our trip to the beach for our daughter. Saved our sanity (iykyk). Was about to move it around while connected to the seat highly recommend.
5,Product as described
