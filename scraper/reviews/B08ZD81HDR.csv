5,With no information available on Dell's website or anywhere else that I could find it was hard to figure out the right size screw & standoff post to install a Samsung SSD on the board of my Inspiron 3891. After ordering another set that turned out to be too skinny I ordered these. The larger size post was exactly the right size.
5,If you are building that sweet gaming rig or you are building a PC for business or school you might want to add or upgrade a an SSD NAND to a compatible motherboard. This way you have super fast SSD speed tied right to the motherboard where it usually does you the most good. Problem the screws that secure the ends of the NAND Drive stick are tinsey small and are easily lost during SSD NAND Drive initial installation or upgrade activities.It never hurts to have a spares drawer full of these because here you get stand offs screws screw driver in the sizes you are most likely to encounter on a PC motherboard. Not having a back set of these vital screws can derail a PC build fast while you hunt in vain for these items. The SSD drive is vital to making the OS and games run at their best on PC.If you are a steamer or you process video for online blogging again you want a SSD NAND Drive on your motherboard. This little package provides piece of mind that insures your PC build is not stopped in its tracks because one of these tinsey small screws or other bits have gone missing. This item gets my five star rating because it has saved my bacon a few times.
5,Perfect replacement to attach a new m.2 ssd. A good value. Box contained a large selection of screws.
5,What else can you ask for?
5,Ordered these after I realized the M.2 SSD drive that I purchased did not come with one. (My Pre-Built PC also did not include one)
5,It has enough screws for you to even lose some. They work for other boards as well.
4,It came in good packaging with all tools require for installation. Very easy to install.
5,I used this kit to place a new SSD into my system. It works great and the screwdriver is excellent. I would recommend this item to anyone.
5,Exactly what I needed to install my m.2 ssd.
5,The screws are all mixed together I needed the m.2 size the smallest.The screwdriver is magnetic just enough to hold the screw as you reach in computer case.Personally I don’t understand why the SSD manufacturers don’t include the screw with the drive.At least this kit is available at a decent price.
5,Has all the right accessories to get M2 drives installed if they weren’t there when built.
5,I have an msi x570 gaming plus motherboard and one of the many nvme screws was almost exactly the same as the MSi screw. Everything worked great my nvme is installed with no issues. They also included a friendly thank you card which is cool.
5,Excelente
5,My motherboard didn’t come with standoffs for the nvme so this kit was very helpful. Definitely everything you need for install
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Needed to install fans and extended adapter’s to pc for upgrades held screws perfectly did fall off and into pc in process of installing and having to dig in it to find them  Did the job at very good price..
5,This is awesome since the M.2 screws are a very difficult screw to come by this gives you many!
4,This kit is a great value for the money with a wide variety of sizes of screws and standoffs for mounting your m.2 SSD. My only complaint is that the included screwdriver while sufficient to use with a laptop or bare motherboard is far too small/short to use if installing your drive onto a motherboard which is already installed in the case. Realistically most users will not completely disassemble their PC’s and remove the motherboard from the case to install a drive in a second or third m.2 slot so inclusion of a longer screwdriver would be idea. For a buyer intending to install a new drive in an existing tower case PC be sure to have a long enough screwdriver to do the job on hand preferably either already magnetized or one you can magnetize yourself.
5,Had to mount my new Samsung 980 Pro to my DIMM.2 card but Samsung didn’t include a mounting screw or stand-off. So fortunately I found this package at a reasonable price and my problem was solved. If you’re thinking they’re a bit pricy well they all are. It’s not a common enough item to drive the price down. So I’ll just have to deal with market forces. Overall it’s a good product. The only change I would suggest is that more of the shortest stand-offs should be included and less of the longer ones since the short ones are used more often.
5,I never got the m.2 screws or standoff screws with my mobo so this was a lifesaver thank you very much!
5,Worked as expected  quick delivery of product
5,It's always difficult to handle the screws if you're a big guy and the screwdriver could be a little bit more magnetized but maybe it's like that so it doesn't damage any other parts.Anyway it has all the necessary screws and sizes.
5,Just as expected fit on my Asus b550
5,Just what I needed.
4,Like everyone else who’s tried to upgrade their ps5’s ssd a stripped screw stood between you and completion. This product works perfectly and is completely compatible! Hand screw in the brass/gold filler then use the tinted screw. The only thing I’ve seemed to noticed that when receiving a magnetic tip on the screw driver it’s a 50/50 split.
5,Works just like an oem made m.2 screw .
5,Might be a bit high of a price for what's being offered but you get exactly what's you see can't fault them for that.
5,I wanted to upgrade my SSD storage on the PS5 and was surprised to see the screw within the SSD bay stripped fully. I ordered this set after seeing comments and can CONFIRM  IT WORKS.  It was easyThe brass/gold spacer is the one that fits handtightenedThe matching screw that is almost a similar tint of brass is the one that goes over it. Like the images.  You can see the difference in the stock screw and the perfect aftermarket one.IF YOURE STUCK ON THE PS5 SSD with a split screw  buy this kit and know that it will 100% work. It was painless with this spacer and screw.
5,If you lost your M.2 screws or never thought you’d buy a second M.2 SSD for your motherboard and threw away the box before you put the second screw in then this is the product for you. If you don’t need M.2 screws then I am 100% sure that you don’t need this.
5,Bought a ROG Strix B-450 a few years ago and recently bought an nvme. The screw that came with the board did not fit. This package had the Size I needed. I only wish I didn't have so many extra screws left over but worth it to get the drive installed.
5,I lost the screw for my M.2 slot. I played with the idea of using duct tape to hold my drive down because I was so excited to install it. I would go to Radio Shack to get stuff like this back in the day but these are new days. The tip of the screwdriver is magnetic which is very useful. This set comes with the risers needed to elevate the drive. I feel like I got a very good deal.
4,As seen in the product picture this is a variety pack meant to work with various motherboards. I can only speak to it having the correct size for an Asus Prime x570-P. The standoff is a little smaller in diameter than the original Asus part but worked fine. The screw was large enough to cover the hole on the NVMe. I used my own screw drivers although the one that came with the kit was slightly magnetized and may have worked.
5,I have no cons with this product.It had the piece that i needed for my SSD M.2.Thank god it was what i was looking for.
5,If you need these you'll know.  They didn't break and my PC still works.  What else is there to say?
5,My screw was too tight and starting to strip like many others so I needed to replace both that and the spacer. This works great screw driver is the right size and IT IS magnetized despite a review saying it wasn't. It's a small screwdriver so it works on the smaller pieces only.Use the biggest sized spacer it's brass/ gold colored. I almost thought I bought the wrong stuff but that one fits perfect (doesn't matter that it's hex shaped).
5,Got into pc building after buying a prebuilt from NZXT before the market crash so i was able to build a newer PC with the highest end 20 series before it went up in price and of course I can’t have enough SSDs so this is needed especially if i lose a screw or cannot find my regular number 1. Screw driver
4,Worked for what I needed and that being extra hardware. So all in all was good all items seems in decent shape and quantity correct with no damage and threads seemed correct.
4,Useful selection of standoffs and screws. One of them will work on your motherboard.
4,If you are building with a current Asus mobo you probably don't need it.If you require a product like this then this kit is a good buy.
4,Worked great. I just wish the screwdriver was actually magnetic as advertised.
5,I didn't see any reviews or questions regarding Dell motherboards. I was having a hard time locating a standoff for my M.2 and nothing out there shows up for Dell. Bought these on a chance but they were too small (thread diameter). Posting here so anyone in the same situation knows better and saves a little money.  Listing 5 stars since the product was as described.
5,I bought this because I was desperately looking for 1 long screw but this gave me what I didn't even know I needed a studded screw to help support the nvme drive! This solved my issue better than I thought and it came to my house faster than expected! 5 stars!
5,I think most of the stand offs in this kit aren't really worth anything they seem more like case stand offs than M.2 ones. I did however end up using two after buying an open box from Microcenter (why is it that people can't seem to remember to include the M.2 stand off and screws when returning items..) and the kit has paid for itself since I saved money on the open box item. Next time though I am going to just buy the one for Asus motherboards.
5,Needed an extra screw for my asrock motherboard to add memory. Bought and received what was expected.  No complaints other than the magnetic screwdriver included could be a little bit stronger.  If you have a steady hand you'll be fine.  Shaky hand = goodbye screw.
5,Got exactly what I needed.
5,Not much to say here. Multiple sizes depending on what you need and enough that I'll probably never need to buy another set ever again. The price is great. I wish my prebuilt PC would have included the standoff that I needed but amazon had my back with these for a low price and next day shipping. If you need them get them!
5,Great kit to have around for the random mounting screws you'll need but lost when doing builds.
5,Simple fast transaction. item as described.
5,Great kit for pc builders
5,Needed one screw to secure my SSD on the X570 motherboard. This pack shipped fast and fit the bill.  Plenty of leftovers for future projects.
3,Having a small sample of choices I was able to find what I needed for the motherboard I got for free. Unfortunately the Asus Tuf X470 board turned out to have Tuf  issues I couldn't resolve.
5,I mean they are screws and standoffs. They work
5,Installed M.2 SSD on Asrock Taichi motherboard using the supplied proper screwdriver (you don't want to mess up a motherboard with an incorrect tool)! The screwdriver is magnetic.Found the correct screws and fitting standoff spacers - they come in groups of three so you can install up to three M.2 SSDs or use as reserve if a screw is lost (they are tiny).Recommendation: Would be nice if a small info sheet is added as to which screw and standoff spacer set fits what motherboard.
5,this was perfect for what I needed to install my M.2 SSD memory with a good price too
5,Screws work great! Got an SSD for my computer snd realized I had no screws to hold it in place. The little flat ones this came with were perfectly comparable with my pre existing spacers in my motherboard. Glad to have extras since both myself and my husband have the same motherboard!
2,I needed a screw to install an M.2 drive in a Dell OptiPlex 5060 Micro PC.  None of the screws in this kit were the right size.  Fortunately I found one in my toolbox that worked.  Not worth returning I'll toss this kit into the toolbox for another project.
5,I only needed 2 pieces from the set but they worked perfectly with my aorus b450 pro motherboard. I'll hold onto the other pieces in case I need them or someone else needs them.
5,Fit my Asus MB. Have spares for my business.
5,They're just a good solid set of M.2 mounts that do what they need to
3,Better to have several sizes available when dealing with an expensive MB.
5,The product worked as it should and is a good buy at this price.
5,Went to install second nvme lost the hardware this kit was perfect
5,Good Value
5,Very glad that this product exists. I had bought an open box MB and it didn't come with these stand offs for my M.2. Very good price. Quick shipping. Would buy again if needed.
5,You literally get every possible m.2 screw you might need
5,Exactly what I needed at an affordable price. Shipped and received super fast.
5,What can I say other than these did the trick! Having so many options is also nice as I knew there would be something in there that would work. The quality is also pretty good.
1,The included screwdriver is not magnetic it’s false advertising. If I didn’t test it beforehand I could’ve lost a screw in a motherboard and bricked it… Come on.
1,This product is not what you want if your trying to install a Gigbyte motherboard. The screws are way too small to be of any use. Save your money and look elsewhere!
2,Screwdriver tip is NOT MAGNETIC as it is described/claims to be. This makes it difficult to screen in the tiny little m.2 screws into the tiny hole of the motherboard.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Nuff said.
1,The screws are good for the money but the screwdriver itself is cheap plastic and broke almost instantly.
1,Tried all of the screws and non of the would fit my MSI motherboard
5,LikesArrived on time and well  packaged.Parts for multiple motherboard vendors very useful.Included screwdriver is magnetized so easy to install tiny screw.DislikesNoneOverall a great kit for those who want to install device asap especially while children are pacing to use the updated computers.
5,Those itty-bitty screws!!!  I am a fumble fingered ....  This pack has everything you need.  I purchased a new motherboard and there was no riser or screw for m.2 number 2 and no screw for number 1.  This kit is a life saver.
5,The screw in the expansion slot of the PS5 strips very easily. This is problem because now you cannot use the spacer and screw to secure the M.2 drive. I bought this pack in hopes of it fitting the PS5 and thankfully it worked perfectly. I was able to handscrew in the spacer and then screw in the mounting screw without any problems. A great cheap solution if you happen to strip the PS5 screw like I did.
5,Sometimes devices don't come with what you need to secure a M.2. This kit has the tops bottoms and a screwdriver. Works and makes it easy to secure your M.2s.
5,Excellent value for so many sizes.  Screwdriver is magnetic though not very strong.  I had no problems using it though.
5,So as far as I know the screws were all there but it’s just a bag of screws. No sheet of paper letting you know which is which. You have to come back to Amazon and look at the product photo. It’s just kinda weird that it wouldn’t be included. But still 5 starts. I got my m.2 installed no problem. Came with the tiny screwdriver which is good have if you’re needing to upgrade something else on your computer.
5,As some others have said in these reviews and if you’ve ended up here after going on Reddit or other forums this will work as an alternative if the screw strips inside the m.2 port.  Even with the right tools my screw stripped and I was beyond frustrated but saw this set listed in a couple conversations and gave it a shot.As others have said the gold spacer is what you need to use.  It is not going to line up perfectly like the existing one but it will keep the SSD in place and secured.  I know it may be irritating that this happens after you try to install the ssd but I highly recommend this as the alternative.
5,What can I say these were M.2 SSD Mounting Screws.  Worked just fine.
5,The included screw driver is kind of cheap but didn't really care too much about it. I had my own tools and the different sizes comes in handy. I lost the screws that came with my motherboard and these work just fine for installing NVMe N.2 SSD.
3,Lost m2 screws twice trying to secure my NVME drive.  On ended up in my PSU so that was fun.  Included hardware is fine but the screwdriver magnet doesn't even hold the tiniest screw...
5,My Asus motherboard had an empty M2 slot but it was missing the hardware to add one.  This kit supplied the perfect size standoff and screw so that I was able to add a new ssd drive to my pc.  I like this kit because it include various sizes so you are bound to find one that fits your requirements.  The hardware is of good quality and the screw and standoff connected with no issues.
5,Bought this for my ps5 because i stripped the screw :(
5,It comes with 15 screws and 15 standoff. There are 2 types of screws and 3 each of 5 different types of standoffs to increase compatibility with different boards. The screwdriver is small and the tip is slightly magnetized to help making installing an M.2 easier. Overall a great package with parts that will work for most motherboards. One improvement that could be made is if the screwdriver was magnetized a bit more.
4,If you're like me you have a PC you built some time ago and you want to add an M.2 SSD to help your aging hardware stay relevant until the Silicon shortage ends. The issue I had is my motherboard's only M.2 slot is a VERY narrow space between the CPU and PCI slot for the GPU so the tiny screws and non-magnetized screwdriver made locking down the M.2 SSD to the riser (HUGE thank you for including a large variety of riser heights) a very difficult and tedious task. That said when I actually did get the screw in and it locked the SSD in place I felt a sense of joy and accomplishment I have never felt before which is why I am giving this product four stars.For the record I don't know if you can even magnetize a screwdriver as tiny as the one they give you but it's literally the only issue I have with this kit.
5,I purchased the PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD Mounting Screws Kit. I only needed one screw but purchased the bunch with a screw driver. I needed the M.2 screw for my SSD but knew I'd use the other screws sooner or later. I already had the standoff installed but was happy to get the screw with the standoff in the package. Nice selection of standoffs as well. I was going to replace my installed standoff figuring the replacement screw wouldn't match "ideally" (as is always my luck building these things). But M.2 screw matched great with my installed standoff and secured the SSD np... I even used the little screw driver... It's a little small but does the job. .. I'd rather not review the screw driver :|  Nice little kit to keep around if you're in a pinch. Recommended for those that have taken PC building into their own hands...
5,This kit was purchased to replace just one m.2 riser. I wish I could just buy one but I've no doubt that me or someone I know at some point will need one of these and I'd be glad to give them one.They seem to be of good quality. The threads on the screws and the risers are all cut correctly. I didn't find any jagged edges. The screwdriver is pretty bare metal but it does the job if you don't have a good one around.
5,Very good fit and easy to install
5,Special computer screws for M2 installation are either not shipped with the units or small and easily lost.  I have dropped small screws like these and it is amazing how far they will go on the floor requiring a lot of time searching to find if lucky to find.This assortment will contain what you need now and future need. It will give you the relaxed luxury of not searching if you drop one.
5,Are there all pieces present? Yes they are. And I installed NVMe successfully
5,The screw on the left worked for my MSI B550 pro motherboard. I had the OEM m.2 nut but was missing the screw. This kit worked perfectly.
5,While not universal this kit covers 90% of the market
5,Has all the tiny screws you'll ever need for motherboard builds. Don't sweat the small stuff buy it!
5,Price point was great all mounting options available.
5,Only got this for more M2 screws the screw driver and extra stuff was a bonus
5,Used these to fasten M2 SSD to motherboard worked great thanks
5,Had the needed assortment of sizes to suit my needs. Have left overs in case I need a different one in the future. Inexpensive with a good selection of sizes.
5,Can't complain works great and is a real kit not simply what you need once but something that can go into a toolbox for later.
5,Needed as spares. It is better to have these than hold up a build or install.Variety of sizes.
5,This was needed to install a SSD into the M.2 socket since ASUS does not supply the needed hardware. Has different sizes. If I do this again I'll pull the board out of the case first. Tiny parts and fat fingers don't work together that well. This kit has enough other spares for a number of builds.
5,Bought this for the magnetic screwdriver (you definitely need one installing M.2 SSDs - too tiny screw) - have not used any of these screws yet.
5,You can't say a lot about screws and spacers but there's plenty for any situation you could end up in
