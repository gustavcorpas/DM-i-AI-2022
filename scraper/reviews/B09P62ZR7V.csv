4,It doesn’t hold the Wi-Fi signal very long. It kept connecting and disconnecting constantly. So in my case there were no continue video.I wrote to customer service that replied quick. The issue with my camera is that this model does not work with internet optical Wi-Fi. The resolution to my case is to ask my internet service provider to switch the router to a non optical router which is impossible as not very often service providers offer optical and non-optical in the same place.So if you have a non-optical Wi-Fi router this will work fine with a good image quality. If your router is optical you will have several brakes in the connection to internet and thus no streaming online.
4,It's a pretty good camera gets good signal from a fair distance pretty good clear picture easy to setup. My only issue is I don't think it has a spot light option has a flashing light instead.
5,I ordered 2 cameras with solar panelsunfortunately one of the cameras broketheir tech support was on the ball to replace and ship the replace Am glad I brought from this company my cameras are working beautifullyam going to buy more cameras for my property..Thank youTech support for all u doUr the best
5,I was very happy at first. 2 mo later my camera stopped working. It won’t turn on. I’ve contacted customer service and have been dealing with them for 2 weeks now and so far have not gotten anywhere. I will update my review when and if this is ever resolved. I gave it 5 stars because it was a very good camera for the price. Just hoping I got a lemon and their going to replace it.
5,Image was taken from the camera through the app.I think the app is pretty user friendly.  Lots of options for settings.  I don't keep the camera with full view of the road (just driveway through to the house) or it will alarm you every time a car passes by. Obviously I live away from the mainstream so you can imagine I don't have the best internet.  I have had very few problems with connection and those are usually connected to the internet provider.  I'm in Arizona so solar is not a problem  the battery works all the way through the night.
4,The camera overall is nice and not bad but the major selling points and features are locked behind a subscription would not buy again update after talking to tech support and getting things clarified about this product I am rather satisfied and would buy this product again
5,What's not to like ❤️. It's easy to install great picture day or night solar powered & intuitive application. I broke a part attaching the solar panel. The seller got back to me within a couple of hours to credit me & direct me to a replacement part. The company’s communication with me was excellent. He followed up to make sure everything was working & I was happy with the product. Recommended Seller!
4,The only problem I have is the solar charging dosent keep up
5,Excellent this was just a close up picture of the camera when I got it. I just installed and it was worth it.
4,Got the camera set to under the eaves of the roof on the 2nd floor. Only disappointment is that I thought it recorded 24/7 with the memory card. Disappointed in this respect.Also to view all motions detections you have to pay monthly to use the app to see everything recorded. If you do not pay for the features in the app you only see live feed from the camera. Then the app is free. These are some of the things not mentioned in the discription for the item.
5,Very high-quality camera and the app is very accessible if you are tech savvy. Highly recommend as a security camera for home or business.
5,A great wireless security solutionThis is my first solar wireless camera I am suprised that at night even there is no sunshine the camera still working. Solar rechargeable is a good design for this camera.The video is very clear even at night at my video I see very clear my drive way. I also could talk， there is mic phone and speaker inside camera.  I love the feature that  I could turn the camera on my phoneso that I could see my porch.  Good value.
4,The camera part is  very good but the solar panel stopped  charging within the first month of use and they haven't been helpful troubleshooting but it plugged in fully and glad I charged it before installing  guess I  will just have to take down and charge it each month if they were more help in replacing  solar panel I wouldn't have to charge  it with a cordI definitely won't be from this seller agian
5,Easy to install running 4 cameras for total house coverage outside. Took about 2 hrs to unpack update firmware and install and test 4 cameras. App so far has been trouble free and easy to use. Great camera solid picture quality. Night vision is good even in total darkness with the aid of on board light . Overall very satisfied.
4,Easy install with the online app. Does what it is supposed to. Using a SD card as well as cloud Servises to save event records
5,It is a good DIY security systems. Only takes several mins to finish the whole connect to wifi mounting on wall. Take care about how to connect to solar panel to camera and how to mount the solar panel. I see the instruction on ad listing.The package is in good condition when I receive. Camera is heavy looks solid.Has nice video. And it record audio too. Audio quality and volume is good enough I could talk to visitor. Good value camera.
3,Camera worked well for two weeks then stopped. When I removed it water came pouring out. Instructions say mount upside down when outside. One would reasonably assume if the logo is readable right side up the camera would be right side up also. Apparently not my late discovery means the camera is ruined because I turned the camera so the logo is upside down so the camera is actually right side up and collecting rainwater.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 amazing cameraThis camera do a great job. I love the fact the the picture quality is very nice I mount this camera at front door I could see very clear who comesand the face. Video is very clear too even when somebody moving. At night also very good.This camera has the feature that I could spin the camera to left or to right  or down(when I want to see close) up(when I want to see the stree side walk). This feature is very helpful. It is remote controlI mount the solar panel on roof and the cable from solar panel to camera is long enough. Very nice design. It is a very happy deal. Good value I will recomand to my friends
5,I wished they had advertised that $30 package required to have camera function properly without package the camera was going off every second. Now it shows only human activity

I love the fact that the camera is every easy to setup. It took several mins to do it. When mounting the camera at front door I don't how to mounting the solar panel I check the video and pictures on the listing ad very easy to do  it. But I suggest seller to add a instruction on user book or accemble finish the bracket.Picture quality is very nice. Both at night or day time. Really sharp and clear. And I could roate the camera to another angle. Sometimes I want to see my drive way sometimes I want to see entrance steps. I spin camera ball remote on my phone nice feature. It is a good value camera I recommend to all my friends who need it!!
5,Thanks for the message. Product arrived on time. It actually worked with my 5g android phone even though it says other wise. Great product so far no issues. Great quality videos.. Pans great lights voice prompt (talk remotely). It also sees at night with light off.. also has a siren. Other services available as well on app ( Cloud Service ) ( VicoHome ). I installed an SD card 128. This is also solar. The plug areas has rubber protection seals. We will see how it holds up to a Minnesota winter.  Will purchase another.Thanks Kev Byron MN 07/30/2022
5,Great camera for a great price.
5,I like the 20 sc video shut
5,Summary:Buy it it's a good quality camera.I purchased this camera with very little hope of being a good camera. Well I was right but it actually for the better. This is a great camera and it does at great job at capturing pets cars and people. It is tagged correctly.I purchased a complete security system from Cove and to my amazement this camera outshines coves.The price is great and the night vision is awesome. It was very easy to install and the solar panel does a great job recharging the battery.The tilt option on the app to move the camera is very easy and useful.I will buy another one and I would recommend it. Technical support even reached out to me via Amazon on their own it's good to know support is there.

The one thing I should mention that the appearence is built quality. It does not feel cheap from camera or box in any way. Hoop up to my home wifi is as easy as it is.I am happy to use this camera  video feed is very quick(My home wifi is good) . The alarm notifications come through in seconds after motion detected. The speaker volume I set to 90% loud enough. To have longer video I set duration to auto.  I shared this camera to my wife we both could control the camera great
5,Came as shown haven't installed yet.
5,I needed a product that was solar powered and wireless. This product fit the bill. The picture is very clear. The night vision works extremely well.
5,so happy with it
3,This product has excellent picture quality and a 30-day free trial for extra security (which is useless to me) but the main problem is that the installation sucks. It is also too heavy and bulky. I'm not too fond of it so I will return this and get one with a better rating. Gave it a 3 for the quality only.
5,I used this Camara over seasworks excellent I can operate by Wi-Fi and have not problem at all.

My friend bought it firstly she recommand this for me. It is nice as my friend saying. The seller respond fast and polite also very professional. The camera image is very clear. Works great during the day. It can be very clear at night.I talked to my kids when I am outside downtown. Both us could hear very clearly and I could see kids clear.  CamerawWorks great job I will buy a second one again and install it in my backyard.
5,Installation and setup was super easy. Highly recommended. Great picture quality during day and night.
5,This is my second security camera. I love it has some questions I txt message to tech support she call me back instantly. She is helpful with suggestion.After sales service is good. They do care about user thinking.Overall the camera is very good value. Easy to set up and I just port on my desk. My house each corner has wifi so I could port it anywhere. I use this camera to watch my dogy when I am at working. Image is very clear I could see it. I love the fact that I could remotely rotate the camera head on my phone I could see where my dogy hidden. I could speak to my dogy when I am outside very helpful function.  At night image also very crystal when I am at vacation  I move it outdoor to watch who coming. Good value camera recommend.
5,These are bad ass cameras. Excellent price and quality. Glad I bought them
5,This is the best camera I've bought! It does everything it's suppose to and then some! Love the spotlight! It's a nice bright bright light for when someone who doesn't belong there is seen.. it also videos everything which I love the most.. have absolutely nothing negative to say about it!
3,UPDATE: After a few weeks the camera does not want to connect to internet(wireless network). Tried rebooting and still a problem. I do not have a connection issue with my other camera systems. Motion detection unreliable sometimes cannot tell what set it off. Also response time to trigger recording is slow causing recording to miss what triggered event. You have to pay extra to be able to adjust motion detection area. I do like the solar power to keep battery charged.
5,It's a good-looking and functional camera. It took a while to figure out how to set it up but I eventually figured it out. I needed to get a wifi extender because the signal gets weak outside but that is normal for wifi through a stone building. I love the solar charging. It always stays 90-100% charge. (I get a lot of Sun) I like the fact that I can log on and check it with my phone. Night vision is good. Motion detection is a little sensitive. All in all it's worth the money in my opinion.  I might buy a second one for the front of the house.
3,The picture quality after up to 10 maybe 15 feet depending on what you are focusing on is not very good. May be good for monitoring close proximity. Will not work for me. Thank you.
5,This camera looks like good quality one when I open box. It comes with a solar panel 2 brackets.Very easy to setup turn on camera down load an app then follow the direction then done. Only takes several mins. I have wire camera I know how complicate it is to install at wire camera. This impress me.Camera stays connection I have used this camera for weeks the solar panel keep charge the camera so power is always at around 95%.  Even when it was cloudy. Camera stay connects.  My wifi is good enough so untill now I am happy with this camera.
5,For the price I love my purchase.  Camera quality is excellent for day and night use. Technical support was very responsive and helpful.  I highly recommend this camera to all buyers you will not be disappointed.
5,The camera’s battery is not working well. I have to charge it using the usb wire provided till it reaches 100%. Then when I connect it to the solar panel it doesn’t charge and loses charge after  1 to 2 days.Update: Make sure that nothing blocks the solar panel and that it is firmly attached to the camera so that it could recharge back the battery. I am changing my rating from 1 star to 5 star. Manufacturer should emphasize charging the battery first so that it actually reads 100% and that the panel put in a place where it isn’t blocked by trees leaves or building.

If they were not great that would not be the case. I was sold after the first one and have continued to add them; often at the request of my wife to make her feel comfortable in my absence. For the price of the camera and cloud service  I don’t think you will find a better more affordable system. I have them in my primary residence and now my vacation property. The video is clear the notification of activity is fast and they are easy to install and connect. If anything the motion detection might be too good if that is possible. The audio is actually clear and the ability to verbally respond in real time to what you see on the camera is a big plus. I definitely recommend this camera and I recommend the cloud service.You won’t be disappointed.

I just take less than 5 mins to finish installation. I mount this camera to watch my driveway. It is a very good camera I could see very clear who is coming or going. My wifi is good after 1 month camera no off line and loading is very fast. The solar panel charge enough power to camera. I don't worry about power off. And no need to take camera off for recharging. I will buy second one.
5,So the motion detection is like spot on. Picture quality is excellent. Very pleased with this camera!! Iam new to security camera and this is my very first one. I have to say looking forward to see what this camera system can do.. I appreciate the tech support they are very helpful and definitely reach out. I 100% recommend this product..
5,I bought 2 for the house and they have been installed for 1 day.So far I'm very pleased especially for the price.Good clear pictures day or night infrared.Setup is fairly easy. Follow the manual. Once you understand and get accustomed to the APP software it's easy to use.I recommend this product. I only wish it were US made.
3,Did not like the fact that base for solar panel had missing parts.  Camera it self is better great quality.  I order one and sent back prefer replacement plus one extra.  All three and all had the same issue.  I returned all three needed for a project could not wait.
5,The tech support is good and it's simple  the motion and zoom effect awsome and nite vision very  impressed all around good product and company .great communication
3,Product worked fine for the first month but now it can't hold a charge more than a few minutes. I'm 8 days past the return date so I'm screwed out of $89.99.Picture quality isn't great at night unless subject is very close to the camera
3,Doesn't work with 5G wifi no clue how it works.
5,I like that's its clear both in the day and in the night.
5,Great product and great tech support.👍👍
5,The tech and customer support was excellent.Good product  good people
5,I am using it to monitor any activity on my property. With reservations I only ordered one. I am not waiting on my secondOrder. Very pleased.

You could see the image is in right direction. That is very helpful . I could port it any where It is convenient I could move it when vacation or move. I used it for weeks no offline power is ok so no worried about good. Recently no rain I think maybe can not put it like this outdoor. Label says : when outside  camera ball should downside. I locate it under roof I think it is ok.And the picture quality is nice clean and sharp. Good value for the money.

Outlook is nice not like that kind cheap one. I show to my husband he is amazing too. Finally I ask him to mounting this camera at my back yard. I have a rampoline for my kits. I use this camera to watch them when I do house work. I could spin the camera to the point where they are and ask them to back house for lunch through the app. It looks high technology feel. Picture is good voice is good. untill now no offline. It much more than my requirement. Happy buying on AMZ.  I will recomand this to my friend.
5,I got this camera because of the solar and 360 movement. So far it’s worth it for the price I also use it in Mexico and I’m in the U.S. so this camarera as long ass you have Wifi it can be installed anywhere. App only charges 3.99 for basic service
5,I've had expensive wired cameras with a dvr up to this point. But after installing this camera in less than 15 minutes and seeing the picture quality and using the 360 motion view I will never go back to the old system.  I love this thing. I'm buying more!
5,good value camera . picture is really clear. If someone visit.  I could know  evenwhen i am outside town.  I mount this camera to view front door and mount solar on roof. this is a good location wifi signal is good and solar panel has good direction on sunshine.  untill now camera is very stable no off line. and power is always full. recently sometimes it is cloudy. It is a very happy buying on AMZ. I bought 4 cameras. And all camera on one accout. that is nice.
5,Easy set up great picture easy to operate.My biggest complaint is that it picks up every outdoor movement  even after the settings are done ad instructed.  Being the only problem I would recommend this camera.
5,awesome quality. It is amazing very easy to install it just take several min done. And it has all features i want I could receive message instant the audio quality is much better than the one I bought it before. I have 4 escanu cameras i pay $3 per month I could have intelligent notificationrecognize people or pet or package motion add motion circle  zone. one subscription but 4 cameras could share. It is a AMZ happy buying. I recommended to my friend he also bought one.
5,Good
5,I now have 2 of these and they work great. The solar panel charged the battery from dead to 100% in 2 days! I love never having to worry about power outages or batteries going dead.
5,Good unit
2,This product is not worth the reviews that it gets for its category. First: customer service is base in China 🇨🇳 it takes time due to the 12 or 13 hours difference between two countries it takes them forever to answer. There is only one way for communication and that is via email so that being said forget about picking up the phone that's out of the question. Second: the camera's quality is OK not so great. But it does its job and at least keeps the people guessing.Three: make sure you install this item in order to make sure the item charges accordingly. My camera stop holding a charge after two weeks. Luckily I still have time to returned it.So what is the motto of these cameras that I purchase in total they were three and one is going back. If you don't care of quality performance and quality support then I will suggest to buy this camera to at least fool the thieves from time to time. Thank you for your time and understanding in this matter. Cheers mate!!! Wish you the best on your next purchase.Respectfullyknightcount69

I want to add one camera on my back door.  I choose one. This camera is so higher than expectation.  I am happy after use. I mount the camera on wall myself several mins done amazing right? I use this camera for around 1 week so far picture is very clear also at night it is good too.  I love the rotate function turn left or right on my phone cool. If after one month it still soo good i will buy one more. Good value.
3,My likes clear sharpe images. My dislikes are hard to move to new position hesitate’s some times only a couple seconds and other times minutes later but alerts me on app when needed I would recommend this camera it does the job
5,Great picture quality Motion detection works great.
5,Only in use a few days. Works well. Motion sensor alert is very sensitive even on low. Motion alert alarm comes on consistently with a small plant movement in wind. Turned motion alert alarm off. Otherwise very happy with purchase.
5,Chickens can be monitored at their level. The wife can play and watch them all day if we are out for the day. Great camera /video.
5,So far after 3 weeks detector works as designed and advertised.
5,Works great
5,Excellent camera quality and maneuverability. Crisp picture and excellent detection. Love that it is solar powered.
5,Nice features to bad you have to pay for them
5,These cameras are amazing! The picture is crisp no need to ever take down and charge or replace batteries. I love them so much I ordered 2 more!Customer service is also outstanding! Highly recommend!!
5,You have to subscribe  but the peace of mind it gives me is well worth it and it's not expensive.
5,Thank you for replacing this product within two days of telling you something was wrong

5,
2,Fully charged and installed not even a month and the solar panel is not charging in a full sun. I am very disappointed in the product. 😟
3,Not a bad camera for the price picks up a lot of tree movement and the wind makes it go off constantly
5,Have 2 set up outside of our home installation was quick & easy app set up is simple & informative quality is great as well. Two way audio & alarm is loud and clear. Overall very satisfied with our purchase.
1,This has been most disappointing.  We intended it for our vacation home and hence did not get to try it until after the return window closed as we surely would have returned it.  We set it up inside 4’ from router.  Unfortunately we need it outside of course so the signal must reach through a plywood exterior.  We started where we wanted it mounted about 25’ from the router and could not connect. We moved progressively closer and it started to sometimes connect at 15’ and a 45 degree angle.  But it would not remain connected and rarely would reconnect.  Finally we moved it to 8’ and 90 degree to router.  It would then reconnect about half the times attempted but spontaneously disconnect and always when any camera direction input was entered.  Effectively this camera is all but useless for its intended purpose particularly since it only operates on 2.4 GHz instead of the more robust 5 GHz.  Color rendition is poor although resolution is good.  No easily found way to flip the image 180 degrees.  Lag time is pretty bad (5+ seconds) making accurate control of camera motion overly challenging.  Dare I say made in China…..perhaps answers everything.
3,Camera luckily in ok shape. Package for the camera was extremely damaged and the put into an Amazon box. Not a good first impression for their company.
5,This is an awesome security camera.  We will be getting a few more for other areas around the property
1,I wish I did not wait long before installing this as I am no longer in the return period.  The only good thing about this camera is the picture quality is decent based on the library once its stored.  My issues are first the app if you see the pictire I attached it just goes into connecting and will not go into the live feed whatever I do installed reinstalled reboot nada its 16 ft above where it currently is installed and dangerous to get to but even with my multiple trips and installation the live feed will not work also the solar function stopped working 1 day it suddenly died due to low battery so I went up again to recharge it but after putting it back the solar function is not charging.  The frustrating part also is the amount of false report it sends EVERY DAMN MINUTE!!!! See picture attached it says theres a person or a pet but THERE IS NO ONE!!!! Im extremely dissatisfied.
5,Todo
5,Works great even at night.

1,When I opened the box I found a broken Solar panel and 2 mounts not attached to anything. Which is a huge issue. Because there are not Instructions! Can't find any on Google nor YouTube. If you have not Installed cameras before this is not for you.After struggling for an hour to figure out the mounting brackets I finally just gave up. Gonna return this camera asap.
1,Pretty bad overall when the sensor pick something up the object is usually far away or the recording stops halfway through and a lot of times it goes offline. the only thing I rate pretty good is the picture quality that's about it
1,I purchased this camera for use outside of the US añd now I'm unable to download the app to connect to my camera. Not happy about this at all. It is saying unavailable in my country
1,I can not say if the camera is any good. The application Vivo Home will not connect through the Wi-Fi to even setup the camera.
1,this item is a failure  constantly disconnect help center is a joke .i want to return it but the window just closed 2 days ago and i just found all its failures yesterday.I got bored and tired to be resetting each time it disconnect with no motive batteries is at 100%  it just get disconnected and will not react I have texted help center 3 times without response. i want my money back.
1,Never have I dealt with such a ridiculous junkie crappie cam recorded omg it will not simply connect to my wifi this seller is a rip off.
1,This product has NO tech support that is available without a fee.  If I could return the cameras that I purchased I would!!!!
1,Not Able to connect to more than one phone at a time
2,The media could not be loaded.
1,A Total Scam product to make people pay a monthly fee for listed features.  Just a regular PTZ Camera with very limited functions without paying anything.  Not worth the money and Very disappointed.
1,The panel won’t charge enough and the battery doesn’t last
1,Does not work with 5G therefore I wasted the money hope you do not buy as well
1,Live view even under the best conditions constantly times out and will not hook upTech support is almost useless reading right of the manualSave your money on this one!
1,Constant alert on low setting.  And to adjust areas you have to purchase a plan which should be part of the camera free.
1,After one month of used the camera stop working is any chance to exchange it.
1,Product but working after a week after the window to return it closed the seller is not doing anything about it
1,Solar panel is not charging anymore
1,No carga el panel solar
5,This product is very nice. It notifies me when there is movement. Very helpful for the purpose I need it for. I can adjust the range at which the camera picks up. I’ve placed the camera in the front part of my house for an aerial view watching my front door and yard. Quality is better during the day. My detection recordings are only during the day. I have zero recordings during the evening hours. The product is nice but would be better if it had detection at night. I did buy the camera for the light alarm. I plan to use once I get more familiar and acclimated with the camera and the partnered app.
5,It is easy to install and the video is really clear very good price and very good product
5,excellent quality of image day and night
5,Had some issues installing it. The camera kept turning off. It kept turning off when we plugged in the solar panel. Unplug that and it would connect.  It took us about an hour to get it to stay on.The picture is great. Really like being able to rotate the camera.You will need the password for the wifi.
1,Lo que no me gusta es que el panel solar no carga la batería
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 One was broke out of the box looked like the screws just busted all way out. Replacement ordered The seller did reach out to me about it but it doesn't matter I shouldn't gotta broke in anyway and now after just 2 days of using it it's pretty crappy it sets about 10' away 10' away from my router and it starts recording and then gets choppy after the 1st 4 seconds so what's the point if I don't record continuously for the 20 seconds like it's supposed to for 200 dollars I was expecting better  There's a screen recording of me trying to get it to play and you can see how bad it is
5,This was the best camera I ever bought- not to mention super easy to set up. Their app allows for precise rotation for that perfect snap. The video quality's high-def audio comes out well and the battery life seems to be always full. I already recommended this camera to my friends and I'll do so again.
5,I purchased this and it works great. Set up is straight forward as was installation. The picture decent both day and night and I like that it is stored in the cloud.  I opted for AI cloud service for 7.99 a quarter which allows the AI to tell you if it was a person vehicle or animal that set it off.  I like that I can also set up a zone in which it will notify me if it detects an intruder.  I like the system so much I purchased 2 More cameras.  I have only had these a month so I can not speak to longevity but so far it is working great.
5,It has been work for my house for few weeks already.All I need the camera for my house is easy to use not complicated for me . And I found this is perfect for me.Cause it’s only need one app to control all cameras and the screen of this product is clear and high quality and colorful.if you are the first time use the outdoor camera I recommend to buy this product.
5,Good Value cameraIt is a happy buying.  Firstly this camera is good quality Comparing the one I had before picture is very clear and nice.Then I want to move this camera to my new apartment but don't know how to set again. I contact the support number on the lable. She gave me a fast reply thank you so much Lin she is nice and professsional. So I love the tech support serviceIt is a really easy to use it. Good value product.  I will buy a second one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good value camera.I lost several package deliveryman said already sent but when I back home nothing there. So I plan to install a camera. This camera is amazing I paste on wall then finish It is supper easy I like this kind product.  Image is very nice. I downloaded a video clip from app even it is at night it is still very nice quality picture. Very clear. I love this quality. I found a very good postion could see my driveway and also the main entrance. It is very stable no offline and solar panel supply enough power. I will buy a second one for my backyard.
5,I am thinking about other order
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had bought several camera. This one is my favor. I bought this kind app camera before. I want to add one more so I bought this. Now I add one more to my phone I no need to change and other app. it is so good for me.  The one I had is without solar  charge. Sometimes I need to take off it . I used this solar charger for the previous one they match this one I keep indoors to monitor my birds and talk to them when I'm not at home.  The picture quality is very good. I also could rotate the view angle from my phone I love this function. And it is supper good values I think that I will recommand to my friends
1,This is NOT the camera pictured on the Amazon listing page. It is a different camera. I would have kept it but the correct parts weren't even included. . The solar panel mount is either broken missing parts or the wrong mount.  There are absolutely no instructions or pictures for this particular solar panel mount.  The mount pictured in the instruction is different.  Another customer included a video of the mount and it is a different mount.
5,I'm not much for DIY projects but this was pretty easy to put up. Camera quality is okay doesn't have optical zoom but I have no real complaints. I had software questions and got a prompt  response so I'm pleased. Basically it is what it says it is
5,PTV camera with solar panel -- Was a great price and read other reviews so really nothing to lose!  I wanted to be lazy and not have to run power to a location I want to monitor and this solar camera appears to do everything I need and more.  Just installed today and having fun learning all the features that I didn't even plan on- - but it has.  Picture is great and camera is responsive -- if the battery lasts with the solar panel alone I'm buying more!
4,Camera works good. A little difficult to figure out how to adjust everything compared to other cameras. Very disappointed that you have to BUY the program that detects people animals and cars.  Good overall.
