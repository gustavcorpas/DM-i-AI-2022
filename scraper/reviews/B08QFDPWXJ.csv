5,After a mini vacation  I left the socket part of my charger at a hotel I was staying in and had to replace immediately.  Amazon had the socket part I needed and purchased replacement.  I didn't have to replace the whole charger that included the wire cord but needed the socket part. Happy purchase  problem solved.  üòÄ
5,I absolutely recommend this block. Lightening fast!!!!
5,Charges fast enough. Needed it for my phone because it didn't come with the block and the USB charging block took 9 hours to full charge. This one takes 50 minutes from 0%
5,Extremely satisfying
5,Theis super fast charger works as advertised. I have no complaints so far!
5,Perfect for phone charging cord!
5,No complaints! product works well for charging.

5,Why pay Sam _ _ _ g prices ever!!! This works fantastically & fast.
5,Good

5,Great fast charge
5,Fast
5,It does the job
5,Funciona bien üëç
5,Phone charger
5,Works as well as the blocks Samsung stopped sending with their phones... which I didn't realize until I unpacked said phone. I have no clue where my old one is and I was counting on getting the super fast charging block!
3,This is a simple charger and the price doesn't worth. Found SAME charge affordable in retails store. Promissed for same day and arrived 3 days after.So nothing  special. I just paid more for the convenience.
4,Muy buena atenci√≥n buen producto
5,It charges my phone in like warp time which I love because I use my phone a lot.
5,Awesome charger very impressed by it. Would recommend.
5,Great charging block. Works well with my Galaxy S22 plus
5,Excellent charger!!
5,Charging my phone
5,Dont know why it doesnt come with the new s22 phone. Cord does. Seller shipped it out very quickly. Came in little plastic ziplock bag that you could use for travel.
5,To charge my new phone and to have a car charger in the car.
5,Charger was affordable and does the job that is supposed to be done.
5,Like that that the cord is real long.
5,I am very pleased with this charger.  It charges in less than 2 hours where my old one took longer.
5,This charger is very fast in charging your phone very protable and durable. Good Money spent
5,Works great. Does the job
5,I've had this charger now for about three weeks. I bought it for my S21 Ultra and it delivers all that it promises. My phone is fully charged within an hour mind you my battery is never fully drained and i hook my phone to charge after two days worth of use when there is about 10% of battery life left. The time it takes to charge my phone fits the 24W claim on the package . Over all happy with the product. Oh yeah one last thing that is not a deal breaker at any rate i really like the black color i say that since i am a bit tired of the white chargers that keep on coming with all my previous phones to match/copy the apple version of their chargers so black one was refreshing. Cheers!
5,My favorite charger for my phone
4,Right length
5,It's just awesome
5,Charges well
5,I wasn't sure about it at first while reading reviews but it's good quality and charges well.
5,Excelente
5,Todo esta bien
5,Cell phone
5,Does what it's supposed to. Truly a super fast charger
3,This was loose in the outlet and I had to mess with it to get it charge and could not move it. Went and bought a samsung one because my s22 only came with a cord and that one works perfectly. I'll keep this one for emergency charging.
5,I like that the charger doesn't overheat when you charge your phone.It is made with good parts.I had no issues with it malfunctioning.I  have no dislikes toward this item.I helped my mother buy the same charger.My mother loved this charger.This charger charges super  in like  70 mins.I'ts more faster than the S9+ battery charger cause they use a fast charge rather than a super fast charge.I like both chargers.Once i started using this new charger i loved how it charged super fast with no issues.I was able to use my phone right away.
5,It amazes me that when you upgrade your cell phones now that they do not provide the charger block only the cord.  With that said my husband was stressing that he would not be able to charge his new Samsung S21 but once again Amazon comes through and this little gem saved the day.  Charges fast ordering easy and shipping was fast as well.  Would recommend to anyone needing this.
4,Not having a cord to it is a mess if you don't have one already
5,The USB Type C Charger works great with my new Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. They only give you a cord with the new Android phone and the it doesn't fit any of the other charges I have.The charging power is great it charges faster than any phone or tablet I have ever had.It's a Charger! Thankyou!Kim Cutrano
5,Works well as intended on my Samsung Galaxy S21. I use the cable my phone came with so can't comment on cables.Overall all this charger works well with the ultra fast charge option on phone.First time I took it out of the box it wouldn't charge. Then unplugged it and plugged it in and started charging. Have had no problems after that. I don't know if it needed to be broken in to charge.
5,Great for those times when you need a charge because you forgot to charge your phone and your running late. Throw it on the charger brush your teeth and you've got a little juice!!!
3,Because you asked
4,N/A
5,Charging power is awesome and fast.
5,Good
3,Overpriced
2,It worked great for a limited amount of time.  Then it died after only 3 1/2 months.  It was used maybe 2-3 days per week as it was a back-up charger in a living room.  Disappointing to say the least.
5,Rapidly chargers my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra with impecable juice! The cord length does not concern me; it's not short! This actually was the biggest bang for my buck. I was so satisfied with the adaptor/charger that I purchased a second one for travel...on the go!  ;o  )
4,I would have  liked a longer cord
3,Charges fast but you must be aware it has a small port it needs a double ended charger cord not a USB on one end..
5,What they don't tell you when purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S21..it does not come with a charger for the wall. All.it has is a USB cord. This works fantastic and with Prime you get it the next day.
5,Charges my phone from 30% to 100% in less than 30min
5,woeks as described. appears to be well built. works as well as original charger
4,Charges my Galaxy S21+ in 30 minutes super fast
5,This charging block paired with the original cord that came with my Galaxy S21 charges my phone faster than any other charger I've ever owned.
5,Seems well made and charges my phone and other electronics quickly
4,I needed additional chargers for travel and just to have a spare. So far these have no problems but I've only had them for a short time.
4,Got this adapter since the new Galaxy S21 doesn't come with the adapter anymore. The adapter works fine and does 'Super Fast Charge' my phone it just makes a noise when I plug my phone in.
5,Like that it charges so quickly as that is a plus for busy on the go folks. Charged from 4 to 100% in less than an hour. The cord is really to short tho.
5,Came pretty quick.Super fast charging for a good price  better price than the stores.
5,Works great with S21 Ultra.
4,It really charges fast. But I think it's a little expensive
5,I love the Super Fast Charger block!
5,Does exactly as it should. Product achieves a fast charge with my original phone cord. No complaints. I'm not sure on aftermarket cords and I will update as soon as I get a chance to use 1 with this product.
3,It works great except it's a loose fit in the sockets for the wall so sometimes it'll easily fall out. Kinda bummed about that cuz it'll obviously stop charging. But ya that's my only complaint
4,It was purchased for another person. I have heard no complaints about the product.
5,This charger is super fast. Fast than any ot be er cord I've owed. A must buy!!!
5,I only ordered the charger.  No coils or anything extra.  I used it today for the 1st time and the products delivered.Thank you!
5,I love these! They do charge fast & I am glad I got them!
5,Works as intended and allows for super fast charging on Galaxy S21 Ultra. Review asks for a rating on cord length yet no cord was included. I hadn't expected a cord at all only a wall adapter.
5,I am using this charger for my new Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra phone (which comes without a charger).  This charger charges 3 or 4 times faster than the old one.  It was a good investment.
5,Works with any USB-C cable.  Charges my S21 5G in record time.
5,Love it it charges fast.
5,Happy with speed it charges
5,Works fine.
5,It is everything that it's supposed to be.
5,I like that it‚Äôs a quick charge. And good value for the money.  I did not rate it as to cord length as it did come with a cord. I only needed the plug block.
4,Charges phone quickly. Does not come with a cord.
3,Cord isn't that long but it does charge my phone fine. The problem is that it doesn't always stay plugged in well. Things seems to loosen really easy and it doesn't charge when it is plugged in. I think it is the cord where is plugs into the actual charging block that is the issue.
5,Charging block doesn't come with a cord.
5,I like item it is good and works.  I great buy for the money.
4,Doesn't come with cord
5,It has charging power
5,Perfect condition fast charging excellent charging brick. I would absolutely recommend.
1,it worked perfect until it complete a year. it just stopped working. I was traveling and had a hard time to buy another charger. cost me $$
4,It works great.
4,Llego en poco tiempoy Buenas condiciones
5,When I got my phone it did not come with charger. So I found one here and it works amazing. Super fast charger! Love it.
5,It appears that my phone did not need to be charged as often after it was fully charged.
5,Exactly what I needed my new s21 ultra didn't come with a charger and cord so I thought I would give this one a try seeing all the good reviews and I'm happy I did.
5,Product was as described. It works as it should. No problems.
5,USB C Wall Charger Block was as advertised.  Needed for a new phone but have not used it yet.

5,I purchased this wall block to go with my new S21 phone. It only came with the cord. Works great and fast charges my phone.
5,Good product for what I paid. Reasonable price & well worth it. It helps charge my phone so much faster. Will buy again if needed.
4,Fast charger
5,Works fast and very well! So far no problem... The wire is well made because it doesnt get as tangled for me.

5,I love it. Great price fast charging.
5,Very happy with it fast compact neat clean. Nice item.
5,It was one third the price of the one my cellular serice was trying to sell me; and it works perfectly.
5,Good stuff. One if the two I ordered didn't work Amazon sent a refund for another within an hour.
3,Yes it charges! Fast charging is questionable.  My phone can detect a fast charger. This is a regular charger. Which is not what I ordered.
5,Great block does the job as stated
5,This charging block works great for super fast charging.  Best purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone.
5,It doesn‚Äôt make the annoying whine like some chargers. And it‚Äôs type c it‚Äôs much nicer being able to plug it in however you want.
5,Power is fine. No cord was included.
5,Works perfectly with my S21! Samsung changed the cords and no longer includes the charger. This is definitely worth it.

5,Works as advertised. Great buy
5,Got a new Samsung and this brick was desperately needed. It charges extremely fast and I'm very happy with my purchase.  Thank you!
5,Solid charger for the price. Charges my Galaxy S21 Ultra crazy fast... Just terrible phones don't ship with these anymore. Thanks Apple.
5,Item works really well. Never had an super fast charging charger before. Give it 5 stars.
2,Bought this charger for my dad's new phone and it stopped working after less than six months. He's getting older so this seemingly little thing really frazzled him.  Hopefully the seller will replace it.

1,Charging block broke after 3 months of use. More specifically when charging was attempted phone (iPhone 13 pro) would rapidly stop and start charging. Tested multiple cords that were shown to be working to confirm that the problem was in fact a faulty block. Would not recommend.

5,Great
5,Fabulous
5,Fast charging
1,This worked fine for 3 months until one night it randomly stopped working. I looked at a lot of reviews before deciding on this product so i‚Äôm very disappointed it didn‚Äôt last long at all. i checked with other cords and outlets and it indeed is broken. Just spend a little more and buy the apple block these 3rd party ones never seem to work well.
1,Went bad after 2 weeks of use
2,My phone came in and I am using the official usb-c to usb-c cable that came from Samsung and when this is plugged into the wall it makes a high pitched hissing noise. Not sure if I got a dud unit but its concerning/annoying.
1,Bought this for my Samsung. Block stopped working 2 weeks after I bought it. Very disappointed
1,Ordered this for my phone but it arrived and did not work. I tried multiple outlets and my new s22 charging cable worked with my son's USB C charger box.
1,This item stopped working less than 2 months after purchasing.
1,This is not safe!Got really really hot luckily I noticed it when I used the outlet next to it before it melted.  So sick of the lack of quality in a charging block over $10
1,It worked perfect until now and it only had been around 3 months not working no more
1,Not type c
1,I used these chargers for my Samsung tablet. Both failed within a week.
1,Doesn't connect
1,I bought this in June and now in August it no longer works. I have not even been dropped it (bc i keep it in the same place) and its basically trash! Don't buy this if your looking for long or short term use. I really would like my money back.
1,Block worked for 2 days then stopped working something was rattling around in block
1,I bought this block to go with my S21. It failed after about a month so I got a replacement block and returned the failed one. Of course the second block failed just after the return window closed. Buy the Samsung block. You get what you pay for.
1,Had it 2 days and it quit working.  JUNK!!
1,Worked well while it worked would super fast charge on galaxy 21 ultra but charger quit working in less than 6 months with light usage.
1,It doesn't work anymore
1,Already broke and in the garbage.
1,It didn't work. Do not buy!!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This power block didn't even last 1 month and stopped working ordered in spetemeber opened it to travel with for holidays worked for 2 weeks and stopped I hope others have better experience then me
1,Did not work didn't get replacement
1,It charged great when it worked. However after 1 month and 2 weeks it doesn't work anymore.  Of course this happened after the 1 month return window had closed.  My advice - find a different block to purchase.
1,Even though it charges fast it sucks due to the fact that I can't move the charger without it coming out the adapter and I constantly have to push it in I wouldn't recommend
1,Spend the extra money and get a Samsung.  Never worked. Returned it.
1,Wasnt heavily ir even frequently used and it failed within two months.
1,This product is a 0. After a few weeks it will not charge your phone. It‚Äôs junk. Unfortunately It‚Äôs too late for me to return it.
1,Charging power was no different from my regular Samsung charging block.  This charger only lasted 2 weeks then stopped working.  I would not purchase this product
1,THE CABLE I RECEIVED IS NTO A USB TYPE C . CHARGER IS USELESS. TODAY 9/5 RETURN WINDOW CLOSED 9/3.
1,Doesn't charge after being plugged into the wall for more than a minute now. Just shuts off and stops charging.
1,Charging brick may work great but the postal service lost my package with 4 other items so I'll never know.
1,Adapter life is 3 to 4 months
1,I ordered 4 of these they did not work got very hot.
1,Will not charge my A715G. Did I get a defective one?
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It stopped working after 3 months and is making alarming sounds like it might catch fire.
1,Stopped working in a week junk dont waste money
1,Stopped working after a few weeks. Don't waste your money
1,Super slow charging power...wouldn't recommend...
1,This item stopped working after 4 days of use.
1,Died after one day! Won't recommend!
1,Didn't work
5,So glad I finally coughed up the nominal cost of this fast charge block! What a difference it makes to be able to charge my phone at its maximum possible speed! Highly recommend!
5,Got a new phone recently that uses a c type charger instead of a USB I was told c to c is faster so needed this to connect. Works great!
5,Works great. Especially since the new phones do not come with an adapter anymore. This is the one that will work with your new Samsung 21 phone.
5,This charger stays in my over night bag. It's charging power is great!
