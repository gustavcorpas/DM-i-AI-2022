4,Good mic good quality but this mic NEEDS an audio interface with a gain control or it just simply doesn't sound loud enough to use. this will set you back atleast another 100 dollars.if you are just wanting a microphone and have no interface get a usb mic. just as good for cheaper
5,The brackets that hold the elastic bands end up breaking because the weld fails…. Then the mic no longer sits in the middle of the mic holder.  I would get another style that has a better design and that is built more durable.  The sound is pretty good but because the brackets break the microphone looks very unprofessional and low budget.*** update ***Contacted company and they immediately sent out replacement.  I always say things will happen but it’s how you handle it that makes the difference.The new microphone is holding up.  Very quick response from company. No questions asked.
5,This mic rocks makes my radio sound loud  and clear audio  thinking of getting  one more
5,For being an inexpensive microphone it's pretty good just make sure to talk or sing directly into it
4,I'm working on building a home recording "studio" for my own personal projects and found that my normal dynamic mic wasn't cutting it for vocals so I bought this condenser mic to use with my new Scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface.For the price and what all you get this is a steal of a deal! However this mic has no bass frequency or warmth to it. It just sounds a bit on the higher side for me. But it works and sounds good enough for now. I tried hooking up my dynamic mic too but it didn't seem to get the sound I desired.The clamping boom arm stand pop screen  mic cradle and cord were well worth the price.
5,The 360 part is kind of lose could be a little more stable. Overall the microphone is grate I would recommend if on a budget.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!
4,At the time of writing this review this product is $59.99. You get really good value with this product the boom arm is really well built and the microphone feels solid however there are two weak links in the package namely the pop filter and the xlr cable.The pop filter itself is good but the part that connects to the boom arm has a shape that does not lend itself to fastening tightly enough. No matter how much I tighten it it still moves I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it like that.The XLR cable on the other hand is completely dead I had a feeling the cable would be trash and my intuition was right. I tried it in both inputs and the results were the same absolutely no audio whatsoever. It's a good thing I decided to buy a separate XLR cable at the same time I purchased this item.But even with the above issues I still think this is a great value product.
4,Works great and provides plenty of value. Tightening some of the screws feels iffy; they don't hold in place without significant force and so it might break. After many months the only part that's given way is the pop-filter arm base. See photos. The metal tension screw went all through the soft plastic. It still works for its purpose but I need to place it carefully before tightening and it takes the paint off the metal.
4,The mic is good and the setup of it is very easy only proplem I had was with the pop filter it would not stay on the bar when tightening when having a closer inspection I noticed a crack on it most likely when I was tightening it but the fact I had to tighten it to much that it cracked for it to stay is not good quality of the peice
4,Overall I think this is a really good budget package for hobbyists podcasters and streamers. I really only have a couple complaints about it.First regarding the boom arm: it's decently built; it has a nice solid feel and holds its position without cranking down the pinch screws. It is doesn't have quite the range of motion at the base as I expected but it was sufficient for my purposes. It's also on the shorter side so the overall reach is not the greatest. I did not like how freely it rotates; I have mine clamped to my desk and it kept swinging towards my monitor--there is absolutely no resistance to it. A quick wrap of electrical tape solved that problem but it would be nice if it had a set screw in the base or were tighter fitting.The microphone is great! It feels well-made has good sound quality and doesn't pick up lighter background noise. I will say however that it is SUPER-sensitive. Initially I had it going to my interface and then PC. With the gain turned all the way down I still needed to keep it a foot or better away for normal speaking--nevermind singing. It was necessary to add a mixer between the microphone and interface to adjust the levels. Other than that I haven't had any complaints. It certainly doesn't have the sound quality of expensive microphones but it's really good as budget microphones go.
5,This product is A1 is as described and the quality and feel will impress you. At an extremely good price point you get everything you need to start recording comfortably. Easy instructions and setup. Recommend this bundle
3,The mic is alright.. durable for sure. The input signal is too sensitive though even with the input knob being all the way down on the interphase. It's good f you're just using for podcasts or streaming videos but for recording music? Not so much
4,As others have noticed on various reviews the clamp for the swing arm base is kinda useless in the real world...  The swing arm itself is pretty nice and well built.  The mic is well interesting.  I hooked it up to a Bogen MX60-A tube amp that I added phantom power to.  The sound quality is pretty nice when you are inputting at low levels such as speaking quietly.  The one thing I did not like was when you have a more aggressive input such as a musical instrument or singing the mic gets a substantial amount of distortion going on.  It is also highly susceptible to angry aggressive  feedback...  I am unsure if that is a design thing or something common on cheap condenser mics.  My other mic is a SM58 so I don't have a good comparison.  Anyway it works pretty good and would be excellent for podcasting blogging youtube and the like.  I need to get a stand alone power supply for the thing then I will be testing it on other platforms.  If I find something really good or bad at that point I'll update.  UPDATED 1-22-21  I purchased a external phantom power unit for this mic and plugged it in to a more conventional amplifier.  The sound is still what I would describe as grossly overmodulated at all but very quiet levels.  Sounds good at a a Very Quiet spoken level and starts breaking up at normal to loud conversation levels.  All in all I'm just not impressed.
5,Arrived fast and was easy to set up and use.  Integrated easily with my DAW.Cable was a bit wonky and the business end did not fit into my Interface box well but fine into other amp rigs.  I just used another low impedance cable on hand.The mounting and arm are very sturdy. Certainly well made.Overall I am very pleased with this product and would totally recommend.
5,I’m happy with this Tonor mic set. I actually bought two because my wife and I wanted to podcast. I couldn’t beat the price. I’m new to this kind of tech and I usually like to sort out the brand names. This isn’t anything really expensive but it’s perfect for starting off.  I haven’t had any problems yet. The simple design of the boom is classic and robust. The material is typical crap Chinese but okay. I have a yeti caster boom with a blue mic and I’m comparing to that. That set up was 199.99 compared to this tonor set for 64.99.
5,If you are a gamer then this is all you need. The microphone itself is not crystal clear of course don't be expecting to buy this if you are trying to drop a mixtape or you're into singing. I promise it won't sound the best but I can say that so far of using this mic specifically for gaming zoom calls discord and even for youtube this mic is not bad at all you can hear yourself crystal clear. Mine is currently paired up to a UM2 audio interface probably the best sounding thing that I have heard my voice sounds crystal clear even with multiple explosions going off in warzone. Moving away from the mic I can confidently tell you that accessories are probably worth 60 bucks alone. The arm moves and swivels perfectly it's very simple to set up I was done in less than 5 minutes I had no experience whatsoever putting a mic together but let me tell you that it was like putting together legos. The pop filter paired with the foam cover god-like I can blow on the mic on purpose and none of the noise bleeds through to the mic itself it simply won't pick up that noise however as soon as you even whisper it will pick your audio up crystal clear. This mic is a steal at 60 dollars and when this also goes on sale sometimes for 42$ it's an absolute no-brainer buy.
5,I like the microphone. I had to get a phantom power supply for it as I had thought that my radio would supply it. Once I got a good phantom power supply I was able to connect the microphone. The comments are that the sound quality on the other end is good. I am using this with a Heil cable and foot pedal to enable me to use my radio hands-free. I'm really happy with the microphone. The shock mount works well. I did not put the pop filter on but I did put the foam wind screen on. It seems to be working well this way. If I were recording music or a podcast I would likely use the pop filter.I don't like the boom arm as much. It seems to have springs that are much to strong. I can't get it to stay where I want it even though I tighten the knobs. I am not using it as I found a better one. Also the base needs to be such that the base can be mounted with a screw or bolt directly to a surface as the clamping mechanism is rather large and does not fit where I need it to. It does appear to be well constructed. For someone with a different setup it would likely work just fine.I should have ordered the microphone without the boom arm but
4,for a cheap mic I find it to be okay. I am just starting out with my live streaming and this appears to do the job nicely. of course if you can afford a better quality mic I would say don't purchase this one but for the price you can't beat the stand/mount it comes with. you will need a mixer to get it to sound somewhat decent. so far happy with this purchase.
4,This was the first XLR microphone I bought and I was skeptical at first due to the pricing considering it also contains a boom arm pop filter and wind screen but I am super happy with this product. It’s very easy to set up along with the boom arm and sounds great through Discord and game chat. If you are looking for a budget XLR microphone this is the way to go rather than spending possibly 5 times the price compared to a Shure SM7B.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 ProsBoom arm is one of the best boom arms I've used at this price.Really nice cable tiesMic is built quite well for the price and sounds decent.Background noise rejection is actually really good for a condenser.ConsXLR cable barely fit to the combo jack on my audio interface and had to force it to go in all the wayThere is a bit of spring noise from the boom arm when moving aroundMic lacks some low end warmth and sounds a bit muddy from mids.  Nothing some EQ won't fix.Overall I think someone with ability to use a phantom powered condenser and needs an all in one package can use this and later upgrade to a nicer mic.  The boom arm is one that will last you for a very long time and will meet the needs of most users.  If you're buying this and wanting mic you won't need to mess with look elsewhere.  This mic needs some processing to make it sound as good as higher priced condensers but don't let that discourage you if you need a budget option.  The mic sounds decent just not up to par with something like offerings around $100.
5,To start off lets talk about everything included in the box. There is a Boom Arm Pop Filter Windscreen Shock Mount The cable and the Mic itself. The Mic is XLR so you do need a Audio interface or phantom power to get this working I included a picture of the audio interface that I am using right now. It cost $110 at my local MicroCenter. The installation for the Boom Arm was very easy and simple You tighten the desk clamp and the you insert the boom arm into the desk clamp. I included a picture of the desk clamp. There is also a WindScreen and Pop Filter included. This help the prevent harsh noises or sounds on the mic. Hold your hand up to your face and say the letter P you can feel the air when you say that letter and a pop filter or windscreen prevents that air from hitting the mic so it doesn't sound distorted. The shock mount is very useful so when you drop something on your desk the Mic doesn't absorb the impact. Now for the Mic it sounds amazing for the price you are paying It has a Cardioid Pattern to reduce the amount of background noise. Overall If you want a good XLR mic for the price The Tonor TC20 is a great option. I do not regret making this purchase. 10/10 I recommend this product.
4,For the price this is a great starter mic for anyone getting into an audio industry. If you're a casual user that just needs a mic just get a cheap USB mic.The sound quality I get out of this is perfect for what I need it for and my mixer powers this without issue. As stated in the title the boom arm could be slightly better but otherwise a solid purchase for the price.
3,ha sido un dolor de cabeza afirmar el micrófono con el paso de pocos meses ya no aprieta como corresponde
5,...like most im definitely skeptical with these cheap microphone kits because they almost never pass my testing for one reason or another. As you can imagine running a full time tech & gaming channel for streaming and YouTube reviews i get a ton of product in my hands so let me just say this...The Microphone Sound Quality alone on this mic sounds better than most microphones double its price tag....you get a full kit of high quality parts to go with it which the boom arm alone is probably $40 and is made of steel and has a durable nice feel to it....this kit is undervalued in my opinion and is a steal at this price tag...the only downside i found was the shock-mount was hard to fix once tangled and that this setup requires phantom Power. if you already have an xlr microphone or a phantom power source your rocking in your setup your golden....Other than that its a fantastic microphone and its definitely worth more than $60 but dont tell Tonor that...If you would like to watch the full review i did on my YouTube channel with this microphone check it out on my channel "DetroitFury" the video is titled "A full audio Kit for $60? Yikes! - TONOR TC20 Review"
5,This review makes me seem like a bot but I am actually human.  I am just so impressed with the microphone considering that I paid MORE for a worse microphone in the past than I paid for this one that I felt the need to review it.Immaculate audio quality and brilliant for podcasts streams vocal acting and all of the other things I do.  Very sturdy microphone boom that is not too hard to manipulate with one hand.  High quality desk clamp with the boom as well.Pop filter disk is anchored firm and is high quality.  Diameter is good too it's not a tiny cheap one and I like the logo on it.  Microphone surface dampener is a perfect fit and is easy on easy off.Out of the box this microphone is ready to connect to a mix board or a phantom power supply.  Wonderful work by Tonor for making such a beautiful product and making it affordable.  It is not the most impressive mic I have played with but it is much better than what I had.
3,Do not get this if you are attempting to produce music or record music. Bought this in October and it distorted many albums
3,It literally got haunted… it worked super good for the 2 months I had it. All of a sudden I couldn’t sing in stereo anymore and only mono. I was like okay? That’s weird. Then I kept using it for like 2-3 days and played with my friend on fornite. She told me the quality of the mic the way I sounded was super bad. She said it sounded as if I were speaking from inside a box. I was like? Really it was working great until a few days ago. I disconnected all the wires. Mind you this mic is WIRED!! not wireless. It had no wires and I was speaking my friend answered something I said and I completely stayed still and asked her if she could hear me. She said yeah I can hear you clearly and that’s when I was shocked. I was freaking out while she was laughing because this mic was working without a wire and the quality sounded shitty lmao. I right away messaged amazon and was able to return it because when I would mute it with the box that I bought for it it wouldn’t even work. That’s scary! It randomly didn’t mute anymore and to me that’s just straight up haunted. Could be the ghost is a gamer? Lmao but yeah I’m still gonna buy it again though and see if it happens once again.
5,I recently purchased this bundle for recording and i am glad that i did. For one the box it comes in from TONOR is great and everything is well organized in the box. Setup was super simple and in no time i was recording on my computer. I LOVE the boom arm (which is well constructed) and the sound is good. For the price i paid for this you really cannot beat it. I plan on using this setup for some time to come!
5,
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Awesome setup great quality and amazing sound.
5,The microphone is surprisingly heavy with no plastic that I can tell. The boom arm is much heavier and much sturdier than I expected. The microphone is a little bright but I've had no problems meeting the requirements for LibriVox or ACX. Eventually I will upgrade the microphone. But the accessories alone are worth the price.
4,This microphone is not the best but it's fairly priced.Important thing to know is that this mic needs a 48v power (phantom power) to work and if your audio interface don't have this option you have no reason to but it. It'll not work.
5,I'm already on record about the high quality of this arm so there's not much more I can say about that but the microphone is genuinely a fantastic buy.At first glance it looks like a repaint of the Neewer cheap microphone (which I also have) but you hear the difference as soon as you compare them. Same phantom power unit same settings and the other mic is just nowhere near as good. This microphone gives a solid sound and overall is a great buy.I modded mine with a different pop filter due to the fact that I have a cluttered space already (as seen in the photos) but I'd actually say the pop filter that it comes with is better than the previous one they were using so they're actively listening to feedback which is always great to see.I really have no negatives to speak of. Absolute buy.
4,I got this to stream with as a replacement for my headset microphone. I was quite pleased but the higher quality settings above 48hz aren’t used on discord and I’ll assume elsewhere too. It’s great for my stream though delivers high end sound and is very clear.
5,Buy it! Works as advertised! Amazing sound quality for the price!
2,It’s a small setup but I have all the required parts. In my sound shop I cannot hear anything that comes through this mic and it has horrible feedback. Not sure if I had just bought a bad quality mic but my friend who bought a different brand mic for 20 that looks exactly the same sounds way louder does not give any fuzzy feedback and it has podcast quality. If much rather try something else without blowing your money on too many parts. Though it lasted me a year ig.
5,I was cautious about this item because of the very obvious push to get as many youtubers to review it as possible. It is however worth the money. You might be able to find a better XLR used or have a friend hook you up but you also get a pretty decent boom arm. Plugged it into my Scarlett solo and it was ready to go.
4,I had to return this for the USB version as I don't have a phantom power source. The sound quality is very nice. Microphone is pretty sensitive so you'll want some background noise eliminator. The boom arm and shock mount are lower quality shock mount isn't a real shock mount just a clasp with elastic around it. Overall worth it if you need an inexpensive mic upgrade.
5,This mic bundle has amazing value. For 48 dollars you get a boom arm which is usually sold for 40 dollars! You also get a pop filter shock mount windscreen and the microphone. All of that for 48 dollars is unbeatable. The stand is really high quality. The stand was the best part of this bundle. The windscreen and pop filter were pretty basic and didn't impress me as much as the stand did.  Now we get to the microphone. This mic is an xlr mic so it needs to be paired with either a mixer or phantom power supply. I used a phantom power supply and it sounded pretty standard. When paired with something like a Behringer UM2 it may sound better. But for 48 dollars this mic is pretty good. Just remember when you get this mic you will have to spend more than the 48 or 60 dollars.
4,as it was missing a part that connects the shock mount to the boom arm. The second time around the kit was complete. You have to turn the wing nuts really tight to hold the mic in place. Other than that this condenser microphone works great plugged into my Yamaha AG06 interface. It seems to be a good value.
5,I had purchased Tonor's USB mic to do a review for YouTube about quality affordable mics for new streamers and since I was impressed with that one so much I thought I'd pick up this kit as well and see how it compares to my Blue Encore 200 XLR mic. I had to turn down the gain in my GoXlr software initially since my other mic needed a higher gain but other than that I like the sound that comes from this mic. It's pretty smooth has a cardiod pickup pattern so background noise or keyboard clicks aren't heard as easily. I think it's a solid XLR starter mic and at the price you can't beat it. $60 or less for the full kit is insane! Highly recommend for a person new to XLR after moving from a USB mic the quality is a lot better!
4,The stick sits inside this cup like piece and its spins around and doesn’t stay in place which personally I find annoying when I’m sitting down playing my games or trying to record content. Other than it does its job.
4,I cannot say much for the hardware but the Mic and the holder work great.  Good sound with very little background noise.
5,I'm an audio engineer by trade so I'll try not to be too critical but this mic is great for the price! The fact that it comes with as many accessories as it does including the really easy-to-use boom stand should set it apart from other competitors! I needed a new microphone to make Youtube videos and short song covers/demos so this was a great option. There is no "warmth" really to it the frequency response skews higher there is a bump above 10k hz that makes sense given the fact it's probably meant for vocals and that boost adds to intelligibility. I tried recording louder vocals through it however and it did not handle it that well (sounded like it was driving it too hard) so I'm assuming its not really meant for that! Overall would recommend to the everyday consumer or someone who is just starting out with music!
3,Decent equipment except the mic. It's trash
5,I had been struggling with getting two USB mics to consistently work in the same PC for our podcast - without success. Shopping around I found these mics and took a chance based on the reviews; buying two of them plus a Presonus AudioBox USB 96 to interface with my computer. What a difference! Clear vocals. No driver issues. Consistent results. VERY happy with this purchase. The scissor mounts are really nice quality as well. Way better than what I had been using. Big fan of this brand now and plan to buy more.
5,Difficult to install with instructions.  Used youtube.  Was easy after that.
5,As a musician and music teacher this microphone is very nice. I can tell especially when recording instruments that it picks up way more overtones then an average microphone. It picks up every sound in the room very well it makes for an excellent microphone for recording. A USB audio interface is a must with this microphone if you are planning to record. The sound quality is much better with through an audio interface instead of a plain USB microphone. This mic is entirely meant to be a recording microphone or in a room where you want to pick up almost every sound. Not a performance microphone Dynamic microphones are better for performance.Would definitely recommend!
5,Often you get what you pay for. This little setup is worth hundreds more and the sound quality rivals that of $1000 units.
4,good sound
5,At first I felt like the quality wasn't far better that a very high quality usb mic but the rage the mic is capable of before peaking or loosing that quality is where the XLR interface is far better. So very happy that I can get louder and still have clear sound fantastic entry level XLR for my use cases. Not to mention the arm is better than one I had previously for more money than the entire package here.
3,If you want an actually good microphone for this price get a blue yeti nano then you won't have to go set up xlr which takes about 40$ so might as well get a classic blue yeti the sound quality is bad and Isent worth the money compared to other microphones unless you already have a good xlr setup
4,Customer service was awesome!! Emailed promptly i proved the problem was legit and they had me a new mic within days! Side note: while trouble shooting first the rep assured me i ‘wouldnnt take a loss’  and i didnt. Awesome!
5,Good value for beginners needing a mic with a stand. Comes with 2 filters a screen and a pop filter definitely needed by beginners for a better sound. Also comes with velcro strips to wrap around the XLR cable to the stand. Stand was easy to set up and easily adjusted. The mic needs phantom power so you cant just plug it in to whatever. Your connected device must be a mixer or audio interface that provides phantom power. Not all mixer/interfaces provode that. I have a Scarlet Solo which provied the phantom power.
5,My son purchased this and uses daily. Great sound quality and constructed well.
5,I had previously order a mike boom from another manufacturer which was flimsy and arrived missing a key component.  I happen to see this item which was on sale and included what looked like a fairly good mike that was only slightly more than the boom I had previously purchased.  This item works great i.e. it holds the mike firmly and can be maneuvered as desired.  The mike is high quality and is as good if not better than the professional mics I had previously purchased.  I have a podcast and the quality of my podcast has greatly improved with this product.  I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Context: I record vocals and I also work remotely those are my two use cases.This microphone should not be used for recording music. Maybe not even for just simple phone calls.. It's not great and I was using it with a proper recording interface with phantom power too. Extremely quiet and sounds really just bad.HOWEVER: the stand is actually pretty sweet! The pop filter is fine for what it is. This microphone ended up just sitting in the corner of my room and I hooked a real microphone (Shure SM7B) up to the stand that came with this package.The stand is great! Actuates in every way it should is very sturdy. Should work with any XLR mic and even comes with some nice cable ties.But steer clear from the actual microphone itself...
4,Me gustó su construcción se ve de buen material el microfono recomendable me hubiese gustado que el atril tuviera mejor movilidad pero esta bien precio calidad esta muy bien..
5,The TONOR condenser microphone - the TC 20 XLR is a great microphone for beginners. It is easy to use and costs less than 60 US dollars. Do not be fooled by the low price as you will get a very solid sturdy microphone and good sound quality. It makes an excellent entry to podcasting live streaming home recording YouTube recording and vocals. I was really impressed by the audio quality. It is compatible with both Macs and PCs.All the accessories you need are included in the kit such as a boom arm shock mount pop filters XLR cable and more. The TONOR microphone comes with a 2-year warranty from TONOR.
5,This is a great budget microphone.  I use it for work teleconferencing and it has been a great improvement over the built in computer and headset microphones I was using before.I haven’t done any recordings with it so I can’t comment on its performance for singing or recording instruments but it does a great job for speaking.It’s solid and well put together.  The microphone is solid and the boom arm has worked well for me in my setup.  Highly recommend.
5,So I'm an aspiring rap artist/Singer and I also do karaoke. This is definitely one of the best microphones I've owned. I've owned the Exalvan BM-8000 and the Tonor BM-700. These two which are in the picture don't even come close to the T20. And then the Boom arm is probably the most sturdy boom arm I've ever owned I'd pay 50 bucks just for it alone. You guys outdid yourselves. Overall The T20 Is a good-sounding weighted recording beast for the price.
5,So I spent multiple days trying to find a good condenser microphone for song recording and kept coming back to this one. After using it for several months I can safely say this is a high quality mic for the price. The sound is clear and the arm is very well built.
4,nice mic good stand wire sucks but pop filter is solid
5,I got this because I wanted a upgrade from the Snowball I had been using for years. I love this microphone and have been using it almost daily since purchase for both personal and professional use. Great quality for the price and I adore the boom arm for this. You get a bunch of useful stuff with it and it all makes it so much easier to use.
4,*Edited from previous review.I had some initial issues with the mic but it was on the end of my compressor.  Now that that's figured out and settled the mic is performing well and I'd say it's worth a buy.
3,I love the stand shock mount and pop filter. But the microphone itself is just sub par quality equipment. I have already replaced the mic with one of a different model and it's immediately better. I would still recommend this bundle because the price is so low for what you get
4,This mic is a super great quality for the money. For my needs it’s perfect and sounds very professional. Make sure you have Phantom power to use. Only reason I wouldn’t make it a five star is that boom is cumbersome for my space and doesn’t fold away well for storage. Very happy with the product nonetheless!
5,The TONOR TC20 XLR microphone kit is perfect for people who are looking for a low priced microphone kit that has good sound quality. For $60 the buyer gets all the necessary equipment for a microphone set up - including a pop filter and sock (for the microphone) which is awesome.For what it’s priced at the sound quality is excellent. After multiple tests the sound was clean and crisp.However it must be acknowledged that this microphone requires an external power source - phantom power - so the buyer will need a possible third device.
5,I bought this microphone for class as well as gaming and it works perfectly. It took me a bit to find out I was missing a XRL cable for my Phantom Power but after emailing the company I got a response in less than 12 hours. The instructions were very helpful and easy to understand. This product is also of great quality. Most of these good microphone stands can't support the microphone however this one can easily. It doesn't take long to set up either and the sound you get if perfectly high definition.
5,Great microphone condenser this mic is great for those who are just beginning to live stream or record videos it is simple to use and comes with the boom arm that can be placed on the edge of a desk taking only very little space  I love that all I need about sound come in this box I was ready to record in only few minutes!
5,I think after fiddling with some settings it sounds really good. I already had a focusrite solo 3rd gen for the audio interface plugged it in. Just make sure you adjust it for discord/streamlabs
5,💕no problems
5,Look for the price you have to be skeptical. Totally get it. I was too. This bundle did not disappoint though. First and foremost the mic sounds awesome. I run it through a Focusrite Scarlett Solo into Garageband and it sounds crisp and clear--very versatile overall. The kit itself works as advertised as well. The boom is sturdy and grips well and the cord's in good shape. I was able to start recording tracks minutes after unboxing. Good stuff. 10/10 rec
2,I like the quality of the audio in listening off an audio controller. However that arm is very limiting. Should be noted that I tried it for playing guitar and singing so the height variation is important whether sitting or standing on live video feed. In any case there is nothing good about it set it up on a table or other platform because it needs to grip on the table with the base upright. There are no grips on the base to hold the arm so gravity is your only friend in stability. And then once it's mounted the arm can only rotate it does not vary much in reach or height. Not happy with it for the use I wanted to achieve with it.
3,It wasnt for me.  The sound was not good enough.  However could work for someone else.
5,This was one of those "well if it is terrible it was only $X" purchases I tried before going to an AT2020.  I am actually very happy with the whole kit.  I am using it as-delivered (no extra parts etc) into a focusrote 2i2 and it works really well and sounds really good.  I've been using it for a few weeks now with no issues and I like not having a headset boom mic in my face all the time immensely.
5,I highly recommend this microphone. I spent a long time trying to get the best bang for the buck and this was the one. The stand feels like quality the microphone is nice and heavy and the range on this microphone is impressive.  Other notable features are the high-quality xlr cables that come in the box as well as customized zip ties. They really help out with cable management. You really won't regret it.
5,This is the third mic I’ve bought after a string of trying to go the cheap way out I finally learned my lesson this isn’t even that pricey but the quality is well worth choosing it over the other versions! Spend the extra $30 and save yourself the hassle if you are comparing and contrasting go with this one!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very great microphone for the price! $60 for a XLR with very good audio quality! I love Tonor and can’t wait for them to have another XLR release! The only thing I wish is this mic would have had a mute button but other than that you will not regret buying this kit! The boom arm is very sturdy and feels very expensive and so does the weight of the microphone. Would purchase again!
5,Seller is great.  Product lives up to it name.
5,This set up easily and performed well. My tin ear probably can't here the difference in a far more expensive alternative. Sounds and works fine for me.
4,Great kit for a starter!  Good quality.  Looking forward to figuring out why i can only get L channel audio and keep it from sounding like I'm under water.  But seriously solid.
5,This microphone is an absolute STEAL or everything you get and I think it is the best bang for your buck in any microphone I've ever seen. Amazing quality over all and the sound quality is really good as well. My only problem was with the XLR cable which seemed a bit wonky at times but since I had a lot lying around I used one of those and it's been an absolute delight. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
4,Great mic but the clamp for the spit guard broke first time putting it on. I’m writing in for a replacement then will adjust my review accordingly
5,Sound is ok if you set it up right and good for gaming
2,Arm is sturdy enough stays in place but the mic sounds awful. Lucky I have a better microphone to use for projects but I could see the mic this comes with being ok for like discord calls or online gaming.
5,I didn't know about this brand but tried it because of the reviews and pricing. I was surprised to find that this mic exceeded my expectations. I use it to podcast zoom and record songs with a Focusrite interface and Garageband. the volume level is great. The arm stand is heavy duty and works as advertised. Overall good value for the price.
4,Very sturdy solid microphone. Arm movement is smooth setup is VERY easy and the shock mount has a great grip on the microphone. I never once found my microphone slipping out of the mount even when held upside-down.
5,Just got this mic and am experimenting with it hooked up to my vocal processor and DAW. Do far Im really impressed with the sound quality and build. Clean non muddy vocals easy to set up very well packaged with everything you need to get started. Can you buy a better condenser mic? Sure. But not for $60 bucks. This is a great value for the price point.
4,Está muy bien. Me gusta como se escucha.
5,I had to get a mic for remote orchestra and this one was one of the best that would’ve been able to connect to my audio box. I even used it in meetings and got great compliments on my audio quality! Easy setup as well!
5,It's great awesome quality to be completely honest. Needs a lot of setup so be prepared to spend a couple days getting it just right for what you want to do.
5,I have had my Tonor condenser mic for a month plus now - sound and clarity are great.  I know that there are more expensive mics out there but I don't have a reason to spend any more money than I did on this mic.  Comes with a lot of quality accessories.  Packed well.
5,It's not top of the line but you can't beat it for the price. I was worried it might be cheap junk but was pleasantly surprised when I plugged it in and got it all adjusted. Definitely don't regret my purchase!
5,It is great for home recording and all components are solidly built.
4,Pretty solid and decent sound quality.  Only feature I feel is missing is some physical or digital way to block background noise like A/C.
4,All in all decent mic i wish it wouldnt clip last second but in the end its a decent mic
2,This setup has lasted me a little over a year. I love the mic but I realized early on that that knobs would not always hold the boom in the tightened position. It seems I needed to over tighten it just to get it to work. Today it broke off when I tightened it. I am so disappointed. Such cheap equipment for a great mic. I really hate to not recommend this but I have to be honest.
5,Definitely crisper sound high quality; use it for live streaming podcasting and ZOOM sessions karaoke and voice over for presentations. I connect my XLR microphone to the M-Audio M-Track Solo USB Audio Interface to my Mac Mini M1... and it's been great.
5,I was using an m57 and 58 for vocals but this really is much better. sound quality it great. I use the boom on my desk for trials vocals then I'll move the mic to my stand in my dampened quiet room. excellent results.
5,Great budget mic. Depth of sound captured in bass range seems a bit subpar. Good for vocals and web casting.Arm Mount is a nice addition it is good value.Velcro cable straps big plus.
4,It was easy to set up.
5,It does what I need it to do. I can use my demos
5,I really like the arm that comes with this bundle. Mic is okay.
5,For the price you pay the mic sounds really good. It isn’t the best sound quality but it’s one of the best for the price range.
4,Only giving it 4 stars because haven't used it yet but looks great good quality
5,If you care about good quality sound and saving money on a mic arm pop filter's etc then this is the mic for you. It comes with everything you need for good quality sound except an audio interface which is needed for phantom power. Would recommend.
4,Assembly and setup are relatively simple and straight forward.
5,Awesome sounds quality it picks up every noise in my house if I don't shut the door to the music room and my vocals come through clean and clear.
5,The microphone is good for the price
4,Awesome Mic great quality and price.
5,My wife needed a good mic for her podcast. So we got two. These are great mics for the price. Very well built.
4,Value for money
5,The set up is easy and the mic and arm works great. I have used it several times since it’s purchase without issue. This is a product I would buy again.
5,I purchased this mic for audio recordings for voice acting and it has far surpassed my expectations. The price can't be beat for the quality product I received.
2,Ok so first things first DIDNT EVEN COME WITH THE BOOM ARM!! I dont understand how it's so easy to forget something that big but there wasnt a boom arm desk clamp or windscreen. Just the microphone shockmount and the cable. So instead of completely giving up on it I tried the mic out. Not going to lie the mic is pretty good captures goodsound overall but the fact that this didnt come with the boom arm is why I'm giving this a low review.
5,I like the look  I like the box it comes in you can use it as a carrying case for travel...
5,Great value for the price. Individual items would cost much more. Mike sound quality isn’t great but it gets the job done.
5,Awesome recording sound. Very crispy and clear.
5,I don't use it everyday but it's working for what i need that is to record at home
5,For this product to be so affordable the quality is definitely there. I love it and would highly recommend to artist on a budget.
5,It works really well i forgot I needed a mixer for it though so yeah should definitely note that it needs a mixer for it to work on your pc. Other than that I like it
5,Haven't started using the mic yet but I love the kit and i'm excited to use it after checking out some reviews!
5,Excelente value for the money. Clear sound no feels cheap at all. Highly recommended for streaming.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very fast shipping! Easy setup! Great sound quality! Great price! Overall very happy with this purchase
2,The stand is good the accessories are good. The mic cable is terrible. I bought a ligget mic cable and still barely registers thru my daw. Ended up buying a Shure SM58 which solved my digital issue kinda a noob at mics the tonner is a compression mic probably better for drums I’d guess. I needed a dynamic mic. For recording vocals and live instruments.
5,Great bang for your buck in your home studio! Looking forward in using this exclusively for my next acoustic release.
5,These bad boys are powerful. I bought 3 with Behringer umc404hd for podcast.
5,Works great clean sound.
5,Great sounding condenser microphone! The price was awesome for the quality of the material. Works great easy setup!
2,The first week it was great.  The sound quality was clear there were no issues.  Then after a few weeks it started to get this high pitch rasp to the sound.  It was slight at first but eventually became very noticeable.  The past week it just has quit working.  I have to unplug and plug it back in several times for it to register the mic.  Today it has completely quit working.  My advice save your money and buy something name brand where the quality is assured.  This just lasted a few months so really not worth it.
5,Works great for my son's streaming good sound quality
5,nice quality and good product. the sound of the mic is amazing for the price and so easy to install
5,for the money you can't go wrong with this mic setup.A+
5,Purchased this for my son.  He is very happy with the quality of the microphone.Good value for the price.
5,Easy to put together  connect and get to work.  I like the spring loaded arm.  This was inexpensive with a lot of perks.
5,I’m no engineer but this microphone works on phantom power so you either need a mixer with phantom power capabilities or an audio interface.
5,Love the sound and worked perfectly with Rodecaster Pro!
5,i love everything about this! it works and sounds great.
5,The people working there are very helpful and they easily and quickly solved my problems. Just great!
5,Excellent company I will buy again from this company excellent support.
5,Does everything I need!  Paid for itself in one session.
5,One of the best products I never had and the quality it's amazing I'll recommend it
5,Got these for my grandkiddos and they Love them!!
5,Excellent item easy set up and user friendly.
5,Easy to used
5,Very Good Quality XLR mic Pop Filter works like it’s supposed to definitely great for the studio
5,It's a great bang for the buck. For those on a budget that want something solid without breaking the bank.
5,Can't beat it for the price and quality its a good investment!
5,Great quality and alot of stuff for the amount of money very happy with this and the quality is great
5,Looks even better in person! The person it was gifted to loves it.
5,Mic quality is good and the stand is very robust. Very well designed kit and good for starters.
5,Good quality. Good valle. on time.
5,This is such a high-quality microphone for only $60
5,This mic is awesome.  Get it.
5,Thank you it is great mic
5,Used for a music video. Came out great! Getting those views!
5,Great microphone clear sound everything is good quality. Thank you.
1,This stand is what you pay for i guess. All the accessories are cool but I spent about an hour getting the arm's post in to the base with the use of a dremel. The elbow tightener doesn't work either. I wonder who had the brilliant idea to slap on a screw tightener to hold against this fairly nice (and strong) spring system.The microphone works decent enough but I would've been better off just buying these parts separately.I'm pretty disappointed and I probably can't return it because I "improperly installed" a poorly manufactured product. For 40 bucks though might be worth rolling the dice.
5,Great for starting out!
3,Even changing the settings it is not zoom recording compatible.Sound is great for recording directly into audacity or ableton.
3,I’m using the mic but very dissatisfied. I’ve never been able to get acceptable volume except by cranking up a lot of gain in OBS.
5,Love my new mic
5,I love it the packaging is amazing for the price also
5,Great sound!!
5,Great product
5,Sounds 👍
5,Good quality
5,Worth the money
5,Good construction and good sound
3,its good and all but the cable connection became bad after a month
2,First the good the mic arm is great quality and not flimsy like most of other ones you see on here now onto the mic...sure you get what you pay for but its bad it vibrates when you talk into it and works some of the time. Feels like it would be a good product but its just not reliable for me
5,It's really good!
5,Great quality microphone for affordable price
5,Works perfectly exactly how I expected
5,Great for price. Comfy
5,This mic is perfect for podcasting! Insane value! 5 Stars.
5,Works great!
3,Shock mouth broke but the mic is a 10 10 worth it
5,this mic is great for the money
1,I’m leaving a bad rating because the microphone stopped working ten days after delivery and it’s not the first microphone that’s done this.The first one I got stopped working 14 days after delivery so I thought maybe I was just unlucky with a faulty product so I got a replacement and it did the same thing so I’ve come to the conclusion that the tonor tc20 microphone stops working after a 2 week period or maybe I just got unlucky 2 times in a row but I will not be purchasing another because of these results. The meaning you get what you pay for really applied itself here.
5,best mic for the price
5,works good
5,Awesome
1,I rarely give out bad reviews but this order has just been disappointing. When it first came in it was really nice then it stopped recording the audio. I asked for a replacement received it and was very very disappointed. The box that was sent to me was an opened/returned box. Saw immediately that the desk clamp was missing. Went to request for a exchange again but the only option I had was to get a refund and return the item. Removed the first layer of foam to see if anything else was missing just to find out that the xlr cord was missing as well. Very very disappointing.
1,The boom arm broke in less than a week. I'm severely disappointed in the quality of construction materials.  I tried to move the arm for repositioning and it broke and fell off the stand.
2,i couldnt get it to work on my mac even with an xlr box. i havent been able to use it for months now and am still looking for a solution.
1,Best of luck if you can actually record with it.  You'll end up having to buy recording software to match it so it actually works for recording any voice audio.  tried different apps and programs of many as suggested to get the audio files to work but they just dont.  If you wanna sit on screen as an online gamer thats all youll get from this
2,It peaks easy distorts and has terrible pickup. I didn't 1 star because I don't like to.
1,I have a $2500 Pioneer DJ XDJ XZ Mixer and this junk mic does not work.  I later found out most DJ equipment uses DYNAMIC Mic and this piece of junk use PHANTOM POWER mic.  Back to Amazon you go.  DO NOT buy this if you're planning to use as a DJ mic for streaming.
1,i wanted to be soundcloud rapper. but the sound quality of this was so bad no one listened. it has nothing to do with my voice.
1,Came in a plastic bag with scratches and no manual like if it was used disappointing would not recommend
2,This never worked. Waste of money
1,Product worked for a day and now it feeds a very high annoying pitch sound.It sucks because I had to leave it in a very remote location for a radio station. Ifeel ripped for a.peofuct that does not meet expectatives 🧐
1,it says on the site that there is supposed to be a microphone with this but mine came without a microphone but still in the box there was a space for the microphone
1,Sending it back and requesting one where the mic stand isn't already broke. It never fails!  I'm getting sick of Amazon stuff!!
1,Everything was fine the arm is sturdy. My mic doesn't work at all very disappointed
1,Is bad because when I open it and I conect it and it did not work I do not recommend is trash
1,Not so great - should let people know a power source is needed- downloading software was a pain.
1,Quality sucks if you are using for professional recording services.  But for karaoke night ...maybe...
1,Cord came with a shortage had to tape it
1,Microphone does not function at all
1,Microphone does not work
5,I got this product last year and the sound quality is good and the material is very nice. I love it so much!
5,If you've been shopping around for microphones whether were talking microphones that use the XLR connection similar to this one or the incredible deluge of USB based microphones that is hit us since everybody headed home for work you might be confused as to how you can possibly know if something is decent quality. Particularly if you want to keep your budget relatively low say between $30 and $75 for a complete microphone system with a boom arm and connections. There's got to be dozens and dozens or even hundreds to pick from now in this price range. Most of them are USB but even then I would say it's hard to decide.As somebody who already had multiple USB microphones prior to the beginning of the pandemic I'm one of those guys who has cycled through probably six different on desk microphones searching for the best system I can for the way I work today in videoconferences and recorded messages.Suffice it to say for about four months now this microphone has stayed put at my desk. The photos in this review are of the microphone after at least four months of consistent use. Here's what I like:– Overall quality of every single component is top-notch in my opinion. I'm not the type a guy that's in the market for microphones costing hundreds of dollars so I'm not going to say it's equal to some of the premium brands but I am going to say it's value exceeds without question it's retail cost.– The boom arm is excellent and the base attachment is easily twice as good as almost any other complete system I've seen anywhere close to this price.– The shock mount stays put even after lots of use and moving the boom arm around on a daily basis after several months.– The XLR connection and cable that it comes with are quality as well no complaints at all.– While I have not totally disassembled it I can tell you that the size of the condenser is extremely large and picks up an awful lot of the nuance in the human male voice. I sound better on this microphone than any other I have. Granted I have shared this with an alto professional mixing board that provides the microphone phantom power and gives me some wonderful adjustments. After very little tweaking I am able to produce better sound from this microphone then the only other microphone I have truly been impressed with and that's the FIFINE K670. After spending a little bit of time playing with this microphone and my alto soundboard never going back to USB!You have a lot to pick from and I think personally considering what you're getting this is a tremendous value. Please note this is not a USB microphone and you have to provide phantom power and soundboard control if that's important to you. Obviously there's lots of USB microphones some of them quite good for the same price more or less in the kit that is similar. But if you want true flexibility and control spend a little bit of money and get yourself a sound mixer with phantom power some quality cables and you will be in control of all the details.The sound quality is rich and powerful obviously stemming from a very large diaphragm condenser with cardioid pattern pickup. My office my home office where this is used is about 12 feet wide by 16 feet deep. While I sound best within 4 to 12 inches of the microphone I can stand up and move around and people can hear me pretty good. It's not quite the same as a true omnidirectional microphone but this is one sensitive and excellent microphone.Add this to your shopping list as you compare and I'm confident this will be in your final list of choices.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I say home recording setup to avoid using the word studio because i have a primitive set up I am still proud of it though and due to my years with doing home based music i have been through many different microphones therefore making my opinion of affordable mics somewhat educated.Right away upon unboxing this i felt like i was dealing with a quality product. The packaging was super tight with a thick foam that had each piece super secure. The microphone itself was double wrapped in an additional thin foam like material. I had the whole contraption put together and clamped to a desk within five minutes or less.I like the clamp on this and i can't stress that enough. The clamp has a thin metal bar with two balls at the end for easy securing and tightening. I have owned many clamp mechanisms that were for a boom extension like this or for a circular condenser thing that just had a plastic or metal/plastic small single handheld turn thing that made securing the clamp very hard. With this thin metal rod with two balls at the end i can fully secure it to the desk without having to use a hand tool to do the final turns.The rotating mechanism rotated smoothly and stays put where you push it to when not using it directly.I like how there is an additional circular guard that can clamp right onto the metal of the arm of the mechanism. There is a foam protector on the mic itself but i like how this was thrown in.The phantom power only need 48v which is a common supply for interfaces that accept phantom mics. I hooked it up to the now vintage Roland sp555 from ten years ago and had no problem powering up the microphone.The microphone itself is very sensitive which is good and will allow me to capture woodwind recordings. I recorded not only saxophone but clarinet successfully with minimal effects pedals accompanying the sound output.I also experimented with vocal samples both with effects as well as clean and the results were great.I like how in two places on the arm there are springs for further adjustments. In the ares where the springs are there is a plastic hand turn adjuster that loosens for you to stretch the springs to your preference. Then you tighten it again when you have opened the arm for the springs to stretch.I like everything about this mechanism and feel it gives a professional look to the home studio.In conclusion i am excited about this microphone as well as the arm mechanism. I recommend this with enthusiasm for all serious home musicians.
5,I am extremely impressed by this package and subsequently the brand Toner. I will say that I am not a professional and my experience with microphones is limited to a couple of Shure mics I used in a band a long time ago.With that said I’ve recently been interested in recording again this time with a PC instead of a digital 4-track. I found this TC20 XLR condenser mic from Toner and knowing that I wanted something with a bit more “oomph” than a simple USB connection could provide it seemed to be exactly what I wanted. After grabbing a phantom power supply (make sure it’s at least 48V) I was good to go. You must provide a power source for this microphone and once you use it you’ll be glad you didn’t settle for a USB powered mic instead.The entire package here is an amazing value for what you are getting. The mic sounds excellent in my opinion has a nice heft to it and has a great range. Remember since this is a condenser mic it is best used to pick up any & all sound around you – perfect for podcasting playing an acoustic instrument while singing etc. The pop filter steel boom clamp and shock mount are all high quality; much better than I expected at this price point. Even the XLR cable is high-quality. The stand allows for 360-degree rotation easily while the boom’s various wingnuts provide a snug fit to keep everything from slipping.I really cannot express how satisfied I am with the quality and sound of this package at this price. If you are interested in this kind of thing and want something inexpensive yet well-made this is it. Just make sure to grab a 48V power supply to go with it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I wanted to try out a mic that is not connected to my headset to see if it was higher quality. This mic has been a nice upgrade over my headset mics I really like it. You just need to remember to buy a phantom power device to go with this such as an audio controller or mixer. This cannot connect to a computer without buying that extra part.Quality: This is made of very high quality materials. The arm is all metal the mic is heavy and feels like it is worth much more than the asking price. The desk clamp is very solid and has a headset holder on it. The XLR cable is solid. They even include a wind muff and pop filter so people do not hear you breathe on the mic it softens things you dont want to be heard like that. Overall this feels very professional.Does it work well? Yes this works great! I use it for discord when speaking with friends streaming on twitch and also just for gaming to do voice chat. In all those cases it has performed better than my traditional headset.You will have to buy an audio controller or mixer. I got an audio controller by Focusrite and it works great with the mic. You can be heard loudly even if the mic is behind you above you it works in many different positions very versatile. The headset holder on the clamp is also a nice touch to keep your headset safe. This kind of mic allows you to use studio headsets and other setups that may be more comfortable such as earbuds it is nice to be free of a heavy headset I highly recommend this to people that need a mic for podcasts streaming gaming.
5,This tonor microphone blew me away by how much it was able to produce such a clean crisp sound. I would most definitely buy again but only once I'm able to get the proper gear needed to support the driver I need to use this microphone.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Having this being my first XLR microphone I am absolutely thrilled how well everything in the kit is. The microphone is great and I recommend you watch the video I posted to get an idea of how it stacks to other options I had available spoiler it was an improvement by far. This kit has nearly everything you need you only need a way to transfer XLR to your computer with an audio interface photoed is my Scarlett Solo with the included XLR cable that was used in the setup this is noteworthy due to the high price point of these units as it now rivals microphones double this kits price just keep that in mind.The packaging is superb the XLR cord is adequate and definitely long enough for most setups. The cord wraps well with the velcro ties to the microphone arm. Please ensure you give some slack to the cord on the pivoting points to prevent damage. The stand is also great it isn't a cheap $20 stand you may find I no longer have to worry about it creaking or falling over with the larger base.The screens for the microphone are good but I may not use both at a single instance as it may result in it sounding muffled compared to just the one screen of either pick. Again this may just be my preference but it is nice to have both options.Overall this has been a great addition and replacement for my desktop setup. I think this will be my recommendation for anyone who wants to start XLR without needing to break the bank.
3,Full disclaimer I am not an audiophile. I'm not trying to record vocals I do not have a podcast. I'm just a guy who needed a decent mic to game with friends.Overall this is a great mic setup. Just look at everything you get. And the individual components are great quality. This looks and feels very professional. But unfortunately in my case this just isn't the mic for me.The problem is it comes with all the headaches of more professional equipment but none of the benefits.First off the pictures do clearly show that you also need a power source for this mic which adds an extra ~$24 or so (for a cheap 48v) to the total  price. But we know all that plenty of customers especially people like parents buying Christmas or birthday gifts for their kids  are going to miss that fact and be completely lost. Yes that is the customers' responsibility to know what they are buying but how many people browsing this budget setup are familiar with studio equipment?  So in general I'm not a fan of beginner kits that expect intermediate knowledge.Second set up was a fairly frustrating process. The kit is easy enough to put together but getting it linked to the power supply and than your PC is a far less intuitive process. I also was not a fan of all the extra cables boxes and used desk space. This is not a "clean" setup for a smaller space.Finally after I got everything working I tested the sound quality and it was no better than the mic I already had already been using. I though for sure the XLR cable would mean an improvement in the quality but I didn't notice it.So for all the extra effort and added expense I would up with something no better and a lot messier than I already had with a simple USB condenser mic.I guess check the other reviews for more informed opinions because I might not know enough to be able to tell that this is a better mic which it might be.But given the choice I'm going to be sticking with the Aokeo AK-60 --https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0875T3D9R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1.Same quality (as far as I know) lower price MUCH easier set up.
4,The boom arm and pop filter alone make this deal worth it!  I have a separate boom arm that cost the same as the bundle deal.  The fact that you get a decent mic makes this purchase even sweeter.Plus- great for podcasting or streaming- comes with much needed accessories including mic mic cable mic cover boom arm stand pop filter- sleek color and style- extremely inexpensive and well worth the price pointCons- not the best for vocal recording compared to other mics i've used mainly because of the emphasis on the high end  frequencies although that can be adjusted through simple EQOverall - I'd recommend this if you're a gamer streamer podcaster or even a singer/song writer just learning
5,I gave my favorite condenser microphone to a budding young (and poor) teenage musician and have been looking for a suitable (and reasonable) replacement for a while. This one is that... or at least really close.I hooked this up to my MacBook Pro using a 48V phantom power box that I just got from Amazon (Moukey - under twenty bucks and excellent) and an XLR-->mini cable plugged into an inexpensive audio A/D converter (also Amazon about six bucks). Set-up worked great.I haven't really put it through its paces for guitar and singing vocals yet (just a quick test) but for speaking it works great. It exhibits no hyper-sensitivity or "peakiness"/overstauration like the first few I tried did. Vocals seem smooth and well-controlled.I wish I were more of a musician and could give you a review in that regard but I'm fairly confident it will excel. I would have easily believed that the microphone alone was worth the price. The fact that it comes with the articulated stand (one that was better than the one I had before that cost half as much as this whole kit) makes this a great value for a very good quality product.
5,He had an older mic and boom arm set up but it was severely lacking in what he was needing currently.I can speak to delivery being on time and packaging. It came nicely bundled in a heavy duty box and very secure inside a foam cushioned box.So his review of the actual product is as follows...It's a very good looking mic set and very sturdy. The boom arm is steel easy to move and has a large desk clamp to hold it securely to the top. The pop filter has a large surface area and really cuts down on the "p & b" plosive sounds and helps eliminate background noises. It has a removable mic cover and cable ties.  It also comes with a metal shock mount to help eliminate unwanted noise transmitted from his keyboard or mouse actions. He did remind me that it does not come with an external power source. You'll need to connect the mic set up to a phantom power source. He said it looks great and is very happy with his new mic set up. All in all a fantastic microphone kit!
5,Good quality tested it and it was very nice
5,I don't have a ton of experience with microphones on the whole. I needed to make a series of professional recordings. I got the condenser and then thought I still had to get a microphone this one was less expensive than others but more professional than what I had.  I don't have a sound booth I have a walk in closet full of cushions and pillows. But with this microphone I was able to make the quality recordings that I needed. It was easy to use. Simple to set up and for my purposes this has exceeded my expectations.I am very pleased with it.
4,This studio microphone kit provides a good set for home studio recording for blogs or other types of recording.  It is a nice set to get you started.  My son was interested in getting into audiobook recording and this was a good starter kit for him.
5,Like every single other person out there right now I decided I wanted to start a podcast. I have a USB mic but decided I didn't like the recording quality enough and wanted to try an XLR. I don't have much experience with XLR mics so this review is from the perspective of a complete newbie. First off the price on this mic was right. Even with buying an audio interface it's cheaper than a lot of the options out there. Opening the box I was surprised at the quality of the build. The boom is beefy and the clamp is super sturdy. I did a few recordings to note the differences in sound quality between my USB and this mic. Absolutely no competition. The sound is crisp and clear no popping. I had intended to use this as a trial mic but I actually just convinced my perspective co-host to pick one up as well. Can't wait to put it to use!
4,This mic is easy to put together and comes with all the parts you need for the microphone. It has a good stand you just need to make sure you have a thinner table since that is what it clamps on to. This mic makes your voice very crisp and clear. It moves around very easily extends and can be changed to many different lengths
5,Here is my take on Tonor's XLR condenser mic.✅The good✅- The bundle is incredible. Getting a shock mount the boom arm and mic together is a Christmas gift.-The Audio quality is great for the price and I would say it's even better than what price reflects.-Build quality is great. Unless you are doing crazy things around the house the mic should last you quite a while.⚠️The bad⚠️-It needs an external power source. Now this is not bad in fact it means the mic is good but I knew you would read this section so I have to tell you something. DONT GET A PHANTOM POWER DEVICE. Toner says it's fine but trust me the only way you will get quality sound out of ANY mic is with an audio interface with a built-in power source. You welcome
4,Overall for $60 its a great value mic sounds good heavy duty boom arm. Only negative is it DOES require a power supply. which can run $25 for cheap one.
5,Finally found my lost Focusrite Scarlett device. You will need to buy a sound device like this (red box) shown in my image for it to work. This provides phantom power to the mic and connects to computer. This is my second mic from this company and I think they have just taken this to another level. A lot better sound quality and design as well. The boom arm is sleek with a bigger base clamp that can fit almost any desk out there. This mic is just the perfect size for me and most of all the experience is amazing. I use it for live streaming but really got it for my podcast that will start soon. Great product and accessories. No complaints.
5,So far I’m loving the microphone. It got here less than a day! I’m absolutely amazed how fast it got here. I ordered it on the actual website instead of Amazon and FREE shipping!
5,I have a 6 channel mic mixer with one analog mic already so I wanted a second to use as a backup mic or for a second person.  This mic works just fine.  It’s not a Sennheiser or a Shure but it’s good enough for my needs.  The mic arm is sturdy and well balanced and the shock mount is effective.  Keep in mind you will need a separate USB interface if you want to connect it directly to a computer; but for an analog setup this mic is a great general purpose device.
5,This a good budget XLR mic kit.Keep in mind you have to have an audio interface to use this.  You can't just plug this into your computer via USB so look elsewhere if that's what you're looking for.I'm using this with the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and it works great.For the price it's a great option for someone who's just starting out in podcast or streaming.The sound is nice and clear.It comes with everything except an audio interface to get you up and running which is great.For the price I really can't find anything to complain about.
5,For the price this is actually above and beyond. The bar to hold the mic is sturdy surprisingly. The mic itself does a pretty good job picking up sound only it sounds a little less warm/full than I'm used to. Some of that is all about having a mixing panel to get the sound you want.The look of this is standard/professional and the functionality of the overall set is pretty perfect. For the price I don't think there is a better deal I feel that without question.
1,Bought this mic to use for our YouTube channel using the Ecamm software. As soon as we went online our viewers said "the sound is terrible"  cannot hear you. So we had to switch right in the middle of the show and go back to our Apple mic that was built into the computer. The viewer said the sound is much better. We were looking for a mic with better quality than our Apple built-in mic and we ended up getting a worst sound. DO NOT BUY this mic it will NOT improve your sound.  Now we have to return the product and start all over. Just a waste of time and money $$$$$$$.
5,I like that this kit has it all. A condenser microphone boom arm shock mount and pop filter. Sounds like a pro at home or on the go. OZ
5,Esta funcionando muy bien por ahora no tengo nungun problema tecnico con el. Esta excelente el material es genial y se ve profesional! El sonido es el mejor que he escuchado! Super profesional!
5,This is an amazing microphone set and I can't wait to start using it have to get a power adapter but it will definitely be worth it!
2,The boom arm broke within 5 minutes and chipped a very expensive studio desk as it crashed to the ground. The company offered me an apology and thanked me for providing them pictures and info of the damages as they will help improve their product.Yo Tonor glad I could use my $3500 studio desk as a way for you to beta test your $60 disposable mic kit.I wouldn't buy one. Its not a quality product and these people won't stand behind it. Save your money and buy a real mic.I wonder if they still want that video?
5,I just want to start this off by saying that you WILL need phantom power or some sort of audio interface/mixer. Thankfully I already had one in the Scarlett Solo which gets the job done! With that said this microphone is good! I already own a Samson Q2U which is a little bit more in price but not by much. This TONOR mic puts out a very crisp sound with no feedback! Keep in mind this probably has a lot to do with it being an XLR mic and NOT a USB mic! However in testing I did notice one thing that I didn't like but could just be personal preference and that was the missing lows. I know this can be adjusted on a mixer or in software but the mic itself felt hard to control trying to get that lower sound to it. This could be due to the fact that it is a condenser mic and not a dynamic if I had to guess. Other than that however I have no complaints! The build quality feels solid and the arm it comes with is SOLID! I was quite impressed by how much you can get for the $60 price tag! 100% worth it if you are just starting out and need something to get set up and running! Hope this helps!
5,I picked up this kit (TC20) and a Focusrite Scarlett Solo Audio interface.The Mic Kit comes with everything you'll need to get started with recordingstreamingvoice over you name it!The only extra that you need to purchase is a separate audio interface with 48V phantom power so if you're looking for something that's USB plug and play I believe TONOR has another couple mic kits for that.Setup is super easy and with the scarlett solo the only thing I had to do after plugging everything in was a quick driver setup then a couple click in my sound control panel to change the signal from mono to stereo (sound would only record to the left channel without doing this)This kit comes with all accessories that you'll need including their amazing T20 Boom arm which is the best I've used. Well worth it!If you're looking for a budget XLR setup look no further!
5,Just started a podcast. (Check us out TheraTea Podcast ) Our first episode has over 200 downloads and many of our feedback is how great our voices sound love the mics but it’s annoying to adjust properly because of the springs on the arm. But overall veryyyy happy with this purchase.
5,Great audio quality it gets more detailed sound that you can imagine. Solid high quality materials great base arm just perfect.
5,Sounds great for the price and is a good addition to a streamer/video producer's studio if you're on a tight budget.
5,the sound is great for your podcast/streaming needs and it wont cost a lot of money to get you setup!
2,Our table corners are inclined and it does not work for us. I think holder part is made unprofessionally
5,Very good and professional option for recording audio
5,Incredible quality! It's sounds very good!It brings a big box with all parts secured and organized. Good color and materials.Excellent price/quality ratio
5,Crisp clear sound at a great price
5,Great product if you want to get into streaming or music. PLEASE BE AWARE YOU NEED AN AUDIO INTERFACE SO THE PRODUCT WILL WORK.
5,The bundle was excellently packaged and was exactly what I expected. The audio quality is impeccable. However the xlr cable is shorter than I would have wanted but it was still functional.
5,The material feels like high end and it is perfect for home studio with good quality of mic
5,Works well for me
5,I bought two different condenser mic setups one from Tonor and one from Uhuru. They were both the same price so I figured I’d do a comparison since I needed two mics for my podcast.I’ve used the Tonor many times so far for streaming and gaming and I am impressed with the quality of sound I get out of the mic it’s crystal clear and seems to have a nice range.The stand is also of good quality. All the pivot points on the Tonor stand move smoothly and lock tight where as the Uhuru stand feels stiff and less maneuverable which may be a slight inconvenience in the future. So I’d definitely buy another Tonor in the future. 5 stars
5,Super clear sound i love how you adjust the rail so easy to use
5,I'm giving this a solid 5 stars for the amount of quality sound and workmanship you get at such a very low price. Even the packaging of this kit was top notch. I was surprised with the sound unprocessed sound quality as I have not purchased a mixer yet. Great value.
5,super good
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Toner mic came dented
5,I still can't believe that I got all this Quality for such a low price. Buy this now.
1,The mic doesn't work
5,Good..But the arm hold the microphe is no good quality
5,For the price I was genuinely surprised for the amount of stuff that was included. Even stuff like Pop filters I didn't think I'd need but it's nice that it's included.
4,Microphone has a solid build. 👌 I enjoy the flexibility of the arm so I can place where ever I am. The sound quality is far better than the webcam Microphone but not exactly studio quality. For the price this microphone is a top performer.
4,A lot of functional equipment for the price. Sturdy good quality built. Everything you need for the beginner. I use this mic in conjunction with others to record great voice and guitar parts.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me gusta cantar y escucharme con calidad es bastante bueno el Micrófono Condensador de la marca Tonor.Resuelve muy bien para transmitir en Vivo por las redes sociales o hacer Podcasting.
5,This is my first condenser microphone and I gotta say this sounds great. My wife has a more expensive Audio-Technica condenser microphone and you can hardly tell the difference.
5,Very good
4,Edit Toner company never responded so I returned it Amazon sent out new one. :-) ...Little noisy on high gain however can't beat this Mike at that price.I liked it so much I bought a second one. However pieces were missing. Amazon said they couldn't do anything about it to call the manufacturer. Sent them an email no response as of yet only been two days. However if they don't respond soon I will send it back for a replacement. That being said it was an awesome microphone
5,Love the sound quality and the look. I just wish the boom had a better range of motion
5,I love the convenience of it.
5,No creo que haya algo que se le acerque por el precio a lo mejor se le puede sacar mejor provecho con una buena consola o interfaz de audio  ya que la mía no tiene buenos preamplificadores al parecer. en youtube hay una review muy buena sobre el donde se comparan con un sm57
5,Nice Work Thanks!
5,I can’t really give an accurate review this was a gift to my grandson and he hasn’t said how he liked it. He didn’t complain about it.
1,It first came I loved the mic. The look the sound I couldn't stop myself from using it. I have now had it for 24 hours and the microphone is already not working. I use FL20 to record and I was receiving a latened moniter so I unplugged and replugged in my audio interface and now the mic is not giving any input to the interface. I've made sure that it's not my cable it's not my interface and it's not my computer because it works with my old mic. Enjoyed the product while it lasted just didn't enjoy how long it lasted.
4,Thought this was a complete set where I could use it on my pc. It was not so im returning.
3,The package is pretty solid looking and feeling. The mic feels like it is good quality as does the stand. The cord functions but feels a bit cheap works ok but is a little tight for some devices. I like the cable ties too. As good as it looks and feels the sound quality is just not there. If you are using it for zoom meetings it is fine but sounds pretty tinny particularly if using for music recording. I am not sure if I will return the package or keep it for the sake of the accessories I got it at about 30 percent off. I won't be using the mic for sure. The other stuff is ok-pretty good quality.
5,Performs like mics costing much more. Great input and integration with my M-Audio interface. All accessories are as advertised. The complete package is a great value for any level.
5,What's not to like when it's priced better than the rest and makes you sound like a pro. Very solid device and has all you need to get started minus the phantom power supply (normal for these types of Microphones). Very nice look and feel with absolute impressive capture. Makes your voice sound perfect and no popping with the filter. Includes cable too. Terrific buy overall and recommended for sure. Nice addition for your studio.
5,I would highly recommend this if your looking for a recording setup but don’t want to spend a lot but for the price what you get and the quality is amazing.
4,Pretty high quality for price
5,cumple con todo lo que garantiza  traer  resistente ligero y sin complicaciones a la hora de usar  de buena calidad
5,Pretty dam good.
5,Very sturdy Much more solid then all the others I have tried. The lesser units last my son about 3 to 5 months this one has gone past a year and is still in great shape.
5,Muy practico y buen producto.
4,Hi everyone. The quality of the product upon arrival is respectable. The only reason I’m giving this a four star rating is due to the fact that the foam for the microphone is missing from the package. Why was it missing? Please send me the foam for the mic. It picks up a lot of static sound without it.
5,Easy to assemble and set up. Affordable and great for my podcast
5,I've bought this and had planned to use it for my PC. I went with a cheap  48V phantom power supply. but when I plugged the microphone and turned on the phantom power I couldn't hear my voice. i thought at first that the microphone might be defective. but after installing a Mixer software and manipulating the gain then processing the audio through a virtual audio cable. the sound quality I got was very clear and well heard. Overall I'm satisfied.
5,I use this for delivering online training voiceovers and background jingle style music and for the price I’m kinda blown away. Love it!
5,Everyone said that I sound great and the audio is crystal clear.Very happy with my New Tonor Microphone.
5,OUTSTANDING 👍👍👍👍👍Great Presentetion.Awesome QualityGreat Price" FIVE STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE"🎸🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🎸
5,Got it for streaming/voice-over/voice acting and it has far exceeded my 60$ expectations!
1,I believe I probably got a faulty unit or something but it looks like mine works mostly okay but has the most annoying buzzing issues. I believe it might have something to do with the poor shielding maybe on the mic. Unfortunately it looks like it's not something I can use for recording
5,My friends can hear me clearly on our calls on Discord and the styrofoam keeps the background noise from letting my friends hear it in the background. It's perfect
4,Now to start off I just can't get over how quality the accessories are. The mic arm and shockmount are comprised of thick solid metal. The "tuning" of the spring and adjustment knobs is perfect. The included pop filter and windsock are just as good; they don't feel like cheap overseas knock-offs as do most combo sets. Whatever the patented "desk clamp" they mention in the images is pure-genius. The included XLR cable is good enough nothing special nothing bad. It's overall the most rigid and quality accessories package I've ever gotten. If you're a professional I honestly don't think it's a bad deal to buy it just for the accessories and put your own mic in it. Or if you are just getting into high quality audio; deal with the cheaper mic for now and if you ever upgrade down the line you will still have an excellent setup waiting for it already.As for the Mic: It's pretty solid and the sound quality is reasonable for the price. I would say the best way to put it is "meets expectations exactly". It meets the same standard of "quality solid metal" as the rest of the accessories. In terms of sound quality it's by far no professional mic but it is certainly better than any USB mic and is more than serviceable for some light podcasting/voice-over/singing work.You really can't go wrong with this set at this price. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it's respectable and not cheap junk.
5,EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y CONDICIONES
5,Good quality n protection
5,Great for my daughter to do home recordings.
5,Gift of the year! My husband bought this for Christmas the kids and us love it! Easy to use and clear to see! We will be gifting these throughout the year!
5,Love it
5,Sound quality good
5,Easily assembled and quality materials.
5,For the price this microphone is great! It was very easy to set up and the sound quality is pretty good (a bit much reverb but that's not a big problem.
5,This item is great it works just like it should. Only thing is the cable is cheap so I had to buy a new XLR microphone cord. Other than that GREAT product!
5,Better than expected
4,Mic sounds great with some adjustments! Def worth the money!!! Boom arm is fantastic! Shock mount is EHH. 4 Star because the pop filter immediately broke when I tried to put it on! Other than that decent quality! Would recommend!!
5,Great item it just didn’t have a usb connection to connect to a desk top computer
5,The sound quality is really good for $90.
5,I think over all for the price this was a great deal. I actually need to purchase a tuner so I havent been able to use it. If you're new to this and have no idea what you're doing BUY A TUNER as well. And itll work great. It was very easy to assemble.
5,You'll definitely need a phantom power supply of some sort (I use a USB mixer) to get this mic to work but the bump in sound quality is worth it. I wish this kit included at least a basic power supply but the upgraded boom arm makes up for it a bit.
5,Quality build great mic for singing and therefore anything else. great value for the money.
5,I recently started streaming online and was looking for a professional XLR microphone. This mic fits the budget as it not only comes with mic but comes with all other necessary attachment and mic stand. It has stylish look and is made of durable material as it is firm in construction. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a podcast or streaming mic.
5,Pros:-Great Value-many extras (boom arm filters cables shock mount and the mic)-great construction materials-great audio for 60$ micCons:-needs a mixer for phantom power-can peak at the high end (though there are ways around this)- shock mount metal seems a little thin
5,For this price you really can’t beat the quality you get out this kit. Super easy to get everything set up and the mic quality is on par with more expensive xlr mics on the market.
5,Love
5,Happy with the sound. After editing the sound works just fine.
5,Este es un micro precioso pequeño de buena calidad . Por el precio da una calidad muy buena. No le pide nada a mis micrófonos más profesionales y de marcas reconocidas
2,MAL!!. Llegó en paquete mal hecho. No tiene marca ni número de serie. No es como está en la foto con cable XLR... TRAE CABLE USB!!... Lo quería para mí portaestudio no para ser un maldito youtuber.
1,No me llego lo que quería me llegue un paquete chino y no era lo que compre en la imagen
5,The microphone is not top of the line quality but does compete with sub 100 euro microphones and considering the pretty complete setup including the sturdy stand microphone XLR cable windscreen shock mount and pop filter its a great starter when used in collaboration with a Behringer umc22 or other audio interface.
5,Ottimo sound buon prezzo
5,Rapporto Qualità - prezzo davvero ottimo!!
2,Venia con un defecto de fabricación la parte central del soporte del brazo venia invertido por lo que no se podía colocar adecuadamente es una lastima porque son de buena calidad.
5,Excelente sonido.
5,Este micrófono se escucha genial mejor que otras marcas importantes recomendado
