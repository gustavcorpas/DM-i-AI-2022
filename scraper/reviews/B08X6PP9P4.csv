5,This little printer is straightforward in its set up and Munbyn certainly gives a lot of resources to help you get things going - there's a physical and digital manual a message help line and online FAQs as well. We had some problems that quickly turned out to be a user error issue but Munbyn was quick to respond and were very kind in following up to help us get things moving.This is the best little label maker for small businesses and the pink and white matches my girlfriend's aesthetic perfectly. The thermal print quality was surprisingly good and things come out very clearly - you do have to tailor your design to be thermal-friendly but that was easy enough to do by just making the logo entirely black and taking out unnecessary intricate details as well as drop shadows. The printing itself is so fast! We love it and have been using the stickers to brand everything from products to equipment to packaging. We've also used it once to print a shipping label and it was surprisingly easy to set up and print as well - it definitely took the stress out of printing a label on white paper taping it down and hoping for the best. Thank you Munbyn! :)
5,Super adorable very easy to use the shipping labels print SO FAST when I click print in shopify - so much faster than feeding a sheet with 2 labels through my inkjet printer. AND I love being able to make my own stickers! I got the set of 3 colors of the round stickers. Found a good video with a google search that showed how to design the 2 x 2 round stickers in Canva and made my own "thank you" stickers to put on my packages on the outside! I have printed the 4 x 6 labels from both Shopify and Pirateship for UPS and USPS - no problems whatsoever I highly recommend this if you're shipping things with any regularity!
5,I have a little soap business and this printer has saved me so much time! Its also saved me sooooo much money! Printing labels on a ink jet printer was getting to expensive! The learning curve on how to use this printer and make labels was a bit steep but just take you time. I use Canva to make labels.
5,As a new small business owner I felt overwhelmed by this set up because I have no technical experience. However to my suprise this set up was sooo easy! I printed out my first order labe today and it was such a thrilling experience ^_^!!!
5,All the negative reviews on this machine sound like user error to me. This thing works great if you have common sense. Obviously don’t put labels in it that have glue on them. This thing runs like a charm never fails and is cute too. Love it
5,The reviews about this printer sold me and  I purchased it immediately.  I did run into some set up issues .  I contacted customer support.  I reached Bridy. The person went over and beyond to resolve my issues and made me so comfortable using the machine  I am a pro. Thank you for your help
5,This is the only thermal printer I've owned and I got it for the new small business I'm running selling collectible cards (Pokemon YuGiOh! Magic etc.) so that I could save money by buying my shipping with tracking online vastly cheaper than the post office and to streamline the efficiency of creating labels. The packaging was really high-quality (I only mention it because I literally stopped and thought "wow this is a high-quality sturdy box and some top-tier solid foam") so it could arrive without damage it came quickly and the printer itself is fantastic. The setup was a breeze; it comes with a USB-A drive that my Macbook Pro had no trouble reading it installed in like one second and then all I had to do was select it as the printer the first time I tried to print and it was all super smooth sailing from there. The drive also had an FAQ document in it for how to solve problems and how to set it up and configure it for use with different shipping platforms which I thought was really handy. It also came with a small packet of fan-fold thermal labels. One word to the wise that isn't mentioned in set-up instructions from what I could tell (some of you probably already know but for a thermal printer newbie it took me a bit to get this): the first time that you feed the 4x6 label into the printer while it's open you need to "pinch" the two label guide tabs together to tighten them so that the label doesn't have any wiggle room to drift to one side or the other. Otherwise it will print a bit off center randomly and I was changing my print sizing to 90% scale for a while until I figured out I needed to pinch/tighten the guides. Now I can print at the normal 100% scale and the full label contents still come out on the 4x6 label. It is a fast printer and everything looks decently high-resolution to me for the purpose of shipping labels--for very small font it's not entirely as crisp as I would have guessed but probably 90-95% of the way to crisp (on super small font it appears a tiny bit pixelated but still 100% legible) and that's just me being picky enough to notice it. When I check the tracking numbers for orders I've sent out they have info in them so it seems like the post office was able to scan all the codes it prints out so for the purpose of the important graphics being crisp enough it seems to work fine. It's also very efficient to print out address labels from 4x6 sheets if you take the time to make a template on word (you just need to go to the page layout and change the size of the page to 4x6; took me forever to figure that out) and are fine cutting them into smaller strips with several addresses per sheet. My only critique is that it's very light-weight which is probably great for some people but what it means is that since you have to tear up to tear the labels the printer itself actually comes off the table before the label tears. For that reason I wish it was a lot heavier but I solved the problem by sitting a book end/paperweight rock I have on top and now it doesn't move lol. You'd just need to find a way to fasten/weigh it down if you don't want to have to put your other hand on top every time you tear a label off.
5,This has been one of the best investments for my small business. I am able to save money labels and stickers by printing them right at home! Tech Support Specialist Ge was able to help me find a small problem with my printer and correct it immediately. Definitely recommend!
5,Using this printer for my business! It’s easy to set up  prints within seconds  & it’s pink!! Highly recommend (:
5,I absolutely love my MUNBYN thermal printer!! I have a small home bakery and use it to print every single day!! I prefer printing my own high quality labels I’ve ordering large quantities from a print service because I can tweak and make adjustments as needed.The printer drive was easy to load onto my Chromebook.The only negative I’ve found is the labels sometimes become misaligned but I’ve adjusted my labels accordingly and it works great!Highly recommend for home bakers and other small businesses!!
5,Best investment ever. If you are still debating whether to buy a thermal printer or not let this be the sign that you need to invest in it! It was THE BEST DECISION I made this year for my business! My only regret was not purchasing this sooner! It is a little expensice but definitely worth it and I think their site even sells some at a little cheaper price so you may want to check out their site as well.The printer is light and didn't look like it can do all the work I planned on doing with it but I was pleasantly surprised. So upon opening and setting up the device I decided to download the driver from their site since I did see they had a more updated version on the site compared to the USB. Instructional video was easy to follow when I searched their site.Stickers of different sizes were a breeze (especially compared to the hell I went through when I got the competing brand Jiose prior to this...so glad I decided to return that and buy this instead). Best tip I can give is to print a sample first of the sticker so you can adjust it accordingly and not be stuck with a whole batch of bad prints. Normally pressing the ctrl+shift+print buttons on your keyboard all at once will give you a better way to adjust the settings of the print quality you want like adjusting the print speed and density. I find increasing the density to 10 or 11 on 2x2 stickers gives a nice dark and solid print quality especially when images are fine in quality.There is a little learning curve to this machine in printing but I am pretty tech savvy so it was easy for me to play with it a bit to get it the way I wanted but I would definitely suggest looking at some youtube tutorials since there seems to be plenty for this product. If it does any error sounds when trying to insert labels don't worry and adjust the label readjustment tabs on the machine to keep the labels in place or you can turn the machine off and back on again and it should work. Don't be afraid to retry it a few times as sometimes the machine needs to reset. Other times I just press the pink button to open the machine and manually just insert the label and it usually works but you will just have an extra plain label that won't be printed on. It is a trial and error but not too bad. All in all a very satisfied experience and I am very happy!
5,it's so easy to use and install! I definitely recommend.
5,very easy to use! can print any labels now for gifts or even shipping labels for my poshmark listings!
5,At first it was difficult but I figured I was doing something wrong and now it’s perfect. Great for small businesses
5,If your looking for a thermal printer for your small business this is the one! I love this printer and it works great for making labels and stickers for my packaging! Oh and I got the blue one so its even better! If your thinking about it get it! You will love it!
5,I’ve had this printer over a year now and have had no issues with it. It’s very easy to figure out and makes shipping a breeze. It’s also nice that you can create labels/stickers for your shop I’ve designed some fragile and thank you stickers for my shipments.
5,The cuteness factor made it cost a bit more but worth it! Works well and love this I got it for my small business (Awesome and Kinda Special designs) and absolutely love it!
5,It's a love and hate relationship with this printer. In the beginning I had problems with the rolls and had to talk to customer support but then finally got it to work. It's almost been a year and all of a sudden my printer will no longer work. I've tried to delete it off my computer and redownload it but all the printer does is make beeping noises or nothing. It's tragic cuz I used it almost everyday and now nothing. It's very very frustrating.
5,Great
5,This is 100% worth the investment especially with having a small business! It lessens my time when I pack orders and I couldn't be more happy with it. Although it's more blue then green but I like it nonetheless.
5,I love how easy it is to use and how fast it is to set up! It’s not hard to figure out how to use it and the quality of the stickers are good.
5,Works easily and exactly as described no issues. Easily switch between printing shipping labels and stickers.
5,I love this printer. It prints fast and the quality is excellent. I highly recommend it. Also the company gives great customer service.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this thermal printer its super easy to install and use. Great prints and super fast and to top it off IT'S PINK!!
5,I bought this printer for my small business and it was very easy to set up! It arrived quickly and I’ve had no issues with it! It’s so convenient and doesn’t take up a lot of room so you can put it pretty much anywhere!
5,The printer works great!
5,As a small business owner this product is perfect for thermal shipping labels. I use it for my Etsy labels!! Love it. :))
5,Love them! Easy to set up and it is very easy to use.
5,So I just got this yesterday and had sooo much fun making labels all night! It really is easy to set up it comes with a lot of instructions as well as links to videos you can watch which I did. You really can start printing labels immediately! It’s also the smallest and cutest printer I’ve ever seen. I was pleasantly surprised by how small it is. Follow the instructions to set printer default to 4X6 for postage labels (printer comes with a stack of them) and then change to 2x2 for the 2 inch round labels which I bought separately. I will be purchasing more labels in different colors and can’t wait. I have a Mac and found the setup very easy. I hate (hate) dealing with printer ink so the fact that you don’t need to deal with that at all with this printer makes it perfect for me and I don’t find the labels expensive.
5,I just got it today (a day early!) and WOW! It prints SO FAST! What an upgrade from printing shipping labels on my old hp printer! I'll update my review if I have any trouble with it down the road!Set Up was only confusing because once you download the driver there's no program that you open with it and my pc doesn't notify me when I connect the MUNBYN the only way I could see that it was connected was to actually go to "printers". Then to actually print I can't seem to just right click a saved pdf label and say print which was annoying since I had already saved one of my labels but when I went to print the rest of the labels directly from Etsy I was able to skip downloading them all together and print directly from the webpage after hitting Print and selecting the MUNBYN. Then it kept the MUNBYN as the default printer for the rest of the labels. I still seem to have to adjust something though it cut off the first letter of my name and other info on the return address.This did come with a small stack of labels (maybe 20 of them) which I wish I would have known but a good surprise. I put the labels on some 2" kraft shipping tubes and the top and bottom corners didn't seem like they wanted to stay stuck on so I did end up using a little piece of tape to secure them. But the label I used on a flat box seemed pretty well set. I assume the labels they send are their own brand. I have a box of rollo brand ones I'll be using after I run out though.One thing I found as being strange is that the labels still can smudge I didn't expect this but when pressing one down I smudged the print with my hand.I think it is absolutely adorable which is such a rare thing to say about anything I buy for my work and I love how small it is it fits so nicely on my IKEA kallax shelf.

5,The best thing I could have purchased for my small business.. wish I would have bought it sooner. Such amazing quality and efficiency. So so thrilled will my printer and will recommend to any small business friend!
5,Love this label printer aside from its color (pink) it's also make my life easy I used to print my label using the inkjet but I have to cut the paper tape it sometimes adjust the size. But with this its very easy to use really convenient I also use this label printer not just for my business but for home too.  Just love it!
5,Printer is compact and doesn’t take up much space. Easy to follow instructions and amazing customer support. When I needed help Ge was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to help get me set up. Thank you Ge you are amazing!! Highly recommend.
5,Product is quick and easy! Works like it should and you have labels in no time!
4,Partially My fault for not reading the entire page but I was hoping this was Bluetooth compatible. So I could print from my phone. This Printer must be connected to your computer to work.There are instruction videos for windows and apple to set up the label printer which made it easy.9/10 the label is aligned perfectly straight sometimes the labels do printer slightly crooked.I would recommend this label printer to friends and family for the price!
5,Machine arrived quick and was so easy to setup. I have a Mac Air and it was a breeze. Love that it came with everything I needed to make setup with an Apple product run smoothly. That was super important to me. First print was not straight contact support for help and heard right back! Got the next print straight on sticker. Thank you!

5,It was a little confusing to set up to windows 10 but I had awesome help from Ge in tech-support! Works great smooth printing! If I ever need help again I know who to call! He was very helpful and answering all my questions!
5,honestly I bought this to print labels for my small business but i wish i could print everything on it cause i love watching this little guy do it's thing.VERY easy to set up (i used the USB with drivers preinstalled included in the packaging) once set up i printed a bunch of dumb stuff for fun to test it out.Had one misfeed so far but nothing too crazy beware when it misfeeds it DOES NOT STOP so if you're printing 50 labels and it misfeeds on label 2 it's going to keep printing and jamming 48 more labels until you stop it manually. This is not an issue for me as i don't see this happening often just beware also pretty sure the misfeed was my fault.Overall very easy setup no issues great print quality for a thermal printer and at a good price point. Would recommend to anyone looking for one of these guys.If you're wondering I got the pink one and yes it's adorable and amazing.
5,Prints great! Easy set up and to use. I use pirate ship for my shipping labels and there's no problems. I've printed maybe 5 labels so I haven't run out of the set-up/extra labels yet. Only issue is that one time when I printed a label there was a small discrepancy in the barcode (it didn't print it all the way through) so I just threw that one out. Not sure if that was just the label or the printer made a hiccup. Overall works really well so far and is pleasant to look at.
5,I’m very impressed with how easy this printer was to set up and use! It’s so fast also! I printed hundreds of stickers in minutes!!
5,I was in the market for a thermal printer and decided to go with this one. Setup was super easy with my Mac prints fast and I like the way it looks on my desk.I have to also add that the service was absolutely awesome! I had an issue with the adapter part of my printer and messaged the company over advice on where I can find the correct replacement after Amazon help wasn't able to. Not only did they respond to me promptly but they shipped out a free replacement adapter to my address just as quick as the reply. Thanks James and MUNBYN!

5,By far one of the best purchases I’ve ever made!! 🤩💕This will definitely make a difference for all my Small business owners/even soon to be like me lol. I am a nail tech (nail page is @KissMySets) and I handmake and sell custom press on nails this was the biggest and best purchase I’ve ever made for my business and it feels 😊! Not only is it cute but very easy to set up directions are very straightforward and laid out for you well. I’ve never used a thermal printer myself and I can honestly say within 5-10 minutes I was up and printing after reading my manual. Also There’s a ton of videos and information online that can help out too. They have the best customer service and you can definitely tell that this was packaged and sent with love 💕. Thank you Munbyn for making this process so easy even for us just getting started & giving us multiple color options 🌈🤩Also the labels were not included I purchased those separately.
5,If you are considering this thermal printer and are not sure! Let me tell you! Do it!This printer was easy to set up to my iMac I was printing in minutes. The quality is stellar. The speed is amazing. And it’s pink!I’ve been able to print labels for my small business in minutes.If I could give 10 stars if I could! This is a game changer works with both my Shopify and Etsy for shipping labels!Don’t think about it! Do it!Ps. I also got the matching scale my shipping station looks so pretty!

5,I really enjoy my new Munbyn thermal printer! It was really easy to set up and it prints so quickly. It’s making my small business work so much easier. I’m excited to try out more label types in the future!
4,I read the reviews thoroughly on this one. I was a little scared of buying an "off brand" printer if you will. The negative reviews had me skeptical but I rolled the dice on it. Set it up on my PC with no problems at all. The drivers loaded fine with the USB that was included. The directions were easy to follow even though there were some spelling errors due to the English translation. I went ahead and bought the munbyn labels as well just to make sure there were no issues. The label set up was easy. Follow the directions and the machine will send one or two blank ones through to determine your label size-and you are good to go. We are ebay sellers so we had to make a couple of changes on the website so the label would print correctly--it was an easy fix. We were printing labels in less than 10 minutes.As of now there are really only two cons that I can see. First--Munbyn needs to reconfigure the cable inputs on the back of the machine. They stick out a little too far out the back in my opinion. If you have a tight space the cables stick out and you may not have enough room to set your labels. They need to be located on the side of the machine if possible. Second the printed image could be a little darker but it's not a deal breaker for me. Overall don't be afraid to buy this machine. It works great and so much easier than printing on a conventional printer cutting and taping labels!
5,Realmente amo estaré printer verde ❤️ es la mejor inversión que puedes hacer si impresión es super excelente a diferencia de el printer gris y el blanco. Cuando vayan a hacer la compra mi recomendación es que compren el verde o el rosa no te arrepentirás y cuando tengas algún problema o duda con tu impresora no dudes en contactar a munbyn por WhatsApp. El servicio al cliente es excelente y Ge es super atento está contigo paso a paso hasta resolver cualquier problema.I really love I'll be green printer ❤️ it is the best investment you can make if printing is super excellent unlike the gray and white printer. When you go to make the purchase my recommendation is that you buy green or pink you will not regret it and when you have a problem or doubt with your printer do not hesitate to contact munbyn by WhatsApp. The customer service is excellent and Ge is super attentive he is with you step by step until any problem is solved.
5,Pairing it to my Chromebook took a little bit more to get used to than I thought it should but once it was connected it runs flawlessly.10/10 would recommend
5,I just set up this printer myself which is a miracle because I usually wait for my husband to do it since I am not techy in the least. I couldn't believe how easy it was!I had a minor issue & emailed for support - Ge reached out to me very quickly to help me correct the issue- THANK YOU Ge!I am so excited to use this printer plus it's so CUTE=)
5,Super easy to use and very quick printing
5,Best product I’ve bought for my small business! It’s so easy to hook up and print. And easy for shipping labels but also super cute stickers for packaging for my small business. Buy it you won’t regret it!!!
4,I bought this printer to cut overall costs in my product's packaging and it has really helped! I'm using the 2.25inx1.25in labels as ingredient lists stickers and unfortunately have run into a few problems with the printer but nothing deal-breaking. I'm not sure if I just received a weak printer but the print is not consistent from label to label and can be streaky/blotchy. I bought 4- 1000ct rolls and have had to throw away 300-400 labels due to printing quality issues. Other than this complaint customer service is always fast and helps the best they can. Despite the waisted labels the ones I do have are super cute and affordable for my small buisness.
5,Love this printer easy to use and install.
5,This machine is a workhorse. I replaced my two dumps (one 4xl and one dual printer) with this and I couldn’t be happier. I print 100+ labels a day for my business and this machine does it quickly and efficiently. Never jams and tech support is awesome if you ever have a question. Would definitely purchase again or buy other Munbyn products.
5,I love this printer so much! It comes in super cute colors and is packed very safely. It comes with everything you need to get started with printing! I purchased this printer because I was tired of printing shipping labels with a regular printer. I was constantly running out of ink and having to repurchase it. Now that I have my Munbyn printer I can purchase labels in bulk and never have to replace ink! This tool is also great for experimenting with packaging (I’ve made thank you cards personalized stickers product labels etc). Overall a 10/10 for me and an absolute game changer or my small business!
5,for anytime of home business where you are shipping multiple packages this is a must!  It saved me so much time and cost of ink and paper to print shipping labels. Truly easy to use! MUST
5,All I can say is it takes some fiddling with. Watched a ton of videos on YouTube and TikTok and finally got it to print on label sizes other than 4x6. Did not find their website very helpful.You should know it only prints in black which I knew. Print quality is not the greatest especially on small or intricate designs and text. Keep that in mind when choosing things to print.Additionally it waste a few labels each time you switch label sizes in order to recalibrate the print size. Make sure to have several left when printing. It won’t just print one label if it doesn’t have several on the “roll/stack” because it pull them through to scan size (calibrate).ProsSuper fast printing. No ink economical. Great for adding to packages that just get thrown away anyways. No frills nothing fancy.Do not have to purchase Munbyn labels only other thermal labels within the size restrictions of the printer work as well.
5,Update- 2/7/8/22- munbyn customer service reached out to me and mailed me a brand new printer. It works so much better! Really impressed with customer support and will recommend this printer.I have been using this for a little under a month with about 3-5 orders/week. At first it printed so nicely. After about a week the print became really light. I've followed Munbyn's directions on how to fix the print to come out darker- by going in printer settings and adjusting the speed and density- but nothing is fixing it. I emailed tech support who told me to adjust the speed and density to a different number- which I did.....and nothing different happened. A little worried that my post office isn't going to accept my packages if the print keeps getting lighter. For now it is getting the job done.Pros- tech support emailed me back within 24 hours which was a nice surprise. It was super easy to install and connect to my computer. Printing labels like this is SO MUCH EASIER than printing on a regular printer and cutting out then taping to a package.Cons- printing keeps getting worse each time I use it. The cords in the back are in a really awkward location- get in the way of labels/label holder.
5,Prints fast easy setup works both Mac and pc and doesn’t use ink. It’s great. Just make sure you select the right paper size before you hit print
5,I was having trouble getting the printer to work on my computer. I reached out to tech support via WhatsApp and not only did I receive a prompt reply they were able to help me figure out what I needed to get the Pinter running. I’m so happy! I highly recommend this company. The price is great too for the quality!
5,Primero estuve dudosa porque había una version anterior a este Printer y leía en los comentarios que las personas indicaban que no podían enlazarla con la MacBook. En mi caso compre esta porque en la descripción indica que trae un adapter (cable) adicional. La verdad es que tengo una Mac Book Air y no necesité el adapter. Se conecta super fácil a tu computadora. Debes ver las instrucciones por si acaso. Imprime super rápido. Te recomiendo una vez que la uses no sacarle los papeles porque cada vez que los coloques ella va a volver a calibrar y siempre deja el primer en blanco. Si la dejas ya colocada no te volverá a pasar. Me encantó.
4,I thought the item was very easy to setup. However my dislike of the unit and main reason why I purchase this item was to print click and ship USPS shipping labeles. You have to manually manage and change each label before printing. You can not just print it from USPS postal website. The size is half the sheet and no other way from the USPS website to change the size of the printing. There are serveral steps that need to happen before one can print. Otherwise I like the small printer and perfect for printing shippping labels from home. Tech support really did not help other than state to adjust the print size nothing about how to get the lables printed in the correct facing.
4,Set up was a bit difficult and the templates could not be downloaded from the site on the flash drive
5,Great label maker to save money and make your own at home. Customwr service is great and respond quickly online and via email. I am excited to play around and make my own labels!
5,I bought the pink printer as a gift for mu wife to print labels for her baking business and it’s an amazing little machine! She’s been loving it not only because the printer it self is “beautiful” but also because printing quality is very good it’s very easy to use once you get to know how it works and they have a great customer service/tech support who was always supporting her through the process of setup and printing for first time.
5,Loved this thermal printer. Very easy to setup and use. Had a couple of questions when I started the set up and customer service was great and replied in that very instant. Highly recommend!
5,When I tried downloading the program nothing worked.I kept trying to plug in the usb drive using the Mac adapter for 2 hours annoyed with this damn printer.I was about ready to return it until I went on their website to read those reviews and that's when I saw someones review saying that the USB adapter that comes with it doesn't work and that you need to purchase the apple USB adapter. I went out bought it plugged it all in and bam! it worked. Now that it works I love it!!!
5,At first I was a little confused. MAKE SURE YALL HAVE THE PROPER SOFTWARE UPDATED BECAUSE IF NOT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO PRINT. I had to download WINZIP in order for me to size them & all things I needed. I’m super excited. The QUALITY could be better but as a beginner. It will work
5,I have a 2019 iMac running Big Sur 11.4 and had ZERO issues setting this up. I ruined about 5 labels just testing it out but that's almost to be expected. Not even mad. I had to look on their website how to reset the label sucker-in-beeping-button thing and that was the only issue I have had since owning this. It's fast reliable easy to set up works with mac and saves me a buttload of time printing labels. The setup is incredibly easy with the USB stick that comes with it. Seriously it's 100% worth every penny and its just so magical when it spits out all the labels at once.I use Paypal for my shipping labels and to bulk print them all at once is amazing. The ONLY issue I have had with it on Mac (and it's probably a mac thing) is that when the OS updates it drops the printer. You just have to add it back in the printer settings which is like 3 clicks and it's done.
5,It was an easy set up just went to site and got drive download and it started working right after . It was super easy to load paper and even easier to print. They gave straight forward instructions on how to change paper size and everything I would highly recommend this label printer!

It also is super fast at printing multiple labels and the best part there Is no print quality issues when it does that. Overall best printer and definitely worth the price because you won't have to replace or ever be upset with it. Definitely recommend this to all my buisness friends! Also the pink one is my favorite 😍

But the performance of this great printing machine is above & beyond!!! I love my Munbyn Thermal Printer. It prints very well and it helped me with my baking business.  I just need help from my daughter to set me up with the process. I just hope I can get the Tiffany blue or pink instead
5,I love it it was on time I can't wait to use it for my business
5,Awesome product we print our own labels
3,Great for standard size labels but I wasted a ton of labels trying to set up for smaller stickers and never got them to print correctly so I gave up on using for the smaller ones.
5,Great printer to ship my Etsy labels! Such an easy-to-use product! They print so quickly too so you don't have to sit there and wait like a regular printer!
5,I’ve been wanting to get a label printer for my small business for the longest time and finally pulled the trigger. I’m glad I did! This machine is great and the blue/green color matches the rest of the accents in my office. My favorite part is how small the footprint is. It’s less than 1/4 the size of my regular printer.Set up was fairly easy. Seller will email you a link with video instructions Which I found to be more helpful than the written instructions. I use a Mac and had no issues. They even included an adaptor for USB to USB-c which is great because I’m always losing mine! I had a few issues getting the labels to print properly and wasted quite a few sheets. You need to play around with the settings to get everything adjusted just right. If you have the wrong settings it’ll crop off the edges or feed through blank labels. These aren’t issues with the machine though just user error.
5,Love this thermal printer! By far it is the best investment for my small business. Really easy to set up and quality is 100 percent. Also when I need some technical support the team was always very helpful they guide me to every step of the process.I definitely recommend this printer!

The speed of this machine is fantastic and I love that it is so easily versatile and the labels can be changed to print logos or even thank you stickers just by adjusting the arms that hold the paper. The small footprint that this takes up is awesome and we couldn’t be more pleased with the product!
4,I LOVE this thing but it takes a bit to figure it out through the manual. I ended up watching YouTube videos to figure it all out.But once figure out ITS SO EASY AND SIMPLE!Worth every single penny!

I am a small business owner and this thermal printer prints quality stickers and labels that I use on all of my orders. Helps give a special touch to my packaging. The print quality is impeccable. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a thermal printer! You will not be disappointed 🤗
5,This product is amazing! I’m terrible with technology and followed the Manuel to set it up. Set up was super simple but my MacBook had an issue reading the printer when it was time to print. I contacted support and they helped me instantly! I was able to fix the issue in less than 3 minutes. A super nice representive named Martin help me! 10/10 tech support and 10/10 product! Prints quickly and clear I seen some reviews saying it wasn’t compatible with MacBook which isn’t true! I have the latest one and it works perfect! Thank you

The label maker was shipped in perfect condition easy to set up and has made printing labels stickers and shipping labels SO easy!
5,Great little printer but it doesn't come with a program to create the stickers or labels. You have to wing it on your own and search for something compatible.
5,This printer is literally so great for small businesses so easy to use! Any questions I had on the printer their customer service team were excellent on providing the solution with videos attached that made it so helpful!

As a user of Munbyn thermal printer i can say is very easy to operate and prints in seconds! No ink needed. If you’re starting a business or already have one this is the perfect thermal printer for “thank you” sticker or even mailing labels! On price it is worth every single penny!-nabilgarza

The color is beautiful and the printer itself does a great job at printing labels fast and clear. The quality of the print job is amazing. Everything is always clear and crisp. The thermal feature saves so much on ink!I do wish it would have a wireless option but the package does come with an adapter for IOS users. I don’t mind having to plug my computer in before using it as it displays beautifully in my work area.Installing the software was also fast and easy. If you are in the market for a thermal printer this one is it! Functionality and aesthetics are perfect for my small business!

Incredibly easy to set up and use. Print quality is great and fast. Would 1000% recommend!
5,In love with my munbyn thermal printer. It makes my job so much easier now I don’t have to waste my time on printing my shipping label on my inkjet printer. And don’t have to spend money on ink. This thermal printer is worth the price!!!
5,Print quality is excellent. It’s easy to use & prints so nice it saves me so much time & money. I love it.
5,I have owned a few Demo thermal printers various sizes. I've owned a Rollo. I was trying to decide between this one and a Brother and I'm SO glad that I purchased this one. The setup was incredibly easy (MacBook online driver installation) feeding the sample labels in and printing was seamless. I've had it for a little over a week printed labels every day from multiple marketplace sites (Etsy Faire Shopify etc.) and it's been FLAWLESS. If you're on the fence go for it. I was worried because it seemed like a newer company and not as mainstream as other brands but I couldn't be happier.
3,I bought this for my home business thinking it would help save money on not buying sheets of labels for my inkjet that I end up wasting half of. I am using a MacBook and have set it up exactly as the instructions stated. Occasionally it will print out my 4x6 (or 100mmx150mm) labels but most times it prints part of them then stops. The only size I can consistently get it to print is 100mm x 120mm. That is about 2/3 the size of the label and on international labels is far too small for the barcode to be scanned. For $170 this is crap. I should have went with the slightly more expensive name brand item.UPDATE:I am updating this review as I did finally get the printer to print 4x6 labels consistently. It took some searching but I finally found the solution on the manufacturers website. Apparently if you are printing things with barcodes and such (basically what you buy this for) the darkness can cause a disruption in the printing. For my Mac I had to go to one of the properties and change it from the highest 8 level of darkness to 3 or 4. It now works great. I only went up to a 3 so other buyers can see this issue and not have to search wasting time and a lot of labels trying to figure it out. This issue and solution should be in the manual.
5,Fell in love with this machine. I am hooked. I would like to try other munbyn products. I was truly amazed at the quality it can produce. Love the portability
5,After about 4 hours of wondering why my printer wouldn’t connect I realized the USB to USB-C adapter was faulty. I tried using the flash drive via the adapter and my MacBook didn’t realize anything was connected. I finally got an Apple brand USB-C adapter and now my printer works great! The print isn’t as sharp as my normal inkjet printer but I’m so happy with it regardless. I love that I can make branding stickers for the exterior of my boxes for so cheap! Thank you Munbyn for this incredible printer!

Perfect for printing shipping labels and stickers for my small business. It prints super fast and I love that you can use different size stickers. I just designed some stickers on Canva downloaded the file and had them on stickers all within a few minutes. Would highly recommend if you own a small business!
3,There are a lot of little frustrations about it that make me regret the purchase.1) The "Learning" process always wastes the first label which is a huge money sink. While the size of the printer is nice the fact that I always have to have the labels loaded means that I can't store it the way I want to unless I want to waste money "learning" the roll every time I load it up. This is my biggest frustration.2) The "handles" inside that guide the labels are tough to move so I always feel like I'm gonna break the darn thing. But they do work. I have had labels occasionally get stuck though.3) No bluetooth. That's on me for thinking I would be fine without it but damn do I regret it now that I have limited desk space and I know that I can't just store the printer against the wall.Some Pros:• The print quality is fantastic.• It comes with a decent number of labels to start so if you don't have a ton of orders right away you should be covered for a bit.• The size IS really nice. It's tiny light and portable.• I got the green color and I love it.
5,I love my little printer and it's perfect for printing labels and stickers. However I had an issue where I had the wrong plug and I contacted their tech service. Within minutes I was talking to them via chat and they sent me a new one in a matter of days. And it's working perfectly again. Super happy with the printer and the service. :)
5,Muy util

I highly recommend this thermal printer to anyone that has a small or big business :) it is very easy to use and the print quality is excellent!
5,I have a online boutique and I love using this for my shipping labels and my cash envelopes
5,There is nothing I don't like about this machine. If you don't want to waste labels I would leave the machine on but other than that it is the best investment. My 6 orders basically paid for the machine. No ink no worries and everyone received their packages.
5,I ordered the upgraded version (for MacBook)  I wish it came with a C instead of usb. Other than that instillation was a little difficult instructions didn’t help. I had to watch a couple different YouTube how to’s. Works great once installation is complete.

Purchased a differnt printer before this and it was such bad quality and a tedious set up .Munbyn you do a couple simple steps to your computer and it’s working within minutes. So glad I went with this brand and it’s pink !

5,Great quality easy to use. Very helpful tech support from Ge!

The company did a great job providing their customers with a lot of installation guides because it can get tricky especially with a Mac user but manageable. The product is very cute (love the color) prints well (make sure the label is in high resolution) and I was even able to make it print multiple things that I need for my store- shipping labels address labels and even receipts (as shown in the video). I’ll definitely recommend this label printer to my other friends in the business.
5,
5,I have been cutting and taping shipping labels for a while now & I thought it was time to invest in my business. This printer is amazing and super easy to set up! I would recommend this to an business owner looking for a faster way to print shipping labels
5,So far I love this printer! I've been printing shipping labels as needed on my inkjet printer which is a giant pain. Well I'm sending out a lot of packages at once so I decided to buy a label printer. I did a fair bit of research before settling on the Munbyn. It was a touch more complicated to set up than some things but the guides were straightforward. It helps if you pause the video about installation when it gets to installing drivers so you can clearly see what to click.Once I got it set up I was amazed by how seamlessly it printed the labels. I just chose the 4 x 6 label setting on Stamps and that was all I needed. So much better than struggling with paper jams in the Inkjet!
5,I'm really in love with this printer. I've been using it for a few weeks and it doesn't give me any problems. It's great for making stickers and labels. And it's fast printing. I printed 150 stickers in less than 5 minutes!
4,color is cute - but for the price you would think there's a place to keep all the unused labels ...... there isn't so that's pretty inconvenient. The website where you go to download the printer software is all in a different language so it's very difficult to understand. I was able to figure it out and then I had a couple issues with the printer itself because it's not printing the entire label for some reason even when I readjust so I'm just a little concerned and I don't know if it's worth the price might return ... 😐

With it being thermal printed it's also eco friendly 💕

Easy to set up and helpful videos online if you need additional help. I use it for both shipping labels and circular round labels I seal customer packages with. Saves me a ton of money on printing!
2,I watched YouTube videos for months (reviews and tutorials) and it looked way easier than it actually is and I promise you I'm not an angry customer and this is not a fake review to deter you. I have not been able to figure out how to print my labels centered and on the the thermal sticker paper and not half on half on the next sticker :(I wold love to simply know how to align the print for and on the sticker paper. I"m going to have to return it if I can't figure it out soon. I don't want to be stuck with something I cannot use.

I use it for both my shipping labels and on round logo stickers it's adjustable for various sized label papers. The look is very sleek and modern and prints very quickly. The setup was surprisingly easy as well I had it set up in less than 5 minutes which I appreciated. Overall I am extremely happy with my munbyn printer.
5,Tech support is EXCEPTIONAL!!!  Tech support FaceTimed with me to discovered my printer was defective.  Sent a brand new one!  AMAZING!!!!

3,It took hours to somewhat figure out how to get it working.. still not sure how I did it.. I ended up printing enough for a few weeks and then when. It came time to reprint... my printer was not matching the layout the print is so light and I have it on 15 density... the darkest.. I reached out and no one has gotten back to me. I restarted and still the same 3 days 2 people playing with the settings and nada! Now I can't even return it and support is no help what so ever.  Tried switching to rectangle stickers and it's just a head ache.. why doesn't anyone help? It's probably a si.ple fix but not when my household can't figure it out aloneeee
5,My sister uses a Munbyn for her small business and she loves it. So I wanted to a Munbyn as well. I was so happy when I saw they had a thermal printer in my favorite color and I knew immediately it was going to be mine. While I had just a little issue with installing this on my Mac I finally figured it out and have been loving it ever since. It's very easy to load the labels in and print. Plus this printer also comes pink or white and they are all gorgeous. I have tried using other thermal label printers before but the Munbyn is by far my favorite.
5,Tech support is hard to reach the cable that come with it was not recognized by my lab top. I had to use one I already had. I spent three days working on it before I tried my cable

I don’t like the set up and new apps tend to be complicated. What stood out with the Munbyn was that it was so plainly labeled and so easy to set up. I’m so excited to step up my packaging.

I can't wait to disease it to design some brand stickers for stickers for my product boxes. It's. I love the simplicity of how the simplicity of how the printer looks and the color is exactly what I wanted.
5,Love my new label and print. Disappointed it didn't come with a DVD for instructions. Thankfully U-Tube  helped a lot. I'm rebranding my product and I don't have to purchase anymore ink. I think the need to do a better job with instructions of the product and how to clean the product. We shouldn't have to rely on U-Tube.

5,I love my Munbyn thermal printer. It was a game changer for my Etsy shop.  It was so easy to set up and cuts down on the time it used to take for me to print labels and tape them on.  I don’t know why I waited so long to get one!  It saves money on printing supplies because this doesn’t use ink so I’m not always replacing in cartridges like I was with my ink jet printer.  It is a must have for any small business owner.  I looked into the Rollo printer but this was so much cheaper and the reviews were better. I am glad I went with Munbyn.  It has been absolutely perfect!
5,I love the quality of this printer. I also appreciated the customer service I received from Munbyn. I got a new Apple computer and couldn’t get it to work at first. I messaged them and they sent me a link for the correct drivers and it was easy to fix! They answered me quickly and then followed up a few days later. Great customer service!

It was extremely easy setup (thanks to the awesome documentation and how-to guides). It has made printing labels so easy and efficient. Plus it is super cute and has a Kawaii aesthetic with the light pink. I love this printer so much and recommend it to anyone looking for a label printer.

And on their official video they tell you to set the size to 100mm x 150mm but it kept cutting the image in half (video is the reference) and after many tries and changing the size to 4x6 and it printed perfectly. Can't wait to start using this for my small business!

5,The very best customer service. I have a Mac Big Sur so I was having trouble connecting the printer and using the flash drive. I contacted the seller and they sent me a cord to help with the issue and video recommendations to set up and print my labels.
5,Love it so far. Haven't used it yet but set up was easy and the test page printed nice. Would recommend this product.
5,Extremely happy with this purchase size is very convenient. We just started our small business and didn’t know how to set it up to our Shopify and was able to communicate with the brand for help. Very easy to use and happy with this purchase.
5,This little pink printer drove me crazy for a couple days… however Alex at Munbyn tech support was the best tech support I have ever experienced in any support ever. I sure hope I have his name correct. This little machine is a dream for stickers. 💖
5,The Set up was easy. I love that I can now make custom labels for my business
5,At first I hated this machine. Couldn’t figure out how to make round stickers and wasted some sticker sheets. BUT After watching the tutorials on the website and YouTube I figured it out ans got it to work.Good for the price! Works great!
1,I initially purchased the product it didn't work. I wrote a review of the product. Munbyn contacted me and offered to send a new printer and labels. I thought that was a great gesture. They asked me to take down my review and I did considering the great gesture of sending me a printer and labels.  I returned the old printer to Amazon for a refund. Munbyn sent the new printer (refurbished) and it didn't work properly. I have reached out to them about the printer they sent. The first time they asked to video chat with me. I don't need a video chat I just need assistance with receiving a new printer exactly like my initial purchase. I included  the sound bite of the error (the printer is making this awful noise). The printer is not calibrating the label size either.  I asked if they could send me a new printer they said sure. That was 3-9. I have reached out again for the 4th time and no response to date(3/18 3/21 3/22 and 3/23).It is very frustrating to have reached out this many times with no resolution. Munbyn if you are reading this please call me. I would just like a new printer to continue printing for my business. You have my telephone number.  By the way it’s difficult to setup round labels. Not the easiest printer out there. Sincerely Upset Customer

I'm able to create labels in any design I desire. The set up was super quick and very easy to follow. I highly recommend this printer for anyone starting a business who wants to kick their branding up a knock!
5,when I was looking info about thermal printers found munbyn and saw this color right away I love the color but wasn’t sure about the quality to be honest I keep looking for more info about it then found out everybody was going for dymo but after several weeks debating between a dymo or munbyn I decided to be in the munbyn family😁 I’m in love with it love the color of course is not the typical black or white😬  the set up is so easy I use a Mac the size of this printer is perfect  the quality is good so far I’m sure I made the right decision😍
5,Easy to set up and use! Perfect for what I need and the color is fun too!!
5,Absouletly love my thermal. easy to use and a way to personalize my buisness.  round 2 x 1.25 and 4x6 labels by munbyn have all be excellent qualityl
5,The person loved receiving it.  This brand is hard to install all printers.

5,This machine is So easy and user friendly! I plan to use it for both business and home!
4,So I just received this printer for my crystal business and it was easy to set up with the YouTube video. But then I had trouble printing the labels to fit the page. I just had to change my printer settings in PayPal which I saw from another YouTube video. I guess it was a little difficult for me since I’m not tech savvy with computers but overall this is a good printer! It’s fast and doesn’t get hot. I hope it lasts a very long time.
5,Printer works well. I originally thought that I could just send a bunch of shipping labels to print; however each label or set of labels has to be saved as a PDF and one has to use the snapshot feature in Acrobat Reader to highlight the label on the page. Then you can print one label at a time. It’s still better than printing a page on regular paper cutting out the label and then taping it to the box. It’s just not as automated as I had imagined. It would be nice if there was software that could identify the label(s) on the page so one could just hit print. Especially if you print several labels at a time.
5,My printer was only delivered today so I am still learning but I easily set it up using windows. The instruction manual was very clear and it enabled me to efficiently set up my computer. The printer is also super cute and it fits perfectly on my work table! I am very excited to continue using the printer and can I just say… not having to use tap to secure the label is a total time saver!!
5,Unbelievable how easy this is to work. Print quality is also amazing

I was printing ingredient labels for my bakery within 20 minutes of plugging it in maybe even faster. Love the compact size label size and colors available and the color! Definitely worth it!

It’s been amazing for my small business! This brand is great I even ordered the matching scale. Highly recommend
5,This little printer is so easy to set up and SO FAST. You blink and the label is printed. It's SO cool and fun and cute!! I can't stop printing with it I love it so much. No clue how it compares to other label printers but I love using it and it also comes with some free labels which was an unexpected bonus! Label EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE!!!

5,Set up was super easy. Print quality was great. I ordered the pink one to match the aesthetic of my office. I love that the products come in different styles and colors.
4,The initial set up was more challenging than planned which left My labels printing only 3/4 of the way. Customer service was prompt in helping me change what settings needed to be changed in order to print the full labels.  Unfortunately I do still have to go into the same settings to print the labels correctly not sure if this is the printer or user though.
4,Print quality needs improvement. It’s more legible than not my packages have been delivered but it’s just not the clearest text. It messes with the professionalism of a business with something so small as sloppy text on a shipping label. Not the worst of my worries but that detail could be better.
5,Had a problem with the first one I purchased it never printed very well. i was sent a replacement and I love the fact that I can see and read everything! So far so good. Munbyn is very helpful to their customers. Thank you

Once I adjusted the sizing everything worked out perfectly. I use this for my Etsy shop and the shipping labels print out so fast! Way better than hand writing them or using an inkjet printer. The pink color is a plus too!
5,Si me super encanto es muy facil de usar y funciona muy bien gracias Munbyn la recomiendo al 100%
5,I love my thermal printer . I contacted customer service to guide me through the process of setting up the printer and were very helpful providing videos and guide over the phone . Thanks
5,I bought this as a shipping label printer and also to make other stickers (thank you's and such) for my small business and boy was it the best thing I have done! Shipping came quicker than expected! Came with easy to install directions! Setup took no more than 20 minutes!! Plus its thermal so I don't have to worry about purchasing ink! If you can make the investment do it! You won't be sorry! :)
5,I really love this product I was debating between this one and others and I am so glad I decided to go with this one. It prints incredibly fast and I had no issues setting it up. I did have to look up a youtube video on the setup because the instructions werent so clear and you can make the text appear darker which is so great. I wont be trading this in for another one any time soon!!
5,This is my 2nd Munbyn thermal printer. If it wasn’t for me blowing out my printer and shipping scale with a bad power strip. Less than 24 hours and I had my new printer set up. Easy Peasy set up from website. Nice aqua color instead of typical black gray and white office supplies. Prints well. Easy label sizing.  Fits in small space. Quick bulk printing. Love it!

It took a second trying to get it to print right for my Shopify store but once it was figured out it saves so much time. I was cutting out my shopping labels which I hated. It's so compact and takes up very little space.  Next will be printing labels. I'm sure it will be just as easy.
3,Print quality isnt that great - when i print shipping labels the carriers cant scan them and sometimes cant read the print.

I love that I can print my shipping labels for my small business right at the comfort of my home. Every label comes out perfect and they stick right to my packages.
1,Update 9/11/22Company said they couldn’t send a replacement printer and would consider sending a power adapter. After days of back and forth and me sending them the same information they tell me they had low stock and would send me labels instead. What I’m I supposed to do with labels without a working printer.I will not be purchasing a printer from here again as they do not offer any type of warranty on their product.Bought in February it worked great but now it won’t turn on. Have reached out to the company to see if they can replace it. Waiting yo hear back still.
4,This thing was such a pain to set up especially on a mac. Instructions are pretty poor but once I figured it out it worked beautifully. Prints are clean and fast. Tip: you can sign up for a UPS account and get 6000 4x6 labels for free.
5,so far so good! I have a Macbook air (macOS big sur version 11.3.1) and it works perfectly. I was amazed how easy it was to install. if you have a Mac: once you insert the munbyn usb drive and follow the instructions all the folders/downloads will be in in your mac 'Folders icon'. Hope that little tip helps. after much research on different thermal printers im glad I got this one.
5,Easy to print any size labels! I just Love it!
5,Worth every penny. Using the MUNBYN Thermal Label Printer has absolutely sped up my process. I am upset I didn't pull the trigger earlier.
5,LOVE!! Should have ordered my thermal printer a long time ago!!!
5,Ugh I was struggling while we all work from home to figure out a way to ship faster. I was burning up ink cartridges and OTS labels which cost a lot. This little printer is compact prints way faster than my inkjet and the thermal printing saves on all those cartridges I was using up. It integrated with my shipping programs easily and has saved me SO MUCH TIME. You can also use this for planners/crafting to print your own stickers/labels!

I was able to print 12 labels in 16 seconds. speaking of labels in the package i received about 30 free labels! super nice!totally recommend
5,I've been using for a few weeks now. Super easy set up no issues. I've been printing shipping labels for my etsy shop and also making some stickers with it too!
5,Easy to install on my laptop and prints super fast love my shipping days😁

5,I was skeptical to get this printer due to other reviews from customers where the the printing wasn’t dark enough. It was the perfect quality I was looking for it prints really fast and the installation was so easy i was able to install the printer in 10 mins and I am definitely not tech savvy what so ever. If you want to save money and time at the post office you will not be disappointed with this printer what so ever.

I’ve been running a small business for years and printed my labels on paper and added it with tape. This speeds up my process significantly! On top of that there are many different types of stickers you can make with this. Cute and functional!
5,This printer is great! Fast printing and does more then just standard 4x6 labels. Was easy to set up and use. Easy to change out the printer rolls would highly recommend!
4,Bought this during Amazon Prime day! Easy install and just did a test print. I have to say I’m glad I bought it. It prints really really fast! The only con is I the cords in the back are in the way if your blank labels aren’t sitting up high when it is going through the machine.
2,So I just brought my munbyn thermal printer which I’m excited about but it’s not working for my chrome book. It states that it’s compatible but when I go to print it says it’s not compatible. I really don’t know what to do at this point. Please someone help! Thanks
5,Very easy to set up. I actually set mine up by the Youtube video. It took less than 2 minutes. Prints super fast! I love it as I don't have to waste a half of a sheet of 8.5 x 11  sheet of paper for one label anymore. I've only printed two labels so there's plenty more exploring to do as I bought additional colored labels.
5,The print quality is great. I did not need tech support. Just took out of box and started printing. Had to figure it out but was very easy!
5,I had some challenges getting it configured but a call to Amazon's support got me up and running. I love this thing! Paired up with Pirate ship I'm saving all kinds of time and money. It'll have paid for itself in no time with the postal discounts and saved trips to the post office. Besides all that I love the aqua blue color of the printer and how it coordinates with my studio. I'm one happy artist!
5,I have received a new machine from Amazon and I love it the customer service is great thanks

I print out labels and stickers for my business and this printer makes it easy. It prints out great and I love the pink color! I would definitely recommend this machine if you have a small business printing out shipping labels and personalized stickers all the time!
5,Awesome product. I got it in the pink and it is so cute. Easy to setup the instructions were very easy to follow and I can now create my own labels for shipping. I also created an account with pirate ship to get the best rates on shipping. Great item for any small business that needs to ship. You can also create personalized thank you stickers.
5,I was looking for a thermal printer to print shipping labels for my small business so I could save the ink in my printer for art and sticker prints. This printer was so easy to set up and use (I use a Mac) and I love that it comes with a USB drive for installing their software. After reading reviews of this printer over the DYMO and ROLLO models I have to say it does not disappoint!

I’m still new to it but I know I can do amazing things with her.

Was using a standard printer before and had to cut the labels and tape on. This munbyn is a total game changer. Prints super fast and Accurate and I just peel the sticker off and put on my package. Love it!!! This is definitely a need for any small business.
4,Initially I had a few problems setting it up on my MAC Book but I got it. I’m glad I purchased & I love the color
5,It’s perfect for the amount of labels I print. Only had it for a day so far. Works great and was a super easy setup! Would recommend buying.
3,You have to subscribe to a site to use machine and even though you set it up to print on a circle it does not.
5,Perfect for my small business skips a couple of my round thermal stickers when I print a high quantity but thats probably user error
5,Came in super quickly setup was quick and the customer support is on the ball! makes a super cute little label and is easy to mess with and change settings.
5,I did lots of research on thermal shipping printers and after a few months I decided on this one. It works great and it’s pretty too! This has a 3 year warranty which was the longest warranty I found on a printer like this. If you are looking for a great printer then look no more!! Buy Buy Buy!
1,Terrible Terrible horrible thing. Been fighting to get it to work since i bought it. I was skeptical so i only bought 1000 thermal papers to print. Most of witch were wasted trying to get it to print. Good luck with support. Support cant call and lucky to get it working for 3 days at a time. Its surly broken now after 6 months and made it through 500 successful prints. I will never buy a product on line like this because your stuck with problems. I am headed to sams club now to replace. I hope I will feel better when I take a hammer to this terrible device i cant return. At least at sams if i don't like it I can return it. I miss brick and mortar stores that help the old fashioned way. I wanted to make a quick video but now its printing a half of a print and then feeding the entire stack of sheets through the printer. Honestly its just easier to hand write your packing slips if your doing 10 or less a day and wait in line at post office. Plus you get to improve your hand writing skills.Update ! I total got ripped off. I was foolish enough to send it back on my dime. Never heard anything. Im reluctant to buy on amazon or online at all. How the word has changed. Cheap products delivered fast. Buyer beware. Wheres The quality ? 1 Year warranty what a joke. Buy  a rollo thermal printer Been great so far !!!
5,Good quality.
5,Love it works great!!! Totally recommend.
5,I tried a couple different printers for thermal 4x6 labels - shipping labels.  The other label printers would always miss the edges and print over 2 labels - wasting both or ejecting a blank label before printing one - wasting one every time.This machine knows what labels are in it and prints perfectly so far - every time
5,I honestly like this printer! It’s easy to use and it’s so cute and it doesn’t take up too much room and it’s amazing at printer many labels. Tech support is awesome! I highly recommend this printer
5,Easy to set up and use. Perfect for my small business!  I will order this brand again!
5,Wow!! Such an amazing printer! Although I don’t have much to compare it to personally I know I made the right choice! I know people who use rollo and they have tons of issues with it and I can say I’ve been using it for about a month now and no complaints!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone !!!
5,Very helpful tech support and good quality printer.
5,I love this printer. My printer stopped working after only a month. I reached out to customer service and after sending them a video of what was wrong they sent me a new printer a few days later. Great customer service Highly recommend.
5,
5,Does the job! Very easy to use just make sure the settings for the sizing is correct!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love how they have many color options not just white or gray like others label printers. I love how the printer is small and compact easy for travel. Nice people to help. Would definitely recommend
5,Overall the product was easy to install and begin printing within minutes. Took me a few tries to find the sweet spot for printing settings but since then it has worked perfectly highly recommend!
5,Super easy setup. Great print quality. The labels print out very quickly so printing a lot is a breeze. I did Have one problem of my labels continuing to feed blank pages through after printing. Messaged customer service on FB and was helped by Martin. He was OUTSTANDING and very efficient. He made sure I was Back up and running immediately. I wiukd Recommend this printer to anyone.
5,I have my own business so I started looking into a shipping label printer to make my trips to the post office much easier. That’s when I found this Munbyn printer. Shipping was incredibly fast. I ordered it on June 10th and received it on the 13th. The packaging was great. There wasn’t any damages to the box nor my product. The setup was completely easy to understand. This has been a game changer for my business and I recommend it.
5,It was our saving grace it gave us more time to do so many more fun things other than taping labels to all of our packages!!! We love it and it was easy to use don’t forget to order labels and the thing that holds the labels as well!
4,a little hard to set up but once you do its great! it prints my labels SO FAST and thy are great quality!
4,Easy to use. However I wish it gave better instructions on label printing.
1,I got this printer on sale and thought it would be a good deal for shipping from home. I was WRONG.  From the start the software is hard to use. A lot of their guides show stuff on a Mac and not PC or the other way around. Tech support doesn't help their English is rudimentary at best and they refuse to give clear steps without you personally emailing them your PDF. They do not believe you about your file being good.  They want to blame it on you.  They rely on using Adobe software that DOES NOT WORK and then blame you for the reason it doesn't. I have experience with software and troubleshooting and they are a NIGHTMARE. They say they are compatible with UPS but UPS doesn't recognize them and their tech support couldn't help. They refused to explain how sending a file to them would help at all. They avoid answering your question directly and use canned responses. In order to use the printer at all you have to download and edit EVERY SINGLE FILE. It is not easy or convenient.
5,Love it! It was easy to set up and prints super fast which makes it so fun to use. I uproot to make Shipping labels but I’m having fun making sticker also!
5,This is perfect!! I purchased this for my Etsy store and I could t be more happy. It’s adorable conveniently and easy to use. A USB drive Mac USB adapter and stack of stickers were included which I was unaware of and found super thoughtful of them to include.
3,Works fine. Just does not print as clear as I needed it to. I was printing stickers with lots of small words so it was blurry.
1,Was really excited to use this but it is very confusing and does not have any instructions whatsoever. I also bought it so I could make shipping labels on USPS.com but I come to find out that you cannot print shipping labels from USPS.com at all. You have to screenshot and edit and go through a bunch of steps to be able to print out on this printer for that website What a hassle! you buy a printer that's supposed to be easy to print a shipping label not so you have to edit and screenshot labels to be able to print them on it.
5,Awesome product!
5,This is my 1st print label machine and I simply love it!!! It has definitely added professionalism to our business of shipping products.  I highly recommend as the set up was simply simple if that makes sense. Printing labels for shipping has become my new friend using this brand. Kudos to this company. Thanks again so much for the added enhancement of my business!!!
5,Needed a printer to use for e-commerce postage/shipping labels and this one was perfect. Connects easily to laptop and prints labels from the multiple postage software companies I use. Quality of barcode printing on labels is excellent better than expected.  I'd highly recommend.
5,Print quality is great connection and setup to Windows 10 was super easy! Driver was on the provided USB drive. I use this printer with ShipStation. I bought the Munbyn label stand and use the large rolls of 4x6 labels I get free from UPS!
5,Absolutely love my printer! The quality is amazing and really easy to use and set up. Super compact and takes up little to no space and the printing is super fast. Definitely Recommend it!
5,Prints USPS perfectly but can't get it to print UPS labels.
5,I had to put another review im starting to hate this printer i just had to print only 2 labels and it wasted like 20 labels the tracking code did not came entirely no matter what size i put. It wastes 20 labels and then a good one comes out. I have a mac so if any of you has the solution for this please help
5,I totally recommend it for any small business owners. Very easy to use. Also customer service is great very helpful for any questions you may have about installing the printer.
3,It's a nice product the directions were not very clear it took a couple of weeks to figure out how to correctly print the shipping labels on this type of machine but once I figured it out it works just fine.
3,I received an international plug with my device  not a US plug like pictured.  I contacted the company about it but still haven't heard anything.  Really frustrated I am not comfortable using an adapter constantly.The print quality is ok my prints came out really pixilated and I had to do some research to find out that others had this problem and that you have to open your images as a PDF to get them to print.
5,LOVE this printer! It's now my little R2-D2 unit. Prints CRAZY fast. I slowed it to mid-speed for a cleaner print. But even top speed works great for FedEx labels. Printed about 1500 labels over 4 days. Not ONE error or mishap. I will NEVER inkjet print a shipping label+pouch again!  BTW easy interface driver and setup for my MacBook Pro.
5,This label printer is a great size not to big and not too small. The instructions were easy to follow for the set up and I can appreciate the extra labels that were gifted to us!
5,NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT IT. WORKS GREAT!
5,It’s so perfect. It prints fast and clear! The pink color is so beautiful and it is so compact. It fits perfect in my work area. So far I’ve printed my shipping labels and packing slips can’t wait to experiment with stickers.
5,This is exactly what I've needed for postal labels and other aspects of my business. AND IT'S PINK!  EXTRA BONUS AWESOME!  Great instructions and easy to use.  Print quality is excellent and HELP DESK is very responsive.
5,Makes printing so easy with no ink needed! Streamlines my shipping process and makes it so much less work. Definitely work the purchase

5,This thermal printer makes life so much easier I love the ease of use with it. The installation was relatively simple. I’d just like to know how to straighten the prints and make the quality a tad bit better.
5,I absolutely love this pink thermal printer. It’s the perfect size for my home office. Prints great fairly easy to set up instructions are pretty clear and you get 10 free labels to start off with. Overall extremely happy with my purchase.
1,I bought this based on how much people raves about the quality and how simple it was to use but I’ve had nothing but wasted time and supplies with it. I can’t get figure out how to make it print properly despite watching multiple videos and trial and error as people have said is inevitable at this point. My honest opinion is that the money is not worth it and I will be sending it back. The fonts/ simple pictures show up grainy and bumpy making them difficult to read at some spots. I’ve had to redesign with new fonts and still not up to standards for what I paid.I have read that this printer is Apple OS friendly and not Microsoft friendly so maybe that’s why I’m having so many issues.
5,Love it. So easy to work it! I love making my own labels
1,They don't make it clear that it only prints in black and white. that's really disappointing -- a lot of money went down the drain for this. And the set up is difficult and it doesn’t even work.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Saw this label printed and HAD to have it cus pink! Its super cute AND it’s very easy to use and setup and print quality is fine.
5,Super easy to use. Easy to connect to laptop. Helped me ship my orders faster than printing them off on sticky paper.
5,This is great for use when you have a small business it is very easy to install and print quality is great.
5,Much more affordable than Zebra or other brands. Once you identify the drivers it is easy to use. Quality is as good as others. Seems to be the same engine and firmware as a few other more expensive brands.  Good customer service if you ever needed.
5,Perfect!
5,It’s the perfect size . I plugged  it in  I adjusted my settings  on my sales platform. It works great.
5,The print quality takes a bit of fiddling but works as intended. It's so pink and cute!
5,This does exactly what we'd hoped for our EBay Business. Fast consistent printing. We had trouble setting up the printer but Munbyn customer service is very responsive. We tried AnyLabel 4x6 Labels but they got stuck again and again - Betckey labels work well however. Overall high quality product.
5,The printer is extremely easy to use. The instructions are easy to follow and it’s worked just fine since I started using it. The only problems are that the sizes are in mm (so if you’re using 4x6 labels your settings should be 100x150mm) and the cords are a bit bulky and tend to get in the way. Other than that it works great !
5,I absolutely love this printer! I bought the label range printer back in the beginning of 2020 and had problems with it. I replaced it with the munbyn and am super satisfied with it! ☺️ Great purchase
5,I use this printer for my small business it’s so easy to install! I use it for thank you stickers shipping labels and so much more!
5,Easy to figure. Never had a problem and makes my shipping’s super fast and easy.
4,I love the printer although if I darken the label it freezes. Other than that it's making my life so much easier!
5,This printer is so cute and will work well with my office set up. It’s compatible with my MacBook Air which is perfect. And it’s very small compact and easy to use. 10/10 Recommend.
5,Very happy with it does what I need it to do
5,very easy to work with and it's fast printing and has a very clear print out come I just love it I'm glad I was able to buy it
5,It's a good product the only cons i'm seeing is you cannot use it without using a desktop/laptop.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The quality of printing is excellent.
5,I love the color and size. I haven’t set it up yet since I’m waiting for my MAC to come back from the shop.
5,The munbyn 2.0 is Very user friendly and it prints very fast it was easy to set up and install I did have to play around with the settings once it was ready to be printed in order for it to work. It’s small and compact so it doesn’t take much space.
5,I recently purchased this label printer and after reading all of the reviews I am so excited to get started using it. I will update my review as necessary.
5,This pink printer is everything!!! Glad I bought it.
5,I like everything about it the print quality also easy to operate I use it for making my shipping label also sticker label for  my small Business very helpful
5,Before buying this I was going to purchase a DYMO. But I am soo glad I didn't. MUNBYN is really easy to use especially for a new business owner like myself and more importantly it saved me some money. I would definitely recommend this for any and all business owners.
5,I put off buying a label printer because I’m frugal.. why did I wait so long?! This label printer is amazing it’s super quick connects easily the set up took minutes. I love this thing!!!
5,Best purchase ever for my small business
5,I really love my printer it’s easy to use and most of all it’s pink and the give u free labels and other gifts that come with it
5,Perfect for small businesses like myself! Its helped me out a lot while trying to get orders out quickly. The labels have come out great so far!
5,Extremely easy set up with my windows laptop! And it's pink so beyond my love of the compact size it is pretty to look at
3,It gets the job done. However it was difficult (just as others stated) to set up. There were writing mistakes in the manual; descriptions were not as clear as they stated it would be. Communication with the vendor was not the greatest.Overall I'd give it a 2 star because it does work but we definitely think it's below average. I wish I had purchased the Dymo 4XL printer instead.
5,Just bought this printer and set it up. So far it has been easy to use and prints great. I love that it is pink!
5,Perfect for labels but gave 3 stars  cause the 4*8 don't fit snug and the can print to the sideid if it goes crooked. Make sure it's feeding straight
5,Once you get over the learning curve it’s a great machine.
5,Love it!
5,I  ordered this item during Prime week and I am so happy that I did. I was looking for a quality label printer that didn't break the bank and the MUNBYN has definitely lived up to my expectations!
5,At times font prints a hair light but the barcodes are always dark and clear but great affordable option for the DIYer or small business owner. Easy to print and pop on packages and definitely streamlined the shipping process.
5,This is the cutest little printer . It is just what I needed for my small business. Easy to set up a well.
5,I love my printer! It was very quick to set up and start printing! It works perfectly with pirate ship too!
5,Easy to set up and use! Love it more than my other label printer. The color is just perfect for my office!
5,Great packaging and super easy setup. Able to print in minutes. Prints labels fast and quick calibration. Absolutely love it.
5,Aesthetically its very nice.  It was easy to install (both the device and software).  Haven't really used it long enough to judge its longevity.  So far very pleased.
5,Love the pink and set up was easy! Makes creating labels for my business so much easier and saves a lot of time.
5,Super easy to use labels look great. Easy to set up. I love how small/portable the printer is.
5,I love my printer! It has made packaging orders so much more efficient!
5,The printer was an easy set up. It’s so small and fits perfectly anywhere and doesn’t take up much space.
5,great print quality just don’t like I have to sc to get label correct size
5,Great pink color and very compact for desktop usage! The test print was quick and of great quality.
5,I love this printer! It’s my second printer and I just HAD to get pink. Will always use MUNBYN!
2,I didn’t realize that it wasn’t able to pair to chromebook so I have to send it back which is disappointing because it was soo cute.
5,Amazing printer I wish I would of bought one years ago. Definitely worth the investment and I highly recommend.
5,Love the color! Haven’t had the chance to officially print anything on it yet but cosmetic wise its a 10/10 for me!
4,Received the product very quickly! It was larger than I expected and in good shape.
5,Easy set up!!! And I just love that it prints super fast! Print quality is great. Definitely recommend!!
5,Absolutely love it. Makes having a small business so much easier and time saver!
5,Works fine. Followed directions in video to setup on my MacBook. It would be awesome to have a Bluetooth version so I don’t have to plug it in to usb. I chose this because you can use either roll or stack label.
5,Fast printing and easy to install. I created a preset and was done.
5,I bought this for 4 x 6 mailing labels.  It is easy to set up and use.  The printing is very fast. This  will save me a considerable amount of time compared to a printer.
5,So easy to set up and use. Great print quality life changing for printing my eBay sales! Highly recommend!
5,I love it! That’s so practical for my business
5,so far so good! so fast and easy to use. sometimes it can print a little splotchy in spots but still readable!
5,I love it and the convenience of how small it is is perfect for my desktop!
5,Prints labels great! Easy to set up too!
5,i recently found out that this printer is not compatible with my laptop i need a refund instead.
5,This label printer came fast and was super easy to set up. Just plug in and download the drivers that comes on the usb.  I made one adjustment to the size and density. I’m done!
5,Very easy to operate I use it to print eBay labels and it's so much faster than my previous printer so glad I decided to purchase this it's definitely going to make things a lot easier
5,Love it ! It’s color is so aesthetic really easy to use.
1,UDATED TO ADDThe company was very responsive in trying to help me figure things out however I have already returned it. I am out the money for the 2 types of labels it ruined or I ruined trying to figure it out a $149 program to try to use the machine & more for a $600 laptop that I don’t really need for anything else. So I was completely aggravated with it. I’m going to try a wireless that is comparable with my IOS phone.I am so disappointed in this machine. I have spent a fortune in labels trying to find a compatible program. I also had to buy a laptop because it is the only way to use this piece of junk. I’m definitely returning it but I’m out the money for all of the labels I ruined trying to use it.
2,This printer is always malfunctioning and giving print error messages. It must be turned off and then turned on before every use. The printer says "offline" even though it's not internet enabled. It's a cheap alternative to a thermal printer but you get what you pay for.  I wouldn't buy it again.
5,I love it it works perfectly will save me a lot of money
5,This little printer works great! I had to troubleshoot printing from PayPal but after that I’ve had no issues.
5,The product works really well and doesn't take a lot of space on the desk.
1,I was so excited for this printer but the package I received was missing items including the set up USB. I tried following the manufacturers instructions for set up but whenever the printer is plugged in it just beeps- the light never turns red or green so I can't even get to the first step of set up or feed the paper through. I have tried all the trouble shooting instructions from the website and am using the provided power cord (the only cord included in my package). I am past the amazon return window or I would be returning. Have reached out to the manufacturer and will update if the issue is resolved.
5,So far it’s been amazing! Just received and already making great labels.
1,Read the instructions did everything in the manual and it doesn't explain where to go to print your labels. Lost my money on this crap
5,Fantastic! Love this printer. It’s changed my life and helps my business move along faster and more efficiently
5,Love this little gem. No ink needed! Easy set up. Turquoise is super cute as pictured
2,Label prints very faint with missing text and not readableI’ve tried every setting found in every video I could find onlineHad to email support because they don’t have a phone numberSupport did not address my issue but rather answered a question I did not askEmailing back and forth is frustrating and a phone call makes better sense in this situation but not an optionSo now I’m stuck with a label printer that doesn’t work well and no way to get any actual help
5,Compact and gets the job done. And I love pink.
5,Excelente me encanto!!! Es muy fácil usar la recomiendo 100%
5,Awesome printer. Easy set up and easy to operate.
5,Works great.
1,The thermal printer was shipped out in a POLY MAILER! I was unable to use it because it was broken. Imagine the disappointment especially since I was planning on using it for my business.
5,Nice little printer!
5,Very nice product and great customer service.
5,Super easy to use. I love this printer. I tried the other brand and it was not great at all.
5,I was skeptical because it is technically a no name brand printer but it works great for etsy pirateship and bar tender.
5,Excellent little label printer easy to setup and get up and running in few minutes.  Continuous printing is great using this little printer.
5,Best printer ever
5,Muy buena compra recomendable.
5,Quick setup and easy to use
5,Super stylish and easy to use
5,I can’t believe I went so long without this product!  Easy set up and prints my labels out in seconds!!
5,Easy to use print quality is awesome.
5,Really easy to use. Works for all printing sizes although I use it mainly for my 4x6 shipping labels.
5,Once I figured out the setup everything was a breeze. Prints address or retail shelf label as well as mailing labels
5,Easy and great printer
3,Good
5,Great purchase!
1,This printer will give you issues consistently.One day it works the next is doesn’t.It does not work more often than not.Customer service is zero help and hard to get ahold of. Wish I could return.
5,Love this product. Helps my small business run smoothly
5,I love my printer I'm using it to start my at home business would recommend it to anybody. love it
5,Printer works well
3,We have to sometimes print the label three times to get a legible label. We've let it warm up to see if that would help. .it didn't.
1,I bought it after seeing so many compliments but I didn't expect the print quality to be so bad! Can't see clearly! Tried it many times and it's the same.
5,Awesome
5,Love this printer! It is genuinely good quality prints Whats needed and best part is that it doesn’t break down 😭 literally all I’ve needed for my business!
5,I love mine!!
2,Not wireless and very complicated to use and customer support not available fast enough
5,Fácil y práctica
1,just bought a new one in hopes maybe the first one was defective..... same problems. this seriously shouldn't be this hard. we have plenty of printers here. we know how to install printers. we build websites..... this thing is a little pink nightmare. i had high hopes that the brand new one would work.
5,Love
5,prints USPS and UPS labels perfectly and super easy to set up!
5,Great printer
1,day 2 and still cant print not one sticker. what the heck my hp printer works better  went through all the instructions but they give you ones for shipping what about the stickers.  I might as well as get my money back and go to office depo llike i had intended to do.
1,I have never reviewed a product on Amazon but this product brought me out of the woodwork to do so. Don’t waste your time and money on this hunk of garbage. Spend the extra money save yourself a headache and go get a rollo (rollo if you’re seeing this and would like to send me free stuff hmu). Upon arrival I followed all instructions and got the red light of death. No trouble shooting could save it. The printer couldn’t determine the correct label size even after repeated attempts with their instructions. Their customer service was equally as rancid. They get 1 star not because they are worthy of any merit but because I am unable to choose zero. Go eat one Munbyn.
1,I just ordered this and was super stoked on being able to print and ship from home !Having horrible experience with it. I had a acer chrome and mumbyn isn’t compatible with chrome os so I had to either purchase a different laptop or retuen printer. Guess what I did ? Yeah I purchased a new laptop to be able to use this damn thing. After hours of breaking my head trying to get this damn thing to work I used up most of the labels because settings are all messed up and the lettering on labels are too faint. Usps won’t take them because they won’t scan !!! I’m so annoyed and disappointed over all I’ve spent $500 just for this printer to work out for me but if failed!
5,easy to use excelent product!
1,I ordered this because I thought it would be a great addition to my office...... Well after two days of trying watching video after video and my Mac still won't connect. It says it was installed successfully but my Mac won't find it when I try adding as a printer. Will be returning.
5,Very convenient & easy set-up
1,I screwed up and waited too long to try and set it up and now cant return but this printer is impossible to work with. I looked up how to videos and still not working! So frustrating!
1,No matter what i do this printer keeps printing SO BADLY MY LABELS!!!! With holes and scratchs i waste SO much labels because it prints well at the 6th try  DO NOT BUY
1,BUYERS BEWARE!! returned for refund due to the poor customer service support. Spent 3 days and numerous hours with customer service to get it to print the label to the actual. With the added situation of the customer service being located in Korea trying to get someone to answer phone or emails became difficult if not impossible. Be prepared that if you do connect with someone communicating in English was an larger issue
2,The color and the design is niceI really wanted to keep this but it was not printing the whole label. Eventually I had to return it I lost money on restocking fee.
1,I was so excited about this label printer when it arrived I immediately took it out read the instructions and started hooking every thing up. Just for it to not work at all! No DING No lights. Absolutely nothing. There isn’t a number to call so I went through Amazon for a replacement. When the replacement comes and if it works then I will update my review. Today I am disappointed for 145 dollars there shouldn’t be any type of issues
2,It was hard to figure it out at first. Have problems with it shutting down while it’s printing. I have wasted a ton of paper because of this. I print different formats in a day so I think that’s why. Needs some improvements for sure.
5,Amazing printer!
1,For the price you pay there shouldn't be any trouble shooting issues and for me there were. It instantly began printing blank labels.
1,Installed the drive to my PC. I have followed all the troubleshooting guides and I can’t get my printer to work at all. Nothing will print and continues to say error even though it’s connected to the right port.
1,At first I was excited about this printer. It was a little tricky finding the correct settings to print through multiple selling apps. I have used this for 3 different platforms. The print quality is not the best. My printer bleeds out too much ink that it makes unable to be scanned. I can never get them to scan at the usps locations. It also prints only on every other label. So many labels get wasted :(
1,It was printing into the label sticker either it was to big or to small I tried so many time that I finish almost half my sticker just by testing
1,Unless you enjoy being frustrated and annoyed I would stay away from this machine! Have attempted to contact support many times but no answer. Trying to print on the 2x2 labels but there is no option for this in the drop down menu. The set up guide has links to videos however the links are broken. The program they recommend you use cost $12 a month. Huge disappointment!
1,It seemed great initially and now after a few months it’s useless. I’ve uninstalled reinstalled and it gives me nothing but problems. Don’t waste your money
1,As much as I tried to like this I was absolutely disappointed in not only the lack of support but also the painful installation of this device. At first it seemed like an easy set up however after ten minutes of trying to find the location of this file it was nowhere to be found. After trying to turn on the machine I’ve soon discovered that it doesn’t even turn on. At all. Requested a refund
1,Stopped working after a week
1,The only first label is fine the rest is terrible. I tried any times… Please see the photo. Really upset.
1,This product is very complicated very hard to use and Tech support was crap  . I’m super upset and disappointed
1,What a nightmare! The printer didn’t even turned on. I changed the cables and it didn’t work or was recognized by my computer.It is such a low quality item. The user guide even had grammar errors! The tech support number is a Chinese number that doesn’t get anywhere.I’m totally disappointed and frustrated! I’m packing it now and returning it to buy another brand.
1,Would no work with my equipment and returned. Ask for refund. No refund after 5 weeks.
2,Even with online help we couldn't get it to work. I returned and got another brand.
1,Doesn't work now. Can I  change new one?
1,As others have mentioned I tried various margins scaling etc. with my labels for Amazon FBA shipments and I cannot get these labels to scan.  It prints the bar codes extremely thick to the point where they "blur" into the other lines making it difficult (if impossible) to scan.  They really need to fix the scaling of the drivers so it prints an easily scannable barcode for the major carriers.
1,This item is trash! The instructions are all over the place! After wasting hours figuring it out it literally printed half of one sheet and did nothing else. A complete waste of money and time. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
1,If you value your sanity you will stay away from this thing. I broke my nerves trying to figure this thing out. The directions provided are so basic - that you find yourself reseting this thing multiple times - and playing with it for an hour just to get one label printed. No Thank You!! If you aren’t computer savvy this is an uphill battle.
1,ive ordered this months ago and different label stickers for logos and it does not tell you the size adjustment. printing either to big or to small also skips labels. very upset I bought this. waste of money.
1,The writing on the label is spacey and the bar code smears USPS won't even accept my packages when I use the printer. It won't format with my windows computer to print out on the entire label it only prints on half or less of the label.I missed my return window not worth the money.
1,I just brought this label shipping printer three weeks ago and it’s a headache. Not easy to setup. I also tried reaching out to support and they are no help. So I will be retuning this today!
1,Does not work
2,I wouldn’t recommend this for beginners
1,If I could give this zero stars I would. When I first started using this printer several months ago it worked like a charm. Now when I try to print 4x6 shipping labels the printer prints 3/4 of the label and then completely stops. I’ve wasted 20 or more labels already trying to troubleshoot and to no avail.
1,If you have a MacBook do yourself a favor and don’t buy this printer it’s so complicated to use and never prints right. Every time I think I have the settings right it just goes right back to not printing right again. It’s so frustrating especially after spending almost $200.
1,The color of this printer is very attractive to me! But it doesn’t work well! I decided to return it! I hope I can buy it for sale and delivery on Amazon! The response is not very good!
1,Won't print anything. I installed the drivers and it printed 1 time. After that it just says "Error - Printing" and refuses to print anything. Not a very helpful message. Complete junk. I guess I will return it.
1,I bought this thermal printer to assist in shipping packages for my online business.  Others talked it up during Amazon Prime Days.  However I could not get the device to work with Stamps.com for anything despite trying for almost two hours.  I will be setting up a return tomorrow.  I had such high hopes for it.
1,I could never get it to work. Called tech support  they tried hard to help.  But I returned it
1,Didn’t work it was defective 😞
1,after several attempt to fix the printer to print quality is bad . disappointed
1,It wasn't the easiest thing to set up.
5,At first I couldn’t figure out the printer. Now that I figure it out some what I love it. I love that it don’t run out of ink. Now I just need to order some labels & etc.
1,Wouldn't connect I downloaded uninstalled this stupid printer more times than I desired and still nothing better I didn't want to return it but was let with no choice.
5,I reached out through whatsapp and the customer support was very helpful and even reached out to make sure I was not having trouble with the printer! There is so much you can do with this printer it’s amazing! Very convenient and does not take up too much space. Also can print very fast.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have had mine for months now and absolutely love it! Beginner friendly. I have never owned one before and was able to set it up on my own pretty easily. Prints very fast and the quality comes out great every time. The only advice I can give is check your print size before printing. Highly recommend!
2,Doesn’t print full layout only did it one time
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 in love with my new thermal print *pink pink pink* thanks
1,Disliked that I changed settings many times and still isn’t working
1,iv used it a few times fine now its not printing at all from top to bottom down the middle.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 If you’re a business owner or are into doing crafty things you Must get this printer! The quality is unmatched and so easy to use and set up! It adds that perfect finishing touch to all my orders!!!!
1,Good value does not print clearly at all very low resolution scanners had a hard time even reading the bar
1,It stopped working after a month of use no tech support either.
1,This product would never print after countless hours with tech-support. Wouldn’t work
1,Do not purchase if you have a chromebook really wish i would have none before purchasing.
1,When printing 4 x 6 shipping labels they all came out splotchy and faint even after I tried all the troubleshooting methods outlined it the product manual.
1,Really not the greatest printer very hard to work with and I personally don’t like it at all. Print quality is poor and set up is made for Europe not US
1,Unit didn’t work. Very complicated and wouldn’t download either. Went with a different easier to use Dymo.
1,Had the hardest time trying to adjust different size labels to print with NO INSTRUCTIONS So I returned it.
5,Printer is super compact  easy to use and install on your computer. The print quality is perfect. Really recommend this printer.
1,Worked the one time only after I opened it and now won't work.
1,No matter the tips or tricks the printer would not work. I even tried on two different systems which did not help at all. Would not recommend this product
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I bought this printer to help me label things for my small business.  I liked that you could choose different label options for sizes shapes and colors!Now I want to use this to label everything!!Super easy to install the driver on my MacBook and on my iMac.  I haven’t tried it on my iPad yet so I’m not sure if you can print from there or an iPhone.I design a label in another program save it and then print.  The printer is so fast it prints many labels in just a few seconds.I recently used the Munbyn to make labels for a taco bar at our family reunion - dish name and allergens.  The labels did not run or smear and held up great to hear moisture and many hands.I love this thermal printer and the cute colors!I purchased the printer several types of labels and the label stand.I love it.
5,Making labels for my business is awesome
1,I CAN NOT get this thing to print my label and everything is installed correctly and the labels and turned the right way this pushed my website launch back another week i will be returning
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 We’ve had this printer for awhile now used it plenty of time for shipping labels and stickers to seal packages. We’re very satisfied with it as it gets the job done. The only thing I have to mention about this printer is that you need to calibrate it if you want to center it which can be time consuming and because this version is the wired one you need to keep it around your desktop/laptop in order to print anything. But overall it’s a very nice printer to start out with.
1,It still will not print my labels correctly- perhaps time to return
1,A very bad working label printer that wasted my money and time and also malfunction very quickly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Best thing is that it's thermal so no more toner smudges for me! It's small and can easily be moved anywhere if you're like me and don't stay in one are lol. For printer setup tips they have videos and Instagram which has been helpful. Once you set it up and tweak print settings it's easy to use! I bought the blue one which is more dusty blue than pastel but still cute. I love that they're coming out with cute new sticker shapes and colors. Please come out with more pastel colors like a light yellow! 🙏😊
1,My bun has poorcustomerservice
1,It's not compatible with my HP laptop
1,
1,Does not print well with my system. I called them but it could not be solved
1,Does not work it doesn’t connect with my Mac Pro I tried everything
5,great product
5,Perfect for small business but would love a colored ink in this very same brand because of my labels
5,Just get it! I will try to add a photo but this adorable little machine has absolutely changed my labeling! I feel more professional and I love that I never need to purchase ink again no dry time and it’s super easy to use! I use it for my cookie labels thank you stickers and shipping labels. Set up was fast too.  I got the full package (labels printer and scale) and it makes my business run much smoother. Seriously just get it.
5,This small thermal label printer comes in so many different colors for you to choose! I bought the pink one to match my office decor and it is so aesthetically pleasing and works like a charm. It doesn’t take up much space but makes printing out labels for just about anything that much easier! 5/5 would definitely buy again and recommend!!!

1,Spent over 8 hours downloading and redownloading turning off and restarting and rebooting a million times to get this label printer to work. It does not show up on my MacBook and doesn't work. Too expensive to sell a product whose software is so crappy. Frustrating but will return and find another product.
1,thermal printer doesn't work and if it decides to print it takes for ever to print or prints multiple pages. Save your money and buy the rollo

I have used this printer for printing shipping labels personalizing my packaging supplies and for stickers. I would recommend this thermal printer to any business looking to save time and money rather than using a bulky printer paper ink and tape. I like how it fits right beside my computer saves me money on ink and  allows for faster production time. I pair my printer with munbyn 4x6 labels.

5,I absolutely love my munbyn! I couldn't imagine my small business without it. It seriously helps my business and my productivity. I wish I had gotten one a year ago!

3,Label got jammed and now the other labels I print aren't fully black and they are difficult to read

4,So if I follow the instruction from the manual it always waste the first page in the roll. Here's how to solve it.1. Have one single separate sheet handy.2. Open the cover put a single sheet on the roller close the lid. This will make the printer spit out that page and the light turn red blinking into "run out of paper" mode.3. Feed the roll into the back of the printer (while the cover is still closed and red light blinking) it will feed the paper in and reverse back so you DON't waste the first sheet every time you want to change the roll or put them away.
5,I got this for Christmas and it’s wonderful! I opened my small business in September and was ready to create a more professional look for my packages - this was the solution and I couldn’t be happier! It works easily and efficiently! MUST BUY!

I purchased the pink one for my cookie business and I love that I can print all of my own labels for our business!  The print quality is terrific and it prints super fast!I  had a few questions when I first started using it but I was able to find all of the answers right on their website!
5,Me gusto mucho es fácil de usar y me gusta por que no hay que comprar tinta .La recomiendo.
4,There are things I should have noted about this printer or would have liked to have known when I saw it.  It will work with my Mac but requires downloading software for my computer and a wired connection rather than using AirPrint which is pretty standard these days:  so we're also talking about adding more wires to the desk area.  It does not come with a small supply of thermal label paper which is available where you shop for office supplies.  Print quality is not up to what you'd see from a USPS automated postal machine as the dots are not as fine.  I do like the label size very much and the printer itself does not take up much real estate on your desk but you'll want it to have a permanent home there rather than just taking it out and using it when you need a label so this is definitely aimed toward business users much more than someone who just wants to create labels from time to time.  For somebody working out of a home office or with a home based business I think it's a good machine.  The pink printer leans toward a tan hue rather than the rosey pink which I see on my monitor.Thank you for reading my review.  I hope you found it helpful.
4,This Pink Label Printer MUNBYN USB Label Printer Maker for Shipping Packages Labels 4x6 Thermal Printer is an exceptionally unique looking thermal printer take a second and look to see if you can figure out what makes this so different. Right. It's freaking PINK!Anyone with a young daughter will know the joy(pain) that the barrage of pink everything can have on a grown man some embrace the pink as a sign of pride as a girl dad but yet others will cringe in disgust at even the suggestion.Other than the visual pizzazz this is a standard basic thermal label printer. Print performance and speed are average compared to other label printers I've tested but the overall footprint of this printer is a bit larger than the competition.  Depending on your desk space this could be a good thing or a bad thing. For me it was a bad thing as I had to do some rearranging to get this to fit close enough to plug into my desktop but that isn't really the fault of this product but just something I thought to mention for others.Overall the Barbie dreamhouse-ification of this thermal printer is wholly unnecessary and super necessary all at the same time. This may not be right for most people but this will no doubt be a big hit for others. 4/5 stars.

It’s a timesaver and a game changer and I absolutely love it.  I’m using a MacBook pro and I love that it came with the adapter that I need for the USB.

This printer has been a life saver for me and my small business ! I am definitely happy with my purchase and recommend this for every small business owner ! Easy to set up and use the labels !

5,I have a small business and wanted to be able to personalize my Thank You stickers and be able to print shipping labels. After doing much research I stumbled into this Munbyn Thermal Printer and never looked back! Not only is it aesthetically pleasing to the eyes (pink color) it's also affordable and so many choices in labels! I purchased the 4x6 shipping labels as well as the multicolored 2.25x1.25 labels. I've been so pleased with everything. Not having to worry about ink is also a big plus for me.I did have a small hiccup when setting up the 2.25 labels but when I went online to the Munbyn website it had a video that literally takes you step by step. So informative and got me printing in less than 5 mins!If you have a business or just like printing labels this is it for you! ADD TO CART NOW!

Ships really fast as well mine got here in only a few days I use it for my hobbies/business and I love all the different ways I can spice up my packaging!
5,The munbun thermal printer is amazing and a life saver! It saves me so much time on shipping out orders! And if you ever have questions just message them and hey are there to help you with any questions that you may have! I would definitely buy another one if I had to.

It does print black and white which is perfect not just for mailing labels but also to different designs. Your creativity is limitless with these cute pink label printer. Worth the price as it saves you time packaging and saves you money in the long run in printing on thermal paper. 🥰
5,I absolutely love my little printer. Easy to set up and when I had a question tech support responded immediately. I totally recommend this printer

5,This printer is easy to use easy to setup and prints with incredible fast and clear quality. I am a small business owner and have already been able to print fun labels with the touch of a button - feels like magic! Also love how many fun colors there are to choose from for labels both round and rectangle! I could not be happier with my purchase. Highly recommend!!!
4,The printer was easy to set up with my surface pro. I haven't installed it for my iPad yet but it came with an adapter to install it. It came with a USB drive that has the installation software. I would definitely recommend looking at the instructions for the set up process. Love the white and pink color. It came with a small stack of labels that was easy to install. I tried the default settings for test print and it comes out clear and easy to read for a standard shipping label. For other test prints maller text appeared blurred and curved parts of my logo were a little pixelated. I wish it had Bluetooth connectivity and was compatible with USPS shipping labels (there is a work around and plenty of YouTube tutorials).  Overall I'm pretty happy with the printer and I think it'll be convenient to use and is small enough to be portable.
5,I love this printer and how it does not require ink. I used to have ink printers and inhaling the ink even in small particles is not good for you. It was also a pain to run out and have to buy a new cartridge. This printer is great for my small business and I can customize my stickers endlessly!
4,It was very easy after I found out how to install online came with no instructions
5,This was so easy to set up and use. My wife has a small online business and she is over the moon with the label printer. Connecting it was so simple and printing even easier. This will change your life if you are a small business owner and hand-writing all of your labels or typing them up. It works especially well when you have a prepaid label that you are printing out. Fabulous!
2,The print is fine but it will work magically and the next it’s printing blanks i re did & re did the restart until it beep 5 times blah blah recalibrated it about 50 times nothing will make it print the size and measurements is all correct I don’t know what to do at this point can anybody help

I don’t even want to know how much money I’ve wasted on ink paper and tape. I’ve only had this thermal printer for a few months but I’ve already fallen in love. I also have the matching scale. What can I say? I’m a sucker for pink! Labels print quickly and are easy to peel and apply to your packages. I’ve also printed branding labels and fragile stickers with this. The possibilities are endless. If you’re still cutting your labels out with a pair of scissors and tape stop! Invest in one of these. I promise life will get easier.
5,I absolutely love this printer! I was debating getting a thermal printer for awhile for my small business but I’m so happy I got this thermal printer! I love how you can either print a bunch of labels at a time or just one at a time. It truly is a time saver since now I don’t have to print out the labels cut them out and then tape them to packages with packing tape. It makes printing labels super efficient and makes the packages look cleaner. I highly recommend! I hope to try out other label printing options with this printer soon!

Its really pretty and it works so well. I use canva to create stickers and it prints it out in the exact font and size. Highly recommend getting it for your business !

With my small business the shipping process is now MUCH faster! No longer having use tape or copy paper etc! At a great price the quality & especially the  color I could not pass up! Was easy to setup & runs super awesome! I have only noticed that the print quality get sometimes spotty but it is rare! Super fast & couldn’t love it more!

Many are expensive and it's a big commitment for a small store on a shoestring budget. I got this thermal printer and was able to set it up within about 30 minutes (if you get stuck there's some good directional videos on youtube). It prints very clearly and you're able to adjust the size of the paper on the same print methods you would normally use for a printer.Having this thermal printer has simplified my shipping process so much! I'm really thankful that I dont have to cut and tape every single label now.
5,Excelente impresora rápida buena calidad y tamaño cómodo.
5,I love my pink thermal printer. Shipping was delayed but the seller kept me apprised along the way with frequent updates. Packaging was great nice study box. Set up is a little out dated. Software is included on a cheap thumb drive and the usb cable is snug sometimes hard to insert into my PC but the device itself prints without a hiccup. Calibration was also a breeze.My package came with a free roll thank you stickers and some 4x6 labels to get started.This device is slightly cheaper than other brands and works just as well. I am happy with my purchase.I was offered a free gift to write a review but declined the gift as I organically recommend the product.
5,Tech support is also very very good

Munbyn was perfect because not only does it work with my website but I am also able to make cute stickers for my packaging AND you get to pick a fun color for your printer!  Definitely recommended!!
5,Excellent everything!!!! This printer is such a game changer for me! Great quality! I love how they gave a link to a video on how to install I’m a visual person so watching the video made it so easy to figure out how to connect it to my iMac! Love thisssssss so much!!! I’m totally obsessed with how pretty the color is.
5,Quick easy and simple set up. There’s a really good video on YouTube that helped me set the printer up to my MAC. So far so good.
5,I’ve heard nothing but great things about thermal printers and have been looking into a few. They are a little pricey but since they don’t require ink you really are saving loads of money in the long run.It was fairly easy to plug in and install on my MacBook. I only had trouble configuring the print settings in Microsoft Word. I was impatient and gave up on Word. Adobe Photoshop let me select the right printing settings 4”x6” for the labels and it printed quickly and perfectly!I would recommend using a label roll holder though. The printer comes with a few labels to sample and they’re stacked flat. The wires in the back got in the way a little but it didn’t effect the printing.It’s also very small and doesn’t take up much space.I’ve been wanting a thermal printer and was lucky enough to win this one from Munbyn. I absolutely would pay full price for it!
5,El producto llegó en perfecto estado y cumple con todo lo que dice la descripción. La instalación además fue super sencilla en 5 minutos ya estaba imprimiendo. Full recomendado!
5,I love this little printer! It was very easy to install and the print quality is great. I use it with pirate ship to print labels from Usps. Just print and stick a lot faster than printing on my regular printer and taping the paper label to the packaging. It saves time space and ink as it is thermal and don’t need ink just the correct labels. You can also order stickers to print with it.
5,I was gifted this amazing label printer as a gift from my brother to help with my small business. Installation was super easy and very accurate instructions. Make sure your settings are set for thr correct dimensions for your printer to print and it will be a breeze. Once you insert your labels the printer recognizes the size which is awesome! I only wish it was Bluetooth but it is perfect!
5,As a medium volume business owner a label printer is essentially a must have for me. And I’ve tried many over the years. Rollo DYMO and many “off brands”.Having a decent base of experience to write this from I have to say this is a very nice printer and a good value too. Comes packaged very nice and includes USB cable and some sample labels! It has been working really great. It prints quickly doesn’t jam and has a very good resolution. Labels come out sharp and always scan just fine. This is literally all that matters when buying a printer!Appearance is also very nice and of course pink!
5,It was very easy to set up and it's so cute. It works really well. No complaints over here.
5,Very easy to set up.  Prints quickly and easily. This product saves me time and makes my order process so much more efficient and professional.  My pink printer brightens up my workspace too! I love it!
5,The best compact printer ever . I absolutely love this printer.  Very easy setup excellent quality and easy installation

Love the ease of changing labels and how fast everything prints. I wish I knew about this printer a year ago when I started my Etsy shop.
5,Super easy and compact
5,I initially added this to my Mac via USB -- the install was really easy didn't install a bunch of junk and it worked quite well.  However I wanted to use it via AirPrint and not connected to my Mac -- so I tried to add it to a raspberry pi and got pretty far (I used their CUPS driver from the Mac + rastertopdf filter) but nothing would work.Going through their marketing page I noticed it said raspberry pi on the page as being supported but I couldn't find the download.  I emailed them and a day or so later got the driver.  One quick install later (I already had CUPS installed on the Raspberry Pi) and re-adding the printer -- and it worked flawlessly!.I would recommend reading the Manual as it's pretty good holding the front button has a couple of options -- depending on how long you hold it and how many beeps.  If you hold it to a single beep it will auto detect the label size (width/gap).I found upping the darkness and slowing it down a bit made for some really nice looking labels.  Love that it stops and is an easy tear.
5,I absolutely love it it’s easy to use and it’s pink 💕💕 100% recommend it
5,The printer was very easy to set up. I love it.
5,I’m so glad I went ahead and bought this it’s easy to use and I love that it’s pink!
5,Quick & easy to install. I was way overdue for a thermal printer so happy with this purchase. Print quality is great.
5,Super easy to set up. I’ve change my workspace to pink gold and white and this was the perfect label maker. I’ve been just making labels for anything since It got delivered. I absolutely love it super convenient and connected easy to my shippo account and Shopify store. Like literally plug and go
5,This type of printer is actually foreign to me. I didn't even know the lingo for the labels used in this type of printer was called "fanfold" labels. I've only had experience with the 4x6 rolls used in Dymo printers. So naturally I also didn't know these types of printers DO NOT house the labels. The labels are fed from the back but sit outside exposed. You can easily make a tray or search for "fanfold label holders" on Amazon. Some holders double as a holder for the rolls too so you can actually use the rolls with this printer as well. I still prefer my Dymo because it's less clutter. But this will be a good back-up for the desktop in my room. I've never had to print in batches so to avoid clutter I won't be setting the fanfold labels behind the printer. I will just feed it one label at a time as I need it.If you are new to this type of printer like me then just do what I did... I searched YT for "munbyn label printer" and there is a good tutorial on it by "ReviewedbyPhil." Secondly go to Munbyn's website directly to download the required drivers.The pricing of this printer is pretty normal and competitive with the rest of the unknown brands. A Dymo 4x6 printer is nearly $300.
5,very easy to install for me it's the best i love it❤️❤️
5,I love it  it’s pink and works good for what I need !
5,Love the mint color and the functionality of the printer.  Makes smear-free labels and is easy to install/use
5,So far i am impressed with the quality of the printer itself.. sometimes a speciality item with my favorite color (pink) is mire like the quality of a toy. Everything was in the box except the ALCOHOL PADS.
5,Easy to assemble easy to understand very helpful the labels print out at a quick speed love it!
5,Love it! Very easy to set up and use.
5,Awesome printer! Easy to use! Prints great!
5,Cute little pink thermal printer.Prints super fast  easy to use  doesn't take so much space and love the pink color.
5,This is a very nice portable label printer. The design is super easy to use and makes shipping very easy. My daughter has an Etsy store where she does handmade items and this has been an absolute game changer. She used to just print off her labels from the printer and then tape them on her boxes but this is SO much easier. She can't believe she has gone this long without one. It comes with about 10 thermal labels but you can find them for very reasonable cost here on Amazon. We picked up a pack of 50 for a very reasonable amount. This is a must have for anyone who ships packages and needs to streamline their process. Highly recommend Would purchase again
5,I have been dying for a thermal label printer and my boyfriend finally got it for me for mother's day and I absolutely love it. It's so easy for me to package my orders now.
5,This printer was so frustrating to figure out at first however with the help of their technician I found out all of what I was doing wrong! He was very helpful and knowledgeable not to mention patient! This is a great printer. Don't give up on it if you can't figure it out at first. I encourage you to reach out to them! They were quickly responsive and accommodating! Happy printing! :)
5,I'm quite pleased with this thermal label printer. It's small lightweight connects easily and comes with everything you need to get started. It works with all the major online retailers and their shipping software and plays nice with Windows. I can't speak for Mac but I'm sure it'll work there without much effort too.Print is crisp and clean. UPS USPS FedEx and any other shipper will have no problem reading your labels. The thermal print is durable and doesn't come off easily like inkjet ink or even laser toner. They even include a little USB stick with all the drivers manuals and information for the printer. They're very thorough and cover all the bases for set-up.How small is this printer? I prefer the Ghostbusters unit of measurement: The Twinkie. This printer is the width of two Twinkies the height of one Twinkie (stood on end) and the dept of slightly less than one Twinkie. It weighs as much as 38 Twinkies (that's about 3 pounds). My point is that it's small and lightweight. You'll be able to put it on your desk and not worry about it.Bottom Line: This is a heck of a lot easier than printing out labels on a full-sized printer and for some folks labels are 75% of what they print. Why waste the space and electricity on a massive printer when this will do the job and save you money in the long run? Definite five stars. Excellent item.
5,Received and was working within 10Minutes. No issues so far. Print quality is great. I’ve even made product care labels with them! Should have purchased sooner!
5,So easy to use. Game changer for small businesses or someone who ships a lot. Very compact too!
5,Cute little printer. Quality printing. Easy set up and tech support.
5,I struggled at first but after few trials within 30 minutes I was able to figure out how to control it completely. I love the pink color so I had to pay more just to get that right color 😂
4,I love how they helped me when I couldn’t connect it and responded to me fast. It’s easy to use and it makes my shipping life easier.
5,I love the color  took me a little bit to set up but would highly recommend!
3,Love the color ! It's been very frustrating to get it to recognize the label sizes. I reached out to customer service & still can't figure it out. I finally got the 4 x 6 paper to print but the paper is still a tad off.  Doesn't tear where it's supposed to. I couldn't figure out the 1.25 x 2.25 label settings. They weren't in the drop down box. Oh well. I'll keep trying.
5,This printer is ridiculously fast and great quality. I've never used a thermal printer before so I was nervous about the setup but it was pretty straightforward. The usb provided makes it so easy. They also provide a few free 4×6 labels for you to practice/use. As you can see from my photo the images are crisp. I'm very excited to use this to create many more labels.
5,It’s a great label printer!
5,Used the included USB stick and I set this up on Win10 in minutes. You follow the directions on a pamphlet and they are quite clear.The unit comes with a strip of 4x6"  thermal labels for shipping. The print was nice and clear.If you do a lot of Ebay or other types of shipping this is easy to use. I used to use a Dymo but they'd break down over time. I must have gone through two or three at least.This is easy enough to use but not flexible as to label size. To print different sized labels they suggest using Adobe Reader  "Snapshot" and resizing the label to fit the 4x6 format. There is a short video demonstration
5,Amazing quality & prints smoothly! Great for my Etsy shop!
5,Great product! I was having some technical difficulties at first with the print getting cut ok off. I contacted customer service and my representative was very helpful @
5,Absolutely love the color! I have needed a label printer to make shipping orders so much easier but the fact that i got it in such a pretty color. Top notch! Prints nicely

5,I loooveee my thermal printer! Super easy to set up and use and the print quality is also really good!!!! If you have a small business this is so worth it
5,This was an easy set up. I print up shipping labels almost every day and I was also able to customize my own sticker labels that I place on the inside of the shipping box top with my social media information and a Thank You.
5,Honest review here.This is a great mini printer for labels... It is very easy to set up and use.  Don't forget to have it recognize the label size you are using.  It's a nice small compact size and is easy to use.  Makes label printing so much easier for me now!!!What I love is that this thermal label printer supports all shipping platforms so there is less guess work in printing a label.This printer is also compatible with windows and Mac OS computers.  You have to install the window driver though which is quick and easy!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
3,I've been struggling with this printer for over a week and have given it many chances. I've tried reading and re-reading the manual attempting setup over and over again trying different browsers taking screenshots of my labels and attempting to manipulate the page orientation that way. I just can't get this printer to work well for me. Too many issues. It comes with a very thorough booklet outlining all of the possible problems you might have and how to troubleshoot so I suppose that should have been a red flag. For me it's a one star. However since I didn't reach out to support and since I'm expecting a certain degree of user error in spite of spending hours on this thing and never being able to print a single label I'm giving it three stars just in case it's my fault.One of the problems is the labels printing out solid white (not printing at all.) They say in the manual to make sure your labels are face up. Well not only are mine face up but it had printed just moments before without issue so clearly that can't be the problem. It thinks its printing but they're coming out plain white.Another issue I can't seem to escape has to do with page orientation. I have completed the setup steps twice and have tried several different methods but when I finally DO get a label to print the orientation is all wrong and it prints out tiny and sideways. Usually I just end up with a blank sticker however.Finally even if this thing DID work the fact that it absolutely requires usb connection is kinda a dealbreaker for me. I really need mobile capability. I have two other printers in my home office from other brands that both function wirelessly and I've successfully been printing sticky shipping labels on those printers for years. I liked the idea of a compact "labels only" printer but sadly this machine just didn't work out for me at all.
3,I like that it's cheaper to print. My label printer just blinks red all the time. I was able to print one label an havent been able to print one label since then.

5,Easy and practical. Have few problems with the 2 blank pages after the actual label print but i figure it out.
5,Overall I think this printer is a good buy.  I had some issues going from 4X6 to AZ ASIN size but I had VERY good customer service from Martin that showed me step by step how to do both.  Thanks Martin!
5,This compact little printer is just what is needed to print USPS shipping labels.  It was setup and working on my Windows 10 computer in under 15 minutes.  Setup instructions were complete and easy to follow.  They even provide YouTube video setup instructions.  Fan-folded labels feed smoothly and the printing is very fast.  A 4"x6" postage label prints in under 2 seconds.
5,This is a cute little label printer ....I had some problems with initial set up but I reached out via SKYPE And a very helpful tech by the name of Martin responded and walked me thru everything!I am now very pleased with my purchase!
5,I had an issue setting up the printer I was the problem so I contacted Martin from Munbyn tech support who offered excellent service and took the stress out of my life. My web order label printer is the best.Thank you Martin :-)
5,I was able to set up the printer very quickly but ran into what I was certain was an irresolvable problem. Thanks to AMAZING customer service from Martin I found out it was a major user error. I had the labels in upside down. Problem solved and I'm back in business. Highly recommend.
5,Works perfectly. Couldn't be a better asset to your company.
5,Really frustrating when set up  at first.  But  I emailed them and no comments about their service.
1,No matter what I do no matter how many times I look it up this thing wont print labels in the correct orientation and size. ALSO you can't read the barcodes. They are blurry and won't scan. I wish I'd NEVER wasted my money on this piece of junk Its cute but its a huge headache. Look elsewhere.
1,I thought I’d give the more economical version of the popular thermal printers a go. for about $40 in savings surely it wouldn’t be a headache! Oh I wish I didn’t try it at all. It took me countless hours and many avenues before two computer experts one who works for Miscrosoft kindly (and for free) discovered that Munbyn’s drivers files were corrupted and would not work with the newest Windows operating system update release two weeks ago and they have not made a fix or even acknowledge their flaws. I could either do a system recovery to reset back to the previous version losing apps and possibly many docs I needed; or I could return this and buy a reasonably better thermal printer for labels and stickers. I returned this.PC/Windows users beware. The drivers may not download on your computer and Munbyn customer service stopped responding to me after I told them for the millionth time that I did watch their YouTube demo video. They sent me the same link four times then stopped responding.
5,I have an e-commerce business and we take care of our fulfillment at the time. This label printer has worked great so far I've had no problems integrating it with our Shopify store.

They help me on im so satisfy with it
5,FAST!!! Great product and even better. GREAT SERVICE!!!
5,It’s awesome quick and efficient I recommend to every business
1,It was a disappointment. I thought this would be a great printer to replace my dymo. Well it wasn’t. I am having tons of issues with it. The printing settings are off the 4x6 labels print off the edges. And don’t even get me started with the mailing labels.
1,Setup was simple. I attempted to use item with a saved label I had that I use for tests and it would not print on the 4x6 format. It was either too small or cut off. So I waited until I got an order on my Etsy shop and tried printing directly from there and it still didnt work. That time no label printed but the paper did feed through. Overall useless for me.

Everything they make is beyond garbage including this printer and you can get so much better for this price. I can't believe that this has as many positive reviews as it does but I know that Amazon is not known for honest reviews nowadays.I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I would say that it is by far the biggest waste of time and money that you can get. This company MUNBYN has done nothing to innovate and you cant even print from your iphone. This printer is worth about $70 in my opinion and they are clearly overcharging for it. If it actually printed correctly I would still give it a 2/5 because the design is horrendous. I can't believe they actually let this garbage off the production line. They should have a recall for this thing with how bad it is.Setup is 2/5 - (if you arent in tech then get an IT professional to help)Printing is 3/5 - like I said it works but it doesnt always.Design is 1/5 - they didnt pay attention to detail and ease of use and no new added features of thermal printers 20+ years oldOverall Review 1/5 - I got this as a gift and am kinda disappointed my brother spent so much money on this crap. The reviews about this printer are obviously fake because this printer is just plain dog crap compared to similar printers you can get at a lower price.

5,Easy set up. Easy to use. Once I realized I had to have it recognize my label size I’ve had zero issues. So user error caused the mess ups.
5,Awesome and so easy to use! I freaking love this thing already and it arrived today. It was the easiest electronic device I’ve ever set up. Why aren’t inkjet printers this easy to use? And it saved me money and it’s pink!!

It is the perfect size and it matches my laptop and printer for an added bonus! It was easy to setup on my MacBook air. I had a question during my first use and the tech support was very prompt through Facebook. I recommend this printer and company!

1,I regret I purchased this Lable printer.I still can’t use it because it’s so hard to set up.I want my money back unless someone help me with they setting.I tried to reach customer service no luck.My Daugther tried to copy and paste a Lable it comes out unreadable.HELP OR MY MONEY BACK😭😡
5,I had to contact them on whatapp and they helped me install it as I was finding it difficult to set up on my chromebook
5,every once in a while you wonder if a product is a legit or not and this one is. It basically does the job. The only thing is I wish it printed in color but I just used a colored sticker and it prints black on it but it works fine so it's great
5,Let’s say i’m not super “tech” so it was hard the first time I used it but once I kept using it it got easier! I have a small business so this helps a lot with not having to wait hours in line at the post office or buying endless amounts of ink for a regular printer. Can’t wait to use it more! TOTALLY recommend!
5,I love it 🥰
5,This printer is highly effective and easy to install and use.
5,i love it and i have a little trouble but customer service help me a lot.. i have a small business and this label printer make everting good and fast best purchase ever
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift.  Waiting umboxing.
2,Print wasn’t very clear. Packages took a week to be delivered. I assume it’s from the printing.
5,Easy to use. I’m glad I purchased.
5,Super easy to set up looks great on the desk
4,VERY USEFUL AND EASY TO USE. AlSO VERY 😍. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY QUICK WITH RESPONSES
5,I love this easy set up and fast printing.
5,The printer works really well but I had some trouble with the sizing. My image was coming out not centered. I contacted support through WhatsApp and someone responded in a timely manner. I spoke with Bridy & got the issue resolved instantly and now my stickers look amazing!  The only thing I wish this had was Bluetooth.
1,the printer works so far so good just tried it print quality is good the paper seems waterproof for shipping reasons i could not get it to smear it was easy to install and works great with windows just push print in my web browser selected the printer set paper to 4x6 hit print easy.my problem is when i contacted support they didn't seem to understand the problem and just sent me an instructional video.i had to go to micro center and buy a power cord which cost me $13 and a huge inconvenience.
5,I absolutely love this. Works great for all of my business needs. I use it almost daily. No problems.
5,Tech support is amazing. Ge walked me through all of the steps to set up my printer because I was having a hard time. I was definitely thankful
5,I absolutely LOVE my new Munbyn Thermal Label printer. The quality of the labels are amazing! Very clear and precise. And the printer itself is made very well! Doesn’t look cheap at all! And on top of everything it’s PINK!!!  Definitely recommend 100% it’s AMAZING!!
5,This printer allows me to print labels for shipping products and whatever else my business may need. The only thing I wish is that I could figure out how to print color. But other than that this thing is the bomb. It prints SO quick and is very simple to use
5,This printer was super easy to set up (for reference I’m not a very tech savvy person) and with the price… I was blown away by the quality! Definitely worth the purchase!
5,Exelente
5,Love this printer. I had the white one and saw pink so had to buy pink too!! Easy set up and works perfect for my business!! Highly recommend
2,It jams a lot and wastes two sheets of labels each time. The print is blotchy. It works ok when it doesn't jam but when it does be prepared to sit for a good while peeling off sticker label pieces of the crevices of the machine. I could of bought a cheaper printer and gotten better results.
5,Easy to install  love the pink. It prints really fast very pleased with the product
5,Love the color and size. Works great overall. I did have a little trouble printing from Mercari but tech support was amazing and helped me figure it out. They messaged and sent videos with troubleshooting techniques. 5 🌟 for their support!
5,Set up easily to my MacOS and calibrated with no problem.Followed instructions that came with the printer and watched their YouTube video which was a great help.

It was pretty simple to set up and connects directly to my computer via usb cable. I was able to start printing pretty immediately. It also comes with some test labels which is great. The quality of printing is not as great as a regular printer but still pretty good. I am having so much fun with this!

Once I sold my previous label printer I bought this printer in a quickness. It arrived fast and set up was quick as well. Definitely happy with my purchase. It will make printing stickers and labels for my business much efficient.
5,I am in love with this printer! I got it to make custom stickers for my business and print shipping labels. I literally opened the box and was printing my stickers in less than 10 min. It was so easy!! And bonus points it is my favorite color pink!!

Only downfall so far is that small font isn’t so clear/legible. I also had to increase the size of my QR codes for my business labels so that it can scan properly. Images tend to blur if they are too small. Overall cool purchase!
5,Amazing label printer and I love it’s pink! Makes shipping label printing easier 💗
5,Easy to set up and easy to use! Plus it's pink!
5,Love it!

Frannylicious.comIf you’re printing labels make sure you set the size to 4X6 on your website before printing. It took me awhile to figure out what I was doing wrong until I went to my settings on Etsy before printing. I hope this saves someone time.
5,I was looking for something to make my life easier for my small business. I ended up buying two one for stickers and one for shipping labels. I had to contact customer service on Facebook and got help from Ge who was very helpful and got me on the right track right away to get both printers set up at the exact same time.
5,I’ve been wanting this printer to make labels for quite some time and was super excited to finally get it! It’s small lightweight and pink!!I would say there was a small issue with getting to connect with my MacBook’s printer queue but after realizing it was the USB plug it found the printer quickly and printed out the label even faster.Support tech was very very helpful and answered all of my questions quickly. The packaging was cute and I like that it comes with all the necessary parts. I would just like to say that the guide booklet should explain how to set up more in detail. I had to go on YouTube and websites for more help but overall I really adore this printer!

I’m truly blow away by how easy it is to use & how much you can do with it. The print quality is amazing! This product exceeds my expectations!
5,The shipping took awhile however I did order the color pink which was not in stock at that time. I honestly love it! Such a great investment plus there were 4x6 labels included!

I save so much time from having to cut labels since it’s precut labels and it saves me so much money on ink. Best investment ever!
5,I love it!
5,Tech was amazing and was so pleased with how fast they helped me...thank you so much
5,I had trouble at first installing I contacted munbyn support they were very helpful and communication was great they helped me get start with a video they sent me very informative and easy to install I love the printer and the color pink
5,One of my favorite purchases. It's so convenient in all aspects especially the size. Highly recommend!!😊👍
5,Absolutely love it! Very quick an easy setup
4,I typed on the web address that the instructions said and windows immediately said it was a virus. I couldn't download the drivers to install it. After an hour of messing around I did find the drivers I needed from googling. It prints nice but for the bulk shipping on ebay it wouldn't turn them to portrait. I'm sure its a user error but there is no option to change the orientation on my end...
5,I purchased the Munbyn thermal printer after self-publishing my first children’s book in July of this year. I love the thermal printer! It was easy to set up and use. Most importantly it comes in my fav color and matches my aesthetic.
5,I have the pink one and it is beautiful super quick & clear! I purchased this back in March of 2021 and today it was pausing in the middle of a print job. I checked out the printer and they have a QR code with tech support through whatsapp & Facebook. I texted the WhatsApp number and sent a video of what it was doing and I got a super quick response “how to” video in response! Super easy and fast! I was back up in less than 3 minutes!10000000% worth the buy!
5,I haven't been able to use this product yet. It came with everything it said it would have. I've heard great things about it. I'm looking forward to saving time and money with this!
5,This has been an amazing purchase. It's easy to use and I don't have to worry about using ink or packing tape for my packages anymore. I also love the color. So fun!
5,I love this thing. Print quality is so good and easy to use!

This was so easy to set up. They provided a little booklet with step-by-step instructions. Even a link to a video incase of confusion. The print quality is so nice! No smudging. So far I've made shipping labels but stickers are next ! Highly recommended.
5,If you are a small business I highly recommend you get this! And it’s pink what’s not to love?
4,Overall it’s pretty good! Nice color and fast printing. The only thing is that sometimes it leaves some part out… I had to manually scale down the image so that it prints the whole thing.
5,Super helpful for small businesses prints out amazing and very cute.  Quality is amazing!!!!  They also communicate very well whenever you contact them highly recommendedLabels are amazing and I can’t say there’s another company that does better highly recommended for the labels as well super helpful in many ways

It’s a great price point and obviously the color option is always a plus! It was super easy to set up and prints out the labels perfectly each time! Super happy with my purchase!
5,Love my machine and its super cute
5,Pretty pink! It matches my small business theme color so well. I did struggle a little to set it up but besides that it prints really good.

I had a Dymo printer and so glad I replaced it with this. I love that dont need to use ink from a conventional printer and can make all the stickers I need for my shop. The color variety is great. I only wish was a wireless or bluetooth option for IOS Devices otherwise its perfect!

It fits perfectly on my desk and does not take up space which is a huge plus! Labels print within seconds and in high quality. Such a lifesaver for small businesses who like to add labels on their products. Highly recommend!!!
5,I would recommend this little life saver.. Easy to set up and use. Would recomend the label stand to go with
5,Great customer service.  Product arrived safely well-packaged and on time.  Compact size but perfect for the job.
5,This thermal printer is so easy to use and convenient when running a small business. The print quality and sharpness is amazing. This saves me so many trips to staples to print shipping labels.

If you need help they are so quick and easy go work with. My printer stopped working and they are sending me a new one. That's how a good business operates is having great customer service and support help available any time a day. Thank you for all you do!!
5,I’m inlove my thermal printer. It’s the best item on my desk.
5,Overall the printer is great the set up was easy but it took a couple tries to get the printer to print everything on the label.  Once it printed - great!
5,The munbyn prints great and is super easy to use. I was able to get fast technical support when I needed it! Would highly recommend this product. I’m so excited to use it and see all that it is capable of 😁!

I really wanted a pink one because it's my favorite color so I was super excited to fins this one. It's compatible with both Windows and Mac and the software is very easy to install. This is going to be a game changer for me because you can print stickers as well not just shipping lables!

It is fast to print and so convenient. I made sure to look at YouTube videos for set up and setting printer settings for it to print. You can print from Canva or I'm using Iffinity designer to print from because it is easier to change the settings! I'm not a techy person so if I was able to figure it out you can too. I found it easy to set up. Best purchase I've made for my small business! I will be using it for both my businesses!
5,Great little printer. Super easy to set up and the print quality is perfect. I bought this for my small business and I’m so mad I didn’t get it sooner.
5,I ordered the pink one. Super easy to set up and installs in literally seconds. Comes with USB drive to make the process easier as well as free 4x6 labels. I would highly recommend it !
5,At first it was hard for me to connected and then it worked

Instructions need a little more detail on how to set up in settings of the computer. But besides that.. I look forward to printing on this printer! Definitely worth the money! I also love that it is PINK!
5,Setup was fast and easy! Printer works as described!
5,I love it this is a very cute printer PINK OMG for my business.Thank you for thinking on us love pink.Connie

4,Really cute shipping printer! Had difficulty setting up with USPS. other than that great product will recommend!
5,This is the best purchase I’ve made!! It is so easy to install and get everything started. The print quality is amazing. No more spending hundreds of dollars on ink for my small business. Highly recommend!
5,I’m a sucker for all things pink when it comes to my office. So when I saw this printer and the awesome reviews I bought it without hesitation. Inside the box you get the printer a USB cord a power cord a USB drive that includes the program to download to your computer and my favorite addition free labels and a USB cord that converts the old USB shape to my new MacBook Air micro USB drive. You can definitely tell they thought it all through when it comes to packaging their product with everything you could possibly need to set this printer up. Now for the one issue that was initially a big one but thanks to an amazing customer service team it’s no longer a problem.  Now I’m pretty tech savvy when it comes to setting things up and follow directions well and yet I still could not get it to print a single label. I tried for hours until I stopped being stubborn and finally reached out to customer service.  I had noticed in the questions and reviews other people with the same laptop as me made rave reviews so I knew it had to be a string of bad luck or a problematic printer. ( I have a brand new 2021 MacBook Air for reference. ) Customer service was very helpful and worked two different days to figure out the problem. Finally the issue ended up being something very small and minut (literally a couple clicks of the button) & now the printer runs absolutely amazing!  It prints fast and vibrant. I’m not sure where some reviewers get that it prints faded because I do not have that issue at all. In fact it might be even darker than my previous Rollo printer. To make my experience even better (& make this one of my favorite brands now as a business owner) is the fact their customer service is very patient and thorough. Because of the issues we continued to have trying to figure out why it would acknowledge the printer by fail to print they ended up sending me 500 labels FOR FREE. You can’t get much better than that! You can tell they definitely care about their customers and making sure they have an amazing experience with their brand. I respect that so much and if anything ever happens to this printer I know I’ll be sticking with this brand in the future. Do not hesitate to purchase this if you’ve been contemplating it. You won’t regret it! Plus they have other amazing colors if you’re not into pink! I will be recommending this printer to any of my friends looking for one in the future.

The print quality is really nice and clear it prints super fast and installation was really easy to figure out. It even came with labels to start out with and a usb to usb-c cord to connect it to my macbook! The pink color is amazing and I'm really happy I added this to my shipping setup!
5,The printer is so user friendly and easy to set up.  I’m not techy at all and I was printing within minutes! So easy to  switch between label papers as well.  I’ve been using it to make stickers and logos.  Love it so much!
5,customer service was very helpful when having issues with set up. product is good. get the job done
5,Printer works great once we figured it out. Getting the printing to line up was difficult at first and we had to watch some videos but we got it working.We use it to print all kinds of labels and logos in our bakery Perfectly Pastry in Waterloo IL
5,This printer is a great add on to my small business. Extremely easy to set up and use. Comes with step by step instructions. Doesn’t take up much space. I ordered this beauty on January 12 at night. Delivered the very next day January 13 in the morning. I was super excited. Love it

5,I just started a home based business. I was printing shipping labels with my regular printer cutting them out and taking them on. This machine makes shipping so much easier!  I just print the labels no cutting or taping. It is fantastic. I would highly recommend this product. It saves time and money.
5,Great print quality easy to use and easy to follow instructions to install. Very fast at printing too.
5,I had a little problem with the setting for circle stickers… When I text the number that came with the printer they text me back within minutes and send another video which was helpful… now I’m printing thank you stickers…
5,Printer was very easy to set up. Directions were very clear. I have a MacBook Air 2020.
5,I love my printer that my husband got me and I love how easy it is to use and print quality is good for black and white labels. Makes my shipping so much easier for my small business at home
1,Let’s start from the beginning. I first saw this product used by girl on Tiktok. I thought wow how cute! And plus I’m going to be selling stuff online so this would be perfect for me right? Wrong! Right from the start IT DIDN’T EVEN TURN ON! Are you kidding me?! So you made sure that the printer you sent to the girl for FREE ADVERTISEMENT  worked but you can’t even do simple quality check for your PAYING customers?! And no it’s NOT me. The setup instructions are so simple even a monkey could do it and all my outlets work fine. I’m not even going to bother with a replacement. If a company gets it wrong in the first place you’ll be better off avoiding them. Returning this tomorrow.

After you figure out how to configure the sizing for your labels it's a piece of cake. I love this printer!Tip: Make sure to purchase DIRECT THERMAL labels ONLY

5,I absolutely love this product. It was very easy to setup and the labels are flawless when they print. Pink is my favorite color so this printer works perfectly with the theme in my office.
5,My fiance recently started a small Etsy shop and needed something that could print her shipping labels and we looked at about 40 different small printers this is the one we ultimately went with and I am so happy we did she loves the color she loves the speed of it it works perfect it's never one time let us down and the roles that you can buy our very very manageable and price extremely strong and have never once come off during shipping in fact all of our customers even enjoy the fact that we can customize our receipt paper so that it's as cute as the products that she sells thank you so much for providing a great product for a wonderful price

The fact that the price is significantly less than a DYMO or Rollo and it is the same if not better in quality and support.
5,Customer service is AMAZING! Super helpful. The printer is amazing!

5,Ottima stampante termica!Devo ammettere che inizialmente l'ho scelta esclusivamente per il suo design e per il suo colore rosa.La utilizzo in azienda per stampare le etichette delle spedizioni del corriere GLS. Inizialmente è stato un pò difficile settare i giusti parametri sulla piattaforma del corriere ma dopo alcune prove tutto è andato liscio.La stampa è velocissima la qualità di stampa è buona.Inoltre un aspetto fondamentale è il non dover più badare ai consumi di inchiostro di una normale stampante.Meno sprechi e più rispetto per l'ambiente.Per me è stato un ottimo acquisto!

5,Il faut bien farfouiller les paramètres pour imprimer ça peut être rageant mais courage avec un peu de temps et de vidéos YouTube ça se paramètre bienUne fois paramètré c'est parfait n'hésitez pas à mettre un coup de chiffon doux sec sur la bande noire à l'intérieur après quelques semaines d'utilisation :)
5,Nachdem mir durch einen Kundenservice bei der Einrichtung geholfen wurde möchte ich jetzt doch 5 Sterne geben . Die Einrichtung war mit ein paar Videos und mit dem Kundenservice ein Kinderspiel.Hierfür gibt es natürlich 5 Sterne .

5,It's a really good extra for beside your inject printer.The quality is different. But it's the technique who makes the prints different.You need to play around with the settings before you get the perfect print.But after that  you're ready to go.The printer came with a cable  software and large labels.I'm very happy with it

1,Impossible d’imprimer des étiquettes lisibles avec cette imprimante les points relais ne parviennent pas à scanner le code. Malgré mes contacts avec les techniciens rien ne va. L’imprimante est inutile. 186€ perte d’argent et de temps
2,Nulle ! Code barre illisible imprime les adresses à moitié.Je ne recommande pas
5,Love it does the job well really good investment
1,Ça a été très compliqué d’installer la munbyn car bien sûr aucune aide . Une fois l’installation réussie elle a fonctionné 6 mois  et puis plus rien . Bien évidemment personne ne vous aide. Je vais prendre une autre imprimante
5,Je recommande
1,Article retourné car je n’en avais pas l’utilité. L’installation est rapide mais l’écriture sur les étiquettes est minuscule. Donc pas utile pour ma part.
5,My label printer didn’t work so MUNBYN send me a label printer! Thank you so much!
