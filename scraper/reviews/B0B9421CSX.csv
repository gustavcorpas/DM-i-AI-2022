5,I received yesterday and installed on two iPhone 14 Pro Max phones. They look Great on the phone. The install tool helps out significantly; follow the instructions and you'll be impressed.
5,I love this type of matte screen protector. I got one for my old iPhone and I was never going back. I pre ordered a similar matte one from a different company before my iPhone 14 pro max even arrived. I installed and it was great but it had small holes around the “dynamic island” which really messed up the experience and also somewhat made the area less sensitive to touch input probably due to the change in elevation. I looked a lot for something like this product right here this is an amazing quality matte screen protector AND it does not have a cut out around the camera and sensors of the dynamic island for the iPhone 14 pro and pro max. They clearly put some type of glass material there which has a similar feel and absolutely reflects light the exact same way once on the phone. So for all intents and purposes you can’t tell there are two different materials at place. It is edge to edge and has no holes or spaces around the sides which has really enhanced my experience. I just wish they made the same thing for the iPad Pro (i see they have a product for the iPad line but it has a camera cut out unfortunately. Anyways I highly highly recommend this product. Oh did I mention it comes with 2 screen protectors and even a very simple and effective installation frame? It really is so ways a child should be able to do this and have zero bubbles. 10/10 recommend
