5,This thing is probably my best investment to date. The Blue tooth is easy to use but the name of the device is NOT the same as in the instructions book. Only reason I knew it was the right device is because my phone showed a new printer. The app is pretty straight fwd but I ALWAYS have to turn the image density up to around 12 for shipping labels. Otherwise it's worked perfectly
3,I went through the instructions many times and could not get it to hook up to my computer which I guess is fine since I print shipping labels from my phone.With that said I actually dislike the process in which it takes to print one label. Printing more than one doesn’t work.There are SO many steps to print one label from pirateship AFTER having their “shipping printer” app downloaded:1. Download label from pirateship website 2. Save to a folder in your phone files 3. Open the shipping printer app 4. Connect phone to the label printer (every time if it’s not used back to back). 5. Click “choose file” in the app 6. Locate the folder in files you saved the label to on your phone. 7. Open one label (again you can only print one at a time) 8. Rotate the label so that it’s in portrait mode 9. Crop to the size of the label every single time 10. Send to printer 11. Send to printer.. again after verifying you really wanted that size of label print out.  (If you didn’t link the printer in step 4 you can connect here too).See what I mean about steps?! NOT time efficient.If you have more than one label to print you get to do it all over again but can skip step 4.See what I mean about steps? I’ve tried to select more than one label to print crop them and it prints two on one label. I tried not cropping to the label size- that didn’t print properly either. I’ve done trials of different ways but sheesh.. shouldn’t be this many steps to print a single label. Especially for a small business.The process was easier when I used printing labels on an ink printer. Hope this helps.
5,Update 2 -July 302022…once you get saving your labels from eBay down printing is super easy. No cropping or rotating. Works well. Haven’t had any issues with shipping with the labels. Great value for a Bluetooth 4x6 printer on sale.Update: I used the labels today and had them scanned in to make sure the USPS could read them. No issues. Your printout will only be as good as your source. If you are using a low quality jpeg it will be low quality print out. With eBay I take the pdf they send me save it to files on iOS then print it and crop just the label. Be sure to rotate it so it is in portrait. 5 stars.Original review: I’m giving 5 stars because it works and was pretty simple to set up. I would give it 4 but that’s only because the iOS app is kind of junky but it gets the job done. Connects quickly via Bluetooth.  Loading paper and feeding it thru is simple and the auto sensing works fine (only used 4x6 so far)  USPS labels from eBay app work fine but you do need to crop them and save as a file just the label part. Again works great and a good value at 150 minus the coupon if you wait till it’s on sale. If the post office rejects my label I’ll update this review.I used their included labels at a density of 8 and speed of 4. Nice and clear. Should work.Buy it. You’ll be happy.
4,Very easy to print a shipping label it’s perfect for small business
5,Makes label printing a much easier chore
4,This device harkens back to the 90s in some ways. I haven't had to touch com ports in ages. It's fairly easy to configure the device but you have to configure it over USB before you can get it working over Bluetooth and then you have to manually change the com port to match the Bluetooth com port.Aside from the install being a bit daft once it's setup I can now print labels for various tasks besides just ups/FedEx.  A worthy purchase imo.
5,I mail a lot of things this made doing that much easier!
4,Once you figure out that you need to download their printing app and pair through bluetooth it works great.There is updated connection that makes some of the set up directions in booklet wrong  but this is noted on an included note so don't lose it lol. At first it seemed I needed to have a connected connote to use this  but realized when I skipped the pages to the 1 page about bluetooth info and found the app info which once installed was able to print on its own from my phone or tablet. The app is simple and works with ebay pirateship and other shipping label websites. It prints in only a few seconds.  I have had to reprint a couple of times due to missing ink on the tracking barcode. But rare. The printer did come with a small roll of 4x6 paper. I used my UPS free roll and it works great. I love the ease of bluetooth/wifi printing!
5,I love my new label printer!!
4,Yhis seemed to be a nice printer. The test print looked nice. However this did not work for our church Check-in system with a tablet.
3,It's really a nice simplified way to print labels that are clear and way cheaper than buying ink for a regular printer!It was really challenging to Bluetooth it to laptop and the download wouldn't work. Had to YouTube a couple videos b4 I could use the printer
5,Works amazing with the Mac and Amazon! Easy to set up and use!
5,This printer is absolutely perfect for a small business. I read a lot of the reviews prior to purchasing and I am glad I did. I had some trouble with the initial set up due to the directions being very short and non-descriptive. The reviews helped me and now I just love this little machine!
4,The most thing I love about it is it’s so easy to set it up literally the easiest print good not the best but good enough for me and very good price saves me lots of money since I ship a lot everyday thank you
5,I will say this printer is my second one due toy first one was just a hook up to my laptop which I love it. I had that first one a month and seen that I could get another for a few dollars more for the Bluetooth and I will say it's the best. Now I can print all my labels from the comfort of my cellphone
4,Works good and set up was not so bad.
2,2 Stars because the print quality is excellent but when i talked with tech support before ordering the assured me it would take generic 4x6 labels like the ones i'd been using in my Zebra printer for the last 20 years.  It does not.  It only seems to work with their labels.  On the bright side their proprietary labels are much cheaper than Dymo or Zebra.
5,Great price great product
5,Super easy and quick set up. Prints quickly and the quality is really good and also very clear. The only thing is I wish I could print multiple labels like in a row without having to keep clicking back and forth. But I haven't had it a long time so not sure if that's an option to queue a bunch of labels an have them print one after another or if you just have to pop back and forth to the next one hit print pop back and the  hit print to get them all to print. Either way good price and works really well. Definitely recommend
5,Was looking for something cheaper to print my shipping labels for my online shops instead of my costly ink cartridges I have to buy for my home printer. This didn't have much feedback yet (compared to the other thermal printers listed) but decided to buy this one due to the 'cellphone' on the picture showing it has Bluetooth capabilities. Not really interested installing it on my home computer so I'm not leaving feedback on that. This is feedback on how easy it was to install and print a label from my Android phone. Took me but 10 mins to unpack setup and install app and print. Easiest thing I ever installed myself... so happy with this purchase! This should save me alot of money in the long run not having to keep buying printer ink cartridges..
5,Works perfectly for what I'm doing.  I needed to create my own hip numbers for Track & Field.  I wasn't sure when I first ordered it because it's $200 less than the Zebra brand but I was surprised this works perfectly.
4,This is very fast printing for shipping label. Although you have to adjust the size manually for it to print accurately it is still very good for the price.
5,I am impressed with the print speed and quality of this product. Great for small businesses.
5,Me gusto mucho ya que es fácil y práctica de usar . La imagen de muy buena calidad .
5,The product support was amazing.  They provided awesome customer service.  Beyond my expectations. I’m also very happy with the item. It literally prints in seconds. Like a stamp. I am so pleased with my choice to buy this product it already made my life so much easier.
5,Excelente funciona con Bluetooth y puedo imprimir rápido y con calidad desde mi celular!!
5,I ordered this for printing labels from pirate ship. I could not set it up (i'm not tech savvy) called the 800# in the manual a real person answered right away & walked me through the set up. Customer service rep was very helpful & very pleasant. I would recommend this printer.
3,The machine is fairly good but the instructions for set up are horrible. Some of the pages in the instruction manual are unreadable and hard understand.
5,Thermal Printer - I Love It!  Game Changer!  It helps my small business so much!  I wish I bought it a long time ago.  I highly recommend!
2,Every time I send a shipping label to the printer via the app it will print the label and then keep running blank labels through the feed until it’s empty or until it’s shut off. So instead of being able to print out one label and walk away I have to wait by the printer and be able to shut it off right as the single label is done printing. And then I have to turn it back on for the next label. It works but it’s a hassle.
2,Very hard to get the download for the setup had to get my soon to be daughter-in-law when she came in to set this up. Was very Aggravated at trying to get it set up so in my opinion get a different brand so that’s why I’m only giving at this many stars. It wants to print 2 thermal label sticker  and u have to reset it after each time it print a label so I just left it at least it’s printing and I didn’t want to mess with it. Because it was so difficult of getting it set up 🥲 but if I had to do it over again I would’ve got a different brand that has more downloads for the computer. I know it’s very frustrating trying to get help from the company and someone that would understand what I was trying to tell them that I couldn’t find a download for the computer 🥲
5,This is a great little printer for shipping labels.  I wish I would not have waited so long to get one.  If you are going back and forth about getting one- just do it.  I print directly from my phone and it is so fast.
2,I’m so disappointed. I tried to print a label today and it was so frustrating.I tried printing from my phone and my computer and everytime I tried to print it would come out blanked. I followed the instructions from the manual so idk what I did wrong.
5,This label printer is quick fairly quiet and works like a trooper!
2,The driver-USB has a tight fit and was very difficult to push in and pull out of the USB port. I did not have any issues with the USB cable that connects the printer directly to my laptop.The instruction manual has low print quality—the words and examples are small and difficult to read there weren’t any instructions in the book or on their website for mobile wireless connection the QR code was useless. To print using Bluetooth you have to use an app
5,Got it for my small business. Came with a roll of labels and the set up was super easy. Haven't tried to print from my phone yet but seems simple enough. It is a bit bulkier than I thought.
2,I don't use this printer every day; but when I do go to use it I shouldn't have to re-install the software each time. (The printer is always "offline" until I re-install the software.) I finally figured out how to get the print darker since I could barely read anything. I have not tried the Bluetooth function since I'm always frustrated at the amount of time it takes just to get a single label to print when my laptop is connected. Pretty disappointed as I thought this would really be an asset to my small business.
1,While open I saw box is not strong just put type. I thought used. After I open for setup it has scratches and fingers print this is used I paid for new price.
1,After 2 months of ordering this printer  it started to get trouble . It shows up an error and I have to restart the computer for works again and I loose time doing that. The problem isn’t on my computer. I’ve checked it. I tried to reinstate the printer drive and I still getting this error using with cable and with Bluetooth.
1,Printer actually does a very nice job printing labels. I printed several from my computer. I was disappointed when I tried to print one via Bluetooth and saw I have to give the app permission to access my contacts and location at all times in order to open the app. No need for either of those with Bluetooth its just a data harvesting app.
1,I Don't Write Reviews About Any Products I Get Here On Amazon But I Gotta Let It Out This Thermal Printer Was Such Awful Purchase I've Purchased On Amazon It Brought The Booklet To Call Customer Service Very Very Extremely Bad Customer Service I've Ever Deal With I Called To Ask Why My Thermal Printer Was Coming Out In Bad Quality They Made Me Jump Through Hoops By Asking For Pictures And The Lady Said That She Would Have To Call Me Back So She Ended Up Texting Me And Testing It out On Here End And She Said Nope There's Nothing Wrong With It Anybody Who Wants A Good Service And Products Go With HP And There Instant Ink Service It's A Better Deal And Excellent Service Than This Piece Of Junk Service They Have Here On Amazon Worst Thermal Printer And Customer Service Everrrr 😡😡😡😡😡😡
5,Very dependable
5,wireless prints great A must have if you ship often.
2,Nuff said. Thank you
5,Looking for a Bluetooth 4x6 label printer. This is it.
2,I have to turn it off after every print when I'm using the Bluetooth on my phone. Literally after every print I have to turn off the thermal printer. Turn it back on then reconnect.
1,I received my printer today I had trouble setting it up. I did everything the manual it came with said and what I could find on the internet. The customer service number does not work and you will not get an answer back. I'm highly disappointed in the product. I tried setting up through my android and the only thing is the blank labels. I can't get this piece of junk to work at all. I'm returning this for a better product. Seriously spend the extra money and get a well known printer.
1,Having a Bluetooth on this device makes absolutely no sense because you can’t use it on your computer and print wirelessly. I’m very disappointed and will absolutely return it today. My advice is to pay extra and get something that really works well
1,This product does not work with the drivers provided and there is ZERO tech support.  This was a total waste of time.
1,Not user friendly at all couldn’t get it to print from my phone like it said I could do
1,This printer sucks.  It stopped working 3 months after purchase.  Could never get the Blue Tooth to work when it was working.  The trouble shooting did not help.  Will never buy this brand again.
1,Bluetooth doesn’t work 50% of time. It doesn’t support basic pdf fedex or eBay labels. Driver crashed windows 10 mouse and the monitor. It wastes 4-6 labels before printing. It won’t print full 4x6. Only 1/4 section of 4x6 label. I did set it to print 4x6.  They sold me a used one in a new box. Manual has 2 warnings per page. It tells you how much this printer suck.
1,I am very disappointed the advertising said that it would be able to work on an iPhone or an android phone I get it and it does not connect to the iPhone! 😡
1,After a painful 2 hour process and multiple people trying to get this Bluetooth to work it simply did not once connect to the phone… in fact it wouldn’t even show a connection was available.Junk returning
1,It says it comes with software but it doesn’t we had to subscribe to a monthly subscription software bad advertising very disappointed
1,I opened the packaging and all the cords were just in a bag not wrapped with ties or anything. Then the printer contained a roll of labels already and the last label ripped off was not clean. It's a used freaking printer!!! What a rip off and joke
1,I read the tech details for a dozen label printers. This one claimed to work easily with iPads and iPhones. I could not get the printer to connect. Disappointed.
1,You could get over low quality maybe if it actually worked.  You can not load the driver from anywhere from any of their instructions.
1,App that creates a label  is poor . Not please with app  but printer is good quality .
5,The printer does the job well without much hassle.This printer would be the best value for windows or android users as the Bluetooth option works for these two systems but not apple.One must keep it on as turning it off then turning it back on will advance the label spool by one label. This essentially wastes one label each time the printer’s power is cycled.
5,Prints great as expected and super easy to setup. Love it.
5,Worked exactly as stated.  Does work with FedEx Shipping Manager. Easy to set up.
5,So far its working wonderfulFast and the printer is great
5,$1000 QUALITY at $100 price. I'd buy again...Bluetooth wireless great quality
1,Downloaded the requisite app and device appears on phone screen as being connected.  However the printer and phone did NOT connect.  Called customer disservice 800 number was told to leave a voicemail so they can call me back at an inconvenient time for me.  Impossible to complete installation process. Returning this piece of junk.
2,Tech support via phone was nonexistent. And the printer is not Bluetooth enabled. You cannot open as an AirPrint printer. Your file has to be sent to a different app in order to print. 👎🏽
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             - I ship so many things for my business. I found printing labels on my regular printer was getting quite expensive as the ink cost so much money! So I hunted for the right thermal printer that would work for me. This one was the right price with the right features. I don’t ever have to worry about ink as thermal print lasts forever. I also love that I save money on tape as the labels are already ready to stick directly on the packages. It makes my packages more professional and cheaper to ship out. It prints my ups labels and usps labels and can do many more. I was able to hook this right up to my computer easily and get it printing quickly. I have windows 10 and it was a quick easy setup by installing the driver and usb drive to install. I can also print right from my phone as it connects by Bluetooth as well. It comes with one roll of labels  but I quickly ordered more to keep up with business demand . The printer is saving me time and money.
4,After major headache with the suggested app of Shipping Printer found one that actually works with the Jaden printer. The app I found is called ReturnPal and worked as soon as I downloaded and installed it. One that was installed my iPhone connected right away and printed a test label. Still having issues getting printer to connect to my MacBook Pro via the cable but I am sure that will be able to rectified even though the driver software was installed per Jaden’s instruction manual.
5,So so so SOOOO pleased with this printer. I'd set aside an hour and a half to mess with it to get it set up an for a good mid-set-up frustration cry it took less than 20 minutes to go from sealed box to spitting out shipping labels even WITH a small cry out of relief in there.The manual directs you to their website for the Android/oS app. The page just says to go to the app store and download an app which is very succinctly simply called "Shipping Printer" (icon is a black printer w blue paper). There's nothing else on their website of relevance to set up so save yourself some time and just download the app. As per a tip on here I just screenshot the label rotate and trim it in my Gallery and then once the app is open you just hit "file" pick your image click the next arrow then click print. Easy parcheesie. Idk if there's a way to bulk print or not but at the bulk I'm shipping I'm not fussed to find out.It spits out labels lighting fast and while they could be a little darker they're still plenty dark and totally readable.Another cool thing is it comes with a USB to USB-c (newer phone port) adapter so you can actually plug the printer straight into your phone if you don't have a computer and connect that way if you don't have blue tooth or it's being buggy or whatev. AND it comes with a USB protector thing. And a good-size roll of thermal paper.Absolutely no complaints. Feels well-made and sturdy and looks like one of those Glade aromatherapy smoke things.
1,I went through a long install process. After I got it running. It would spent like 40 second to start pri ting and sometimes wastes 2 to 3 labels by printing 1 label but taking about 4 label. 3 plain and 1 label. What a waste of labels. If I try to put it back in it has to calibrate and wastes 2 labels right there. And to finish it would start printing after calibration and print half label on 1 sheet and the other half in another label. 🤬 don't waste your money. On this product. Returning it right now
2,Prints only when it is plugged in to the computer.Bluetooth wireless printing does not workTech Support cannot figure it out. Spent hours with their Tech Support an not able to resolve it.
5,Second time buying again! Very easy to use and easy download!
5,works good
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Very vague when it comes to Bluetooth instructions… I have a iPhone XS so the iOS App you NEED to use printer is “Shipping Printer” available at the App Store.
5,Very easy install and setup! Very fast and not too loud when printing. Stop looking and just buy this one!
5,I love how this makes me look professional now when I ship orders out to my customers.
5,Got this for my side business label print. It comes with a roll of hundred sheet sticky paper. The installation is easy the Bluetooth connect well and I can order my print quick and easy. Highly recommend for business!
5,I really like the printer. It does exactly what it says it does. The CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE was GREAT. I called when I had an issue getting it to work properly and got a live person right away. I didnt load  the paper properly. We also text back and forth to make sure everything was right. On top of all that  They Sent Me A Gift in the Mail. Its a plug in light thingy. It goes great with the theme of the house. I will definitely continue to order from Jadens
5,Easy and perfect
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m absolutely in love with this. It’s so simple to use with an easy setup. I’m using it primarily from an IPhone and once you download the app it’s click and go. I bought a different brand before this and absolutely could not get it to work. So this was a breath of fresh air.
5,Ok. So hooking this sucker up to my iPad wasn’t as easy as I thought but honestly once I got it…it’s super easy and is fantastic. I travel while I work so pronto g labels on the road is a must. Super happy with this snd it will replace my regular printer once home
