4,For it's price the HAWKRAY Wireless Outdoor Security Camera does have quite a few functions that place it a cut above from other types of security cameras. You'll get a lot of bang for your buck here. It doesn't quite measure up to the Ring security cameras which I will detail in a bit.First off the picture quality. The picture quality is really quite remarkable for a $40 camera. It records in 1080p (you can toggle between standard or high definition) and has a fantastic night vision mode. There's also a micro SD card unit for you to save videos or you can subscribe for three different tiers of cloud storage. You can also communicate two way with the camera and access a static photo or live feed if you feel so inclined. Setup and the camera itself are relatively easy to install and mount. You'll need to be near a router to complete this setup. You can also easily unscrew the camera from it's base if you ever need to update it or charge it. It detects pets cars and people and can tell when a pet is being accompanied by a human being which is also very helpful!Now for the not so awesome feature. First off the camera itself does not record continuously. It is only activated by motion sensor. So anytime the camera detects anything you will get an alert on your phone. Which is very helpful but not so much if you have people going in and out everyday. You can put the camera on "Do not disturb" if you don't mind about receiving notifications should anything shady occur on your property. It will record but you won't know if it does happen. As far as I can tell it starts and stops anytime it detects new movement. The camera only records in several second intervals as opposed to one continuous stream until it no longer detects any movement.Where you place the camera is also very important. It cannot be outside of the WiFi's range or else it won't sync with your app. You can access it anywhere but you cannot place the camera too far outside of your own range. You won't be able to update it or pretty much use it as far as I can tell if it is in fact outside of the perimeter.Lastly the placement of the camera itself is a huge factor. You'll definitely want to place it in an area where the camera has enough time to capture the motion. I have mine towards the beginning of a decent sized driveway so we can easily see when the mailman or Amazon drivers drop off a package. I have a view of everyone who arrives or leaves the house which is helpful in a shared housing situation.The battery life is advertised as lasting about 3-6 months. My camera lasted a week and a half before I needed to recharge. it could be a faulty camera but this was very disappointing as I do not want to have to climb a ladder to unscrew and charge this camera once a week.Overall for the price it's a more than capable camera. It won't solve all of your home security issues but if you're looking for a cheap option and you don't mind not having 24/7 constant recorded surveillance vs motion sensor (Or if you live with roommates or a building that you don't own) this is a great way to circumvent a lot of the headache.
4,We bought the camera to keep an eye on our garden and chicken area in our backyard.  The evidence of deer foxes and raccoons passing through motivated the purchase of the camera to get notifications as they pass by. Being completely wireless was a big plus due to the area of coverage being a fair distance from power. So far we’ve managed to capture/be notified of several instances of foxes creeping around the chicken coop and deer trying to eat out of our garden.Mobile App/Setup: The VicoHome app is pretty easy to use and the initial setup of the camera was straightforward.  The app allows real-time monitoring of the camera the ability to set audible/light alarms on the camera an intercom feature and the ability to review previously recorded videos.WiFi Reception: Once the camera was connected to WiFi it has maintained a constant connection and has provided consistent notifications via the mobile app. Our camera is installed approximately 100 feet from the nearest router mode.Image Quality/Motion Detection: The images/videos captured by the camera are pretty good – especially when conditions are brighter.  The IR night vision is also fairly good but the frame rates in nighttime videos could be a bit better since wildlife moving through the frame tends to be pixelated. The motion detection tends to be oversensitive at times (picking up shadows of clouds passing through the frame or under-sensitive (missing people or animals walking through the yard for which I had expected to receive a notification) but generally does detect the events I am interested in. I agree with other reviewers that the night vision motion detection can be a challenge to get right. I got better performance by adjusting placement and field of view to mitigate things in the yard which caused frequency “false alarms” – often things in the foreground blowing in the wind.Battery Life: The battery has lasted 4-5 weeks on each charge.  During the initial few weeks had the motion detection threshold set to “High” which resulted in a many notifications but did not seem to drastically impact the battery life.  After reducing the detection threshold to “medium” it seems like there is a good compromise in detection capability and battery life. So far the camera has only seen warm temperatures so we will see how the battery holds up as it weathers colder nights.All in all the camera has been a good tool to keep an eye on things in the yard.
4,The quality of the footage is way better than I imagined it to be. I am an iPhone user and for those who think android camera graphics can differ strongly I imagined this camera to have that same grainy film but I was completely wrong. I was shocked by how clear and strong the camera can pick up. The noise quality is great another feature I didn’t think would be as good as it turned out to be. I live in a apartment next door to the only bar in my small hometown and I’ve had my fair share of weird experiences. I figured it was time for my safety and knowledge to purchase this camera for my outside deck facing out to the parking lot my apartment  and bar share. One of the best things I’ve done for myself in a long time! The motion detection can be a little odd sometimes it will catch a person but there is nobody there or it will say a package was delivered but it was a car driving past. For the most part it’s on the spot and notifies my phone immediately. For the money it’s worth the little glitches here and there. The microphone that allows you to talk into the app and speak out of the camera is the only thing I think is the worst aspect of the programming because it’s very cut out and staticky at points. Sometimes it doesn’t catch the first or last part or what I’m saying. That could have something to do with the app more so the camera! Overall great product. Thank you so much!
5,Finally a user-friendly camera that easy to install and operate.  I replaced my two cameras with this one and was immediately happy.  They worked so well; I now own five.  Two are plugged in. The smart phone ap makes it so easy to view and manage.  I am not tech savvy which is why I hated my previous camera.  I can immediately find and view video taken.  Setting motion detection managing notifications and temporarily put a camera to sleep are a breeze to change.  When an unfamiliar car appears in my driveway I am queried as to whether I know it.  They allow 5 cars to be put on a familiar list. Tips: The recommended micro SD Card is 120MB/s C10 U1 Full HD A1 (option on the Amazon screen for this camera).  I tried a gaming card and it would not format properly.  Also turn off notification until you have the camera installed. Otherwise the voice will keep 'yelling' at you.  Highly recommend the Hawkray Camera
5,This camera is awesome.  We have a Nest camera in our backyard which we bought many years ago (for twice the price).  This camera does everything the Nest does and more.  We are very happy that we purchased this camera.  We did find out though that you cannot put it behind a window as it will not capture movement doing so.  Although it does capture my flag that blows in the wind but not a person.  The battery lasts VERY LONG.  We've had it on 24/7 for over a month and it's still at 79% full.  The WiFi strength is "STRONG" and it is approximately 40' from the router.  The test will be when we attach it outside but I think it will be fine.  We like everything about this camera.
4,These cameras are pretty awesome. The connect easy to wifi and the app is fast on your phone. Picture quality is amazing even at night. The sound is great on them as well. 95% satisfied. The only complaint I have and why I gave it 4 not 5 stars is because of the motion sensitivity. You can set up areas  to where it's not supposed to pick up but that doesn't work. I even pay for the service and it's the same so I'm stopping that. I have one on the front of the house but do not want notifications every time a car drives down the street I've blocked the street off in the area but yet I'm constantly notified of cars and people walking. I get well over 100 notifications a day on just that camera... I still highly recommend these if you want security at a great price!
5,For an inexpensive camera this unit is amazing. It operates and gives you the same results as cameras that are 5 to 10 times its price. When I ordered it I did not have high expectations because I have ordered these types of cameras in the past and have had nothing but issues. One thing that blows me away is how long the battery lasts.  The software was easy to use and the camera was simple to set up. It was perfect for what I needed it for and I am so glad I have it!
4,I bought this camera as a replacement to my indoor camera that eventually gave out. I’ve had this camera so far for a few weeks and I’m very happy with its performance. The video quality looks great! The night vision also works great. The response time for when the camera gets triggered to record is a bit delayed but overall great camera for the price. It was also so easy to install which is what I was also looking for in a replacement. Will definitely be adding more of these to my home.
5,I am very happy with this camera. I purchase 2 cameras for the front and back of my home. The picture quality is great and gives me a great view of the entire back yard and driveway. I was skeptical of the cameras because of the low price but they are just as good as the higher priced ones. I do recommend making sure the cameras are put in a low enough position so you can take them down to recharge them .  I highly recommend you try these out. You will not be disappointed.
5,I actually use these inside 2 windows and they work great!  I know it says not to  but  I wanted something easy just to see my garage doors and another part of my driveway in front .  Connects fast when using the app and you can turn off notifications during certain hours if you want .  I think by me having in front of glass the battery doesnt last as long as if it were outside.  The app does show battery perentage so I just plug it in until charged and good to go.
