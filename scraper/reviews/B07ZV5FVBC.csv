5,So far this is the best shredder I've ever owned by a wide margin! Glad I spent a little bit more money on a much higher quality product (I got the 10min one too) this is the best bang for your buck!I've had a few shredders before in the ~$40 range (mostly Staples ones) that broke pretty quickly -- this one really doesn't cost that much more comparatively. They'd only be able to do like 5 sheets (nowhere near 12) and eventually plastic bits would start falling out of the insides and it would stop working. If you put in like 4 sheets and folded one accidentally those would jam immediately. Then the jams would be hard to clear and could damage the shredder. Or you'd run it for like a minute and it would start overheating already and start malfunctioning.So far with this shredder in a few weeks' time period I already shredded more than I have in the past 5 years combined. Probably did like ~10000 sheets of lots of old documents. That's how much of a powerhouse this shredder is compared to all the other ones I've owned previously! So it's been easily worth the money already as it has outlasted the others that would start malfunctioning at ~1000 sheets.It's also never jammed on me! I've never tried 12 sheets on it but it'll do 6 sheets no problem whereas my previous shredders would start falling apart -- literally -- if you tried 6 sheets.And this thing can run for like an hour without overheating! Like I get tired out and I have to take a break well before it overheats. Whereas with previous ones I'd spend like 2 minutes and already had to wait for it to cool down. Now the bottleneck isn't the shredder but me!Also because it's been so durable so far I'm no longer afraid of shredding things here and there worried that the shredder might suddenly break. Sometimes I shred some old documents as a therapeutic meditative activity now -- shred your worries away xDIt also holds more paper than my previous shredders before I have to clean it out. And while it is taller than I expected that surprisingly made it more ergonomic so I didn't have to lean over as much while shredding.As some reviewers have noted when I got it I did check the insides and did see some bits of shredded paper. That seemed sketchy but it does say on the note that comes with it that they "test every shredder" and so that's why you might see some leftover bits. And honestly even if it is used it's outlasted my previous shredders by a 10x margin already so it's good quality stuff either way.So overall well worth the price best bag for my buck I've had with a shredder. Bonsaii also has a 1-year warranty (and the reviews seem to say that they've made good on that too!) which is why I originally bought it with my past shredder purchases going awry. But I guess it's as they say if a company is confident in such a long warranty the product probably isn't going to break quickly! Hoping to have this last for many more years :)
5,I liked it But then it randomly shut down and I had to slap the top of it for it to turn back on. (read til end)The window is useful but where I have it I can't see it clearly (dark).I looked through the troubleshooting and it told me to check if it was full and sure enough it was - _-So yea the window tells you when it's full since this shredder motor sits deep into the container. I thought it still had a little more to go but forgot the motor is pretty big.
5,Bougt a replacement for my old broken shredder. This is doing the job so far still manageable noise and overall functioning the way i expect it to. Nothing fancy.
5,This was a replacement shredder & it proved to be much better. Quiet operation efficient & easy to use.
5,I have run hundreds of files with no problems.  I am very pleased with its performance.
5,The size is perfect for our needs it's also quiet when it runs! Very important for us since we both work 3rd shift... we're not waking up to a crazy loud paper shredder! Whoop! Whoop!
5,I feed this thing unopened junk mail and it just effortlessly chews through stuff.  So far I am extremely impressed with this machine.  My old shredder was a toy in comparison as it could only handle three sheets and I had to remove staples.  I'm loving the new found freedom this gives me.
5,very dependable. no paper jams.
5,Best shredder have ever bought
5,like it
4,For the price this thing is good. It’s jammed and still works after being unceremoniously un-jammed.
5,Great product….heavy duty built.
4,Very sturdy. So far shreds 10 or 12 sheets at a time
4,Product arrived overnight super easy setup. I was actually using the shredder less than ten minutes of opening box.
5,I haven't had it long but this shredder is very sturdy and working well so far even on cardboard.
4,It was a lot smaller than I thought it’d be.
5,Small enough to conceal when not in use.  Works great and credit card feature is most convenient!  Recommend highly for home use!
4,Does a good jobfits is small places..only gave it a 4 because I shared lots .therefore bigger is better
5,It was quiet and does the job. We have not had it put to long term use yet but the noise is a large factor at this firm.
5,It works great!  Very good value.
5,Initially this was a great product with no issues whatsoever. I only used it intermittently and made sure to clear the shreds of paper from the blades to avoid jams. I kept the machine very clean. Once it was unplugged I would use tweezers to remove every bit of paper from the blades to keep it in working order. The other day I plugged it in to use it turned the switch to auto and just like that no power. No power in reverse either. Not sure what happened but it's in the landfill now. Very disappointed.
5,I have had this for about two weeks now and have had no problems with it as of yet. I have shred atleast 500 - 1000 documents already maybe even more then this without any issues.
4,I use this unit to shred private documents for my tax service and personal use.  Shredding is adequate but it does clog the cutters too easily.  Wish I had spent more and purchased a micro cross cut shredder like I had before.
5,Sturdy fast and so far no paper jams
5,Quiet and easy to use.
4,It's fine if you shred as go.  Don't accumulate a big paper stack because it has a thermal protection lock out.
5,Takes at least 14 pages with no issues.  Shreaded a lot of stuff and container still not full.  Do not know bout safty features.  I like this and have no complaints.  Have not shreaded disks or credit cards.  Only used paper and staples.November 17 2921.  Shreader stopped working.  Valled number on shreader to troubleshootTHEY ATE SENDING ME OUT A NEW SHREADER.  I wonder if they would of done this if I had it longerMay 5th 2022Shreader got stuck again.  Called # again on unit to get help.  They told me what to do and shreader is working great again!  Great customer service! You just have to be careful not to put too much in it.  Shreader gets stuck. And reverse did not do a good job. This time I just had to get the stuck paper out of unit!  Takes 14 pages though. I try to keep the page count lower though
5,Cross Cut multiple page capability
5,Easy to use. Cut documents into very small pieces leaving  me with a feeling of security without worries that Nyone would piece the pages back together.
5,This thing chews it up! Love it
3,It definitely seems safe to use. My teen helped me to shred some old bills. However it only lasted about 1-200 papers and it won’t work. It no longer spins and makes a screeching sound. I’ve let it cool down  cleaned it out and nothing helps.
5,For the cost this shredder is effective.
4,Good quality
5,As expected
5,As a shredder
5,Shreds like a charm
3,Paper jams up in the shredding teeth and needs to be cleaned out frequently even when the basket is empty.
4,It’s fine for simple home use - old files containing personal information that you don’t want to send to the dump etc.  But you might want to go with a bigger one if you have a home office.  Bin fills fast and is a little awkward to empty.
4,It is more powerful than I thought it would be. Take your time and it will eat that paper. A little top heavy but not a real problem. Fills quickly.Easy to clear if it becomes jammed by reversing. I was putting in about 10 pages at a time and it worked well.It will shut down for 30 min after about 15 min of use if you continuously feed it but I didnt find that to be too inconvenient for my use.It is good for the price but I dont think it is good for a large office. More for home or very small office use.
5,Great shredder.  Serves our purpose perfectly.  Thanks
4,Ok while it lasted. I know how shredders do jam I have been especially careful with this one. I love the way it shreds credit cards and shredded paper. However if the basket gets full and you’re shredding paper the shredded paper it may back up into the blades which can cause severe jamming.  so that is my issue now. it’s been a year since I’ve had it October 2021 would’ve been one year so just a year and a few months and it’s no longer functioning. I can’t get it replaced under the factory warranty. therefore I am in search  of another shredder not sure if I will buy this brand again but I will say it was worth the money but now the price has increased. When I bought it I paid $54.99
5,Home shredding
3,I should have  gotten larger
3,It says this can handle 12 pages at once. No way. At about 5 it bogs down and strains to mulch them. Overall it got the job done. But needed patience to get through the shredding that was needed. Also one good thing it doesn't jam very much and the reverse mode takes care of the rare occasion it does.
5,It functions as described.  It’s a little too top heavy and wish it had a larger bin.  Otherwise seems to be a workhorse.
3,I assumed I was buying a new product but it is very obviously used and arrived pretty dirty and dusty. I wouldn’t have purchased it at this price if I’d known that.
5,This product  seems solid and offers good value  You just cannot be too careful with the sensitive information you through into the rubbish bin
5,Solid unit for the cost. I’ve not had the unit over heat yet and I had 3 years worth of junk to shred.
5,This paper shredder is great! This shredder is very quiet compared to others that I have had.  I had a lot of shredding to do and found this shredder capable of shredding quickly.  The only con I can think of is that  container is small had to dump several times.
5,So I ordered a Bonsaii paper shredder over 4 years ago but thought that it was only 2 years old (this extra time at home has totally messed up my time references!).  It was jammed and we thought that was the end of it.  Well I checked to see if I needed to write a scathing review about how it doesn't last as long as one should (I was feeling surly that day) only to realize that it was much older than I thought.  Well I figured it was just at the end of its life so I ordered another one.  Well one more try with trying to unjam it and VOILA!  It's back to its former glory.  As a result I haven't even had the opportunity to use the new one!This was an amazing purchase and I would recommend this brand to anyone.
5,Equipo co buena calidad en su motor de trituradora y buena fabricación.
4,Would liked to have the shredded pieces smaller.
1,This shredder has been working faithfully for my without any issues. I typically never shred at the max capacity of 12 pages at a time. I’m usually at about 8 max and never had a jan problem. The motor completely died on me just at the 1 year mark. I also painstakingly cleaned both sides of the shredding blade with tweezers and was hopeful that once I was able to clear it that the blades would turn and do their magic again. What a waste of money. My previous el cheapo shredder lasted me 10 years and only shredded up to 6 pages at a time but it was very faithful. I regret getting rid it of and replacing it with this gawd awful one from Bansaii. What a waste of money
5,Exceeded my expectations!  This smaller shredder really packs a punch!  Some reviews complain of the 5 minute "limit."  If you run 12 pages at a time and don't let it stop it will only run for 5 minutes straight.  However grab some papers shred them pick up some more then shred those and you won't have to worry about the 5 minute "issue."  I shredded enough paper to fill two 30 GALLON garbage bags over the course of 3 hours and it didn't stop once!  Shredded credit cards without missing a beat.  This is a heavy duty shredder.  Buy it you won't regret it!
5,I’m definitely very happy with this shredder it’s not obscenely loud and does a good job I found the top heavy bit after looking at how solid the blades are I can see why. Worth every penny and then some.
3,Okay product paper jam easily
1,Obviously used to shred documents.  The first shredder worked for 6 weeks.  Careful to not overwork the machine. Only Shredded 3 or 5 sheets at a time (maximum shredding capability is 12 sheets - don't do that many). Did not shred longer than 3 - 5 minutes at a time (maximum 5 minute using time).  What a nuisance.  Machine totally malfunctioned 2 weeks after return eligibility date with Amazon.  Contacted the company. Sent pictures of Machine with explanation of the malfunctioning problem.  After going back and  forth with the Custer service rep it was finally determined they would send a new replacement.  On the second day after we received the replacement the machine died.  We replaced our original unit ( a Fellows product) after approximately 10 years with never having 1 problem.  We decided not to  pursue a replacement. The company DOES NOT REFUND MONEY.  They only replace the unit. BUYER BEWARE. NOT A CONSUMER FRIENDLY COMPANY.Writing a review like this goes against my grain.  However  after dealing with the company for several weeks my frustration has got the best of me.  I suspect there are many customers who are use this company's products are wondering what planet I come from!
5,Just as described
4,This shredder works much better than the ones I've had in the past but it has one characteristic that I'm not crazy about which is the 5-minute limit for shredding. It's inconvenient if I have a lot of shredding to do because I have to wait for 40 minutes between 5 minute  bouts of shredding apparently to keep the unit from over-heating. If I had read the provided info more thoroughly I probably would have sprung for a more powerful unit. But as long as you use as instructed it seems to work fine.
4,Well? I purchased this unit in June 2020.  Today is March 2021.  While it's "working" it seems to have slowed down and making a horrible clicking noise.  Always properly used and never abused.  1 year warranty stated.  Will reach out to seller and update.Update July 2021. Seller provided a replacement. Working well and thankful for good customer service.
5,Well worth the upgrade to 12 sheets at a time capacity for my year end home office records shredding; did an excellent job!
5,If you’re looking for a home office shredding to do some simple shredding this is perfect. Able to do a few pages at a time. Shreds well. A little noisy but what shredder isn’t.
5,This is an efficient shredder and far less noisy than previous ones I have owned.
5,Very great product
1,I had a fellows shredder for years until it recently stopped working and decided to give this one a go based off reviews. Worst purchase ever. I have not even used enough to empty the bin the first time before it stopped working. It got a paper jam and I was able to take the paper out but bits of paper are stuck on the blade. Unless the fellows which provided more space to allow me to remove paper bits stuck there this shredder is so narrow it is impossible to clear it. I have to use a knife as the only thing narrow enough to fit in the space and it has scratched up the entire shredder and it still not clear or working. I have reached out to customer support and will await their response but I am extremely disappointed in the shredder. I understand for safety features the space between blades is good if you have kids but makes it impossible to clear any paper jam
5,I bought this in September 2020 and used it occasionally.  Then I had my first jam a few weeks ago and after I cleared the jam the shredder had stopped working.  Reverse still worked but not the shredder.I contacted customer service and described the problem.  They agreed to send a replacement for free.The new shredder arrived within a week and is working well.  I'm being careful to keep it at about 5 or 6 pages at a time to avoid the possibility of another jam.  5 stars for customer service!
2,I liked that it shredded more pages than others I have had.
4,This shredder is great for at-home. It has yet to jam on me as I am quite careful with how many sheets I am putting in. The only con would be that the storage is smaller than I would like and the top shredder part is quite heavy.
2,It says you can shred upto 12 pages at time...7 pages & it gummed in order to un-jam itit would need taken apart down to the blades
4,Paper shredding
4,Like
2,It only allows 2 or 3 sheets at a time.  It's nice and sturdy but I would pass!
4,I love that it shreds the paper super fine but I don't like the fact that it bunches up in the shredder itself. I continually have to pull the loose ones from the shredder. Other than that I am super satisfied with my new shredder. I have only had it a few days so we will see how it does after a few weeks.
1,This is not worth the money I paid for it.  First off it only has an off setting automatic setting and reverse setting.  It has no forward button that keeps running continuously until I want to change settings and 9 out of 10 times if you use the reverse setting it causes it to bind up with paper and no paper will feed through forward.  I have to take a pointed object and push the jammed paper through the shredder roller blades to clear the jammed paper.  I spend more time working on it than using it.  I could not put as many sheets of paper through at the same time as seller said could be shredded at one time.  I would only feed through about half as many sheets.  I would recommend you not "EVER" use the reverse setting if you make the mistake of purchasing this product.
3,Gets hot too fast... Not for commercial use! Good home shredder!
2,We received it 6 days ago. It overheats quickly. It cannot handle 12 sheets of paper.  It has a popping noise that sounds like something is about to break.
5,Bought it to replace an Amazon Basics shredder that gave up the ghost after a brief career in my home office. This one is heavier and feels better made as reflected in the 10% price difference. I don't ask much of these things and it's early yet but so far it's done 8-10 page wads without difficulty. I put waste bags in and it works fine with them.
3,No "on" switch just "reverse" "off" and "Auto" which makes it difficult to clear. Had to clear by hand (after unplugging)
3,Used it for about an hour. Then I put in 5 pages and it jammed. Did the reverse to get them out then jammed again. Now it doesn't take paper because there seems to be a load of shredded paper around the rotors.I haven't had a chance to open it up to clear it (don't know if that will even work) but definitely not happy with the purchase.____________________________19-03-21: I received a replacement without having to ask- just received so will be using it again though more carefully. 5 points for the customer service and will give updates on performance.
1,There is no indicator when it's full so all you can go by is the window. Fair enough. However at 3/4 full it's completely clogged doesn't shred anymore and now that I tried to clear the jam it does't even turn on anymore. At least before it would go backwards haha. Which didn't change anything the paper was still stuck. I had this for 4 months hardly used and I'll can do now is throw it out and buy a new one. I wouldn't recommend.
5,Not liking the heavy weight.....After using it just a few hours it quite working and nothing I could do to rectify the problem.  Must call customer service now
5,I use this mainly to shred cardboard. It works really well. It started to slow down a little after several months use so I purchased lubrication/sharpening sheets and now it is back to shredding the cardboard at the speed it used to. Always had issues getting enough browns for my garden compost until I purchased this.
4,Works good
4,This is a good shredder. It will NOT shred 12 sheets consistently as it is advertised. I usually shred 4 or so at the time and it does good. This is not your volume shredder if you need to dispose of a lot of paperwork on a daily basis. Get a more robust and expensive one.
5,works great for my business if i sent in a bad review it was by mistake wrong product this product is great
5,Could use handles to lift the heavy cutter up from basket
1,The shredder stopped working after just over a month.  Moderate to light use.  I contacted their support they said we need a copy of the receipt and a video demonstrating it doesn't work.  Its been three weeks and I keep sending emails and additional requests for help - nothing.  Garbage support from amazon and whoever this wacky 800 number service is - obviously an outsourced support service company.  Really unhappy - the item should have been fully replaced  under warranty or a full refund should be issued.  I feel like they are intentionally dodging giving me support until the warranty runs out or i get tired and just go away.
5,This is a great shredder. It definitely takes 12 pages and the accidental staple. I'm not really interested in shredding papers. I have to clean out my office after 10 years of collecting papers and it's doing the job with gusto. I hightly recommend if you need some shredding in your life.
3,I had a lot of trouble with the first one I ordered. would jam and the reverse didn't clear the jam. Also I tried a credit card and that jammed also. I would be surprised if 12 sheets would be a good idea. I only do up to 4Amazon kindly sent me a replacement As long as I empty it when the bin is 1/2 full and run the reverse periodically whether it needs it or not so far the replacement has been satisfactory.
1,Bought in November was fooled by the price. Seemed like a reasonable deal but when it jammed up after 6 months I realized you get what you pay for.  I put in a peace of junk Mail from AAA and it ground to a halt.Then I spent hours cleaning the jam going back and forth. Now the cutters don’t turn and nothing feeds into it. I wish I would have listened to all the negative reviews and saved 54.00 I hope some will listen to mine.  I can’t contact anyone with the company if you call they put you on hold for a half hour then disconnect and 6 months is to long to send it back. A warranty is worthless if you can’t talk to anyone in the company.all I have left to the bbb and a trash bin.
4,Paper shredder
2,Works well at first!!!  Wife uses it to shred many medical documents every day.  HOWEVER after a couple weeks of use it jams up quickly and you have to MANUALLY unclog it frequently. I found that the claw parts of the grinder fill and jam up with bits of paper then it starts jamming up. You actually have to use an ice pick to remove these bits of paper jammed in the claw parts.  After cleaning well it will shred about 30 sheets and then start jamming again. (We only shred one sheet at a time in the shredder and it still jams. I think the claws are machined too roughly and causes the paper bits to stick to them. The claws may get dull quickly (not hardened) and that prevents cutting the paper correctly. (Not sure but educated guess)
1,Stopped working after first use. Just makes noise but the shredder blades don't move tried reverse and that didn't help either.Returning for refund.Don't waste your time with this!!!
5,So far so good for household paperwork.
5,I've had a lot of shredders over the years but so far this is truly the best one I've purchased.  It does a fabulous job at cutting up old credit cards as well as lots and lots of old bills that keep pilling up.  This is definitely the most used thing I've purchased this year.
5,It’s the best shredder ever! And basically I shred a lot! I mean lots of important papers and envelopes  and it runs like a champ  as well as it holds up a lot of shredded papers before emptying l.
5,Love it shredded very good
4,One of the best I've bought so far
2,I only used the shredder once a quarter and bought it in Nov last year.  So I used it about four times putting financial documents through it.  I do not own a business or work from home so it was barely used.  Today I used it for a few minutes straight without stopping and then it wouldn't go forward or in reverse. I called the number on the motor and left a message.  I liked that it could shred with a staple in the papers. But I have another really old shredder that doesn't do staples. I bought it years ago at Staples for like $20. It still works.  So I don't give this Bonsai high marks.
5,great value for your money. don't try to put more than 6 sheets of paper at 1 time. it will get stuck & not easy to get out. but if you use less you will be satisfied with the performance. takes up a small space.
4,Value for money. Obviously not as secure as a cross cut but I didn’t want to spend that much. Doesn’t overheat quickly
5,It does everything it says on the product. I love it it’s fast and pretty quiet. I’ve been shredding everything
3,The downside of this shredder is it has no handle or safe way to remove the top when removing the shredded material.  Other shredders usually have something to grip this one does not.  It's precarious to try and put the top back in without worrying about getting your fingers in between.The upside is it's quiet and does the job.
1,This shredder stopped working on the first day we got it. It says it can do up to 12 papers. I didn’t try that but as I was shredding I noticed it struggled with letters that were folded (4 sheets). Eventually it just stopped working. You could hear the spinning sounds but paper had gotten stuck on the feeding side and those could not be removed. First day! Don’t bother with this one.
1,The motor broke with 10 sheets. Into the landfill it goes. More cheap junk going to the dump in less than a year.I opened it up and found that they use plastic gears which simply snapped under the pressure of six sheets. Photo attached.I will be reaching out to this company for a refund and will update my review on how that goes. DO NOT BUY.*UPDATE: I have reached out to the company and been ignored. They have deleted my 1 star review on their website twice. They are curating the reviews on their website.**UPDATE: I posted a question (not a review) on their website and they actually replied (photo attached). I asked "why do you keep deleting my 1-star review?" and they actually replied with "12 page shredder will not shred 12 pages or even 8. It works well on 2 or 3."So you did see my review.... and it's called a 12-page shredder. And their descriptions say 12 pages... wow. Welcome to the new normal!
1,Poor quality and quit working in a month.  Did all the troubleshooting and still did not work.  No satisfaction when I called the company; said out of warranty.  I will not buy from this company again!!!
1,Warranty is only 30 days. It's a piece of junk; jams easily and not easy to clear. Mine broke after 5 weeks.
5,All good
5,This Shredder is Very Fast and Effective...Allows Me to Spend Less Time Getting Paper Resolved and Thrown Away...a Excellent Product and Cost Effective Too .
4,This machine works well. Very top heavy. Not a light unit.
4,Have learned to push down shreds occasionally so blades dont get clogged.
5,This is a great paper shredder!  Very easy to use.  The “window” in the front is very helpful in showing how full it is.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good paper shredder!
4,It's been good for what I need without spending that much. Quality is good but remains to be seen in the coming days.
5,I've been needing to get a shredder for years & finally got around to it. As soon as I opened it I put it to the test. So far I've shredded credit cards old CDs & 6 stapled pages all without issue. I still need to go through a huge stack of papers needing shredding but so far it works great!
5,I had a problem not with the shredder but found my house was too humid. I bought a small dehumidifier and no problems since. The company contacted me and were very helpful even tho it was not their machine that was the problem.
5,It was smaller than I thought! However it does work wonderfully!  I have only used it a couple of times but so far so good!  It is quiet and shreds nicely!  It helps clean up the clutter of paperwork!
4,Looks mice but to be honest I haven’t use it
5,Upgraded my antiquated shredder to this one and wish I made the switch sooner. This shredder is really quiet compared to my last one and is more powerful. Does a great job shredding and compacting so you can shred a lot of pages before having to empty the bin. Awesome safety features as well.
5,This shredder was bought as a replacement for a bonsaii shredder I have owned several years. It is a smaller model than the one I owned previously; however I like it because it has basically the same features and is much quieter.
5,Handles junk mail easily. Like any shredder it overheats if you use it for too long but once I had gotten through my backlog it hasn’t been a problem since. Large enough capacity that I don’t have to empty it often with normal use.
5,Working well so far. I’ve only shred 2-3 sheets of paper at a time. Shreds quickly. Not sure if it will get hot quickly as I’ve not used it to shred a bulk of paper as yet.
1,Filled the bin 4 times.  Worked great.  Next batch it started to jam up while only feeding 4-5 sheets at a time.  Died soon after
3,This shredder is okay for home use but I am a little disappointed. If you run 5 sheets through it it sounds like the motor is straining. I went to shred a cd and it jammed. Now I use it mostly to shred paper. Adequate for paper but it could be better
4,I would prefer that basket be taller
2,Jams to easily  very messy  when you need to empty very dissatisfied.
5,so far it's been a great replacement for a shredder that I have had for many years
4,Small but efficient. A bit noisy. It's nice to have the small view space so I know when to empty it.
1,Works nowhere near as advertised. Can't shred more than 2 or 3 sheets at a time. Paper jams common. We gave up and donated it to our housekeeper.
5,I had a non-operating problem with one component on the paper shredder.  Bonsaii promptly sent me a replacement.  Excellent customer service.  The shredder performs very well.
5,I love this shredder! Sure can’t put these pieces together. Great for credit cards too. We replaced old machine. Nice sized. Heavy duty.
5,This is a mighty mini!!! I was nervous because it was smaller than my last shredder.  It is smaller but it works great! Best feature... I can actually put a plastic bag to collect the shred.. no more loose pieces at the bottom of the bin.Love it!!
4,Had to shred all of my late husband’s files.
3,I would be cautious when buying from this company. My first purchase died within 3 weeks. Only used it 5 times with 8-9 pages at a time. It took me two months to receive a replacement
5,For small to medium shredding projects this is a great item. Have used it to shred paper and credit cards with no issues and no jamming
2,This shredder stop working after 3 months. Nothing is jammed in it. I turn it on amd it starts smoke. Please buy something else this one is a poc
3,I am not happy with this product!!  It does not work as advertised.  I kept getting paper jams after only using 4 or 5 papers at a timeVery disappointed in product❗️Elaine Shatz
5,This is a good product for what I use it for at home.  It is durable and works great.  It can only hand 6-7 sheets of paper at a time.
5,Great product does the job put two bins of paper through it so far no issues. Only downside is wish the collecting bin was larger.
4,The cutter is a bit awkward to handle.
5,Bonsaii Paper Shredder 12 Sheet Cross Cut-works very well. Had it for less than a month and is doing well. Light to medium home use to shred unwanted bills and documents.  Surprisingly feels like a good quality shredder. Recommend.
5,This is one of the least expensive shredders but it is very solidly made can handle 12 sheets (although I do not use more than about 8 sheets at a time). I highly recommend this shredder.
5,Great
5,I enjoyed it works exactly how it says I enjoy shredding my stuff...it is more on the heavier side but it fits anywhere
5,Is exactly what you ordered. Easy to use.
4,i would like a bigger basket to catch shredding
4,Just started using it. It appears to work fine.?
5,I replaced another one that I had that had stopped working correctly which was a different brand.  This one seems to be working just fine.. good for the value I would recommend it..
4,This is just what I needed.  All I need to do the job.
5,Great little shredder you can stick anywhere out of the way. I love it! It's perfect for my needs.
4,Reasonable and adequate.
5,I like it because it’s quite and smooth when it cut.  What I don’t like is if I use it a lot at one time it will jam
5,Loves to devour all of the credit card offers and unwanted bills! What a great “gotta have” for any household!
1,Lightly used for under three months. Totally failed.  The price is right but product is not suitable for use it is advertised for.  What good is AMAZON prime if I cannot return and product totally fails.
1,Not very sturdy to do more than 5 sheets even though it said 12.Just stopped workingSo returning.
1,This is the worst shredder it jams all the time under five minutes of use! It also isn’t true that you can shred more than 1 page at a time! Bonsaii Cuatomer service is terrible they give you excuses and said shredders will jam! I said they can’t jam all the time that isn’t normal! DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5,So far great.  Not too much noisein my opinion.  I recommend it.
5,I love it.  Its fast and durable.  I already done shredded up half a file cabinet I had.
5,Very quiet and powerful.
4,As described
2,disgusted
3,It's powerful but I don't like the fact that you can only use it with the garbage can it came with.. it has this like magnetic mechanism to connect the shredder with the can for it to work ... Might return it
3,I only used 6 sheets at a time. It worked well initially but started to stop working (jams). You also need to empty the bin when it’s half full or else the shredded sheets will be pulled back to the blades thereby jamming it.
3,Advertised as cross cut the one sent to me is not. It gets the job done. I don't want the hassle of returning so I will keep it.
3,Didn’t last me long got jammed and I get a lot of spam mail so waste of money
1,I used this shredder for less than an hour and it quit.  Very disappointing!
5,very good Brand this may be the best I ever purchase. Thanks.
1,I know it is not the most expensive one out there but you would like it would last more then 2 days.
5,It is small but mighty!! Just be sure to follow the instructions for use especially lubricating the blades. If you do it will keep humming along like my shredder.
1,When I first received this shredder I liked it.  It was quiet and shredded quite nicely.  But after roughly 12 days I heard a loud pop then it sounded like it had rocks in it and would not shred anything more than a page. Sounds like some internal gears failed.  Sucks...
5,Its everything I expected and more glad that I purchased it
1,Broke down on the first use
5,I like the way it shreds the paper The shredder mechanism seems to very ample..
5,I finally found a shredder that finally works well. Papers don’t get stuck. I did a lot of shredding and it didn’t break. I even shredded a credit card without problem. I highly recommend this product.
5,Very pleased with this paper shredder. It’s powerful and no issues with jamming!
4,Great
5,Shredded the paper good and could use more sheets in it than my old one.
5,Great shredder. This is the first one I ever purchased but I can tell you it’s very good and I am excited about how well it shredded my important documents
1,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. The thing kept jumping with only 2-3 sheets. Got stuck and them got stuck again and again. Then totally stopped working. My wife says it's the worst shredder she has ever had.Can't get it unstuck so in the trash it goes. If your looking for a good shedder guy anything else but this one.
5,Shreds 12 sheets at time and quiet
5,I really like this shredder and it works great!!!!!!!!
1,This product overheats very quickly and constantly jamming
2,Too small and weak. Junk
5,whole family like it very versatile price good
1,Need exchange.  No longer working.  Please help me with this.  Need Printed mailing label.
2,very hard to empty very overated
3,To top heavy. Keeps falling over.
1,This item is complete CRAP. I used it once and it over heated. And now is not working
5,Makes the small shred strips that I like which works very well for my home office.
1,This is the worst shredder I have ever owned. It worked for 15 minutes tops.  It says it's supposed to shred 12 sheets at a time.  I inserted possibly 4-6 standard sized sheets at the very most and it got stuck once.  I was able to free the paper and the second time it just completely stopped.  Reversing didn't work.  I let it sit for hours unplugged it and nothing.  I called customer service and was on hold for about 18 minutes and then disconnected.  I emailed and no response.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.  It's not user error because my last shredder lasted for about 12 or more years and it cost less.  I just basically shredded my money.
5,Didn't over heat and went through 8 bags if you used properly.
1,I have owned this product less than one month and it is already not working.  I have only ran less than 100 sheets of paper through it and never more than 3 or 4 together at one time with any staples in it or any credit cards/plastics.  I would like a replacement as clearly this is a lemon.
2,Tried to do about 12 papers like said can handle and it got jammed. I switched it to reverse and it didn't do anything. I tried to pull the paper out while in reverse to help it and it is now off the track. Now it doesn't pull the paper down. Didn't even last a month.
5,For a small unit it does the job.
3,It is much smaller it will require you to empty the container often.
5,Strong machine
1,Thos didn't even last 2 months. Don't waste your money! Should be 0 stars high cost low quality.
1,I don't care for this shredder. I've ordered two(2) and they both stopped shredding after several uses. The shredder stopped catching because paper got caught in the shredder's feeder and I could not remove the paper caught in the feeder even with your counsel. I took a pair of tweezers and tried to pluck out the stuck paper and then used a credit card to further loosen the paper and turned on the reverse operation and then tried inserting two(2) pieces of paper in the feeder and it did not catch. I want my money back and need to know what to do to return them.I have one boxed up already..the first shredder and need to know how to return the second. I think I have the return label for the first.
5,I like this shredder is smaller than the older one I had.  Powerful and quiet too!
5,I have no dislikes
3,It’s ok - not as good as I thought it would be - also kinda heavy
1,Basket came cracked it is paper thin I can only imagine how long this would have lasted if I actually got to use it. I can’t say what the shredding is like but without a basket there’s no need to proceed.
5,I bought this for home use. For my needs it is perfect.
2,The shredder worked well out of the box but within 4 months the gears in the middle jammed after routine use on normal paper.  I called customer service who will send a replacement but the shipment will originate from Vietnam and will not arrive for another 3 weeks per their estimation.  I give this item 2 stars for customer service- Zero stars for the actual product.
5,It shreds the paper just right.Love it.
2,You have to take off top to empty the shredded paper. Don’t like that.
5,Work just fine! Much needed to get rid of important papers
5,been needing one of these and this thing is very efficient
2,The will not feed paper anymore in less than 5 month from time of purchase. Awful performance. Of course the return period was 30 days. Since I am working from home this is unacceptable. Documents with PPI and HPI should be shredded. This item was a waste of money
5,Does a great job of shredding mailings.
5,This unit is a perfect tool for the home office
5,Love the shredder. It fulfills its promises.
5,Works well ---can now get rid lots of papers no longer needed
3,The motor is too load.
5,It’s a good shredder for the money
3,smaller than I wanted  have  to clean  a lot
5,Works great. Amazon basic stripped gears by
5,I re  as lot love this I wish it had wheels the base is kinda heavy
1,Have had it less than a month and it's burned out.
5,Absolutely GREAT!  Perfect price-point and everything we we expecting.  Thank you!
5,This shredder does exactly what we wanted
5,works great and does 12 pages at once
5,USO PERSONAL...
5,i love my shreder
5,Good  machine work great
5,Great for the money!
1,Opened box plugged it in and began testing product.  Max capacity is 12 sheets of paper but I didn’t want to push it so only did some receipts regular size sheets of paper and a few pieces of junk mail.  I didn’t operate continuously only in small batches.  Before the bin was even 3/4 full it stopped working.  I thought maybe it overheated so I left it alone for about 20 minutes.  When I tried again it wouldn’t work but the light was on.  Waited another 10-15 minutes and still won’t work.  Back to China it goes👎👎
5,Right size
5,Shreds really quickly
2,Worked ok and was used as directed- one day stopped taking paper- don't buy! Customer service proved finally sent another unit out after quite a bit of prodding.
5,Powerful shredder at a good price
5,security factor
5,Compact works well love it!
1,does not crosscut just shreds inconvenient to use and empty smaller capacity than expected not worth the money
5,Works very good
1,After one session of slowly inserting a few pieces at a time a pin on one of the gears bent and now the device is unusable :/
2,Although we are very careful not to feed too much paper into this shredder it jams frequently.  It is not easy to remedy the jam as we have to take the gears apart to clear the machine to continue using it.
3,Noisy paper jams would not recommend
5,Shredding documents
1,First day it jammed on one side.  Second day it stopped working completelyOld shredder lasted 6 years without any problems not this brand though
5,Liked it
5,This is a really good shredder for the price
5,Works perfectly
5,I don’t like the product; it James up very easily and stops working
1,I got what I paid for. Don’t do it
3,Not happy it turns off after about 20 papers
5,Quite quiet
2,Extremely loud and item jammed constantly even with 5 pieces of paper. I bought it May 31stbit died last than 2 months after! It. It jammed every week in between. I used my mom’s Amazon basics and I was highly impressed. I ordered on immediately! Don’t waste you money on this shredded.
5,Love my shredder its the perfect size and works great.
1,This is the worst shredder I have ever bought. Do NOT spend your money on this.
1,This is like a toy...it comes up to my knees and I'l 5'4" tall.  It doesn't have a removable bin to empty the shreds...you have to take the heavy top off every time to empty it (if it is plugged in that's a problem).  It holds barely 50 pages of shred before needing empty.  Its only $55 dollars but buy one with more capacity and convinience to it. This thing is for cancelled checks....maybe.
1,Broke after two weeks .
1,would not recommend.....jams very quickly...
1,K hace 1 mes y algo y ya no sirve claro que no me agrado
5,Very heavy duty
5,Perfect for a home office
5,Great product
1,Completely jammed up after one month.  auto on feature failed to work.  Extremely poor quality and certainly not worth the money.
5,I liked that itt works perfect. No problems.
5,Acorde al precio
2,The first and second one only lasted for days. Kept jamming and ultimately stopped working.
5,Perfect
5,i LIKE THIS PRODUCT
1,Didn't even get to fill up the tub with shredded paper before it stopped working.
2,I just received this shredder @15 min agoAfter using for approx 7 min it overheated and won’t go back onKeeps going back to red light and shutting down???
2,I was looking for something different
5,Wonderful
1,I bought this to keep in our home office to discard personal info. EVERY time that we used it it jammed or over heated. It would jam with 3 pieces of paper!!. I was able to get un-jammed a few time but I finally contacted customer service and they sent me another shredder in hopes that it would work... NOPE same thing happened!!! The quality of this product is terrible. DO NOT BUY and WASTE your money!
2,I purchased this item and the first day I used it just stop working.  I could not fix it so I returned it for another brand.
1,Died on first use.
2,After only having the shredder for a month it just stopped working. It barely held 4 sheets of paper
2,It says can handle 12 sheets of paper NO it doesn't four sheets jammed it had to take it apart to unjam it.
5,QUICK
2,The blade got stuck after one hour working so I have to wait till and you’re cool down and see if it’s working if not I have  to return to Amazon .
2,For such a small unit much too noisy great for shredding junk mail orJust to recycle paper with  no personal information.
1,I really just feed 2 pages at a time it cannot handle the 12 advertised. I have a small office and might need the shredder once a week when my reports do not print correctly. It jammed up by somehow leaving a lot of paper product above the shredding teeth. Please address this issue.
2,It was much smaller than the picture indicated
1,I ordered this unit and it didn't work right away. I have had a pending warranty for two months now and they can't even tell me when one can ship. Very bad experience
1,When it invariably jams it is a B**** to get it working again.  If a return wasn't such a hassle because of size and weight I would return it.
1,Shredded about 60 sheets of financial records the day I got it.  It broke the first time I used the "reverse" switch.  Sending it back.
2,It gets really hot when shread for a long time.
1,This product was a waste of money.  I only use it 3 times and you cannot shred no more than 2 documents.  This wasn't something I used on a daily basis so I'm not sure why it stop working.  Very dissatisfied with this product
2,Product works well but you are constantly empting it. Needs a bigger area to hold shreds.
1,Horrible. I have an older smaller one of this brand. It was great. I wore it out so had to have the same brand. New one is bigger supposed to handle more sheets. It sounds like it is dieing with one sheet. Gets hot way too quick takes forever to cool down. After contacting them they asked if I wanted my money back. I said yes. Haven't heard from them since.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Customer service is very hard to deal with. Still trying to get warranty service.
1,Shredding old documents didn’t last a good month. Called for product support they said they would send a new one. Been waiting over a month now not worth the money
1,I just opened my shredder and it looked used. It had a yellowish dried up glue substance under the lid.  Then it jammed on the first day I used it.  Now it won't work anymore. What a waste of money.
1,Overall good shredder but I really do not like it stop shredding all of the sudden because the bin is full. No warning sign to empty the bin and I wish I would known it before I buy this shredder.
1,It was fine until it stopped working. When you turn it to auto position motor start running with nothing inserted When you try to insert paper it wont go into feeder.
1,It didn't work for long
1,brought it on July 9 2021. Stop running already ! Speed is too slow and too much noise.Paper jam all the time .
1,I’ve used the items 2-3 times for light shredding. Today while using it it became jammed and now won’t operate at all. I never went over the 12 paper maximum. Extremely disappointed
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I am on my second one of this product i got one the paper got stuck and they replaced it. And now I am having the same issue and I have been going back and for with the seller and still it does not work. I don’t recommend this product at all
1,Purchased this in March. Had it for four months. Used it about 5 times. It is totally jammed up and will not budge.
1,Just got the shredder  it gets jammed when shredding credit cards. I am very dissatisfied
1,Do not buy ! a piece of junk!!! Work only in few days!  Returning and DEMANDING a F%%%%^ refund!  Worst purchase yet from Amazon! NOTE: DID NOT WANT TO GIVE NO STAR; ONLY DID TO BE ABLE TO SUBMIT THIS REVIEW!!
1,The product stopped working after about a week of use. Intermittent use.
2,The paper jammed frequently even with only 6 to 8 pages.
1,this product broke after minimal usage. it jammed and we cleaned it. when cleaning we noticed the teeth on the gears were broken
1,gets jamed up motor got hot started smoking. had it for A while before I used it so probably can/t send it back
1,Just received this unit today and it’s going back. Wife used it the first time and after about 8pcs of paper it jammed. She cleared it and the unit got hot and jammed again. Piece of junk! One star is one to many!!
1,This is a dangerous toy that falls over easily and shreds poorly.
1,This shredder stopped working within a few months. Customer service was worthless!
1,It’s not working already!  Didn’t have it long and it’s not jammed but not working.  Really disappointed with it!
2,Not recommended!
1,Brought in February this year product only work until recently now it will not shred do not buy
1,Only had it for a month before it quit on me
1,Would not turn back on after 1 usem
1,I liked it if it would have continued to work
1,After using this shredder for the second time it is already broken and will no longer shred paper.Not happy at all :(
1,It got jam with paper and I was unable to Unjam it I had to buy another one
1,It is much too small I was led to believe by looking at the picture it was much bigger than it is. Dissappointed.
1,I was able to shred a small amount of paper.  I used less than 12 sheets and it would get hung all the time.
1,Both only ran for a few days then continued to jam. Do not need to spend time unjamming it. Do not tecommend.
1,stopped working company said they would replace an never sent a replacment
1,Used 2 times and the blades jammed
1,I bought it to shred documents.It works well and price is very reasonable
5,
1,It did not hold up. Broke the first month I had it!
1,Started out OK but soon jammed under household use.Very disappointed.
1,It broke after using it for less than a month.
5,The only thing I don't like is that you cannot see when the paper is filling up
3,Ordered this item to replace an older shredder. It does not seem to cross-cut as described. The paper is coming out as strip cuts.
2,Can is very cheap plastic and the shredder top is extremely heavy. Ist use top slipped off the top of can and can split into. Called at least six times and was told a replacement was on the way. Never arrived!
1,It worked for maybe 3 minutes. My spouse bought it for me and I just tried it it only shredded maybe 5 papers and stopped working. Don’t spend your money on it it’s not worth it
5,Got it to replace a shredder that I put over the top of a garbage can and only shredded 2-3 pages at a time. This thing shreds a lot at a time. It shreds cards also. I am really enjoying it and it seems very sturdy.
1,When I opened it the printer had been used and full of shredded paper stuck in the teeth of the printer. Also there was dog or cat hair all over it.  It was the worst experience in the purchase of anything.  I have never given a bad review but I am compelled to let everyone know of my experience.
1,Did not take long to jammed to the point of no return.  The shredded paper accumulates under the cover and eventually jams up the teeth.  Trying to remove the cover to clean is impossible.Waste of money.  Do not buy.
1,On the 3rd shrewd the paper got stuck with 4 sheets and quit working. I’ve went back and forth to get the jam out CAN’T!!! It will notMove!!! It will go backwards but where the jam is it doesn’t budge!!! So can’t use it and husband through all the box and stuff away before I used it so can’t return it!!!! Makes me so mad!!!! DON’T BUY!!!!
2,I am returning this now. The pictures have you believe this is a standard size planner but when you get it its SMALL. Like it can sit on your desk. Buyer beware! Im not paying this much for a shredder this small. So mad and disappointed.
1,After several uses it died.
5,works well is heavy to me but does the job  only use in home but no problems so far
5,Small footprint great shredder crosscut
5,This is fun ! Awesome peace of equipment I didn’t know I need
5,Quiet works well!
5,Perfect in every way
1,UPDATE...I didn't think things could get worse but they have.  Not only is this a challenge to operate and do what it's supposed to do...it gets even worse as it no longer will shred even a half a page.  Please don't but this product unless you want to do like I did and just throw your money away!!!...Not recommended...I initially bought this shredder because I thought it was a good value. BUT this compact shredder was great when I only had to shred 2 or 3 sheets of paper a day. Once I began cleaning out files and running reams of docs through it for 20 minutes or more (sheet by sheet) it jammed and froze up.  Its gone from a paper shredder to a paper weight.  The shredded paper builds up below the cutting blades causing it to over-heat. Using the reverse function causes the shredder to jam and stop working completely.  After plucking the paper from the blades and waiting for the temperature to cool down it starts again.  Next time I'll buy a shredder that is functional and dependable.
5,Quiet and you don't have to shut it down every 10 mins!
5,Great purchase! My old shredder left the papers/cards in strips...this one cross cuts the items. It's not silent but it's not nearly as loud as my old one and it doesn't take up much space. I highly recommend this product.
5,It's smaller than I thought it would be but it does the job.
5,This shredder works as it should Price was good.
1,used the day i got it and ran about a dozen sheets in it and allready jamed up. i would not by this again.
5,Great quality and capable shredding ability. Very surprised at the strength...
5,works great and lightweight
5,Got it for my mom who’s old shredder from like the 2000’s broke! Awesome shredder! Did the job smoothly! No interruptions. Did credit cards like a piece of cake. It’s small and easy to hide and keep your room looking clean. Very well built shredder definitely recommend to anyone
5,This shredder works great. I have used it to shred personal information and it works good.
5,Does a lot of paper and runs very quietly.
5,It’s wonderful is exactly what I was looking for. Nicely built capable and sturdy.
5,at this time i can only expect for the best.
1,It gave up on me after the 3 shred
5,Very satisfied with our general lightweight shredding of paper. We haven't tried anything heavier such as cardboard etc.
5,manages multiple pages very easily
5,I like that it never got jammed where i couldn't get it fixed. i had another brand but it was as great as this.
5,Very easy to use
5,Just what I needed and is easy to use.
5,Shredding documents
5,Nice shredder.  Because I have arthritis and am older the top was too heavy for me to lift to empty.  So I gave this one to my son for his business and bought another from the same company that has a drawer in front that is easy to open and empty.
1,I ordered this paper shredder to assist with cleaning my home office. While cleaning I prepared a large pile and waited for the paper shredder to arrive. I unboxed it and it looked as if it had been used. See photo. I thought maybe they simply tested it. I plugged it in and tried shredding one sheet of paper. Nothing. It was broken. Why would a company send out a broke item. Not good spent your money somewhere else.
1,Used it one time snd it quit working.Update:  The seller sent me a new shredderat no additional cost. The shredder works. The container it sits on waste basket arrived cracked.  Luckily I still had the other on so between the 2 I have a complete Shredder.  The seller did try to make it right. So I would rather do business with someone who admts mistakes and will do their best to correct them. It didn't cost me anything over the original cost so I'm happy.
5,This is a sturdy efficient product. Compact in size but powerful. Good value
5,Wished it was wheels I like that it is light
5,Works great so far!
5,Good product its work 👍👍👍
5,Its very efficient and e3asy to us.
5,Very impressed with this shredder!  I didn’t know how noisy my old one was until I got this one! Quite powerful too!
5,Sharp. Compact. Holds twice as much as last shredder.
4,My father is a retired lawyer and needs to safely dispose of paperwork leftover from his practice. I purchased this shredder for him based on the reviews. It does need breaks but that’s great because so does my 72 year old dad! He can shred while listening to NPR or watching TV and emailed to say he really likes it.
5,So far so good.  Seems like a good value.
5,Best value for the money.  So much easier to use than my previous one.
5,Good shredder!
5,Easy to use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great value. Not too loud. Noise level is is quieter than other shredders. At first I shredded one piece of paper then I shredded the equivalent of 11 pieces of paper sheets and envelopes. Both went through with ease and definitely did the cross cut as you can see. Hope it will last!
5,Good size. Work very well!
5,I love the way it shredder the credit card and disc.
5,Excellent!!!
5,shreds up to 12 pages with or without staples and paperclips. Is Quiet. Effecient.  12 sheets Cross Cut Paper Shredder C170-C shipped next day delivered with care via Amazon. Placed in the special box on porch with care.  Instructions state run 5 min-max time rest 40 gives machine time to rest/clear and continue. Wont overheat this way.  Main switch has 3 settings - Auto REV OFF. The Power button is blue. Starts shredding automatically when paper is inserted into feed opening. Warranty is for 12 months from date of purchase. This product replaced similar shredder but it only did 5 sheets-wasnt as AWESOME as this one.  Highly recommend this product (home or office use)
5,As advertised! Very very happy!
4,It works well and does it's jobs and even shreds credit cards and DVDs. I just dislike that it can overheat just be careful not to stress the machine so much.
