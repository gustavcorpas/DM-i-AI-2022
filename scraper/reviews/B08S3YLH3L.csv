5,I use my tablet for artwork specifically using Procreate. I had used procreate for 2-3 days before ordering/receiving the screen protectors I can only tell the smallest of difference between cover/no cover. Generally when there is a problem it can also be attributed to going too fast - I.e: if you draw a line then undo then quickly go back to draw a line there ‚Äúmight‚Äù be a delay but it‚Äôs not an every time thing and I feel better knowing my screen is protected. Another thing I noticed covered vs uncovered using the iPad & pencil without the cover the pen would lag or get stuck if there was a fingerprint & so far I have not noticed that issue since putting the screen protector on.Install was also pretty easy I do recommend watching the YouTube video just to get a general idea (link provided inside the box). My only personal complaint is that I wasn‚Äôt fond of the cleaning wipes. I have used other screen protector kits & the wipes included in this set seem to have a stronger smell and take longer to clean off/clear the screen. My solution was to use the wipe then a very slightly damp paper towel before using the provided microfiber cloth.Final note is I was very impressed with the packaging. I was expecting something flimsier but they come in a well protected cardboard box/case that you can continue to use to hold the other set until it‚Äôs needed.
5,I bought these to go on my 5th gen iPad Pro 12.9" and they've been great so far. I've only used one but it's went on super straightforward and I don't think it's harmed the picture quality or anything whatsoever. I do wish there was a slight anti glare coating or something similar on the front because compared to the plain screen it does glare quite a bit when in sunlight or something bright but that's a very small price to pay!
5,Easy to install
4,Easy to put on jus missing the gadget to get the air bubbles out
5,The touchscreen works super well easy to install and perfect size for the iPad Pro 12.9 I really recommend it to anyone who wants to have something good
4,Excelente producto üëçüèΩ
5,I really like the product but it was a little difficult to put the screen protector only because the iPad is so big . But over all it worked out well.
5,Great products
4,It was a good product
4,Installation was a bit difficult lots of air bubbles and there was no way to remove it had to push them out. Quality of touch screen seems to be good quality it‚Äôs on the thick side so it will handle scratches. Most importantly the screen covers the entire iPad screen. iPad pro 12.9 2021 5th gen. And supports Apple Pencil. In addition it include camera lens protectors.
5,Great product quick delivery
4,Easy to install. Great screen protector
5,To soon to review
5,I loved the simple fact that it was installed in less than 1 mi ute literally less than one minute.  It took longer to take out the package than to actually install the protector screen.  Love it!!!
3,It‚Äôs fits
4,So the screen protector is amazing but the camera protector is use less it falls off too much.
5,As described. Delivered before estimate date.
5,Only downside to this was that my apple pen didn‚Äôt work great with this. But since I don‚Äôt use my pen that often I‚Äôm extremely happy with this. Honestly the video it tells you to watch seems skeptical but it worked exactly like the video! I was surprised. I bought for iPad Pro 14 and it fit great probably a millimeter shirt on all sides but once my case is on it‚Äôs not noticeable.
5,I love APPLE‚ÄôS Ipad Pro - 12‚Äù.  I had the original 1st Generation now I have the 5th Generation and am loving it.  This Screen Saver is great not a lot of smearing and everything  comes thru clearing.
5,So it fit perfect and was kind of easy to put on. Kinda because yes it stuck well but I hate having to take only a back slip off and getting it on. But I mean hey it fit and stuck well. Both sides fit and stuck well on it. Good buy
5,No issues with installing fit and touch screen works fine
3,It‚Äôs a nice screen but it has bubbles and it‚Äôs on a brand new fresh out of box IPad Pro.  And before you say I put it on wrong my husband who has been doing these for 20 years did it.
4,It's a universal doesn't fit exactly right on first generation iPad pro
4,Just as expected
4,Works very well and somehow picks up less finger prints than the normal screen!
5,Easy to install. Good quality. Price includes 2 great value
5,Install worked as specified.  No bubbles and I always get bubbles.
4,This is a good pack to get to protect your iPad screen. Worth the money and easy to use. The only thing missing from the pack is a thin edged tool to smooth out air bubbles.
4,Me parece que es un excelente producto. Le baj√© una estrella porque me vino rota una de las 2 micas de protecci√≥n para las c√°maras traseras.
5,I am very satisfied with the screen protectors . They fit perfectly and adhered well . It saves a lot  of money and I am not able to tell the difference from a more expensive brand.
4,Great product for the money
3,Couldn't use. Threw away
5,i saved up three months worth of pay to buy an ipad pro so i knew that i was gonna take every precaution with it once i got it. i bought these screen camera protectors plus a heavy duty case. i was a little worried the screen protectors wouldn‚Äôt fit with the case attached but they fit perfectly. the screen clarity is great the touch sensitivity is the same and my apple pencil still works great. super easy install with the guide stickers / cleaning pads. will definitely repurchase if i ever need more.
5,It‚Äôs super easy to install especially after watching the video. No bubbles!
4,A good fit.
5,This screen protector works as advertised.  Installation was easy.  I had a few bubbles I couldn‚Äôt get rid of‚Ä¶until I watched the YouTube video.  I followed the video and it worked great!  I don‚Äôt notice any loss in picture brilliance with the 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 with the protector on.  There are almost no fingerprint on it either - I was surprised.  My screen was covered in fingerprints before I put this on and now - nothing (or at least so feint you have to look at it in a certain light to see any.  I haven‚Äôt taken any pictures with it to see if the camera protector has any affect but based on the screen protector I‚Äôm not concerned.  Well worth the $
5,Easy to install. Good Quality.  Fits my IPad Pro very well.  Will not damage the tip of my IPad pencil.
4,Overall the installation process was pretty simple but I did run into an issue with getting out the air bubbles. The method shown in the instructional video was easy to follow but the part where I put finger through the middle to place the screen protector ended up giving me two huge air bubbles. Luckily this is a two pack and I managed to do a little better with getting out the air bubbles
5,I had trouble installing the protector. The second try was better. Very durable
5,Works great
5,Works as advertised. Good value.
4,Found it easy to use and wish I had a Placer too
5,Product and installation was great
5,I have had bought this for a couple months back. About 5 or 6 months and this screen protector is still intact. I had dropped the device a couple of times and protected the screen with ease. and it didnt even crack it self. The adhesive is perfect aswell hasnt started peeling at the sides either. overall amazing product will be buying from them again when the time comes.
2,This screen protector was impossible to put on and I ended up ruining 1. It must have been a catch! Maybe that‚Äôs why two were sent. Then the second one doesn‚Äôt fit my screen entirely. Overall I‚Äôm highly disappointed :-(
5,I have used Sparin Tempered Glass protectors for all of my electronic products.  A.  The delivery was excellent.  B.  Installation was easy.  C.  Screen protection is outstanding.
5,Product was easy to apply and works just as I expected
5,Easy to install clear instructions. Ended up with a couple of bubbles that will hopefully work themselves out over time. Good value for money.
5,Installation was a breeze and the product itself is absolutely amazing and so worth the price
5,Good material
5,Good protector for the money. Goes well with the case I purchased. No bubble on first try.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I‚Äôd buy this product again if I want more
3,The package arrived slightly bent but that was all it took for screen protector to crack.
5,This was easy to place on the iPad and seems to work great!
5,I have an iPad 12.9 and have tried several screen protectors and I must say this is the best. It is thicker and easy to put on. The air bubbles were very few and quickly were moved to sides. Well worth the price! The touch screen is still responsive and now it will be clean.
5,I bought this set primarily for the lens cover protector and already had a screen protector for the iPad. However when I put my original screen protector on it did not go on smoothly so I figured why not use one of these protectors and it went on flawlessly and was super easy to install! I am so glad that I bought these!!!
4,Easy to put on
5,N/A
5,This screen protector is surprisingly super good. Installing it was easy too. I followed the video and it made the instructions easier to go through then having to read it and still be confused. I‚Äôm glad it came with two screen protectors just in case this one breaks i can always have a spare. This was really worth my money.
5,I initially failed to install it correctly but it was super-easy to re-adjust it without any issue.The kit combination is all good and it does help installing the protector.Even after attaching the protector the touch is really good and the screen is very clear.So I am satisfied with this product.
5,They fit perfectly
5,Easy to install
2,Tempered glass screen protector is known to wobble apple pencil lines so why do you guys say it‚Äôs ‚Äúapple pencil compatible‚Äù? Thankfully I found out on line about this before I applied this.
5,It does what it is supposed to do! It fits fine with a cover case that I bought so happy days
5,It was say to install
5,I purchased these screen protectors to try it out. My husband found it easy to install. Definitely worth it value. First screen cracked and now I‚Äôm on the second one. I use a touch screen pens and it works as well as my touch of my fingers. Great product!
5,It is worth the price! Highly recommend it
5,I wanted to get protection for the camera because i dont like using a case with my ipad but i was afraid that my camera would be scratched upon using on my desk. This product protects both front and back and the best value ive found so far.
5,Fit great and not too hard to install.  Patience is key for sure.  Used the guides and had almost no issues.  Have 2 ipads in the house so getting a 2 pack for this price was a great deal!  Would reorder if needed.
5,I like that it came with 2 protectors. I gave one to my mom. I had to reapply it numerous times to get the bubbles out but that happens with all the screen protectors I use. So I take full responsibility. Overall it‚Äôs a good product for the price.
4,I am happy Wight eh ease and use of the glass Screen Pro. It had great directions and was easy to install. I like the photons protector feature as well.
5,Standard screen protector with accurate cut and seems to work just fine. Nice touch on including the camera lens protector. Only downside is the lack of a micro fiber cloth that often comes with other screen protectors but a very minor issue.
5,Installation packet helped! Loved that it came with guide stickers! I thought it was just extra dust collectors so I used tape instead to adhere to my iPad for easier installation. I hate how most screen protectors don‚Äôt have guide stickers anymore! Made my installation easy especially for a bigger screen!
1,Applied today there are two are bubbles  in the corners that just will not go away I‚Äôm going to take the other screen to the phone repair place near me to get them to put it on for me the first one just isn‚Äôt right
5,The screen protector and camera protector were a perfect fit.so far I have no issues. Great purchase for the money I spent. Thanks
5,Super easy to install. Picture instructions were easy to understand; YouTube video helped even more cause I was second guessing myself lol. Great quality. Liked that it came in a 2 pack of each. Definitely gonna order screen protectors for my iPhone from this company.
3,I wish I could give more stars I love the screen and camera protectors but unfortunately it does not work with my Apple Pencil.. so I am returning it. If you doesn‚Äôt plan on using your iPad with an Apple Pencil then this is a great option for you!
5,Easy to install and fits perfectly. With a clean screen it seals effortlessly on its own with no air pockets. I have an iPad Pro 2021.
4,Good quality with best price.
5,Not too hard to install - just follow the steps from the installation guide. It's important to be patient. I used the guide stickers and had almost no issues.
5,F√°cil de instalar
5,This is one of the few ipad PRO 12.9" screen protectors out there.  Installed in under 5 minutes easy to follow instructions and great protection.  They even give you a mini-cover for the cameras on the back :)
4,Great product will purchase again
3,I have a small bubble under the screen protector that won't go away. I can press it out but the screen doesn't stick well in that spot. Therefore the bubble always returns.
5,It easy to install and I love it.
2,There are small imperfections on the screen protector and when placed on the iPad screen leaves small bubbles. Tried to remove bubbles following their directions but still some remaining. Pulled first screen protector off to see what was causing issue and could see the slight imperfections. Good that this was a two pack as using second one.
5,Really great screen protector. It was fairly simple to install so I applied it in little to no time. I‚Äôm just so anxious knowing I had no screen on my pro pad so this really put me at ease.
5,My screen was starting to crack and this prevented that damage expanding.
5,This worked out great for my iPad and was easy to apply.
5,Easy to install works like a champ. You never know with screen protectors but the SPARIN hit all the check marks for me. Recommended.
5,The alignment tabs supplied made this the easiest and flawless screen protector application I have ever used! Thank you!
5,brought 2 screen protector and 2 for the back of the camera and is very ease to put on and is a very good quality.
5,This was used for my new iPad as a screen protector to safeguard any drop downs and screen breaks. It looks great and very easy to install with the tool kit provided.
5,Excellent product and easy application. I really like the additional protection of the camera.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Second purchase. Cheap but high quality
5,Fits perfectly and guide made it easy to install! Second pair of hands helps though to perfect! Camera protector also fit perfectly!
5,Love these! They are easy to install and are very clear when done and if you are like me who doesn't know what you are doing their even better!
5,Extremely easy to install best part is you get 2 to try. Save one for future if corner breaks. But I think its worth a shot for such prize.
5,love it! I didn't know there was two screen protector! it work out good because I have two iPads!! thanks so much also it was a fast delivery!
5,I bought this product to my Ipad pro and it fits perfectly and works great. I recommend this product .
3,It‚Äôs worth the small monies I paid for it compared purchasing at Apple/cell company.The finger prints show everything - and it does nothing to block any glare.
2,$12 bucks for 2 sets is not bad but like the saying goes ‚Äòyou get what you pay for‚Äô I needed a screen protector and AmFilm wasn‚Äôt available in 12.9‚Äù when Amfilm does become available the Sparin gets replaced
5,Very easy to apply and is very good especially for the price. The bubbles went away by them self just need to place the screen protector down.
5,Great iPad Pro glass screen protection and easy installation
5,Very easy installation!
5,Very easy to install on my IPad Pro 12.9 inch.  Looks great!
5,Item as Desribed
5,Great value for the money! The camera protector fits on well and the screen cover is anti glare.
5,very good quality and have good packaging have all the cleaning stuff you need
5,Great product. Easy to install and it contains all of the necessary tools. The video on YouTube is excellent for instructions.
5,It is easy to apply and it fits perfectly.
5,-Great product-Fast shipping and Delivery-easy to install-great price-will buy again if necessary-i recommend it 100%
5,Good quality glass doesn't effect the screen colors. Includes back camera protectors too.
5,A real nice screen cover.
5,VERY EASY INSTALL! CRYSTAL CLEAR SCREEN. EASY TO CLEAN AND WORKS WELL WITH MY PEN. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY.
5,I love it
5,Does what I need it to do. Fair price. Satisfied customer.
5,You get exactly what you see! Great and easy installation
5,This is a great product. Easy to install. Touch screen works great. Apple pen works great.
5,We watched the U tube video and followed along - easy install
5,I am happy with this screen protector it is really good and easy to install.
5,I love It!!!! Protect mi iPad very goood üíØüíØüíØ
5,Item was very user friendly. Touch screen is great with this item. Would recommend.
5,Just as described everything you need to make installation easy. Would order again.
2,1. They enclosed the wrong instructions. (I purchased this for an iPad and Nintendo switch instructions are enclosed.)2. The method for installation is absurd and very very easy to mess up.3. The screen protector itself is equal in quality to others.4. No squeegee enclosed.5. Do yourself a favor and buy a screen protector from a different company.
5,Easy installment. Bubble free if applied right. Fast shipping. Great quality.
5,Excellent product for the price! Fit my iPad perfectly. Will purchase again!
5,It‚Äôs perfect .. Including the protective cover for my camera lenses

5,easy to install and perfect quality
5,Like the fit and easy application
5,I loved itttüòçüòç
5,Excellent cover for my new IPad.
5,Easy to use
5,Easy to use  perfect fit.
5,Love it
5,Take time to align correctly.
1,It's disappointing that two pieces are split when you open them.
5,Nice
3,I used this product for my ipad pro. Works great.
1,Good thing they sent two because the first set broke trying to install. Second set lots of air bubbles. Entirely not worth your time
1,No queda a la primera como dice en el instructivo tuve que hacer m√°s de 5 intentos ya que siempre le quedaban burbujas
1,i hate it. easily collected dust. wasn‚Äôt adhesive anymore. thanks
1,The microfiber cloth came dirty so when you try to clean the screen before applying the protector the screen only gets dirtier. It also came with stickers that didn‚Äôt make any sense and the instructions were for an iPhone not an iPad. It‚Äôs really just a piece of junk.
5,
1,Cleaned and cleaned followed ypu tube directions and still had to use both sheets and still have bubbles. Don‚Äôt let them fool you. I would ask for money back ifI hadn‚Äôt used both sheets.
1,Item arrived severely damaged. Back was ripped off and both screen protectors were badly broken
1,Now I know why they send 2 screens... this one came cracked.  The other one worked fine and went on very easily.
5,Super easy to install very durable.
1,Screen Protector was crushed when received Returned
1,item came broken
1,Very flimsy! Cracked the first day üò≥üò≥?
5,This product is perfect for the price. Easy installation and thorough instructions. It doesn't get much better than this.
5,I liked the screen protectors it was affordable and was easy to apply but the back camera was a bit hard to apply overalls everything was fine.
5,I have had many electronic devices over the years and used many screen protectors for them.  This was by far the biggest one though so I was concerned that meant it would also be the most difficult to put on my new iPad 12.9‚Äô‚Äô screen.  However to my pleasant surprise it was both the quickest and easiest application I have ever had in my experience.  It went on perfectly with no fuss at all.  Combine that with a very good price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else looking for a new screen protector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Lo que me gusto fue que es bastante f√°cil de poner y si se tiene que remover para quitar cualquier part√≠cula de polvo que se haya quedado de puede remover sin dificultad y reinstalar f√°cilmente.Parece que no tiene una protecci√≥n adherida. üëçüèª
5,This set is a great value! It includes a front screen protector and a protector for your camera. I installed both and have not had any issues!
5,This is honestly the easiest to follow whereas I had one before this and i absolutely hated it
4,It will have some finger prints on the screen . Just ok
5,Use it for personal & for our church ministry
5,A must have! Now I need one for my phone lol.
5,Love it
5,Para colocarle proteccion a mi IPAD
5,Great great great amazing value!
5,Hard protective covers.Seems like a good product.
5,The product is easy to install and quick cleanup.
5,Great product
5,Its honestly super easy to install. I dropped my ipad and the screen was literally intact. 10/10 recommend.
5,If you follow the instructions you can‚Äôt go wrong. I installed it in about 5 minutes and it looks amazing. It looks so good  you don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs  there. No bubbles !!!
5,again...IMHO this product is just as good as the higher priced screen protectors!!! it was simple to install and the installation video on product site helps visually. the camera protector has black circles that actually help with glare and shots in fog. very happy with product!
5,If you follow the instructions it installs perfectly. I only have one bubble (my mistake though) but it‚Äôs barely noticeable with the screen on. Apple Pencil works just as well with this screen protector.
5,Normally installing these screen protectors is unnerving because placement is unforgiving.  With its hinges this one was a snap.
5,Easy to install and no bubbles
5,Very nice protector installation was very easy and managed to install it without any bubbles didn't affect the performance of the touchscreen (with and without the apple pen). All in all very satisfied!
5,Honestly said it was difficult to distinguish the difference between protectors. What I was looking for was cheap price normal quality and reasonable packaging. On the whole satisfied.
5,Just perfect very easy to Install didn‚Äôt left no bubbles on screen worth $$$ I give it a 5 star üåü rating
5,It works. It fits. Good buy.
5,Easy to go on-but very hard to get on right-I mean if not put on clean of lint and dirt will show.
5,i stuffed up the first install lucky it came with 2
5,Works really well for such a huge piece of glass protector.  Everything you need are included in a nice package. As long as the screen is cleaned properly installation is super easy.
5,Thanks. So easy to apply with the directions.
5,The product came exactly the day and time as expected. Easy to put on and great packaging. However the tool to scratch it down to remove the bubbles does not come with it. Still great quality.
5,It was nicely packaged and sealed. Each screen protector had it's own pocket. Easy to install for sure.
5,I recently bought the iPad Pro 12.9 2021 version and I wanted a glass protector just in case it was to drop. This was mostly easy to install but didn't come with a card to get out the air bubbles which was needed. However it doesn't affect the clarity of my screen my touch screen still works perfectly and I have no complaints.
5,It was very easy to install and I really like it!
5,Just got this for my new iPad Pro 12.9 inch and installation was super easy to follow along with video and guide stickers. I like how they included 2 screen protectors for camera and front. Definitely recommend and will buy again when needed!
5,The product came fast and super easy to install! I really recommend it üòÅ
5,Price quality arrived just on time
5,Perfect fit for my ipad
5,I used this product for my I pad pro.
5,Great product! Definitely would buy again. It was a good price for the two screen protectors + the camera lens protectors. It was also very easy to install. Recommend this product!
5,At first they sent me a broken screen protector and I sent it back for a new one. It works great.
5,Very easy installation.
4,I was able to place the screen protector on correctly but other ones I‚Äôve used have a plastic guide that fits over the device. This one didn‚Äôt.
5,This was a easy item to put on. Well made and protects my iPad!
5,A great product for the money. Easy to install works nice with the pencil! Would recommend!
5,Great quality
5,Price was great came quickly and package well
5,Easy to use with no air bubbles if applied well.
5,üëçüèª
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Very pleased with the quality of the product for the value. Having installed several protective screen covers this product by far has the easiest and coolest method for application that guarantees successful alignment w/out bubbles.
5,Me encanto y mas por precio lo recomiendo al 100
5,Easy to apply have had it on my iPad for 3 months now. Works great.
5,Nice cover for iPad at a good price
5,es facil de instalar y vino con todo lo necesario.
5,Great fit easy to put on will be buying again
5,Easy to install and looks great!
5,Easy to install glass screen protector you dont even feel its there.
5,When I order screen protectors I always seek out Sparin. They‚Äôre really easy to install and are of good quality. They also come with 2 protectors for the same price many others sell for one. Don‚Äôt waste your money some fancy ‚Äúsuper cool sapphire‚Äù case from a name brand. It‚Äôs literally the same as this.
1,Leaves a little too much space around the edge of the screen. Your iPad is not 100% protected
5,Easy peasy~ sticks well and will test some more for the next few days. But for now it's what I exactly expected it but it doesn't have that round edge.
5,Great quality for the price comes with everything you need and a link to a youtube tutorial! And an extra best of everything if you need 2 screens or you have an extra one for later! Great product!
5,The screen protector is actually pretty good great actually.it was cheap and came with two. So over all I think this is a great buy
5,One of the better screen protectors I've purchased as it came with the helpful placement stickers a microfiber cloth screen wipes and the sticker to remove dust.  The installation was easy and left only a small bubble which I was able to push out of the screen easy.  Works well with the current case I'm using as well and hasn't had any issues.  The Apple Pencil works well unless you dislike a smooth surface but I don't find it to be a problem as this was much more affordable protection than the paperlike one which is very pricey.  Great product(s)!
4,Anbringung war super easy der Stift funktioniert auch - problematisch ist blo√ü dass sich Fingerabdr√ºcke sehr abzeichnen
4,√à un buon prodotto non proprio semplice da montare. L‚Äôantiriflesso cos√¨ cos√¨
3,Lieferung erfolgte schnell Ware war original Verpackt und in Ordnung. So weit so gut.Die Folie ist auch (Blasen- und Dreckfrei) montiert und erf√ºllt ihren Zweck.Ja sie spiegelt und ich hatte mal eine Zeitlang Probleme mit dem Apple Pencil 2. Generation. Zuweilen konnte ich nichts anklicken in ein/zwei Bereichen bzw. erst nach mehreren Versuchen. Allerdings war/ist das f√ºr mich nicht reproduzierbar. Es kann also auch meinem Umgang mit dem Pencil gelegen haben.Eine matte Folie kam in Verbindung mit der Nutzung des Pencils nicht in Frage da die dort geschilderten negativen Erfahrungen diesbez√ºglich √ºberwiegen. Von daher akzeptiere ich das spiegeln zumal ich das iPad nur in der Wohnung o.√§. nutze.Bei mir war es diesmal so ziemlich das erste Mal da√ü ich eine Schutzfolie ohne Hilfsrahmen aufgebracht habe. Darum hatte ich auch dieses Produkt gew√§hlt bei dem man zwei St√ºck geliefert bekommt.... sicher ist sicher.Das Aufbringen der Folie:Das Vorbereiten/Reinigen war ok wenn ich auch subjektiv sagen muss da√ü ich f√ºr die Displaygr√∂√üe (12.9 Zoll) das Reinigungstuch und Microfasertuch etc als etwas zu klein empfand. Aber ok.... es hat funktioniert. Auch das Klebding zum Staub entfernen hat seinen Zweck gut erf√ºllt (dazu gleich mehr).Ich habe dann aber drei von den Klebestreifen verwendet um die Folie zu fixieren was mir sicherer erschien damit die Folie nicht verrutscht. Ich denke wenn man zu zweit ist ist das Ausrichten einfacher bzw. das eigentliche fixieren der Folie. Geht auch alleine aber ich habe drei Anl√§ufe gebraucht. Allerdings bin ich auch etwas pedantischer was das gleichm√§√üige ausrichten betrifft.Etwas verwirrend aber: Die Schutzfolie der Schutzfolie ;-) sollte man auch mit Bedacht l√∂sen da diese sich nicht so ganz leicht l√∂st. Ich habe es geschafft das die (Display)Schutzfolie etwas verrutscht ist und sich ein Klebstreifen gel√∂st hat. Entsprechend fummelig war es das ganze wieder auszurichten und zu fixieren ohne die Kontaktfl√§che zu ber√ºhren. Letztendlich hat es aber funktioniert.Die (Display)Schutzfolie habe ich dann vorsichtig umgeklappt aber noch nicht aufgelegt und auf der Seite mit den Klebstreifen nochmal ausgerichtet. Derweil auf der gegen√ºberliegenden Seite mit den Fingern gest√ºtzt damit sich die Folie noch nicht anschmiegt. Anschliessend behutsam abgesenkt und versucht das ganze einigerma√üen gerade aufzulegen.Gleichm√§√üig ist es bei mir nicht geworden aber mit einer H√ºlle f√§llt das nicht auf (wenn man es nicht wei√ü).Gr√∂√ütenteils hat sich die Folie angeschmiegt die paar Luftblasen am Rand konnte ich mit dem Microfasertuch entfernen.Nat√ºrlich hatte ich es aber geschafft da√ü ein Fussel am Rand sowie einer genau mittig drunter war. Also musste ich die Folie wieder anheben (die Klebstreifen waren noch drauf). Der Fussel am Rand war auf dem Display und konnte mit dem Microfasertuch entfernt werden. Logischerweise war der Fussel in der Mitte auf der Folie. Da kam nochmal dieser Fussel-entfernungs-Klebstreifen ins Spiel (welchen ich nat√ºrlich noch nicht entsorgt hatte). Dann das ganze Spiel mit dem Auflegen nochmal.Schlussendlich war die Folie (f√ºr mich einigerma√üen gerade) drauf ohne Fussel und Luftblasen. Daf√ºr war ich durchgeschwitzt.. kein Witz. Im (trockenen) Hochsommer mach ich sowas bestimmt nicht.Die Schutzfolie f√ºr das Kameramodul war dagegen ein Klacks. Saubermachen gerade ausrichten drauf und gut war. Keine Ahnung ob das dann Gl√ºck oder k√∂nnen war ;-)Die Folie vom Kameramodul habe ich bis jetzt zwei bis drei mal gel√∂st gehabt da ich mit einer H√ºlle Probleme hatte und testen wollte ob es daran liegt. Die Folie hebt nach wie vor.Fazit:Die Folie ist seit ca. zwei Wochen drauf und bei t√§glicher mehrst√ºndiger Benutzung hat sich noch nichts gel√∂st. Aktuell treten die Probleme mit dem Apple Pencil auch nicht auf.Ich wei√ü jetzt gar nicht mehr was das Zeug gekostet hat aber es war eins von den g√ºnstigeren mit zwei Folien und gr√∂√ütenteils positiven Bewertungen von daher von mir eine Empfehlung.Wenn es das Set jetzt noch mit einem (funktionierenden) Hilfsrahmen geben w√ºrde von mir aus auch f√ºr ein zwei Euro mehr w√§re es perfekt (Stand bis jetzt nach zwei Wochen).
5,Achat d'un paquet 2 protections √©cran (+2 pour la cam√©ra) en taille 129 inch. Instalation facile aucune bule. √Ä tenir compte: la poussiere redescend vite il ne faut pas trop "agiter l'air" pendant la mise en place. Les guides de pose sont tr√®s practiques. Bonne couverture de l'√©cran. L'Apple Pen fonctionne tr√®s bien. Les traces de doights sont visibles mais pas trop m√©chament (je n'ai pas encore vue une protection d'√©cran qui ne marque pas du tout). √Ä voir sur la r√©sistence dans le temps. Pour l'instant rien √† reprocher. Je recommande.
3,La pellicola di vetro sembrava molto buona per√≤ solo dopo una settimana era gi√† scheggiata nonostante non ha preso urti e l'iPad √® rimasto sempre attaccato alla tastiera.
4,Il me fallait une protection d'√©cran j'ai pris celui-ci il s'est mis tr√®s facilement presque sans bulle.J'ai suivi les conseils sur Youtube ! Nickel
4,Je recommande ce produit pour tous ceux qui cherche une protection pour l‚Äô√©cran de l‚ÄôiPad mais aussi pour ceux qui utilise le pencil il glisse plus facilement et sans couinements ni risques pour l‚Äô√©cran de plus le fait d‚Äôavoir les protections en double est un plus . Bon rapport qualit√© prix.
4,Pacchetto. Completo x proteggere iPadnon ha aderito perfettamente x la custodia miafa un po‚Äô di difficolt√† a pigiare i tasti rispetto senzama d‚Äôaltronde se lo si vuole proteggere.Buono.
4,Beim zweiten hat‚Äôs dann funktioniert.
5,Pas √©vident de l‚Äôinstaller sur une grande surface car difficile de chasser les bulles d‚Äôair.
4,Top üëç
4,Ich finde die Folie f√ºr den Preis vollkommen ok.Das Anbringen mit einem Rahmen find ich einfacher und besser da dieser hier fehlt nur 4 Sterne.Das Touch reagiert nicht mehr so sensibel wie vorher aber nicht st√∂rend.
5,Des d√©fauts ont √©t√© constat√© sur les surfaces que j'ai aussit√¥t fait part au service apr√®s vente de SPARIN.Et je dois dire qu'ils sont formidables d'efficacit√© car ils ont aussit√¥t r√©agit et remplacer mes √©crans.Si seulement les soci√©t√©s fran√ßaises √©taient aussi honn√™tes et √† l'√©coute de leur client.Je mets 10/10 √† SPARIN pour leur service et la qualit√© de leur produit.
4,Ce produit est bien il y a tout dans le kit pour pr√©parer l'installation de l'√©cran de protection. Les instructions me semblent claires en 5 minutes j'ai mis la protection sur mon iPad. Je trouve le r√©sultat bien sans bulles et agr√©able au toucher
5,Devo dire che √® davvero spettacolare. Per posizionare il prodotto alla perfezione sono inclusi nella confezione degli adesivi che aiutano alla grande. Se avete pulito bene lo schermo il vetro temprato si incolla da solo. Da guardare il video di installazione su YouTube il riferimento √® nelle istruzioni. Davvero un prodotto eccellente
5,Protection tr√®s bien ¬´¬†cousue¬†¬ª bien bord √† bord mais qui ne g√™ne pas la coque de protection de la tablette. C‚Äôest pareil pour le verre tremp√© de l‚Äôappareil photo !Je n‚Äôai pas suivi les indications donn√©es pour la mise en place du verre tremp√© sur la tablette car √ßa me semblait plus compliqu√© que ma technique !
4,Top
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Facilissimo da installare ho fatto per circa 3 minuti. Anche se fa il bolle deve soltanto trascinare al bordo come proprio dal video per installare.
5,Perfect. I used it in my ipad pro 2021 the fitting and the view are perfect. You can't even notice it
5,Ottime
2,Das Panzerglas f√ºr das Display hat Blasen in der Mitte und am Rand und der Touchscreen hat sich verschlechtert das einzigst gute an dem Produkt ist die schutzfolie f√ºr die Kamera.
5,Glas passt wunderbar - direkt auf nagelneues iPad Pro aufgebracht - daher keine Staubeinschl√ºsse. Wird in H√ºlle mit Deckel betrieben also kann keine Aussage √ºber Kratzfestigkeit etc. gegeben werden.
5,Simple √† installer. Rapport qualit√© prix excellent. Le prot√®ge Simple √† installer. Rapport qualit√© prix excellent. Le prot√®ge √©cran fonctionne avec Procreate et Apple pencil. √©cran fonctionne avec Procreate et Apple pencil.
5,Hervorragendes Preis- Leistungsverh√§ltnis mit sehr gutem Service absolut tadellos.
5,Echt super h√§lt was es verspricht und ist richtig stabil.
5,Beide screen protector und die zwei kameraschutzfolien sind sehr gut verpackt und intakt angekommen. Schon am Tag nach der Bestellung geliefert. Anwendung am Ipad sehr einfach und unkompliziert ohne Blasen oder sonstiges. Die Qualit√§t der Kamera Bilder ist trotz panzerschutz super und der Apple pencil reagiert wie ohne Folie.Ein super Produkt f√ºr den niedrigen Preis kann ich nur weiter empfehlen.
5,Impeccabile
5,Istruzioni chiare e dettagliate facilissimo l‚Äôutilizzo nonostante sa negata per queste cose. Aderenza perfetta e assolutamente antiriflesso. Veramente soddisfatta del prodotto e c‚Äô√® addirittura un secondo foglio di riserva.
3,Ansich toll nur leider nicht mit dem Apple Pen kompatibel Pen wird nicht erkannt!
5,Ottimo prodotto! Niente bolle e vi assicuro che √® la prima volta che riesco in questa impresa grazie a questo vetro protettivo
1,Entrambi i vetri rotti non aggiungo altro
5,Super
5,Bin mit dem Produkt sehr zufrieden.
5,La protection s'installe tr√®s facilement pratiquement aucune bulle. Je n'ai pas test√© la solidit√© de la protection (..et je vais √©viter) mais celle-ci semble assez bonne.
5,Wenn man sich nicht bl√∂d anstellt h√§lt das Produkt sein Versprechen
5,Buon prodotto di facile applicazione se si seguono le istruzioni online
1,Lorsque l'on regarde la vid√©o d'installation cela semble tr√®s simple.  Toutefois la d√©monstration est faite avec un IPAD plus petit que la version PRO 129" dont je suis le propri√©taire.  J'ai utilis√© les deux feuillets de protection vendus.  J'ai scrupuleusement respect√© les modalit√©s d'installation (surtout la deuxi√®me fois).  Rien n'y fait je n'ai pu installer la protection sans avoir des bulles qui m√™me avec le chiffon fourni ne peuvent √™tre enlev√©es.  R√©sultat je n'ai pas de protection et tout part √† la poubelle.  Mon impression g√©n√©rale: c'est une arnaque.  Ce produit n'est pas adapt√© aux grands √©crans.
5,Sehr gut!
5,Bon produit. Pos√© sans difficult√©.
5,Anche proteggi camera originaleicea
5,Einfach gut
5,Venu tr√®s rapidement . Identique √† la description
5,Top!
2,Il prodotto non √® male purtroppo l‚Äôimballaggio con il quale arriva √® molto fragile tanto che uno dei due salva schermo √® pieno di crepe √® completamente inutilizzabile. Non ne consiglio l‚Äôacquisto
