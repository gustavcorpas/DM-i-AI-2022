5,I was so happy when I got this charger. I love that it's small enough for the nightstand and that the watch is held in place while charging. The watch goes into night-mode automatically when placed on the charger; you can see the time if the watch is touched or jostled.
5,I've been wanting a stand for the apple watch because as much as I like to charge my watch I'll need to bring that cord everywhere I go and I don't like that. Also what I really like about this is that it doesn't require to use your OWN cord and IT STAYS FLAT. Absolutely in LOVE with this item!
4,Returned this. I would have kept it if it didn't make my watch hot while charging.  Since the ad states it's for 7 & below I'll assume this is why it’s happening.  One star off only for the heat issue.  Otherwise great for traveling & nightstand.
5,I’m loving being able to use this for my watch. Convenient and easy. Although I would like to have gotten a electric plug in for it
5,I like this little charger.  The watch doesn't slip off the charger like the one the watch came with.  Its easy to see on the nightstand.
5,The magnet is stronger & charge is faster! The ease of use enables a less sensitive connection.
5,It does everything it says its going to do. I love how easy it is to put the watch on it. Also love that the watch faces me so its easy to read.
5,Works great easy to set up snd easy to put watch on with any band
5,I bought as gifts and I asked if it worked fine. They said yes  they use it every night.
5,I love that I can set this on the nightstand and just touch the stand in the middle of the night to see what time it is.
5,So far it’s perfect.  Great size.  Watch sits well on it despite different bands.  Very happy with purchase so far.
5,This Apple Watch charger is a perfect stand-alone charger. It’s easy to carry with me when I travel and doesn’t take up a lot of room on my nightstand.  I can check the time in the dark just by tapping my nightstand.  I love it.
4,Attractive.It is  V E R Y  S  L  O  W  To charge.

5,Ordered this to fill in for my wife's vintage Mac charging cradle that she left behind. Turns out she likes this one better. Built-in charger is a big dollar saver. Very stable base. Easy to put watch on and to take it off. Reliability is the only open question.
5,This is the easiest charger to use and travel with. I will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts.
5,Didn’t purchase for travel
5,Works exactly as intended my one wish was that it was foldable as that would make more convenient but for the price it is really nice.
5,I wanted a small charging stand that would fit on my night stand this looks good and works perfectly.
5,Works like a champ.
5,This is just what I was looking for great price  compact for night stand or desk.
4,Does not work! It takes all night to charge my watch.UPDATE:The seller reached out and after my initial review once  confirmed the charger I got was defected they sent a replacement. The new one came in and it changes faster. I’m very  happy they were able to get me a new one.
5,Loved the price size and easiness to use. This is exactly as described. Recommended.

5,Great watch charger with a strong magnet for holding watch in place.
5,This is small compact for travelers and does a quick charge quicker tan the charger I had
5,Easy to use. Stays on the stand.  Charges with no problems
5,Charges very quickly and will fit easily in any bag/purse.
5,Love it easy to use and convenient
5,I got this because the dock that I previously used with my watch was unreliable. It was super finicky about the exact placement of the watch. If it wasn’t in the “sweet” spot my watch wouldn’t charge. And finding that exact right spot was no trivial feat.I like this dock. It’s small and lightweight so it’s very easy to travel with. It’s visible so I can see my watch at night when I wake up and know that it is not yet time to be conscious. Or that it is time to get myself caffeinated and going. It’s a great little watch dock it has a very small footprint on my limited space nightstand.
4,While it charges without issue which is really the main purpose - it misses the mark when it comes to design.  The bottom needs to be weighted to sit firm on a desk.
5,I’ve only had it for a little over a week.  So far it’s working great.
3,It’s a great design for the bed stand but it charges slower than an Apple brand charger so you have to wait or charge overnight.
5,It was a reasonable price. It seems to work well. I don't think it would be good for traveling as it has a high profile.
5,Love the charger for my Apple Watch. Works great
5,You can definitely feel your music with these headphones not just listen but FEEL ♥️
5,Easy to use at home or away!
3,Forgive me if it was in the listing and I didn’t notice but I purchased two of these. One for my spouse and one for myself. Theirs works great. Mine refused to charge my watch out of the box. When we tried my watch on the identical product my spouse has it wouldn’t charge in it either. Spouse has no trouble with either one. It’s kind of cheaply made but a cute design. I can’t use it.  It would be helpful to have that more clearly indicated in the listing.Like I said if I missed it that’s on me; but I wanted to warn others who have 38mm Apple Watch this won’t work for our size watches.  Bigger oNES it’s fine actually seems to work well.  I was so disappointed.
5,Perfect replacement for my broken Apple charger.
5,Was looking for something to put in my travel case. This works perfect. Easy to store and use.
5,I purchased it and like it so much I bought 2 more. I stays in my suitcase and the other 2 are for nightstands. Easy to set up and easy to use!
5,I have a series 7 45mm watch and the smaller stands don’t charge my watch or make a good connection.  This one did the trick.
5,Love it. Charges great  compact. It’s perfect for my use.
5,I like this very much
5,This watch charger is so easy to use - just drop it on!  No fiddling to insert an actual charger because it’s already built in. No fiddling to get the watch to match up to charge. Perfect
5,Amazing product!! Works just as I expected. Doesn’t get hot when charging and works perfectly the same as an OEM model. Definitely shocked!
5,Easy
5,Love this charger. Small but powerful.  I like it better then the other ones I’ve gotten.
5,Very small and compact.
5,The item arrived in a cute box and looks dainty in black color. My Iphone fits perfectly will definitely recommend.
5,I like this product. I keep it by the bed and put my watch in it at night. Super easy.
5,I bought this charger for my husband and he’s very happy with it.It’s nice & small and charges his watch quickly.
5,I love it. It’s so convenient & easy to use.
5,Love it!
5,It’s small enough to take anywhere and it does exactly what it says it does. Great charger
5,Works very well. Have used it for a couple of weeks without any problems. I would definitely buy it again.
5,Charges Apple Watch - quickly and easily.
5,Good product for the price
5,Easy to use watch fits right into place for charging. Sleek design fits easily onto a small nightstand. Highly recommend.
5,Very pleased with purchase. Charged great.
5,Perfect for my nightstand
5,Great for traveling
1,I bought this charger so that I can place it on a mini floating shelf near my door and I can grab my watch and go. The FIRST 2 times I used this charger I grabbed my watch and realized the battery was barely charged after sitting on this charger all night. My solution was to find another wire to plug the charger into it worked. Five times my watch was charged to full battery and I was happy. Then comes the disappointment the blue light turns on for 1 second and I’m waiting for my watch to charge and nothing happens. I have tried everything: plugging the charger with multiple wires plugging the wires into multiple outlets placing my watch in different positions and giving the charger time to work after I see the blue light turn on for one second. Nothing has worked and my watch is still dead.
2,Charger doesn’t charge. Watch has been sitting on it for over 12 hours and shows as if it charging(lights up) but once taken off the dock it is dead.
1,Do NOT buy this charger! I have now tried it out plugged into the wall to three different computers and to a lamp with a USB port. In all cases even after ten minutes or so my Apple Watch (less than a year old) gets extremely hot overheats and then shuts down and reboots. The charger and the watch are both scorching hot after only a few minutes charge. Very dangerous and now my watch is acting all strange. I will be putting this in the garbage and buying one from Apple. i figured with all the high reviews this was safe but it absolutely is not. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
1,I really like the design of this little charging stand BUT...my watch gets much too hot when I use it for more than a few minutes. By comparison when using the cable that came with the watch there is NO change in temperature even after an hour or two. My less than satisfying compromise has been to place the disk portion of the cable on the stand (being magnetic the disk stays in place) and then situate the watch over both pieces. So yes I'm using it but not as designed.
1,I have not had this product even a month and it stopped working. It lights up green like it’s charging but it actually did not charge anything in five hours. My battery was less than when I put it on the charger.
1,This technically functions but the charging is so slow that it can’t be consider helpful. I put my watch on the charger at 9pm when the watch was at around 40%. At 8 am is was still “charging” but only at 75%. Don’t waste your money on this just spend the extra few bucks to get an authentic Apple charger
1,I purchased this with high hopes based on the reviews. My charger did not work at all! Not one time was I able to charge my watch with this device .
1,I couldn't find the charger that came with my apple watch and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a new one from apple. I bought this and charged my watch for over 24 hours and it was still dead. Luckily I found my original charger and it charged my watch in 1-2 hours probaly less. A lesson learned when looking for cheap you'll get it.
1,Liked the shape and size but this thing didn’t keep the watch in place and drained it.
1,I have a watch 6 and this doesn’t work. Already tossed the box it came in so I can’t get a refund lame.
1,Does not work. Light will light up for a minute then go off. Will not charge.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Product didn’t work out of the box. I tried a few different blocks cables and even my laptop. Blue light came on briefly when first connected then went off and didn’t charge my watch. Returning and replacing to see if it was just mine.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I got this charger and after a couple times charging my watch it completely stopped working and now I have a dead watch :(
1,Do not buy unless you have money to purchase new watch. It does charge it but it also ruins it
1,Stopped working after 3 days.  Tried multiple watches to be sure if wasn't the watch.  Complete garbage.
1,Did not charge the apple watch. It got very hot and still not charge.
1,It worked the first time I used it and it never worked again. Don’t waste your money
1,Plugged it in and the light came on but never charged my or my wife's apple watch. So I returned this paper weight.
1,Didn't work. Plugged it in and it simply didn't work.
1,Didn’t work
1,Doesn’t charge
1,Will not charge my watch and my watch gets hot
1,My husband just didn’t like it at all
1,I received a defective item
4,Testing this charger and the similar Newdery charger.  They both work well so I'll keep both since they are value priced.  This has a front led to indicate charging has started and the Newdery does not.Nice design with non-slip base.  Magnet holds my new Series 7 Apple Watch but not quite as securely as I'd like.  Watch starts charging immediately when the magnet takes hold.  Small blue led lights up on front to indicate watch is charging.  Like this feature.  Takes a few hours to fully charge.  I leave my watch on it overnight and it's fully charged in the morning.The included USB-C cable is short for my needs so I'm using a longer one.  Need to supply your own charger.  I'm using a 20W PD USB-C charger I purchased on Amazon which works just fine.I could use Apple's included magnetic charging disc but I wanted something to hold my watch up for bedside table use.  This is perfect for that purpose.
5,I was looking for an Apple Watch charger for my desk. This one is simple but effective. The vertical charger is perfect for utilizing the watch as a clock when not being worn. I can easily recommend this to anyone who is looking for an Apple Watch charger.
5,This watch charger does exactly what it claims to do and it does it well. I have owned other brands of Apple Watch chargers and this one is by far my favorite after the OEM charger. The best things about it are that the magnet is actually strong enough to hold the watch up without worrying about placing it just right the charger itself looks clean and modern and the cable is sturdy. My only complaint which is very minor is that the charging indicator light is fairly bright.I tested this charger extensively and while it won’t replace my OEM charger for daily use it has certainly become my new travel charger. I do not have a way to measure exactly the speed of this charger but I found it to be extremely similar to the original charger. My watch was quick to charge and there was no concerning heat or warmth from the charger cord or watch itself.It is worth noting that this charger does not include a charging block and you will have to supply your own 5V adapter.Overall I would highly recommend this charger. It’s attractive works well and is quite affordable. I have been using it for days without issue. If the charger does eventually stop working or if I run into any issues with the cable I will update my review to reflect them.

5,I'd recommend this charger to anyone over the generic one Apple provides. This makes it easy to rest your watch on overnight so it doesn't easily slip off. The cord is long enough and it charges fast. I'm super happy I finally got a different charger!
3,Hooked this up to my USB analyzer and found that it is indeed a slower charger. This charger maxed out at 190 mA. An original charger maxes out at 410 mA.======== ORIGINAL REVIEW ========I keep this on my night stand. I usually charge up my watch while I'm in the shower and while putting my daughter to bed. I liked this charger because it had a little more to it than the stock Apple charger which was always getting knocked down on the side of my night stand. While this charger is heavier than the original Apple charger it could use a little more weight to better keep it in place. I may open it up and put some BBs and hot glue to help in this regard.In using this charger I do not believe that it is charging as fast as my Apple charger. Not a deal breaker for me as I am pretty good about remembering to charge it but for those that may be in a hurry for their watch to charge up you may want to look elsewhere.
5,This is a great charger for my apple watch. It stands up so I can use my watch like a bedside clock - just have to nudge my table a bit and the watch face lights up.  The charger stand itself is very sturdy and fits with my elastic wrap watch band and magnetic mesh band easily.  I LOVE that it comes with the power source and it is not a loose add in bit like with the actual apple charger.  It makes for a more secure mount and charging - no heating or losing contact and stopping. Again - it comes with it's own power cord which is a USB so it easily plugs into our travel block.
1,Product did not work from taking it out of the box returned it the next day
5,Great value for the money. Like that the watch stands up. Charges fast.
5,Very nice. Exactly what I wanted. Works great

5,Very sharp looking an clean on your night stand . Works so much faster then my apple charger .

1,Thought this would work great! It barely even charged my watch. Don’t waste your money.
5,Works wkll
5,Came when it was suppose too. Use it in the camper when we are traveling. Works great. Charges my wife’s Apple Watch without any problems.
4,The watch  is charging just as fast as a regular charger… it is not bulky so it is easy to take it everywhere!!!
5,This charger looks very nice and works quite well too! It uses usb-c which is very nice. I would recommend this product!
5,This charger is made with great quality materials and works well. one thing to note is that it does not come with a power block.
1,this item is complete garbage it does not charge .plugged in my apple watch 7 it was at 80% left it on charge for 24hrs and it is now at 90%threw it in the trash
