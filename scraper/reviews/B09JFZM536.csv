4,I would rate this projector as a good value for its price.It's not as bright as I'd hoped. And the focus ring is pretty wimpy. It should not be confused with a pro model.But for its price it's fine. It's higher quality than most others in the same price range especially with the current $20 discount.I bought this to use as a teaching projector. It's not great in a bright room but works fine if the classroom lights are dimmed.I have a professional projector in my home theater that I use for watching movies. It's brighter and has better color control than this one. But it cost almost $1000. You get what you pay for.
4,Do notice a lag with Bluetooth audio but that may be my speaker vs the projector.  I just connected with a male/male cable to the speaker and that works great.
4,A good projector with good connectivity options.The iphone connection with wifi does behave oddly though.. takes a lot of time but may b it needs a very good wifi. Mine is a basic wifi. But i use HDMI cable which works great.Overall good one.
4,We just received the unit. We did unbox the unit and tried it out inside the house.  It does get a little warm.  We were unsuccessful connecting our Android phone.  The setup password the unit stated to use in the mirroring setup doesn't work.  The app recommended as a second option wasn't found in Android app store.But so far the hdmi works well with our laptops. Haven't tried usb connect yet.The brightness is good on the unit and the picture is clear for 1080p.  The speaker is decent sounds a bit hollow But overall not bad. I would definitely suggest have an external speaker setup  if using it outside.  I was disappointed in the supplied 120 screen.  I was hoping it came with a stand. So you would definitely have to have a place to hang the projector screen.  No stand included. I would also recommend a small cooling fan as well to help keep the projector cool outdoors and some kind of shade.  As I mentioned above it does it warm after about 5 or 10 minutes.  About the same temperature  as a gaming laptop or warmer. Keeping it cool will help extend the life of the projector.  The internal fan does work but just okay.  The fan is a bit loud but not so much you can enjoy the viewing from the unit.  It will become background noise after awhile and you probably won't notice it after awhile.  Haven't tried it outside yet we had to order a projector stand kit.  So can't  comment on it's clarity.
4,Unit works good but the remote is very slow to respond sometimes.
4,Nice
4,Everything about this projector is awesome. The only two things that can be improved is the sound quality and the ability to screen mirror a device while STILL being able to connect to home wifi (you can only screen mirror if you have data on your device that is not wifi). Other than that AWESOME projector
4,It us I really like the set up. Easy to use.
4,The remote doesn‚Äôt work at all. Sound is a little low but overall amazing product for the price!!
5,I‚Äôve been through many projectors and this one is the one it connects through Bluetooth which I love and customer service is amazing and very very helpful!
5,We purchased this Projector for use at our club meeting and it did not disappoint the brightness was excellent and function was perfect. We did have a problem with the unit and contacted customer service who responded quickly and resolved the issue. It's one of the best customer service experiences I've had and confirms that this is a solid product and company.
5,Great product for the price picture quality is great! If you plan on watching Netflix/Amazon movies you need to connect your phone to the projector with a HDMI cable.  I bought the $50 apple adapter that connected my phone to the projector/HDMI cable.  You won't be able to watch them with out it so purchase it right away or you will be bummed like I was and think it didn't work.
5,Very nice projector for the price.  Very easy set up.
5,It was so easy to hook up to the surround sound and streaming device. My husband says every morning  ‚ÄúWhat are we going to watch at the drive-in tonight baby?‚Äù I love it‚Ä¶we were going to buy a 75‚Äù TV and I started looking at these and decided this is a much better plan. We will purchase a better quality screen for the living room real soon and use the free screen outside üòâ The quality of the picture is fantastic!!
5,This worked well right away.
5,Screen share and streaming by phone not great. Can‚Äôt get some apps to play movies. I am sure there are things but from what I can tell don‚Äôt like IOS or something. Or I can‚Äôt figure it out
4,Good
5,The first movie right out of the box was Top Gun: Maverick ordered off iTunes.  The projector did not disappoint!  The picture quality and brightness did the movie justice.  I highly recommend this projector for the price; you won't be sorry.
5,For how much it costs this is not a bad option at all. If you want something better the price goes up significantly.
3,The picture quality at 120‚Äù is watchable but only clear-ish in the center of the screen. I tried to thread it to an overhead hanger and the brass thread snapped in have. That said this was bought to be an outdoor projector so we didn‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money on it. It gets the job done but you‚Äôll want to buy something higher end if you‚Äôre going to use this as a primary screen.I was pleasantly surprised by the screen that was included. At the price point I assumed it‚Äôd be some sort of material I‚Äôd have to iron to get creases out of. But it‚Äôs actually cloth and decent quality.
4,Projector worked right out of box easy setup. However when used outside  I need a brighter unit. This one says 9000 Lumens and I can say it's not even close to that yes I know the difference between ansi lumens/lumens.  This is great for the money  it may do well for some just not me .
4,Setup was reasonably easy and I tested it on a wall inside and then the back of my house. The included remote doesn‚Äôt work but it‚Äôs really not necessary. All necessary functions are controlled from the buttons on top the projector and I‚Äôm using a Fire Stick for watching. Good stuff movie night in the pool!
5,Comes with everything you need and its super easy to setup.
3,Can‚Äôt play Disney plus or Hulu or Netflix on this for copy right reasons. It was highlighted half way through setting up everything. I am returning and saddened . Not sure what the difference is with me playing on my phone or iPad to a magnifying screen .
5,The quality and brightness is awesome it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watch my HD tv!! Won‚Äôt be disappointed
4,Set up is fast and easy
5,It work great no problems but hooking up to Bluetooth is hard for iOS besides that I love it .
4,Great picture and sound for indoors cookouts parties with friends etc etc!
5,I purchased this as a gift for my dad's 60th birthday. He said the picture quality is just as good as a TV. He loves it!
5,Very happy with purchase
5,So this is my first projector I wanted a larger screen without spending a ton of money for the price so far I have been impressed. Better picture than expected for a sub $200 projector. Cannot wait for football season! Already watched a couple movies awesome to now have my own ‚Äútheatre‚Äù at home. Now sound is at the volume I want and in an environment I feel safe. Works fantastic with Roku! If only there was a way to hook up to quality sound. The sound quality is the main drawback. Mfr just said maybe in future projectors‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt help me now.
5,Purchased for backyard use
5,Easy to set up and picture quality was great. Used a camera tripod to help set the projector up to level. The included hdmi cable was nice to connect to our Roku and the pairing with our Bluetooth speaker was seamless. We noticed that the volume was lower via Bluetooth than a wired connection but not sure if that‚Äôs due to the speakers or projector.Either way our kids loved watching the movie in our backyard!
5,I've only had this projector for a week but it seems to be everything that I've been looking for. The resolution is crazy also. The setup is really easy
5,Easy to use out of the box
3,Developed an annoying audio issue. Returned. Don't like the 1\8th AV Jack would rather have RCA jacks at this cost.
5,We put it in our man cave to watch football. Works great
5,Bright clear 1080p picture no frame rate issues with movies. Love that I can plug a Roku stick and run directly from machine. Easy pairing with my Bluetooth speaker as well.
5,The power cord is a little short and it would also benefit from adjustable feet on front for multiple surface adaptability. Otherwise a great little machine.
5,We liked that it was light easy to set up and had Bluetooth.  We definitely appreciate that it came with a screen it was also easy to set up (we actually attached it to my photography backdrop stand).  We ordered it on the same day and it arrived in time for our outdoor movie night.
5,Great picture quality. Very easy to use from our phone. The price is right!A great buy for the summer nights. üìΩ
5,We love this projector! It's super easy to use. We bluetooth our phones and speakers to the projector as well  using an HDMI cable to attach the dvd/blueray player giving us multiple viewing options. The clarity is exceptional. My family is enjoying backyard and campground movie nights.
5,The picture quality by far is the best compared to other projectors. Definitely a great buy for the price!
5,The product was very easy to set up.  I am still testing some of the features (audio bluetooth air play etc) but am happy with the purchase so far.
5,Still having issues with setup to phone as it didn't give the password like it said but hooked it up through hdmi to computer and quality of sound and picture is great!
5,For the price with the features it includes.The built in speakers have decent sound.Easy to setup and pair to Bluetooth speakers.
5,I originally brought a cheaper project but wasn‚Äôt satisfied with clarity of picture purchased this one and the picture quality is way better.. I say spend a lil extra to get better quality. User friendly set up was very easy. So far I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase. Definitely recommend
5,Great product! Love the bonus screen!Good picture and great sound from speaker. Grandkids  love our outdoor movie nights now!!!!!
5,excellent value-easy set up. must get single point mount
5,I love the whole thing
5,This projector is one of the nicest on the market. It comes very securely packaged with everything you need. I love the size of the screen and enjoy that you can hook up multiple different devices in order to suit your projection needs. The instructions are user friendly and the staff are wonderful. Would buy again.
5,Everything about this projector seems to be great. If i had to pick one thing to make it better it would the sound. Works great with an external speaker added but the internal one is not loud enough for outdoor use.Overall though totally worth the money.
5,Great video quality and ample sound with integrated speakers.
3,Kinda blurry
2,It said we were to get the 120 inch screen but did get it
1,After 2 1/2 hours I was able to connect my smart phone with the projector I was able to mirror my screen to the projector and I was able to hook up the Bluetooth to my Bluetooth speaker all that was great! But as soon as I selected a movie on Netflix and hit the play button the projector would go black and all I would hear is the sound I tried unplugging it disconnecting everything three times and it just doesn‚Äôt work. Super aggravating to think I purchased the more expensive projector hoping it would be easy. üò°NOT!!
5,My tv is hooked up to outdoor antenna and would be nice to get my tv up on the big screen. Works great with my firestick and watching football games.
5,Do not waste time and energy in searching and researching for a budget friendly projector with all in one features this is the best of all on Amazon. Go for it!
3,Picture quality is ok overall but the corner is blur.
5,The product came packaged with all the components. It was each to set up and serves our family needs.
