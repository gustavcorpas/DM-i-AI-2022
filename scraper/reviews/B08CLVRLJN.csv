5,The Galaxy 5 watches come with a USB C charger.  After purchasing a Galaxy 5 Pro for myself and a Galaxy 5 for my better half we don't have enough available USB C outlets yet.  This charger uses the older standard USB A plug and works fine to charge the Galaxy 5 watches.
5,I use to charge my galaxy watch 5 pro and they work well the charge and in a good time. like 2 hrs from 10% to a 100.Great price.
5,This Samsung Galaxy Watch charger is much better than another one I was using  which caused the Watch to constantly overheat and not charge the Watch. THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!
5,Had misplaced my charger and had put my watch away wasm't sure what model I had this carger workd on multiple Samsung watches.  Happy to say I'm using my watch again
5,Looks/feels/functions like the out of the box charger for my galaxy watch 4 classic
5,Works as expected. No issues as of yet!
5,This is the Samsung watch charger not a reproduction so it charges well and does not overheat some other charger copies tend to overheat while charging.  It costs a little more than the copies but it is the real deal.
5,I am a person who hates to buy branded items when I can buy generic and get the job done. I bought a Galaxy 4 watch from the Amazon warehouse and ended up getting the battery replaced under warranty because it just wasn't working right. They sent it with what I later learned was a generic charger.I was still having some issues with it taking a long time to charge so when I decided to get a charger for my luggage I went with this MOE one.Alas it charges quickly now. This charger is much faster in my experience than the generic ones. So it was money well spent.
5,I bought this additional charger for traveling. What a great addition.
5,Very compact for travelers. Does the job. One similar item didn't work and was returned.
5,Excelente producto
5,This is a genuine Samsung charging cable identical to the one that came with my watch (GW4 classic).
5,Have no issues with this product.  Works well for my watch charges it fully.
5,Misplaced my old one and needed a new one. Got an Oem charger and was back in business.
5,It works
5,The media could not be loaded.
3,I bought this for an old Samsung Watch that it said it would charge. It worked great the first few times but it's no longer charging the watch.
5,It works
4,It's OEM it's not cheap but it works. Price is only thing I took a star for.
5,fast charges with galaxy watch 4 we used it in the car and at home.  Doesn't come with a charger block
5,Works very well. I have no problem with it.
3,Bought this charge as this is the charger that the Samsung website had provided as it was easier to buy it this way I figured the convenience was right as I use Amazon all the time....well I had spoke to a Samsung representative who said this charger would work for both my Samsung galaxy watch and my Samsung gear sport watch and well I guess I was miss lead to believe it to be true and was very disappointed....it showed up today September 22 2021 the first day of its possible date of arrival between the 22nd and the 27th well after all said and done it was fast shipping so 5 stars there but usefulness on the other hand was very very poor it charged the watch up to 2% on both watches and then stopped charging them I am disappointed to say the least but I guess convenience isn't always the best route to take
5,Same as my original one
5,Indistinguishable from a brand new charger at half the price!
3,Aparantemente el cargador llegó con falso contacto.
1,Left it on the charger overnight and it was only at 42% the next morning.  I had to put ut on the original charger. I bought this as a backup for traveling but I recommend buying a charger directly from Samsung or your wireless carrier. This is the second one I've bought and both do the same thing.
1,See above
1,Does not charge my galaxy watch 4. Will be returning.
1,Left watch to charge overnight on this charger and woke to the watch overheated and the charger smoking.
1,This device is supposed to work the Samsung Galaxy SM-R732  If it does it takes days to charge.Unsatisfactory
1,It’s a usb cable called a “wireless charger” I’m totally confused about the name.
5,Looks to be genuine like the original.  No issues at all.
5,I tend to stay away from "knock-offs" in favor of the branded item. This is that and it works well.
1,Doesn't work with watch watch displays "use official charger" though it has a Samsung logo on the bottom
5,This is the original charger for my galaxy 4 watch. I would buy again. Great product!
5,Not for my phone
4,It did not work properly
5,Original replacement for Samsung watch 4.  Dog chewed up original
5,Seems tp be an exact replacement charger for Galaxy Watch 4 classic.
5,It's what you'd expect a genuine Samsung replacement (or in my case a second charging station for convenience sake) for Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (and others).
