5,Waited 10 months give my review..This thing holds up!I am a mechanic and have beat this thing up..Carburetor and brake cleaners were destroying my Fitbits and I thought I would try this out.I did buy a screen protector to keep the screen safe and definitely glad I did. The watch still looks nearly new still after all my abuse.  The tracking of my stats and the app are great. I just wish they would offer ecg in the USA.Notifications and the ability to answer and make phone calls on this definitely help when my phone is in my pocket.  The faces available are nice and I found an app that has even more than Amazfit offers.  I have the amazfit scale which syncs with this watch and have trying to get my wife to switch over to this brand.  Still can't believe the battery lasts a week or more for me and charges fast too..
5,Nice smart watch. Especially for the price. First of all Battery life is GREAT I get about a week of battery life before charging at about 20% that is monitoring heart rate oxygen level steps and sleep. Is comfortable and light enough that you forget your wearing it. I have the brightness set to auto and that works great for me. There are alot of permissions to go through when you first set it up and go through them slowly to make sure caller ID and stuff work properly. Lol. I made that mistake at first as I was excited to have the watch. Screen is surprisingly sturdy and has taken quite a beating with no scratches at all.only  only downside is that it doesn't have a Google pay type app. But I knew this before I bought it. I Love to snorkel and swim and it tracks swimming exercise very well and handles being in the water for hours at a time with no issues.
4,Wow what a smartwatch. I have been fantastically surprised and satisfied with this purchase after coming from a Fitbit Charge 4 on a lark. I will simply list the pros and cons after using this smartwatch for about 3 weeks:PROS-love the large clear responsive display nearly edge to edge-dual button control is awesome and fast.- lightweight can barely feel the watch. The strap is comfortable and easily removed.- The app is fast and syncs effortlessly with the watch- menu systems are fast and easy to navigate with tons of options on the watch itself and in the app.- excellent third party watch face support via 3rd party apps.- blends in seamlessly as an "unknown" brand - not an iwatch not Samsung etc. I happen to like that.- fast and accurate GPS lock when outdoors and exercising.- the display brightness is superb & auto adjusting brightness is excellent fast and reliable.- Great battery life considering all the data it is collecting with fine grain options on what sensors you want enabled.- The charger is magnetic and works great (unlike the Fitbit charger.)- Multitude of granular options within the app. A bit cluttered but once figured out is very nice. Things such as the menu organization on the watch and additional settings.CONS-health tracking only in real time in bits and pieces ex: real time heart rate "app" passive HR tracking normally same with blood o2 sat. Seems weird to need an "app" for real time HR.- I happen to find the scrolling crown kind of pointless. It's fine to copy Apple but the touch screen works fine.- Not a ton of aftermarket bracelets / bands- sleep tracking sometimes struggles for day sleeping (night shift). Takes a few weeks to really get good data.- doesn't seem to be a "golf" activity mode.- wish the display was truly edge to edge. as a result black watch faces look the best.- naming conventions for "shortcuts" and "apps" and "quick access" are confusing and essentially all do the same thing.- the app seriously needs a facelift. Whereas most companies just copy Fitbits UI and colors because it makes sense - Amazfit mashed both their own and others UI into their app and it looks atrocious - particularly sleep tracking.Overall I am very satisfied with this watch and its price point. This is an excellent "neutral" watch that can be worn on a nice night out on the town or casually hanging out with friends. There are enough options on this smartwatch to satisfy virtually every category of user. I think Amazfit is doing big things and will only continue to grow their product line and offerings in the future.
5,I've had Android watches and other Amazfit watches. I MUCH prefer the Amazfit/Zepp OS more features than I can use and insanely long battery life of my GTR 3 Pro over Android alternatives that are much more expensive have poor battery life and are invasive. The Zepp OS is built for wearables so much more usable than my Android watches.The GTR 3 Pro has a gorgeous display is responsive and fast and even with full bluetooth connection to my phone lasts 7 days on a charge. If I turn off the bluetooth I get 10+ days on a charge. It's a perfect size lightweight and the two crowns allow for one-press access to your choice of menus/functions - nice touch (no pun intended).The Zepp Android App is a great dashboard that hides a dizzying array of features and customizable mini-apps. Amazfit asks users for preferred updates and functions from time to time.The little things obviously matter to Amazfit - since this watch is supposed to be both a sports wearable and a fashion watch they included a heavy rubber watchband that looks and feels like leather is more durable than any other band I've ever had and is obviously not harmed by sweat or water.I've had it for over a month now have been hiking kayaking swimming biking with it it has been through multiple TaeKwonDo classes every week yard work including felling large trees. No scratches on the crystal (amazingly) and the band looks the same as the day it arrived.I couldn't be happier with it except that my Android watch now sits on the counter completely forgotten.I haven't found a single thing to complain about.All this at a price point 1/2 that or less compared to Samsung Apple and others.
4,It's a fun watch but don't expect a lot other than some health tracking.It has a proprietary OS so you are limited on what you can do.  It has GPS but ZERO map functionality just maybe a logged run.  The store apps faces are very lacking.  Again good for what it does but in this day and age we expect a lot more.  Also thought it was wireless charging but it's got a peg leg nub.  I wish they would state how the charging works.I returned it as my GW4 did more and I was able to export and send more info with the GW4.  But this does what it does but you are going to be wall gardened into that functionality.  I'd expect zero upgrades over time.  I returned mine .  Best of luck all!
5,--- Update: The amazfit support team reached out to me and found a workaround for setting up an account. I am updating my review from 1 star to 5. Thanks for the support.I never leave reviews but these people have really pissed me off and have taken a lot of my valuable time with no solutions.You'll need to go to hell and back if you need support on this product. I was excited to receive my watch this morning. I was trying to set up the app on my iphone in order to use the watch. But the app consistently crashes during the account setup prompts. Mind you my iphone 13 is brand new with no issues. As such I am not able to use the watch (no account on the Zepp app = no watch use).They have outsourced their support to amazon which can only help with generic issues that exist in the amazfit helpdesk found online. They simply share the most likely link with you that they think might be helpful. Its horrible. I was finally given an email to amazfit's support. They have yet to respond. Now I have a piece of good looking hardware that I cannot use.
4,You won't find a lot of Android apps for this watch he uses its own operating system. Don't let that bother you. This watch gets fantastic battery life. Depending on what you choose to be on the battery lab can be as short as 3 days or as long as one week. The shortcoming of this watch is you can't customize your watch face and there are very little English watch faces available to third parties and secondly you can't really make your own watch face very easily.
5,I was a bit skeptical at first but the less-than-a-day battery life from my Apple watch became too annoying to continue dealing with.  I haven't reached the end of the battery life yet since I take it off and charge it every 4 or 5 days simply because I get tired of wearing it.As for features it has everything I need and more.  I assumed the support by which I mean available apps software/firmware updates would be sparse since it's not one of the dominant brands however it's far exceeded my expectations in those areas.  Amazfit is clearly putting a lot of resources behind their products.Overall this watch has exceeded all of my expectations and I wouldn't be surprised if this company starts gaining serious ground on Apple Garmin etc.
5,Keeps track of my kayaking rafting hiking steps...links to Strava....and battery lasts for days even with lots of GPS usage!  Really enjoying it!  Gotta say that I like it better than my Garmin!
5,Llevo más de 1 mes probando este reloj y todo excelente lo único que no me gusta es que las esferas que están en la tienda son algo caro con respecto a las funciones deberían haber más esferas gratis pero en función todo muy bien.
