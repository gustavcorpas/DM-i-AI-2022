5,I've found it hard to find a wired keyboard and mouse in my area. These both work fine certainly beats using a wireless and wondering when the battery would give out on one part or the other.
4,This was the first Amazon keyboard I bought many years ago. I absolutely love that the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys have a bright green light on the keys themselves rather than up at the top with such tiny symbols that you have to memorize their positions. I also love the calculator key that brings up the computer calculator on the screen since I use it often. Since then it was replaced by a keyboard that did not have these features so I was ecstatic when I saw that these were back in stock since I work from home and use my keyboard all day long. I ordered three of these but one had a defective space bar. It was crooked and would only work if you hit it dead center. The other two were fine and I returned the defective one and received a refund 2 hours after dropping it off at the UPS store. I hope this was just a fluke as I plan to buy a couple more since I always have at least one spare and want to have a couple extra in case these become unavailable again. My only complaint is that the keys are a bit "clacky" but not annoyingly so. The other Amazon keyboard keys are quieter but I like the features on this keyboard much better so this one is my preference.
4,This keyboard and its companion mouse replaced the original KB and mouse that came with my new #### computer purchased about three months ago. It is not silent but I like the sound. The layout is just a bit different but I can adapt to that easily. What keeps me from giving this a five-star rating is that is cannot be rear-height adjusted. It does have built-in ~1/4-inch risers in the back but I want more "lift." I want to be able to increase the height more. In the past KBs had feet in the rear that had three positions: completely down (no lift) a little lift and more lift. The cost of adding that into building the KBs - made in China anyway - is trivial. Charge an extra dollar and give the customer flexibility!
5,I set up a basic internet-only mini-PC and I decided that I did not want to deal with battery drivers /software with the PC.I wanted a foolproof no trills dependable internet-only PC; that I could turn on and go right to the point.The wired keyboard and wired mouse proved my point.
5,Replaced a wireless keyboard because position of keys made touch typing difficult. This keyboard is ideal and I'm so glad I bought it.
5,muy buena compra.
5,So nice I bought it twice. Bought this a few weeks ago for my office and loved it so much I bought it again for my home office and set it up immediately upon receiving. I love the feel and clicking of the keyboard and the mouse glides easy with soft clicking and scroll works perfect. Does not have adjustable feet for height but has an elevated lip to have it stand at the perfect height for me. Price point is awesome. Will continue to buy as needed!
5,Great
5,This is a two piece set with a keyboard and mouse as described. Upon closer inspection this is a chiclet keyboard like you might find on some laptops. They are small keys inset into the face of the keyboard with the rubber dome type inputs for the keys. The keys themselves are a light plastic and are fairly responsive. I'm writing this review on it right now in fact. It's about the same quality as any budget keyboard with decent quality plastic. Obviously you aren't buying this keyboard because you want the very best you are buying it because you're on a budget and want something of decent quality. I think you get that with this set as I find typing on it isn't too bad and it is fairly responsive. The keys are spaced nicely and doesn't feel cramped. You get all of the keys you would expect. The escape key isn't too different from the rest of the keys and not spaced away from them so it may be an issue to some but is otherwise perfectly useful. Becuase of the size of the keyboard some of the keys are perhaps closer than some might like compared to a full sized and full featured keyboard. The F keys are quite small but if you're like me they don't really matter too much. The extra keys like the My Computer key calculator key and they media player key are decently useful and the addition of volume controls and a mute button are also nice. The Amazon Basics logo is unobtrusive. The num Lock key has an LED light to let you know it is on as does the caps lock key. I found all the keys worked just fine. There is not a lot of surface outside of the keys which could be a benefit or not depending on your style of use. I find that it sits pretty flat. There are no flip out risers so the small ledge at the top end is about as raised as this keyboard is going to get. The rubber feet underneath the keyboard keep the keyboard pretty well in place. I have no found no real fault or issues with this keyboard except for possibly the styling. This makes a pretty good backup keyboard in case your high performance one suddenly goes bad and you have work to get done. I even use it for gaming where it isn't the utmost in performance as far as key presses go but is perfectly serviceable for the majority of users. I have no experienced any real ghosting issues but I'm not likely to.The mouse that comes with this set seems prettys solidly built. It tracks well has all your basic buttons and while perhaps not the most ergonomic mouse I have ever used it is very functional. The scroll wheel works well and both buttons click very positively without issue. My kids and wife use it on the family computer the most and they have no complaints. In fact the fancy Razer Tron mouse they used to have on that computer stopped working correctly due to the infamous razer clicking problem. The best thing is that it just works without any need for fancy drivers or software. The kids use it fine with their games as well.We've been using these two items for a couple of months now and they have held up very well. They are very reliable and work just fine for most computing uses. For the price this is a winning combination for most computer users. The only people I would not recommend this to is your hardcore gamer as it will probably wear a bit fast in the usual areas and it is just a dome input so it isn't the best for extremely fast responses and the key blandness might cause some confusion if you are the type to use a wide variety of keys.
5,The PRT SCR function didn't work on the keyboard that came with my Dell computer.  This one works perfectly!
