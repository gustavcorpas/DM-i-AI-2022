5,This card is AWESOME. Beefy so make sure you have clearance in your case. Takes up about 2 and a half slots also. This thing rips apart every game I throw at it. I'm mostly a space sim player so games like Star Citizen Elite Dangerous and No Man's Sky are my dominant games. Star Citizen is a mess but this card holds up even against its unoptimized state. Doesn't run to hot at least for me as I have 9 fans running in my case in a well air conditioned room. Highly recommend you pick this card up. Isn't very flashy with only the logo being RGB lit but that's okay. It's over clocked out of the box and I haven't had any issues even running with a 750 W Gold-standard PSU. The price is just too good to pass up for one of the best cards of this generation.I play exclusively at 4k on an OLED 120hz monitor and I have no issues staying above 60 FPS.
5,This gpu runs cool and quiet! No issues so far and Iâ€™m thinking most reviews complaining of noise or thermals have a terrible case or cooling. Not seen any temps above 60c Max settings 1440p on sotr rdr2 . Coming from a Strix 5600xt this crushes it in every way. $725 who could complain. Glad I waited since crypto miners had to pay $2k for this 18mos ago! Just do it and have a blast!
5,very good with my Ryzen 7 5800x. and ram 32gb
4,I was able to pick this card up at a "reasonable" price and it's been the upgrade I've been looking for... after install two more fans in my case to cool the beast down. Prior to this card I had a 1070ti and never had any problems with it overheating. I don't consider the over heating to be an issue with the card but an issue with my understanding.I wanted this card for the HDMI 2.1 port so I could get 120hz at 4k and for 4k gaming in general. It has not been a let down so far. I'm getting ~90-100 fps in most games with my current build.Overall I'd give it a 9/10. Minor negatives being the price.
5,My 390x died and considering the insane prices for GPUs right now I decided to go for a 6900xt since the price of a 6800xt is very similar. And out of all the 6900XT's out there the ASUS TUF one has been rated and reviewed extremely well.My previous AMD cards have all been from Sapphire but they've all died in 5ish years so I'm a bit skeptical on their longevity now. I'm hoping the backplate on this card provides better cooling and protection than my previous non-backplated cards.- Easily pushing 2 x 1440p @165Hz- Noise is minimal honestly don't hear it but I haven't pushed it too hard in gaming. 5900x cpu cooler is louder.
5,This is a little pricey but rivals the top cards out there including the RTX 3090.
5,I'll keep this one for a couple years. Its definitely a good card to game at 1440p with.
1,died after one week. showing artifacts and video card driver is crashing.  buy xfx 6900xt not asus model.
5,I used to only run NVIDIA cards but this card has been a revelation - don't let the NVIDIA fanboys tell you otherwise (I've been one for a long time). Build quality on this model is great and the gpu core and vram have excellent overclocking headroom. AMD software has been reliable and stable and the card supports resizeable bar on Intel based PC's. People honestly sleep on how legit these cards are.
5,This ASUS TUF 6900 XT GPU does well @1440p with newer games such as BDO and Halo Infinite. The games look very good on this gpu and run pretty smooth.
5,This this is huge so make sure you have the case to accommodate. All settings maxed out for 1440p. Will look into 4k in future. Since ray tracing isn't a big deal for me I wasn't concern with it considering this card trades blows with the Nvidia 3080ti/3090. Also much appreciate thanks to all the crypto miners for overly inflated prices.
