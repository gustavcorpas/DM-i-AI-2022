5,The build quality is excellent.  It has a magnet on the bottom which lets it attach to my computer and give a more stable platform for the reader.  I am very happy with the purchase!
5,I need this to read new CF Express cards that I purchased instead of XQD cards.
4,I bought a second unit after trying out the first one which worked great. The second unit failed after one month. I contacted customer support and they agreed to replace it. I'm sending it back this week for a replacement. The first one I bought is still working. I'm a pro and use both SD and CFexpress cards daily. This is very important part of my download/workflow.
5,Reliable very fast and can do both SD and CFexpress.I like that the cards snuggly slide in and out without a spring or other type of mechanism.A little more than I like to pay but worth the build-quality and performance imo.
5,PROS:-The reader has a magnetic base which I love. This means that the reader isn't just dangling from the end of a cable and can be loaded/unloaded with one hand while firmly mounted on a PC case.-Reads SD cards.-Has a heavy build and manages heat well. The unit itself does not overheat but the Sandisk 256GB Extreme Pro CFexpress card gets almost too hot to touch at 400MB/s. I think this is a mostly a limitation of the card's heat management not the reader's. I can't imagine how hot the card would get if writing files at the card's advertised write speed of 1200 MB/s. Again I presume this is a limitation of the card and not the reader firmware design.-The reader mounts the XQD card (status light comes on) but so far does not recognize it in Windows 10. I am hoping that this functionality will be added to the reader with a firmware update by Prograde. There is really no reason that it shouldn't since the Nikon D850 camera can now read both cards.CONS:-I cannot get the reader to recognize the NIKON XQD 120GB card which is the same form factor as the CFexpress card. Hopefully this functionality will be added by Prograde with a firmware update.-Copying 130GB of random photographs from an M.2 drive folder to the reader on a USB C SS10 3.1 (red) port took about 5 minutes. The highest transfer speed was about 400 MB/s.-The CFexpress card gets almost too hot to touch at 400 MB/s write speed. I mostly blame this on the card since the reader stays cool.-The CFexpress card stays almost too hot to touch even when sitting idle in the reader. That is pretty typical behavior of many USB thumbdrives when plugged directly into a workstation port but I'd think that the reader firmware should be able to put the card on idle to avoid this. I count it as a CON unless proven otherwise. Leaving the card in the reader for an extended period of time will damage the card.-I can't really imagine this unit transferring files anywhere near the advertised card write speed of 1.25 GB/s. That is about 3x the speed that I reached but it may be possible for short periods or for a single large file. Also I imaging the heat production in the card would be much higher which is just not healthy for the card.
4,A bit overpriced for what it really does.  Its a card reader.  It does have a nice look comes with a piece of metal that you adhere to you laptop for a magnetic attachment.  Comes with 2 types of cables.  Reads the CF type B.
5,I had to test a few cables and connectors of my desktop before I found the combination that yielded excellent performance.  A transfer of 8GB or so takes a few seconds.  Very fast.  The card does get pretty warm but that seems to be common and these CFExpress cards even get warm in my camera.
5,Efficiently operated with SD and compact flash cards.
5,It's small. It's unobtrusive. I get a solid 1GB/second transfer off my CF Express B card. It supports my old SD cards as well.But my favorite bit? That magnet.No more having my card readers sliding around on top of my desk running away when I try to insert a card. Now this lives on the corner of my monitor stand mere inches from the mousepad. It doesn't move a millimeter when I add or remove cards. It's easy to see when there's activity.Best of all my reader is no longer buried under a pile of cables and other junk making it that much less likely that I'll leave a card in the reader before heading out for a shoot.If you're the kind of person who's dealing with cards multiple times a week do yourself a favor and grab this. You won't be sorry.
5,Since there is both a CF Express and SD slot I now can take just this reader with me for 4 different camera bodies. Speed is fairly fast but not the fastest read speed. The faster reader is 6 times more costly and you might not need the speed if time is not that important. 4 minutes versus 1 minute.
5,Yes it's fast. Yes it handles Cfexpress B and SD cards just fine. No it's not cheap. Unfortunately my Sony XQD reader had no firmware update so I had to get this one for my D500 (firmware updated).
4,Fast reader 200mbs on sd. 400 mbs on cfexpress on older original 3.0 usb A interface. Strong magnet is nice for sticking to side of pc case. I think magnet may act as heatsink as unit never got warm. CF card does get hot even when not being accessed. I notice activity light on reader comes on every few seconds when not in use and cf card inserted.. I suspect this random activity causes card to get hot. Sd card does not get hot CF does. I notice this to be a complaint for all CF express reader reviews. so probably normal. I pull CF card when done reading to stop heat issues. Both cards used were SanDisk extreme pro fastest versions available on sd and cfexpress
5,Honestly the product was great until it just stopped working after about a month of usage. From what I can tell the device is not getting power so it's no longer reading my cards -- and I have tried a couple of other USB-C cables with similar results. I reached out to ProGrade through Amazon and haven't heard anything back from them yet.Hope this works out because I'm out of the return period (only by like a week or so) and enjoyed using it while it lasted.Edit: 2/5 ProGrade got in touch with me offered a replacement and apologized for the delay in communication. Redemption could be underway. Hope this works out because tbh this card reader was dope when it worked. Updates to follow.Edit: 4/5 Prograde notified me that a replacement is on the way.Edit: 5/5 Replacement arrived safe and sound and is working great. Been using it for a couple of weeks or so and no issues. Sometimes things can go bad. I understand that and Prograde took care of me so their actions show they are here to help their customers which speaks volumes. Looking forward to ordering more products from them in the future.
4,The reader is good but one large issue that I have is that it heats up fast. I don’t know if it is due to me using a SanDisk cf-express card but the card can get hot after a few minutes. Otherwise the reader works great. It’s easy to use and compact.
5,I've got a fast computer but a REALLY slow card reader.  So initially I hooked this up to my usb-c port but it didn't work any faster than my old slow card reader.Then I used their cable and hooked it to one of the usb ports on top of the machine.  Instant triple of download speed.So use thier cable and use the usb - usb c cable.  Its really fast.
5,This reader supports both card types I use with my camera: CF Type B and SD-UHS II. The read performance is very good which is nice now that image and video files are getting larger than ever. The magnetic back of the reader is a convenient way to attach it to my desktop PC case while I'm using it. The reader was well-packaged and the seller delivered it as promised.
5,I feel kind of like a fool for waiting so long to invest in this. It has made uploading photos from my SD cards 99% faster and easier. Highly recommend you get it whether you're a professional or not!!
5,Extremely fast. I use it to download photos from CFExpress and SD cards.
4,Working like it should. It does cook the card pretty good so I only plug it in when extracting images and unplug right after.
5,This PROGRADE digital card reader has a beautiful compact design; is sturdy and extremely quick transferring my numerous large 95+ mb photo files from my CFExpress and SD cards! I've used dozens of card readers and this one is the best of all...!!
5,The only downside with these is they are not Backwards compatible with XQD. But these are the absolute gold standard in readers!
5,What can be said about this that wasn't said already?reliable fast sleek.
5,I was desperately needing to speed up my ancient Sony reader. This did the truck and we’ll surpassed my expectations.
5,UPDATE: So the included USB ARE 3.2's. Apparently the marketing dept  didn't think the instructions should be updated. After playing around it only took a minute to start the transfer process.  I could then remove my storage card while the transfer completed (which took some time but I could use my card so I didn't care.I ordered this USB 3.2 Gen 2.0 card reader only to get 3.1 Gen 1 and 2 USB cables. It is so slow I'm not sure it is even working. I have contacted the company for the correct cables. I will keep you posted.
3,It works great and seems like a nice product.  I'm just scratching my head about why none of my Sony XQD reads in these?!?
4,First off I'll just say that this device transfers Canon R5 CR3 files very fast. I've had no issues with compatibility or quality.The only issue I have and I ordered this having already read this from others is heat build up.If you leave this plugged in for exactly what length of time I do not know it becomes extremely hot. A card left in the reader will become extremely hot also. I did discover a simple work-around to the issue. I unplug it. Amazing concept I know.
5,This card reader is expensive but once you get over the price it’s absolutely fantastic! While using it with pro grades 512g gold cfexpress card I can easily import 200gb of photo/video in less than 7 minutes to my MacBook Pro! I also LOVE how this thing is magnetic. It’s super handy as I can stick it to anything metal and not worry about it sliding off the table! It does get physically warm while plugged in but I haven’t had any performance issues. It feels rugged like a GoPro! I’d say if prograde could drop the price to around $39 -$49 this thing would be perfect!
5,Great product worked as avertised
5,I shoot in RAW and Max JPEG resolution on a very high resolution camera.  I often have over 500 images (x2) to transfer and the speed of this reader is much appreciated. Especially with the CFexpress card getting hotter and hotter the longer it is in the reader.
5,This reader is the best on the market plus it is magnetic and that’s a plus when working on assignment
1,Purchased as a 2nd reader. It is unopened in package. However the first one I purchased corrupted my CFexpress B card. I was able to pull 7 of a couple hundred files into Lightroom then I got read errors after which I could not see any image files on the card. When removed from the reader the card was excessively hot even for typical CFexpress B cards. I want to return the unopened 2nd one purchased as I have ZERO confidence these readers are functional. Guess I have to eat the cost of the one that went belly up.Decidedly very unhappy and will never purchase from manufacturer again.
5,I just got this and have used it a few times.  Initial impression is that this is a solidly built reader that is handsome and of a good size.  The weight is also good so it is substantial but not heavy.  The ergonomics are good and it travels well with my laptop.  I use a Mac and it works just fine.  It is fast.I recommend it with the caveat that I haven't used it for an excessively long time.  If I have problems or trouble I'll update.
3,Easy to use but a little Slow.
5,No
5,A card reader is a better idea than downloading from the camera - the camera socket can break.  This reader is well made and has a magnetic base to prevent movement when inserting the card.  I didn't do a timed download but my observation was that it was several times faster than connecting directly to the camera.  It is not inexpensive but if "time is money" it is a bargain.
1,Absolute trash. Just smashed my second one by throwing it across the studio.48 mbs with a CF Express Type B and an M2 drive?! I will never buy another product from this garbage company.I figured the first one was a fluke - nope.
5,works as described. Its fast has a small foot print and the magnet is pretty handy. I had to buy a 4 ft usb c cord to get from behind my pc to my desktop but overall I'm happy with the purchase
5,Would be nice to have thunderbolt and also backwards capability for XQD
1,Used it only for cfexpress type b cards and connected to a iMac. Issues1. Cannot eject the card2. Sometimes the finder window gets stuck. The directory shows empty ( will get ur heart rate up). Only recourse is to reboot the Mac.3. Does not copy. Tried relaunching finder app a few times but to no avail.Very frustrating experience. I’m done with this. I’m looking for another reader.
5,Gets the job done and works great. Has a magnet which is useful if your laptop or desk is magnetic.Price is a bit high but this is a great product.
5,It’s very fast and handy
5,Small compact beautifully designed and works perfectly
1,I got this to replace my Delkin cf express card reader because I shoot with multiple cameras. Some have SDII cards and some CF Cards. At first I loved this as I only needed to bring one card reader when I travel and it is decently fast.  However I bought it in Dec and the CF SLOT doesn't work five months later.  I only use The proper cord and have it labeled as I have all my cords in my tech bag. BUYER BEWARE would get insurance if you buy this item
5,I liked the fact the base has a built-in magnet and fits well on the side of my desktop PC.
4,The product works as advertised. The customer care provided is first rate.
3,I ordered this because I thought that there was something wrong with my Sony brand XQD card reader - later I realized it was a user error and you cannot read CFExpress cards in XQD readers. So I bought this to read my CFExpress cards but $80 for this? For that price it should read everything on the planet. I would not have bought it if i were not desperate at the time.
5,Tested it using Prograde cobalt on USB 3.2 Gen 2X2 type C cfexpress 325gb TEAMGROUP v60 & Prograde v90 256mb cards.
1,My cards get incredibly hot whether I am downloading anything or not. I left it in for just a few minutes and it was burning hot. Wish I returned this before the return window closed. It is pricey and I expected more from it.
5,Reader has both card types needed for the new Canon R5. Reads cards quickly. Price is a little expensive but the saying 'you get what you pay for' absolutely applies.
1,By paying almost $80 for this I assumed is was well made.  Unfortunately it stopped working on day 32 or 2 days beyond the returnable deadline.  The product worked great when it worked but this is the very first electronic device I've ever purchased that died so quickly after working.  There must be some kind defect or poor quality control.
2,Do not buy this reader! It run hot very very very hot. After downloading a few gig of files and pulling the cf card out I burned my fingers. I called tech support. They said it runs a little warm yet within specs. I guess if you want to boil water. Maybe this is why the R5 got a bad review on the heat issue.
2,I initially really liked it and it worked great... Then stopped working after 4 months.
2,When I insert the CF Express card in the top slot it takes a long period of time for the folders to be opened.  I tried change to different USB slots in the PC and it does not work well in any of them.
1,This order was for a "CFexpress and SD UHS-II Dual-Slot Memory Card Reader by ProGrade Digital | USB 3.2 Gen 2 for Professional Filmmakers Photographers & Content Creators" but I recieved a single slot card reader. I am sick of the constant misleading of customers or the lack of attention to delivered what is being purchased.
1,It'll show up on the computer but won't let me copy anything to or from it.
1,I purchased one and within 1 week it stopped working.  Called the company and they agreed to replace it. The replacement lasted 5 months and then it stopped working. I am going to try and find another brand.
4,Formatting in camera is really fast and so is the transfer to computer. I am troubled by the magnetic bottom a feature I do not need and maybe do not want. A friend once set a magnetic ruler on his floppy disk-instant death. What happens if I set the reader on a memory card--any memory card?
2,Haven't used yet because I'm too scared to use a reader with a super strong memory-wiping magnet on the bottom. Removed the plackard and screw on the bottom to remove the magnet now feel comfortable to finally use and not have to hide from my external hard drives
1,I like this device.  Performance wise I have no problem with it and it is fast.  Right now I'm only using UHS-II SD cards.  So what's the problem?  The DESIGN and provided CABLES are just terrible.1)  It has black paint all over.  I use this thing while work in my dark room and I can't see the darn thing.  There are no LED anywhere showing you where to insert the cards.  At least my "cheap" Kingston card reader has an LED that starts to blink when you insert the cards.  This thing doesn't have anything like that and it is a bit pricey.2)  The cable is too darn short.  They could have made it at least six inches longer.  The cable is connected to the back of my PC and because is so short the cable has to be hanging from the side of my PC case to the front top part of my PC case.  Is ridiculous.
4,The Sandisk CFExpress card reader is no doubt a junk. This one is far better than Sandisk's. It also works with my OLD GENERATION Sandisk CFExpress card. The speed is far better than usb c wired link to my Z 6. The magnet at bottom is a great design so I can adhere it to my tinny ITX case. The price is somewhat expensive only for such a card reader.
5,Fast best reader out there.
5,very fast speed at write/read. But fever is too high during transfering large data and speed is slower at this time. But I think fever was cause by memory card.
5,I had a USB C port on my motherboard but I never really used it. Keep in mind that I had a camera which only used Compact flash and SD cards. I really didn't pay attention to upload speeds as it's usually no more than six hundred images. PS I am a professional photographer. Now that I use a camera which uses CF express cards combined with the larger file sizes I noticed a significant impact on performance. I decided to move to something faster. PS I believe my USB C port is 3.1 or 3.2 gen 1 so it's probably not taking full advantage of the bandwidth of this reader but honestly I'm very satisfied with its current performance.
5,Love the rugged look and card fit is excellent. Does get warm with CFexpress cards as mentioned by others but not an issue. I choose to not make use of the magnetic base but that could be a nice feature for some.
4,I LOVE how this has both CFExpress B and SD card slots.  This saves me because for some stupid reason my Canon R5 has both cards and doesn't just use two of the same like every other camera in the world.  My only gripe is that the card reader gets hot.  I'm talking REALLY hot.  You need an oven mitt to pull out the CF express card after uploading.
4,At least with writes to CFexpress cards the ProGrade is 18% faster than the fastest ones from Sony and Lexar. The magnetic base is very convenient if you have a tower PC or workstation as it attaches to the side of the case and is always at hand.
5,WORKS FAST AND IS MORE CONVENIENT. LOOKS GREAT
5,I use this with my cf express card and raw files. It works very smoothly and as expected I'm very happy with the purchase. The magnetic feature is really handy and convenient.
1,I've had 2 brands of CFExpress cards need to be recovered after being plugged into this reader. The first were Sony Tough brand cards the second were Angelbird brand cards. Using those cards in other readers results in normal behavior. Reading the cards is sketchy as well slow and unreliable. Pure junk if you ask me. I've read of other people having trouble with "ProGrade". Recommend do not buy if you aren't using ProGrade brand storage media.
5,Awesome!!!
4,Love the magnetic feature.
5,Very Good
5,As advertised
5,Stable to read  write and rescue problematic sd card
4,Stackable Memory Card Reader with compatibility issuesPackingComes in a sealed quality cardboard box containing:1 x card reader dual slot CFexpress B and SD UHS-II1 x USB C to USB C cable1 x USB A to USB C cable1 x metal sticky pad1 x User Guide1 x Registration / software info cardIn useThis reader has a magnetic base. If you have more than one ProGrade card reader you can securely stack them on top of each other. You could stick the metal sticky pad provided to a laptop lid and then attach the reader to the back of your laptop screen. Seems a bit gimmicky and you only get one sticky pad.As a card reader this will read any brand of CFexpress B or SD card.Warning number 1. If you have ProGrade cards you must have a ProGrade card reader to use ProGrade’s Refresh Pro software.Warning number 2. If you have a different brand of CFexpress card and need to update that card’s firmware you will need that brand’s card reader. You cannot update the firmware on other CFexpress B branded cards using a ProGrade card reader.So in general you need to match the brand of card reader to the brand of the CFexpress B card for maximum compatibility. An expensive mistake I made not knowing about firmware updates for CFexpress B cards.What I liked1) Well-made card reader should survive travel well2) CFexpress B and SD card slots3) USB cables providedWhat I disliked1) Slots are not spring loaded; you have to push in and pull out the cards2) Does not support XQD cards my camera can read and write to both CFexpress and XQD cards why do card readers in general only work one or the other?3) Not fully compatible with CFexpress cards from other brands4) Inner packaging is black plastic which is not accepted by my road-side recycling scheme5) Magnetic base I would want to keep this away from hard disk drives.Overall a good card reader that is a must for 100% compatibility with ProGrade CFexpress B cards. Given the lack of compatibility with other brands of cards and lack of XQD card support I would rate this as three stars for users with only ProGrade CFexpress B cards I would rate as five stars hence four stars as an average overall.I hope you found this review useful and save on making potential expensive purchases.
4,No me ha gustado que se calienta en exceso cuando está en uso con la tarjeta CXF. Con la SD no se nota cambio de temperatura  Deberían estudiar porque se ese calentamiento extremo. Rápida transferencia de los ficheros con buena velocidad
5,Pratico e rapido junta todas as funcionalidades necessarias
5,I’m a new ProGrade user. Basically I believe the build quality and the company's commitment of their products. I have not done any technical test to prove the performance of the card reader but anyway It is fast and happy using with the Canon EOS R5 camera.
5,Owned many this thing is rock solid and a bullet fast
3,Works fine - but gets really hot if a CFExpress card is left in it while attached to the computer.  Have to ensure the reader is disconnected from the computer as soon as download is complete.
1,I have probably used this a dozen times and it would take a while to mount the disk and now not at all.Ive tried other brand cards cables and nothing works.
5,I am using it for my ProGrade Digital 650GB CFexpress Cobalt Memory Card and it works perfectly.
5,Seems to be adequate quality and worked instantly on my 2017 iMac. Quicker and more reliable transfers than plugging in the Canon R5 directly.
4,My camera can use XQD/CF Express cards along with SD in the secondary slot.I have a mix of XQD and CFExpress cards along with some SD  cards for backup.I have a Sony MRW-G1 which can read both CF express and XQD cards (as they are electrically compatible).I bought the ProGrade reader for 2 reasons:1. I need a prograde reader to use the prograde proprietry card management software with my prograde CFExpress cards.2. It has an SD card slot as well.Unfortunately the reader will not work with XQD cards although any camera (that I klnow of) that uses CFExpress can also use XQD cards.The magnetic base is very nice. The reader is very fast with both SD and CFExpress cards.If you need a single reade for XQD and CFExpress cards this will not work
4,I was in the market for a CF Express Type-B memory card for my camera and so I also needed to purchase a CF Express Type-B card reader. I've decided to get this reader because it also has the UHS-II slot.The unit construction seems very solid and I like the magnet feature at the bottom of the reader it is very strong and is easily attached to the side of my desktop case.The included USB-C to USB-C cable is not very long (I guess it is a standard length) so having the ability to attach the card reader using the magnet closer to the back of my desktop case is a positive for me otherwise the cable is not long enough to place the reader flat on my table surface.In terms of file transfer speed I can only compare it to the SD card reader that I have built-in in my monitor and the ProGrade card reader is a lot faster (~25MB/sec vs. ~120MB/s).In terms of CF Express cards speed - I don't see much improvement. I have the Delkin Black which is supposed to be one of the fastest CF Express cards on the market and definitely much faster than my SD UHS-I cards but I get similar transfer speeds for both cards using this reader maybe 10% difference.In terms of heat the reader gets a little bit warm when I leave my Delkin Black card in it but it is not running hot at all. However this could easily be due to the quality of the memory card itself (I read a lot of complains about SanDisk CF Express cards running very hot while the Delkin cards are not).Overall this is a good product but I think it could be cheaper.
3,I would have given these a higher review if the price point wasn't so high. I understand that CFExpress is a relatively new media but I feel like this is a high price tag for a card reader. I'm happy with the build quality it feels sturdy but the strangest thing to me is that they've put a magnet in the bottom of this device. I guess because they figured users would slap it onto the back of a macbook screen or onto the side of a camera cart but to be honest it makes me uncomfortable to have a magnet as strong as this one anywhere near a hard drive or flash media (because isn't it known that magnets can wipe data???).Prograde is a good company though I've dealt with their customer service and they're on point.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 A excellent device that performs admirably when reading and writing from memory cards.
5,Fa quello che promette consegna nei tempi prodotto perfetto.
1,The card reader has a magnetic base. I placed it over my WP passport external hard drive which is what I did with other readers. The magnet ruined it! I had to purchase a new hard drive and had lots of hustle with restoring my photos. There should be a warning written everywhere for people not to do that; otherwise you can say a good-buy to your hard drive and all of your photos. I think there should not be a magnet in the first place.
5,Il lettore legge la cf express l alloggiamento l avrei preferito a molla come nelle reflex (push and pull)
4,Hoffentlich wird die große Hitze nicht eine Karte zerstören. Ansonsten bisher ohne Probleme.
4,Really a fast one the only problem is heat dissipation it become an hot piece of metal after 3 GB of file transfer!
5,This card reader is lightning fast. Even if you’re pulling images or video off an SD card the 10gbps bus is fast. Most card readers hang off either a 450mbps USB 2 or 5gbps USB 3.1 bus. The increase in bandwidth is noticeable.A test session of 100 images ~60mb each saved to a CFExpress-B card were ingested into Lightroom faster than it took to plug in the reader and mount the card.The package contains a small metal strip backed with adhesive that allows the magnetic base to attach to a laptop or other non magnetic surface.
3,Passant à un Fuji XH2S j'ai dû acheter une carte cf express type B PROGRADE et donc ce lecteur pour la lire : le transfert est un peu lent.J'ai testé avec une carte mémoire pour vérifier la vitesse avec le deuxième port : très très lent dans les 90/mo/s maximum.. J'ai donc pris ma clé USB lexar j'ai inséré ma carte SD sandisk et là tout de suite vitesse de 256mo/s beaucoup plus rapide !Dommage car le côté aimant du boîter est vraiment cool!
5,Both the card are the card reader arrived quickly they are now in use and it seem to work very well. No problem with the transaction.
5,After trying three other card readers ProGrade Digital is the very best.Fast as lightning and it works plug-and-play with Linux Ubuntu 20.04no drivers no nonsense just plug it in and unload that CFExpress card in MOMENTS!Couldn't be more satisfied.A little more expense for a LOT more satisfaction. I strongly recommend it
5,worked perfectly for me for my USB cards and  CFexpress Type B Card
4,Klappt einwandfrei und schnell nicht ganz so schnell wie die internen Laufwerke der M1-Macs.
3,I was looking for a good card reader for both CF express type B and sd card and this one looked good but maybe a bit overpriced received it quickly worked well but then I started noticing it getting hot and my Lexer cf express type B getting almost too hot to touch and it worries me it may one day damage the card so I would not recommend this.
4,RAS
2,Neat feature having a magnetic base so that you can place it on the side of your computer.However I did not know this and had it sitting on top of a WD Passport external hard drive for a few days.Hard drive is now toast.
5,The reader worked perfectly. My large audio files from CF card on my Canon R5 transferred quickly
3,L'ho comprato una seconda volta dopo aver restituito il primo ma purtroppo questo lettore con Win 10 proprio non va. Mai una volta si riesce ad espellere la CFexpress con l'opzione "Rimozione sicura". Il primo lettore l'ho restituito perchè aveva un sacco di problemi e dopo 2 giorni non ha funzionato più. Ridarei indietro anche questo ma.... mi sono stancato e lo tengo. Per onore della verità devo dire che il trasferimento dei files non molto pesanti è buono.
5,Well made and easy to set up and use. Down load is quick works well for me
4,Buona l'idea del doppio cavo in dotazione (USB 3 e USB-C). Costruzione solida c'è la possibilità di fissare il lettore su una elemento metallico mediante il magnete in dotazione. La velocità di trasferimento dipende dal computer utilizzato. Come tutto quello che gira intorno alle CFExpress non è proprio economico.
5,Great build quality.
5,Has super build quality. Made of high grade plastic material. Supports UHS 2 sd card and cf express type b card  at the same time. Very good reading and writing speeds. Comes with both type c to c & type c to usb cables. Has magnet at back to stick it to your laptop’s back.It is just expensive that I don’t like but hopefully it will get cheaper with time and mass production. Thank you ProGrade and Amazon.
4,Elijo este lector porque no quería tener lectores separados para CF y SD.Lee y escribe muy rápido con tarjetas rápidas si se asegura de usar el cable y el puerto USB C rápidos.Buena calidad y funciona bien. No es barato para lo que es.Se calienta cuando se trabaja a toda velocidad. (Es bastante común.)Cuando termino de descargar quito las tarjetas y desenchufo el lector que se enfría bastante rápido.
5,Perfect in every way!! Thank You! A+++ Highly Recommended Seller!!!
5,Small fast perfect for travel.
3,Works well as a very fast card reader. The magnetic properties were a scary discovery.  I normally keep the card reader with the hard drive with my photos on. Realised the reader had stuck very firmly to my hard drive!!!!No idea why anyone would make a media reader magnetic!!! Now stored well away from my hard drives and computer
5,Lecteur de cartes adapté pour mettre en valeurles dernieres générations de cartes et leurs vitesses .
5,Ottimo prodotto e super veloce
2,Reader frequently corrupts files when uploading from SD cards. I know it's the reader as photos get corrupted using the reader but when I change to anothervreader all in fine. Tried to return item earlier but unable to as Amazon not the seller. A rather expensive mistake.Edit: Amazon have subsequently refunded me in full; they didn't have to so fair play to them - excellent customer service!
5,Good solid product
5,In Verbindung mit NVME SSD`s unglaubliche Geschwindigkeit. Ich benutze den Kartenleser eben nur zum Kartenauslesen. "56 GB werden dabi so schnell übertragen das meine Karten etwas handwarm wurden. Nach dem Auslesen stecke ich die Karte wieder in die Kamera weshalb ich Hitzeprobleme nicht wirklich feststellen konnte. Wer eine Postproduktion direkt von der Karte im Leser macht oder lange stecken läßt wird allerdings tatsächlich eine stärkere Hitzeentwicklung feststellen können.
3,Fait le taf aimanté donc pratique.Seul bémol de taille  il se déconnecté logiquement de temps en temps comme si la carte était éjectée
5,Das Gerät kann ich sehr empfehlen. Zuverlässig und sehr schnell in der Datenübertragung. Preis Leistung stimmt. Der gummierte Magnetfuss hält das Gerät sehr fest an meinem Rechnergehäuse. TOP Empfehlung.
5,Der Kartenleser ist echt gut wird zwar etwas heiß aber der Support meinte das ist normal und stellt kein Problem für die Karten dar. Das einzige was mich gestört hat war der viel zu starke Neodymium Magnet. Da der Kartenleser öfter neben externen Festplatten lag hatte ich Angst diese zu beschädigen. Der Magnet lässt sich aber ganz einfach entfernen. Unter dem Aufkleber befindet sich eine Schraube die den Magneten festhält. Einfach Aufkleber abziehen Schraube lösen Magent entfernen Aufkleber wieder draufmachen - fertig!
5,When initially I inexplicably received an empty envelope (?!?) Amazon customer service was very helpful and quick to sort out the problem and try again this time successfully.  The item is nicely packaged comes with two usb-cables (usb-c to usb-c and usb-c to usb-a fine for notebooks a bit short for stationary PCs depending on the location of their usb ports) seems to be well-built and is really fast.  It handles both types of cards the Canon R5 takes hence there is no need for a separate SD-card reader.  While cheaper options are available for CFExpress type B cards only this one tics all the right boxes for me.  Highly recommended.
5,Quick to upload photos onto my laptop great.
1,ce truc est une vraie saloperie qui n'a fait que faire planter mon ordi.il est parti à la poubelle remplacé par un lecteur premier prix à 30 balles qui fait largement le job.
5,Lecteur assez discret pratique en nomade. Ultra rapide pour décharger des cartes professionnelles. +
5,Absolutely rapid download speed.  The fastest card reader I've ever used.SD and CF Express at the same time and it downloaded a lot of large files in seconds.Highly recommended.
5,Habe diesen Kartenleser gekauft um die neue Generation der Speicherkarten in meinen iMac zu lesen.Das Gerät funktioniert bisher gut. Tatsächlich hat man das Gefühl die CFexpress Karten werden gut durchgegrillt. Ich lasse die Karten sicherheitshalber auskühlen bevor ich sie wieder in meine Kamera zurück stecke.
4,Super schnell aber meine Sandisk CFexpress Karte wird echt heiß in diesem Leser.SD funktioniert auch und das auch gleichzeitig mit CFEXPRESS.Der Magnet und das Klebeschild sind praktisch so rutscht es nicht gleich umher beim Karten entfernen oder einlegen.Die USB Kabel sind hochwertig und stören nicht die Drahtlos Verbindungen.Alles in allemPasst
5,Lettore di ottima qualità peccato per il prezzo un pò elevato
1,I had this for only two months and every time I tried to back up files it would eject the card and my hard drive. It got super hot and eventually melted the usb end.
5,Nulla di dire. Cigliegina sulla torta sarebbe stata una custodia
4,Das Lesegerät funktioniert schnell und zuverlässig. Auf Gehäuse-Seite ist ein USB-C-Anschluss verbaut es liegt aber ein Kabel für USB-A bei ein Betrieb an USB 3.0 (oder gar 2.0) ist also problemlos möglich. Allerdings ist dann die Performance eher so mittel aber das ist nicht die Schuld des ProGrade-Geräts.Wie gesagt die Performance ist meinem bisherigen Eindruck nach recht gut. Auch der verfügbare SDXC-Slot ist eine gute Idee; was mir etwas weniger gefällt ist dass das Lesegerät im Betrieb durchaus recht warm wird.
5,Works well. High speed solid construction and has a nice strong magnet giving a solid attachment to a steel case (or supplied plate for laptops) which makes things tidier than having it dangling around loose.
5,Schneller Reader der bei UHS-II die maximale Leistung bringt vergleichbar mit dem besten Readern anderer Hersteller. Bei CFExpress habe ich keinen Vergleich zu anderen Readern habe aber langfristige Schreibraten entsprechend der Herstellerangaben der Karte gemessen - der Reader dürfte also entsprechend leistungsfähig sein.Praktisch ist der magnetische Boden - so kann man den Reader bequem am PC-Gehäuse befestigen (falls dieses aus Metall ist) oder mit dem beigelegten magnetischen Aufkleber auch an einem Laptop oder einer Schreibtischplatte fixieren.Es liegen sowohl ein USB-C auf USB-C als auch ein USB-C auf USB-A Kabel bei. Ein kleiner Trost bei dem doch recht hohen Preis.
5,Preislich nicht gerade ein Schnäppchen aber sauber verarbeitet und ein wesentlich stabileres Gehäuse wie bei den meisten Konkurrenzangeboten. Funktioniert bislang tadellos.
1,Zuerst war ich sehr überzeugt von dem Reader. Kontte 5700 Fotos in unter zehn Minuten auf meinen Rechner ziehen. Beim entfernen der Karte ging dies jedoch sehr schwer und als sie draußen war war diese gebrochen und ein Teil der Kontakte hängt noch im Reader.Sicherlich ein guter Reader meiner geht jedoch zurück werde mein Glück mit einem anderen probieren.
5,Super fast card reader.  Well constructed and solid.
3,Positiv:- sehr schneller Leser- unterstützt neben CFexpress auch SD Karten (auch UHS-II)- Starker Magnet zur Montage am PC-GehäuseNegativ:- wird sehr heiß- nicht kompatibel zu XQD (und das ist absolut unverständlich...)Fazit: wer XQD nicht braucht ist hier richtig!
5,Der Kartenleser Prograde CFexpress- und SD UHS-II ist heute angekommen zum Preis von 6999 über Amazon. Warum mir jetzt ein Preis von 8999 angezeigt wird keine Ahnung.Der Prograde wird mit 2 Kabeln geliefert. USB-C <-> USB-C und USB-C <--> USB.Das Lesen und Scheiben von CFExpress und SD UHS_II Karten von Sandisk funktioniert einwandfrei.Hab es am iPad Pro und iMac ausprobiert alles prima. :-)
3,Der Reader ist  eigentlich toll: Klein und sehr schnell und bietet CFexpress und SD. ABER: Es ist verstörend bis beängstigend dass die eingelegte CFexpress-Karte (Sandisk 512) richtig heiß wird auch dann wenn man keinerlei Lese- oder Schreibzugriffe auf die Karte macht. Das war mir für die teuer Speicherkarte zu riskant zumal beim Sandisk-Reader diese Hitzeentwicklung nicht zu beobachten ist. Dort wird die nur eingelegte Karte lediglich handwarm oder geringfügig mehr. Deshalb habe ich den Reader lieber zurück gegeben und einen zweiten Sandisk-Reader gekauft.
5,Produit reçu très rapidement comme toujours. Bonne qualité de réalisation et permet d'utiliser les 2 cartes en même temps.
1,Leider muss ich bei dem Gerät die schlechteste Bewertung überhaupt abgeben. Hab mich bei der Bestellung sehr auf ein schnelles Kartenlesegerät gefreut. Aber beim Anstecken an den neuen MacBook Pro mit M1 Chip kam die Ernüchterung. Das Gerät wurde einfach nicht erkannt.Nachdem jeder Anschluss ausprobiert wurde habe ich dann entschlossen das Gerät zurückzuschicken. Leider ganz ganz schlecht.
5,Der Kartenleser funktioniert absolut einwandfrei und bietet im Zusammenspiel mit den entsprechenden CFexpress Karten eine sehr hohe Datenübertragungsrate! Alle Daten wurden ohne Fehler übertragen.
5,Bis jetzt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem Lesegerät.
2,Ich muss den Card Reader per USB-C am Mac offers ein und ausstecken dass die CF oder SD Karte erkannt wird. Für die neuen schnellen Karten kopiert der Reader die Daten viel zu langsam. Und das Gerät samt Karte wird viel zu warm.
1,Hat nur 2 Monate gehalten dann war der Leser für die CD Expresskarte defekt. Wird außerdem beim Lesen sehr warm!
5,Fa tutto quello che dice e non fa perdere tempo in attese inutili.
5,Finition parfaite  très costaud 2 cordons aimenté et transfert rapide sur CFexpressJe recommande fortement
5,Performances solides. Debit à 270 en lecture et 220 en écriture avec sd uhs II sony. Belle finition. Cfexpress non testé.
5,Fast and no problems on imac
5,Eine gute Qualität hat ihren Preis
5,schnell und robust
2,Bonne sélection des formats chauffe beaucoup trop
1,En achetant cet article je pensais que le lecteur pouvais également lire les cartes XQD mais non il ne lit que les CF express. Ne l'achetez pas si vous utilisez des cartes XQD. Un produit fabriqué par une marque aussi renommé que ProGrade aurais du pouvoir lire les deux formats de carte.
5,If you own a Canon EOS R5 this is the perfect card reader. The only thing that would make it better would be a mini type c hub so you could daisy chain them.
5,It has become my go-to card reader ever since I bought it.
3,Performance is fine. However the reader and the contained cards do get very hot.If you buy this don't buy a new heater this winter.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The video is of the app Nikon Transfer II transferring 40 NEF (RAW) pictures to my computer. My computer can do 10Gbs easily so I was looking for a fast card and a fast reader. The video above is of the 128GB Gold Prograde CFexpress type-B card w/read speed of 1700MB's write speed of 1400MB's. I certainly nailed my goal of fast card and reader with this company. Forget QXD. Nikon D850 recognizes these cards. Not familiar with any of the Z cameras yet and if they are compatible. The card heats up in the reader due to the card being a type of PCIe 3 SSD drive with a data rate of 4000MBs compared to 160-300MBs. Leaving your card in the reader keeps the card active thus keeping it warm. External SSD enclosures are the same way. Very warm to the touch. I suggest you don't leave your card in the reader after transferring your files to the computer.
5,I bought this primarily to off load photos from my Canon R5 camera which uses CF Express Type B cards and also SD cards.  It works perfectly and is very fast indeed in transferring photos from the CF Express B card.  Way quicker than using a USB cable from the camera to the computer
1,Spent a ton of money on this Prograde Dual slot (CFexpress-SD) card reader and it was doa. Used the supplied cable tried my own cables used different usb ports and only once did the led for the CFexpress slot illuminate yet it did not show up in windows explorer (Win10 Pro). I have a cheap amazon card reader (also type c) and it worked with the same cables same usb port. Do not buy!!! Quality control at this price should be much better.
5,Works flawlessly and even works with the iPad Pro which is great!
4,Works as expected faster than my existing card reader was looking for dual slot reader this one works well
4,This is for reading files from 150 MB camera it's a little faster than the others and it has enough room for a few pics
5,I have bought the card reader to read my Sony CFexpress Type B Tough 512GB card. And it has worked perfectly fine. The card reader is way smaller than i expect it to be. The cables that came with the card reader are also of decent length. It is also a good compact size to bring it on travel in the future.
5,Very good item
1,Non-removable magnet makes it dangerous to pack with hard drives and credit cards. This is a huge concern as I would normally pack it with my drives when on location. the chances of someone having something metal in the perfect position by their workstation while feeling totally safe having it there are slim. They should have included a magnet separately with peel-off adhesive if they felt like that is an important feature.I was able to pry some of the foam base off wedge a knife under the magent and pry it off but the dumbdumbs use an aluminized label for all the product info underneath which are hard to pull off and there is a screw that bolts the magent on. If removing the magnet try to peel off the lable from the magnet to get access to thescrew. I forced mine open stripping teh hole...whcih is not really a big deal.Otherwise it is a fine product.
5,Compact appears to be well made and uses usb-csome have said it gets hot but i haven't noticed.
5,Used for uploading from CF-B card to a MacBook Pro. It does not work with older XQD cards apparently. It is a well built compact reader that will travel well and save space
4,Väldigt bra och behändlig kortläsare för CFexpress och SD kort. Det är inte många på marknaden som har den kombinationen. Jag använder dessa kort i min kamera och tycker det är smidigt att kunna ha en läsare för båda typer av kort i en och samma läsare. Tyvärr så blir CFexpress kortet extremt varmt och man kan knappt ta det med fingrarna utan att bränna sig när man tar ut kortet. Tar man det på sidan så går det bra men man bör lägga det åt sidan och låta den svalna innan man tar på den.
4,Purchased in haste as I was after a CF card reader. SD reader as fast as my previous pro grade USB 3 reader - fast. Impressive looking reader and packaging!
5,There is nothing to review other than the fact that it delivered as advertised.
5,Very happy with this product. I feel like it's over priced at just over $102 CAD but if you're shooting a lot of video and need to offload it quick-ish how much is your time worth? I've been using it for a few months now. Haven't had any issues with it. I would recommend this product to high volume shooters. If you don't shoot tons of data you can find something much cheaper that will suit you better.
5,Does exactly what it says. Comes with 2 different cables which helps with compatibility and it’s lightning fast when I want to transfer anything. Great product!
5,Buy it.
5,Extremely quick and easy to use. It keeps the speed up which is awesome for both cfexpress and ssd card. Buy it!
4,This has very fast transfer rates but it heats the card up a lot even when not transferring data. Not sure if it should do that but I just make sure to eject it after it's transferred the data to be safe.
3,The reader itself is quite bulky- about 10x times bigger than the card size. Can't imagine what is inside because my SanDisk reader is just slightly bigger than card size.Read speed is just about 700MB/s using USB 3 Gen 2. Not sure whether it is CF card or reader issue but all the same - both claim about 2x higher speed.
