5,I have previously owned a desk-mounted Huanuo monitor arm and needed to switch to a wall-mounted setup. I owned the desk-mounted arm throughout the interminable Covid pandemic and it was great so naturally I chose to stay with Huanuo for the wall mount.The arm itself is excellent and I recommend it---it's just as good as the c-clamp desk mounted version. I have two 24-inch monitors attached.Installation was fine. Given the reviews I was expecting to need to draw my own template and purchase additional mounting hardware but as it turns out they have added a precut template and more mounting hardware to avoid these issues. That was a pleasant surprise and I am glad to see Huanuo responds to customer feedback.I experienced two issues: One of my own making and one inherent in the product First I did not realize this mount was not compatible with steel studs. Many new build apartment buildings use steel studs instead of wood studs because of their fire resistance (along with other nice features). Because steel studs are typically narrower than wood studs and because toggle bolts require approximately half inch holes to mount I did not see a way to sturdily attach the mount to the steel studs without an uncomfortable chance of accidentally cutting one face of the stud in half with the drill bit. This was my own fault.Instead I anchored a 4.5 foot fence post to a concrete block and fastened the monitor arms to post. This while not the prettiest thing I've ever made is working fine. In doing so I discovered that the provided lag screws are not of great quality. The manual recommends installing with them a socket wrench but this would be a giant PITA so I first used a socket adapter in my drill to get them most of the way in and then hand-tightened at the end. There is no way you'd be able to use a standard Phillips head drill bit without stripping the provided screws.Even with the socket adapter the provided lag screws barely got in---the screws are quite soft and the indent that marks where the screws are fastened means you get maybe a quarter inch of grip on the head to drive it into the wood. This is a pain but not a disaster---I would recommend just buying your own lag screws of comparable size (size given in manual) and use those instead.Additionally a very minor annoyance is that one of the thumb screws meant to keep the monitor in the bracket was a little too large (the other fit perfectly). I think its something like a #6 machine screw; I had something lying around that fit and used that instead. No biggie.tl;dr: great mount subpar mounting hardware but that is easy to get on your own.
5,IT professional here that works remotely from home. Easy to install no out of the box assembly and serves my needs beautifully for two 24" monitors. All mounting hardware was included. Biggest reason I bought this item is it's ability to angle and manipulate monitors to almost any configuration. I sized the pre-drilled holes to a 2x4 wall stud and it is rock solid. Advice: Take time to see how monitors will hang/display before mounting; it is lower then you think.
5,I purchased this duel monitor support system because a desktop stand on one of my monitors failed completely without any action on my part; it just broke. So I was looking to upgrade to a duel monitor system which would not require mounting to the desktop; my desktop is glass.I ordered this 2 days ago; it arrived yesterday evening.After a light review of the instructions and knowing how to properly mount things on a stud behind drywall I went to work. Taking advice of the person who recommended a cardboard template I created one from the cardboard within the shipping box itself. I used a stud finder to find and mark the outer boundaries of the stud on the wall. I used a level to mark a line for the placement of the cardboard template. I drilled pilot holes as the template had been marked accordingly. I used an electric drill to drive the hex cap lag screws into the holes with the mount held against the wall. I attached the mounting bracket to the monitors and slid them into the arms. Note: you may have to loosed the final joints on the monitor arms to allow for easier movement in the up/down direction; not too loose not too tight. I placed the cables in the bottom arm channels with removable covers.The system is now in place. about 30 minutes to complete install. It is well designed. It is well worth the price asked. You will not be disappointed.The screws which ho9ld the monitors to the arms were not in my package. As weight alone holds the monitors in place this was not a great concern. I may go to the hardware store and obtain hand turn screws to insert into these holes just to assure firmness of the joint. The monitors can wobble slightly without them; no big deal as they would not wobble when not being moved.So if you need to mount two monitors to a wall this is a very good way to do it. Buy one and see for yourself...
4,Its an  excellent bracket.  The problem I have is that in order to position the two monitors next to each other they are too close to me to focus. They should have made the piece that attached to the monitor that could slide on the arm. Or make that arm telescopic.
5,This wall mount is very well built and with the monitors suspended I have much more clear work space!  I have a 34" LG 34UM59 LCD ( actual width 32.5") and a 27" ACER S271HL LCD ( actual width 25.25" ).  I tightened the gas piston for the 34" LCD and it holds perfectly.  I didn't like the idea of mounting it directly to the wall so I mounted it to a 2 by 6.  I used 3/8-16 cap screws 1.75" long.  This required re-drilling the mounting holes slightly oversized to fit the bolts.  Then I used 3/8-16 "t-nuts" through the back side of the 2 by 6.  Once I hammered in the t-nuts I mounted the 2 by 6 to the stud using lag bolts placing it flush on the desk to help support weight.  The wall mount is then bolted on.  One thing to mention is to mount the HUANUO down low near the desk.  I have shelves which are 23" above the desk.  The monitors can move the full vertical range.  The attached picture shows the monitors side by side when pulled out as far as possible.
5,I bought these for my home office very easy to install and use. The best part is how affordable it is.
5,Not difficult to setup. I have been using my two 27' monitors monitors for a few months now. No issues.
5,So I read a crap-ton of other reviews of this and other products. For context the setup I was after (and what I was able to do) was run two laptops into two Dell D6000 docks with a USB/KM switch to the two docks so I could bounce back and forth my keyboard mouse webcam etc. between the two computers at the push of a button and this setup was perfect. The desk I have cannot handle the weight of a huge stand plus (4) monitors.Bought two of these so I could mount the two monitors for each computer. Setup was honestly pretty easy. You'll note and I think other reviewers have noted that if you're going for my look the monitors WILL be off the wall a solid foot and there's nothing you can do about it at least with these 22" monitors. Perhaps if you were using two very large monitors you'd have to push the arms back to get them side by side but as you'll see in the pictures this is what it took to get me setup. For me I could care less about the extension distance from the wall. I got the setup I wanted.Somehow I was able to do the install by myself. Use a stud finder if possible otherwise I used 16 OC from the whiteboard above and up from the electrical box below. Intersected the lines and no issues. When installing try and get them completely level but don't freak out if they aren't level because you can adjust the monitors rotate left/right a little bit if it's an issue. I used a drill bit in one hand pinned the mount on the wall with a level on top with my other hand and then scraped the three holes so I knew where to drill. Drilled pilot holes and then set the screws and mounts in place. After a little bit I HAD to use a ratchet to snug it up and get it all the way to the wall as the impact/drill just couldn't keep going. Make sure you get the mount all the way to the wall and it's snugged up nice. The lag bolts were perfect thankfully I nailed my pilot holes so all (3) holes for each mount were exactly on the stud (thank God).All in all very very sturdy. I made a few minimal adjustments to the tension screws for the monitors. The cable management for the mounts was pretty nifty I still need to velcro down all my cables for everything else but I might wall mount my docking stations and laptops so we'll see.In all you'll be glad you got this. I do a lot of IT work and wondered if I needed a painted plywood backer board on the wall and that's completely unnecessary. All in all great gear and I'm thrilled to have my dream setup.
3,I've yet to install but have seen what others have been saying. The supplied hardware on the packaging says concrete only not for wood or dry wall. WTF am I supposed to mount it with then? Why would you supply us with supposed concrete mounting hardware I don't live in a castle. I suppose like many others I will have to make a trip to Lowes / Home Depot to properly get the correct mounting hardware because I do not want to waste my time or ruin my wall with multiple attemps when/if I mount this arm. My rating(s) are on par with what I've read from others reviews and from me unboxing it.1) It's very sturdy and feels well made and for $49 at the time of purchase it's undoubtedly the best option.2) Has the highest range of motion specifically pulling the monitors to you and all other ranges.3) Garbage hardware save yourself your time and your wall and go purchase the recommended/required hardware for whatever surface you intend on applying this mount to.
5,Not much to say Its definitely worth the price. Small note they provide a paper template for making holes. For me they weren't aligned that well just see for yourself if they match the arrangement on the mount. You can always just make your own template if necessary.
5,This mount is amazing!! Very well built I like the fact that is overbuilt. Large mounting plate for wall large pivots gas shocks and sturdy metal arms. Packaged very well all the hardware was included as well as tools for torquing the shocks and installing monitors. Great product.
5,If you have any experience mounting anything to a wall these dual wall mounted arms are super easy to put up. First off the mount does not come with mounting tools such as drill drill bit phillips head bit level or stud finder which is expected as all of which made the installation easy (you definitely want these tools for all your future installations anyway). I did the entire installation by myself so that means one person is capable of doing it alone. The mount does have some weight behind it so that could make it harder but still easy to install. Once mounted to the wall I attached one monitor and made adjustments to the tension screws and placed it where I wanted. Once the first arm proved it wasn’t going anywhere I installed the second monitor the same way. I have my monitors set side by side horizontally. I’ve had the dual wall mount for several months now and have not needed to make any adjustments to the tension screws. Very sturdy. I’m a gamer and get excited sometimes which results in jumping around which caused my monitor to shake when it was physically on my desk. The wall mount has completely eliminated the shaking or movement caused by my excitement. The range of motion it offers is by far enough for both monitors as you can place them in several positions while on the mount. Overall a great buy especially as a pc gamer who streams.
5,The item is exactly as described and it is great quality. It’s heavy yet sturdy.  The installation was pretty simple especially with the included instructions to go by but I would recommend making a template of the mount for marking your spots on the wall. The mount is heavy so it’s complicated to hold it in place long enough to get your spots marked.  Getting the monitors mounted was simple as well my only complaint is the bolts for tightening the tilt of the monitor were hard to get tight enough with the included Allen wrench for the monitors to stay put. I ended up getting a ratchet with the right attachment in order to get it tightened down enough.My only complaint overall is the pictures and description would lead one to believe the monitors would be able to butt up to one another (with no gap) but the only way I can get this to work is to have the arms fully extended.  Once I got the monitors adjusted I ended up with a decent gap between the two and have to look further to the left and/or right than I wanted but I was able to get them to where they are fairly comfortable. Overall great product and great quality and there are a lot of pivot points and flexibility in it but unless you have monitors that are larger than 27” you’ll probably end up with a large gap between the monitors (if that’s an issue for you).
3,Overall ok but very annoyed that it came with concrete wall anchors but nothing for standard drywall/wood. I have to run to hardware store to buy the correct pieces before installing
5,I did a lotttttt of looking around and ended up with this mount for my monitors (Two 27”) the arms are extremely solid overall mount construction also extremely solid. Arms move any way you can imagine and my screens line up perfectly straight. 10/10 would buy again.Try and get help hanging it. The mounts very heavy and was a pain in the @$$ to hang along not impossible just not fun until you get one screw all the way down to keep it holding itself
5,first the package is heavy. its metal. it well made.2nd : the arm can easily hold 27" monitors since these days monitors are so lightweight : its not a problem.the instructions are easy .you will need to drill 3  holes in the wall and the only drawback I found is the 3 mounting screws supplied in the box are too thick. I used my own mounting screws which works perfectly.the device has nice cable management tunnels. you can tilt the monitor to any ! direction . turn it 360 deg. so even if you screwed the back plate a bit offset  you can easily fix the monitor position horizontal later on by minor arm adjustments.there are screws to even adjust the spring strength.I love this arm.
3,This would be an easy 5 star review from me. As far as the arm itself it's 5/5 from me. Knocking off 2 stars because I'm sick and tired of these stickers people use that are impossible to get off. I've now sat here for over an hour trying to get these 2 stickers off the arms and it's got to be one of the worst stickers I've ever encountered. Goof OFF won't do anything to these stickers. Now I just got them soaking in that stuff for the 20th time still working on it... Such a huge waste of time. So frustrating and incredibly unnecessary. Never in my life have I made such a silly review. It almost feels wrong but this is just so absurd. Who wants giant yellow stickers with instructions on their arms? Obviously there's going to be people that will want to take these off. Please fix this problem!
4,Bought this to mount my two 27inch dell monitors and get some more space on the desk. Overall setup was not too bad and probably took a total of 30 mins (minus Home Depot trip to get some screws). For my setup I have one monitor centered and other monitor on the left and this mount seems to work well. I was able to push one of the arms all the way back and the other one comes out at an angle and probably a foot over the desk.I mounted this on a stud but the provided lag bolts stripped half way into the stud. I did drill pilot holes first. Ran to Home Depot and got some sheet metal screws of similar size and they worked perfectly.
5,Works great. And super easy to install.
3,Picked up to install two 24" Lenovo monitors for my new home office set up. Works well enough.This mount does put your monitors quite a bit away from the wall. From the edge of my screen to the wall is 16" of wasted space behind the monitor with the way the arm sits. I had to rearrange my entire desk set up but the mount is sturdy and holds the monitors just fine.I took off a star as the mounting plate for the monitors does NOT work if you have any recess on the back of your monitor. My two monitors (Lenovo T24v-20 and T24i-20) have a recess where teh stock stands click into. The brackets for this mount use a thumbscrew on top that is impossible to get installed if you place the brackets on the monitors then onto the arms like you would normally. I had to install everything as a whole and have my wife drive the lags in the wall while i held the entire assembly. Yuck.I also dropped a star as teh cable guides on the arms do not like to stay on. They will randomly pop off; no movement of anything and they are installed correctly in the slots. Weird.
4,very sturdy doesn't sag perfect set up for me but I am only using 1 arm right now. Later I will add another smaller monitor. Would recommend.
5,Supper easy to install though I did find the lag bolts they provide a bit overkill. Very nice looking and lots of optional positioning
5,It was a good mount easy to use I would recommend and get another one if I had more mounts
4,I don't like to have a dual monitor setup where the two screens meet right in front of my face - I like having one screen centered in front of me with the second screen off to the left or right. This mount is flexible enough to do that even with 27" MSI Monitors. I was able to push my main screen back with the second monitor off to the left by extending just that arm. My only complaint is adjusting the tension so the arms don't sag with monitors - seems like you need to turn the bolts a lot to get the arms tight from moving.
5,I work from home on occasion and with limited desk space I needed something to accommodate a laptop docking station and dual monitors.  In addition to the work equipment I needed room for our 27” Apple. By mounting the arm just slightly above the home pc I was able to get the dual monitors to store up and out of the way when not in use.  Thanks HUANUO for making my home office setup functional for work and home use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Was exited to mount these for my dual monitors although i used one placed horizontally (normal) and the second one placed vertically the mounting was kinda tricky since my desk is L shaped. And i had to play with the measurements before drilling the holes. Overall a lot better than the one i owned and since my monitors are not that heavy. Would recommend!!
5,Easy to install range of motion is as described and moves smoothly. very sturdy 10/10 would buy this again for my next project.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 easily supports a 24-inch monitor….you can adjust its hardness height and position I would buy it again
5,Holding two 32s up perfectly fine.Worth the money.
5,This is a well built high quality mount. It is a real bargain. The instructions are clear and the parts were well labeled. My only suggestion is that the manufacturer add a template. Trying to mark the pilot holes while holding the bulky and heavy mount is difficult even with two people.Here are my suggestions:1. I built a template out of cardboard2 After taping the template to the wall I used a push pin to mark my pilot holes3. There is no way that we secure the lug bolts with the included wrench you need a drill. Don’t use a Philips bit the threads will strip. Use an 11mm hex bit.
5,This is is a great wall mount!  My 27” monitors needed to be installed in a corner and I wanted to free up the desk space.  I was worried that being in a corner the arms would impact the walls or that I would not be able to adjust them to the position I wanted but neither was an issue.  I had to mount the wall bracket close to the corner because of the location of the wall stud but this worked out perfectly.  The height is fully adjustable and the monitors are lined up perfectly.  Very happy with how it came out!
4,I like how easy it was to install sturdy and this is available for more desk space. The hard part to get the power cords to go through the "arms." If you put the monitors closer to each other you would have to move your desk further from the wall or else the monitor is about a foot away from the wall. Otherwise I do love it it is a great product.
5,Easy to install and so far works great. Purchased two one for my work office and one for my home office.
5,I have had two curved monitors for several years and have been looking for a way to get them up off of my desk. This mount was the answer. My husband and I installed it without much issue. It is sturdy and now I have the range of motion to easily adjust them in any direction.  I would give it six stars if I could.
5,This is an excellent product once it is correctly installed. It has an ample range of motion sturdy. You need to read the intructions first before even unwrap it.I thought I will get away installing it with 80lb (max I found) anchors but they couldn't hold it with the monitors. My bad because they highly stressed not to do that. Then I installed it again finding a stud and it is very solid. I am not afraid that the monitors will fall. Then ajusting the air spring to the correct level you can position the screen in any position.
3,This mount is stable and allows a wide-range of motion. It is made of quality metal parts and keeps cable management in mind with its design. The big complaint about this product and why it only got three stars is a quality assurance issue. One of the holes on the monitor VESA mount was not centered with the hole it attaches to with a screw. A normal consumer might have to return this product due to this issue alone because there's no way to get the holes aligned and screwed in. We had to use a drill to cut away some metal to make the hole on the bracket better align. Once this modification was made it fit like a glove.Overall solid product but if you get a quality failure like mine you might very well need to send it back for a replacement or refund.
4,I love this armature; makes it easy to lower and lift two screens; I can even have one screen in a vertical position Definitely durable and no problem setting up the armature in the first place.
5,Very Nicely designed product. In most cases this will work very well for hanging two identically or similarly sized displays.However make sure that your lowest point of display is mocked up before hanging. Due to the placement of the mounts themselves via their VESA coupling on the back of my displays they are about 4" higher than the most ideal location they could be. I will have to remount but that is my own incorrect analysis.
5,Solid setup does stick out like other reviews mention. Instead of getting the height where you want it and tightening it there you loosen the adjustment screw until it can droop freely to where you want it to be. It's a bit odd but it does work
5,Mount is a great solution if you want two monitors side-to-side and stationary. They aren’t particularly fluid in their movement but won’t move once they’re in the right place. Makes my “work from home” days a lot easier!
2,This mounting arm isn't bad when used in certain situations. If mounting on a wall where the arms can extend a foot or more you may be pleased with the purchase. The mount is sturdy and the motion feels smooth once the resistance is appropriately set. The issue with this mount comes when you are sitting close to the wall. You will be unable to put the monitors side by side and stacking likely won't be an option at any distance. Furthermore the mounting bolts strip quickly. If you need to back them out more than once you may find they no longer have Phillips head groves.
4,This is everything it describes. Relatively easy to install though I had to take the arms off and then put them back on after the wall bracket was drilled in. Otherwise everything went smoothly
5,It’s a super nice tools if you use more than one monitor. I recommended
5,Great product. Very sturdy. Followed the directions and it worked like it was supposed to. Just like any wall mount with an extra mounted monitor. Follow the directions and it should be ok. It holds my monitors just fine. The install was pretty easy. Finding the studs and not having a ratchet was the hardest part. The rest was cake.
3,So this product does as it says it will hold your monitors or tv up to the wall.However the included instructions are unclear and not very efficient. Also the hardware included with the product is not strong enough to hold up the mount I would suggest using your own.Lastly the instructions to release tension on the arms were backwards. Easy to figure out but confusing overall.
5,Had an issue with one of the arms not working.  Contacted the seller had the replacement pieces sent and received within a week.  Amazing!  I love it!
3,The install is total garbage. For this price you'd expect the screws to be magnetic and the top of the wall plate to be flat and accept a magnetic level to have a chance of mounting level. The top bolt holes are offset so there's no way to have solid on stud. You would need to bed able to perfecting determine the center of the stud to even get close. Otherwise it's fine. Install is just total garbage and they didn't think that one through at all.
5,Wored well for my gaming setup.
5,Works very well. Securely anchored to the wall and tensions for monitor movement are great!  Only knock the mounting bracket has three lag screws for the wall. Their silver while the bracket itself is black. Kit doesn’t come with any covers for the mounting screws so they clearly standout.
5,Drill 3 holes align screw into place. Mount VESA brackets on screens clamp on arms screw top to secure. Movement range is exactly as advertised.I wouldn't apply full body weight on it but it is sturdy.
5,Installation was very straightforward.  Just make sure to anchor it properly.  I put mine into the studs.  I had to do some work getting the monitors to line up like I needed them to but it worked out great.  Very happy with this and would definitely recommend it.
1,If you have to move get ready for bullet-sized holes that you have to fill after removing from the wall.It’s huge heavy awkward and pinches and hurts when you try to maneuver your screens. It’s INCREDIBLY limited in range in motions and the bars have spring-action propellers so get ready to get punched in the face and shoulders when you dismount your screens.Worst purchase ever. The absolute worst.Save yourself literal pain and suffering and DO NOT BUY THIS. I would love to get my money back if at all possible.
5,Love these arms they are monsters. Had to put our computers at the table because of space didn't want 2 desks in the way. They make it feel like a futuristic setup. Can move them anyway we want with no problems. Definitely recommend they are tuff and sturdy with 2 27 inch screens.
4,Works great.  Saves space.
5,Very easy install so far so good!
2,This mount seems sturdy and was simple to install however has a very limited range of where the monitors will sit. If you want your monitors a couple feet away from the wall they're mounted to it may work better but I was hoping to have to monitors side by side about 6" from the wall and it's impossible to do. With the full arms the monitors end up feet apart from each other. I took out one of the arms on each side and they ended up too close together. I tried with just one arm shorter than the other and it was closer but still didn't plant the monitors exactly where I needed. I'm going to try a bunch of different adjustments but I'm honestly pretty disappointed and will probably just end up returning the mount.
3,This works but could be better. I cannot put my screens next to each other like I prefer the arms to not allow the distance to be that close together. The air hydraulics do not work well either i turned the Allen wrench both ways neither direction made it tight good thing the chair is adjustable.
4,Arms are to long and can’t put both connected to each other
5,Have had it for about 2 months now and haven’t had a single problem with it. I was able to detach one section of the left arm to make it shorter as well.
5,Requires careful planning to locate mount directly over a stud or something solid not drywall anchors alone.  If no stud available mount to backboard and attach that to spread the weight.
5,if you have dry wall. try and find the support beams in your wall. there are tools for it
3,I purchased because I wanted to hang my computer monitors on the wall and free up space on my desk. The mount does not lay flat up against wall and it puts the monitors really close to your face.  Would not recommend for a small desk area. This is better for gamers.
2,it CANNOT support two 15 lbs monitors yeah it was good for a year and a half. After that it just slumped over I fixed it for about two months and now it's just stuck there they should give the right tools to tighten it at least. The monitor cable management thing is SUPER hard to use it was barely able to come off it's only able to carry like 1 cable. can I atleast get like a half refund or something
5,I purchased this for my son and he loves it. Very easy to install and easy to maneuver and align the screens. I highly recommend this product
5,The wall mount is sturdy and has a wide range of motion. It is perfect for my 24inch monitors.
3,The monitors will not line up in a side by side without gaps unless you extend the arms fully.  This brings the monitors too close for my office space comfort and visibility.
5,This made my dual monitors arrangement and usage so easy. Recommended if you need a dual wall monitor stand
5,Works great for my new gaming setup!
5,Just installed. Do not have both monitors on it yet. Should be fine! Would recommend!
3,Overall good but not finished product  I can’t believe there is no cap to cover big nuts there should have been one more jump so monitor go back little bit  now it come too close to face
5,Monitors for work at home job.
5,Holds my 2 27 inch monitors up with ease. Was easy to install
5,Product is used for two large monitors. No issues with weight works like a charm
5,Worked perfect well made easy install. It was actually a Dream Fit.
3,One of the bolts for the mount was stripped and won't tighten and the monitor won't stay level.
5,like it !!!
5,Easy to install
3,One side stopped staying up after 4 months of use.
1,Made of solid material & had a great area of motion but sadly it ripped a hole in my wall....
2,It came with stripped screws that cannot be tightened. My monitor is a bit wobbly on the left arm. I thought I can deal with it but with constant movement it gets worse.
1,This is trash. I wasted cash on this and now my walls have 3 large holes in them and I have 2 monitors who cannot sit within 6" of each other unless they site at a 75degree angle. The installation equipment is cheap and broke during installation. I had to replace the anchors with ones I had at home. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
1,I did not receive any of the hardware with my order. So I am unable to mount or use the product and the listing suggests there is hardware in the box and there was not.
1,The items they gave me were so poorly made when I tried to drill into the stud the screw threaded and didn’t even get through the stud. Never buying from this brand again.
1,Couldn't get the mount to tighten enough to actually hold the monitor up. No matter how tight it got.
1,didn't work and customer service is a joke.  China based nobody to help.  Matter now escalating to Amazon Exec.  What a joke....
1,cheap garbage stay away
1,Missing the attachment to attach the screen to.
4,These things are build very well and surprisingly lighter than I anticipated. Mount them to wall stud and they are solid. The gas arms work very well and are easy to adjust depending on the weight of your monitors. They are easy to move around and get into your desired position depending on how you're sitting etc.They are very bulky. To get the monitors lined up they have to be pretty far away from the wall. So if you don't have too much space between you and the wall the monitors will be right up on your face. Unfortunately that is my only predicament so far so these are not for me.
4,So. PROs- holds two monitors with ease. can move up/down left/right and swivel. Can adjust tension so it will stay in place. Pretty straight FWD assembly and feels well madeCONs: the adjuster for tension has an engraved arrow that says turn left to and the sticker says right (follow engraved one). The holes for mounting to the wall are offset to mount to wall. I find that not only odd but annoying. I am NOT mounting this heavy thing with MOLLYS so I need to hit the Stud. So one went at an angle to hit the stud (bottom one in my case). I have NO earthly idea why it would be offset (see pic) but it is. There is cord holders along the bar so the cords can be hidden. That is great And you can actually have one monitor on top of the other. Which I will not use but is pretty versatile.  My monitors mounting holes were perfectly aligned to the mount for the mount.  Oh and there the square mount slides on to the bar mount and thumb screws down so there is no balancing act when mounting the monitor to the bars. (this may not make sense on here but basically you put the square mount on the monitor then the monitor slides onto the arm. So there is no trying to hold monitor up while screwing it to the arm trust me it is a good thing).  Had it a week. Works as it should and I like it.
5,Works great. I use 2-27" visio monitors and hold up great! Suspension hasn't given out and pressure holds good.
5,Great product that is perfect for my two 27 inch curved monitors
5,This is very sturdy. Use caution when taking the arms apart i smashed my thumb between them when i was trying to take off the zip tie.  Nothing wrong with the packaging I was just trying to remove the sturdy zip tie with a knife and i slipped and smashed my thumb between the two arms.
5,Perfect bracket but the dimensions included aren’t exactly what I was looking for. It’s easier to get them now that it’s mounted.From the top of the wall bracket to the center of the arm bracket is 4” lower at its lowest point. There’s 11” of vertical travel so the highest point for the arm is 7” above the top of the wall bracket. The maximum travel horizontally from center of both brackets is 19 1/2”. Hope this helps!
5,This brand has worked well for us and this seems an even slightly better made unit than the last one we installed. BEFORE you get started find and read the manual and the "Caution" label in the box - it will throw you for a loop if you just start cutting tie traps and bands. "Ouch!" Only problem with the install was taking several measurements to "best guess" how high to mount it. We assumed the center of the swivel on the base as the center point to work from - and that worked OK but I think we mostly just got lucky. We also had a 2x4 exactly in the center of our desk space so that was VERY helpful. Do make a tracing of the mount's "footprint" and use that to mark/test where is should go on the wall. I have no idea why that's not in the box - simply nuts to do what the directions say and try to pick this thing up to mark the holes. And make sure you know where the center of the 2x4 (if that's your support stud) is because the top two holes on this are very close to the outer edge and you can easily miss. Bear in mind your monitors may be heavy - and heavier when you start shoving them up and down. You don't want to be "that guy" who tore up his wall because he only "almost" got into the wood... We've done these before - over-engineer the support on this. We've had more than one person go "Oh wow!" and grab the monitors and start jerking them around like we'd never do. Anyway good design... Works very well if you pay attention to ALL the details in the set up. Good luck. Do it right and you'll be happy with it.
5,Overall I can't fault the product for what it is. This is a good product that does what its suppose to do but you'll only know if it is the product for you once you mount it and play with the arms to set your monitors.I have a 24" Acer (SA 230 bi) and 27" MSI (Optix G27CQ4) mounted in the center and I have to chose if I 1) want them further back against the wall with a large gap in between or 2) too far forward and close together. I think for those that want to put their monitors in the corner it will work very well for you.Mounting: I recommend making a template for the screws and being confident in finding the stud. the top two screws will work with the 1.5"  but in needs to be dead on. The instructions also call for too big of a drill bit size. Double check it against the screw and make sure it's smaller for the threads to get a good grip.VESA mounts: Mounts are good but the spaces and screws are not a "one size fits all". While the instructions call for spacers and the longer screws on curved monitors the Optix G27CQ4 required the longer screws to be cut a bit for a proper fit so you don't damage the internals.
5,i mean is not the product fault just limitation of two arm  if you do dual monitor there are some spot that cann't be stay. should just do some more resurch
4,This mount is working pretty well the install was super fast and easy. Sturdy install into stud I feel safe having 2 24" monitors mounted and hanging above my new 32" curved 2k display.The only issue I have with this is mount is the positioning feels stiff/locked and not as in how hard/easy the monitors themselves are to move but the range of motion is not as fluid as I like want one of the monitors about half an inch over from where it is now but no big deal.Great product overall.
5,Currently holding 2 samsung 27 inch curved monitors perfectly.
5,I felt largely overwhelmed by the number of offerings for dual monitor wall mounts. I watched several YouTube videos and read tons of reviews before finally settling on this one. In the end I chose wisely! The Huanuo wall mount exceeded all of my expectations. The mount is sturdy well-built and a great value. For cable management the covers allow for routing of one HDMI cable and one traditional power cord. The range of motion is great but I can understand the concerns of those who want their monitors side-by-side and near touching. I prefer some distance between my monitors so after installation I was able to return my monitors to their previous locations but without sacrificing the desk space under them.  The only real negative comment I have is that an installation template should have been provided. The apparatus is cumbersome to hold while measuring to make sure it's level. Oh and be sure to mount it to a stud! The instructions aren't clear on that but I knew to locate and screw into a stud. Overall I am really truly happy with this product!
5,Great solution for a small corner space.
5,Diese Wandhalterung hat mich total überrascht. Angesichts der nicht all zu großen Auswahl an Doppelwandhalterungen und dem relativ günstigen Preis waren meine Hoffnungen auf ein Qualitativ hochwertiges Produkt eingeschränkt. Doch als die Halterung ankam war ich schwer beeindruckt.Positiv:- saubere Verarbeitung stabiles Material und hochwertiger Eindruck- verständliche Anleitung Schrauben und Dübel sind dabei- ich habe zwei unterschiedliche Bildschirme montiert einer leicht der andere etwas schwerer. Beide halten sofort ohne Schwanken auf jeder einstellbarer Höhe. Die Härte der Tragkraft ist an einer Schraube einstellbar. Bei einem leichten Bildschirm wird die Feder (oder der Spannmechanismus) natürlich nicht so hart eingestellt als bei einem Schweren Bildschirm. Die Range der Einstellbarkeit ist relativ groß.- der Preis bewegt sich im Bereich der einfachen Wandhalterungen daher Top- die wichtigen Gelenke kann man fester oder lockerer Einstellen- die Halterungen sind seit drei Monaten im Einsatz und sind wie neuNegativ:- Montage: Das Teil macht einen hochwertigen und massiven Eindruck das ist es auch. Es wiegt einige Kilo. Ich hab die Montage alleine gemacht es empfiehlt sich aber die Montage zu zweit zu machen. Die Arme sind in der Horizontalen an drei Gelenken beweglich in der Vertikalen an zwei Gelenken (Gelenk der Bildschirmauffassung mitgerechnet). Das macht die Halterungen insgesamt sehr sehr unhandlich. Eine Montage alleine erfordert Geschicktheit Ausdauer und Geduld. Bei mir hat es funktioniert jedoch war die unterste Position der beiden Bildschirme am Schluss leider etwas höher als ich erwartet hatte. Aber nicht weiter tragisch...- Aufgrund des Gewichts und der nötigen Einstellungen an der Spannhärte der Arme ist es nicht wirklich möglich die Halterung samt Monitoren an die Wand zu halten um die ideale Anbring-Höhe testweise zu begutachten.- an jedem "Arm" ist ein schwer lösbarer gelber Warnhinweis-Aufkleber etwa vier auf drei Zentimeter.Fazit:Würde ich jeder Zeit wieder kaufen der Preis ist absolut gerechtfertigt.Ideal wäre es wenn ein kleiner Hinweis für die Anbringung der Bohrungen in Bezug auf die untersten bzw. der obersten Position der Bildschirmfassung (eventuell auch Spanne rechts und Links) angegeben wäre (die unterste Höhe der Bildschirm-Unterkante bzw. die oberste Höhe der Bildschirm-Oberkante wäre natürlich noch genialer aber da gibt es bekanntlich unterschiedliche Größen und Längen). Dann könnte man die Position der Schrauben an der Wand realistisch abschätzen ohne dafür das Teil samt Monitoren mit einer Hand an die Wand halten zu müssen und mit der anderen die Bildschirme die Bildschirme in verschiedene Positionen ausrichten. Dann wäre die Montage auch alleine machbar und man erhält ein Einwandfreies Ergebnis.Positiv überrascht hat mich die zuverlässige Einstellbarkeit für unterschiedliche Bildschirmgewichte. Die Bildschirme halten zu dem perfekt in ihrer Position.Klare Kaufempfehlung
5,Good quality easy to install
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Facile d’installation ce produit répond entièrement à mes attentes et est très pratique.
5,I've been using it for over a year now still as sturdie as it was when it was setup. Perfect for my dual monitors
5,Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden und die Halterung ist wirklich stabil. Meine beiden 24 Zoll Monitore passen perfekt und lassen sich wunderbar in die gewünschte Position bringen.Der absolut einzige Kritikpunkt in meinen Augen ist die Montage - es sind 3 Löcher an der Halterung wobei 1 unten und 2 oben vorgesehen sind. Die beiden oberen sind ziemlich dicht beieinander was bei 10mm etwas schwierig ist. Beim ersten Bohrversuch hatte ich nur ein sehr großes Loch am Ende :( Beim zweiten Versuch dann etwas schräg gebohrt damit die Löcher voneinander weggehen und nicht wieder verschmelzen. Gibt wahrscheinlich genug Leute die das für ein unwichtiges Problem halten aber wer die Bohrmaschine nicht allzu oft in der Hand hat muss hier einfach etwas vorsichtig sein um Moltofill zu sparen :D
4,Brought this to expand my set up the walls in my house tend to be on the thinner side and you'd need special wall plugs to really get it sturdy and in my case it definitely could be sturdier but does the job.The arms themselves are somewhat stiff so if your expecting smooth gliding motion it's not always the case depending on the direction some shake in there but they have worked well for swinging a monitor over to my desk. Tilting them up and down you'll need to loosen them so you can't always just do that on the fly. They do the job I needed them for may replace them with a different type of set up in the future.
5,Sono robusti e reggono 2 monitor da 27 pollici  un po’ male per regolarli  perché hanno  bisogno dell’esagonale ed è scomodo sopratutto se già è tutto attaccato per il resto top materiali ecc
5,My general rule of thumb when mounting anything on the wall is use a stud whenever possible and avoid wall anchors. This unit has 3 mounting holes (2 close together for the top of the mount) I only used one of those and the bottom and it was sturdy enough with the provided screws. I mounted a pair of 27" monitors and this mount supports the weight without any issues. I would highly recommend this wall mount.
3,The support is great with integrated sleeves for cables etc. The thing is while the height/sides adjustements can be done somewhat easily (if you're patient) the tilt does not hold the monitor in place. When you find the right angle to tilt your monitor you have to tighten the screw like a madman and 3/4 of the time the monitor just tilt down because of the weight (and I am far from the weight limit! My monitors are all 11.1 lbs and the limit for each arm is 17 lbs!). Also one of the screw heads on one of the arms was too small for the Alan key to fit properly luckily I had another one laying around but it was still near impossible to tigthen/loosen and adjust. Otherwise the spring is awesome and once everything is in the right place you stop complaining.
5,Great product overall it does have plastic trays that are there to help wire management although I find them easy to pop out if you have really sturdy and thick wires.
3,The mount itself is fine but the screws are way too soft for what they need to do. I have to replace them with my own screws.
4,Took me less than 20min to install the arm itself. The arms feel sturdy and can easily bear a 24" and 28" screens.I'm returning it because with my current setup I can't put my screens side by side without losing in depth.
5,Very tough son of a b****h love it. Everything is metal except for the wire cover. I really wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly supprised by how solid this thing is.
5,Definitely worth the money.  I would buy it again
5,Good design and very easy to use
2,J'utilise 2 écrans 27 près malheureusement je ne peux pas utiliser le support l'amplitude ne me permet pas de placer les écrans correctement Est ce possible de le retourner?
5,Can't ask for more
5,Top quality arms
4,You can't put 2 moniters touching
5,Really great mount all together
5,Good value for money
4,This is ok but in my view attaching two monitors on a two arm single point mount is always going to be slightly flawed as there are only so many places that the monitors will sit nicely together and you can be guaranteed that these won’t be quite where you need them.  Do yourself a favour and buy two separate pole mounts.
4,Giving this wall mount a 4-star review as I had an issue getting the up and down tilt to actually work. The allen bolt to adjust the gas strut is a good size and it allows you to tighten it enough in order to pick and choose exactly what height you want the monitor to sit whereas the up and down tilt is another story. The very small allen head is a pain to work with and 2 out of the 4 I could barely even get the allen wrench to fit in as the paint was laid too thick on the inside. Once you actually start to tighten the bolt you find yourself cranking on it as hard as you can to where the head either strips out or the monitors still sag. Keep in mind I have two Odyssey G5 curved monitors that weigh only 9lbs each and the company claims that each arm holds up to 17.6lbs so for it to still struggle to hold it at the right angle is very frustrating. I ended up having to drill a bigger hole through the bracket completely and running to Home Depot to stick a 13mm bolt through with a nut on the other side as you can see in the pictures. I am now able to tighten them enough to hold the monitors at the right angle without worrying about anything stripping out. Other than that the quality of the rest of the piece was great.
4,Great quality product with attention to detail.Pros:-Sturdy-Well Build-Cord organizers built in-Strong adjustable springs.Cons:- When you use the 27inch monitors you loose almost all your range of motion. The arms can hold them but the only adjustment you can make without them overlapping is up and down motion.
5,
5,Buen producto hace totalmente su función.
1,je fais le retour des demain le support ne tiens pas a la position demandé très déçus
5,Perfetto x la gestione di 2 monitor. Permette di posizionarli come si vuole
4,There's no mistaking that this item is solid and well built also relatively heavy. Following the instructions I located the wooden stud within the wall and marked the centre. The instructions then said to hold the unit against the wall hold a spirit level to the top and to mark your holes to drill doing this on my own was impossible as it's so heavy that there was no way I could hold it with one hand and mark with the other. My only other gripe was with the lag screws trying to use a screwdriver or impact driver on these was impossible I stripped all three screws even after drilling larger pilot holes than the instructions suggested I'd highly advise have an M6 socket or box spanner handy to get these into the wood.The adjustability is amazing! Up Down tilt twist left right. I did have to adjust the gas struts but not a big deal.
3,The build quality of these monitor arms are great it feels really sturdy and heavy duty. The whole thing is unfortunately let down by the fact that if your monitors are close to the wall they can't be directly next to each other. You have to pull them away from the wall a significant distance for this to the be the case and by then they are at the edge of the desk and right in front of your face. I have instead had to have them against the wall but far apart. It's a good thing I didn't but this for gaming!
4,PROS: Easy to assemble. I was able to install without the assistance of another person. Though having a second person would  have made  things  even easier.  I was initially concerned that this system would not be strong enough to house two 27”Monitors but once I mounted the bracket into the stud behind the drywall it did not budge! The screws and washers provided are super heavy duty. Very very  thick and provide excellent support! Also the instructions and tools provide are very easy to read and use with excellent step by step instructions.The build quality is surprisingly solid and the range of motion is excellent for all kinds of different layouts.  The Allan keys provide are excellent for fine tuning your layout and provide a quick and easy way of adjusting/ tightening things up.CONS:If you are new to mounting (as I am) you will need a 5/32 drill bit (4mm) to pre drill your 3 holes 55mm deep. This delayed my install until additional tools were acquired as I was under the impression that all I needed was a power drill and some screwdriver bits.The bracket for concealing wires are a bit finicky and do not seem to like thicker cables. I was able to fit two (power/display) on one bracket and 3 (power/display/hdmi) on the other. The trouble is the top brackets will pop out easily when moved which is slightly annoying. The bottom brackets are surprisingly stiff and difficult to place back into position once removed. You may need to use the but of as screw driver to lock it back in place after you’ve threaded your cables. I find the bottoms ones to be more secure due to the sliding mechanism below vs the clip in mechanism on top.Final Thoughts:Excellent product. Great value here. This is a good buy.
4,L ho utilizzata per posizionare a parete i miei 2 monitor da 28 pollici…la staffa è semplice da montare e permette parecchie regolazioni…unica pecca che per avere i 2 monitor vicini bisogna metterli parecchio in fuori dalla parete…se si cerca in installazione vicino alla parete coi 2 monitor vicini vicini non è L ideale
5,This is a great product. It was super easy to put together and mount. I use this everyday at home since home is now my office and it allows my to use a space as my office but also tuck the screens to the wall when I'm done and you don't even notice them anymore. With all arms like this it takes some tinkering to get the adjustments just right but once you get it they are perfect.
5,Bello robusto pratico.
4,hatte mir diese Halterung bestellt da ich meine beiden Monitore schön an die Wand hängen wollte. Allerdings habe ich dabei die Wand nicht gefragt. Als das Teil ankam schaute mein Mann mich an dann die Wand und meinte ob ich meinen Tisch in den Keller haben wollen würde denn im Büro haben wir nur Leichtbauwände. Das Ding an sich wiegt schon einiges und dann noch mit zwei Monitoren dran. Das wäre zu viel gewesen daher ging es leider zurück.Preis passt allerdings zur Qualität. Hätte es echt gern genutzt.
1,Disappointed with the quality control.  One of the screws that controls the tilt was stripped.  Other than that the product is good the reason for one star is that now I am stuck half way and not able to complete the project
5,Zur Montage sollte man zu zweit sein weil da Produkt ein gewisses Gewicht mit sich bringt und es allein schwer zu Händeln ist. Es wirkt sehr stabil.
5,erfüllt ihren zweck wie erwünscht.Ich habe die Halterung nicht mittig montiert sondern nach Rechts versetzt um so einen der 2 monitore gerade vor mir zu haben.Die Montage kann allein etwas kniffelig sein aber mit etwas Geduld klappt das problemlos.Ich habe Die Halterung mit 8x40er dübeln befestigt und damit hält sie meine 2 27 Zoll Bildschirme problemlos.bisher sehe ich keinen grund die viel teureren alternativen zu kaufen.
3,cant get both monitors to touch each other even tho theyre the same monitors this mount only works well if u mount it in a corner wasn't good for me..
5,Sturdiness 8.5/10Anti wobble 9/10Range 7/10Install 6/10Ease of use 8/10Needed wall arm for my second monitor realized a dual monitor arm setup was basically the same price in the cheap range and I am very content with this one rather impressed actually.Build quality is quite impressive to be honest wasn't expect that. Wall mounted so can't really say for the wobble but by manually shaking the arms and stuff it doesn't wobble much much less than a cheap monitor stand for sure.Install was alright I had trouble with my main monitor which's vesa mount is extruded 1" inwards. The vesa mount is rudimentary but solid. I suggest using a level of course.Range of motion is alright I wish it had more vertical range so I could have them sit more flush to the wall right now at max height they're sitting with visual interface at exactly 12" from the wall.Cable management works fine though my main monitor with power HDMI DP USB cable running down the arm wouldn't fit in the tiniest tray although it fit the wider one. Simply tiewrapped it to the arm no big deal that's not a problem for me.Thanks for making a very good and affordable product. I will say again I was impressed by this product.
2,The wiring covers are very small you can barely fit two cables into them and even then they constantly pop-off if you move the monitor or so much a breathe on it. Eventually I just stopped re-installing them.Range of motion isn't great as the arms tend to hit the wall right when you are almost to that "good" position. As a desk mounted system this probably worked fine but as a wall mounted system the arms simply don't have the right range of motion. The ability to telescope the arm or to slide the vesa mount side-to-side would help with this a lot. As it is after drilling some huge holes in my wall I feel that I am kinda stuck with this.
3,Die Qualität ist sehr gut und alles ist top verarbeitet! Jedoch kommt man recht weit von der Wand ab wenn man die Monitore direkt aneinander haben möchte! Solltet ihr einen schmalen Arbeitsplatz haben berechnet 25-30cm als Abstand von der Wand! Es könnten vllt noch ein paar cm rausgeholt werden wenn man mit einem Distanzklotz oder Balken arbeitet was warscheinlich nicht im Sinn des Erfinders ist!Könnte eventuell überarbeitet werden! Ansonsten ein sehr gutes Produkt!
2,Cable tray cracked on arrival.. not too happy so far.
5,Well built and sturdy used to mount 2x 27" monitors on the wall.  Make sure you have a stud where you want it otherwise it may be at the edge of your desk and you may have your monitors to far away from the wall or appart.  The wire handling is nice but my monitor power cables are to short to run in the  channels and still make it to outlet.  It would be nice if they had a 16" or 24"  cross extension so you hit two studs and than mount it anywhere on the wall you want.
4,This item is good quality for sure!  Very well built but it doesn’t seem to have very good range of motion. The 2 monitors sit quite far apart from each other and there doesn’t seem to be a way to adjust that.
4,Im Lieferungsumfang sind der Arm selbst und die für die Montage benötigen Schlüssel ordnungsgemäß und ordentlich verpackt. Bei der Montage selbst empfehle ich eine zweite Person hinzuzuholen da dass dann doch eine ziemliche Fummelarbeit war. Das Teil ist sehr robust und hält 2x 27 Zoll Monitore Mühelos oben am Arm selbst ist der Gasdruck entsprechend leicht und mühelos einzustellen.
5,It is pretty good the only thing I wish it had was a paper diagram so I can line up the holes easier
5,Works and looks way better than pictures. Got rid of my table mount and this is just totally worth it
5,Sencillo de montar. Incluye todos los tornillos necesarios para montarlo en la pared y para colocar los monitores en los soportes.Tiene un aspecto sólido y permite el movimiento de las dos pantallas manteniéndolas en la posición deseada. El soporte Vesa permite colocar el monitor sin dificultad.
5,happy with it will see how it lasts
3,Moves up and down well turning is good also. Only complaint is it does not move backwards or forward easily. There’s no option to loosen it so it can do that.
2,Maybe just a dud but one of the struts is shot and cannot lift the monitor
5,Easy to mount decent range and sturdy. Holds two 24” Dell p2427 with ease. Hard to beat for the price.
4,Parfait pour mes écran 27" & 24"
4,Work great so far.
5,So far so good!
5,Support facile à installer.Visserie pour 2 écrans fournie.Seul bémol  l'article est parti d'Italie pour remonter sur Paris (1385 kms) puis livré chez moi (250kms). Pas très écologique 😲Il faudrait savoir d'où provient notre achat pour mieux choisir
5,I use this to mount a 27 inch and 24 inch monitor. The built quality is amazing. I 100% recommends this product
5,le recensioni lette mi lasciano sempre dubbioso sui prodotti che voglio comprare devo dire che la qualità è notevole robusto (ho attaccato 2 monitor da 27"). mi sarebbe piaciuta una maschera da applicare al muro per segnare la posizione dei fori per i tasselli. i bracci sono pesanti e due persone per il lavoro sono consigliate
5,Leichte Montage einfach zum einstellen und hält Bombenfest
5,Rapporto Qualità-Prezzo incredibile! uno dei migliori in assoluto. Facile e veloce da montare qualità dei materiali di alto livello e robustezza unica. Ottimo prodotto! Molto snodabile e facile da utilizzare e modificarne la posizione. Utilizzato per due monitor curvi da 27 pollici
1,Installed the monitor arm for 2x 27" monitors. Seems that to align the monitors they have to be very very far away from the wall. Feels like the arm is missing an elbow. They also don't fold in on themselves it leaves the monitor very far away from the wall. Despite this if you're happy with the monitor some distance from the wall the build quality is good and the sturdiness is good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Es un producto de 10 se nota resistente y de calidad. Muy satisfecho de momento.
5,Like: sturdy design good range of adjustmentDislike: 10" gap between monitors when pushed close to wall when close together they are about 16" forward of the wall.
1,Wahrscheinlich ist das auf eindn Materialfehler zu schieben. Da alles richtig befestigt wurde. Der 2. Monitor hällt perfekt..
5,Very strong and easy to install.
4,Aimé
4,This monitor wall mount is good. I was able to install it fairly easily even though one of the screen would not stay upright at first. I contacted the seller which sent me back the defective part twice. It was very quick allowing me to finish my installation in a timely manner. My only gripe with this wall-mount is that I am unable to put the 2 screen right next to each other because of the design of the mount. The best way to mount them is to have them with a space between them as shown in the image which is not what I wanted in the first place. If you don't mind that I don't think you can go wrong with this mount considering the very good customer service that comes with it.
5,Very good product!!
4,Need more depth if arranged as I showed in photo. Made a L bracket to let it sit on the top of the desktop
1,Takes way too much space and absolutely impossible to return.  I’ve been waiting a week for courier to pickup w continuously no showing when they they sent out tracking saying driver was on the way….avoid the headache!
5,It's heavier than I expected definitely recommend two people setting this up
5,Works well seems solid good value for the price.
1,The directions about how to tighten it to keep the arms straight were not matching with what was actually happening. Which led to me breaking it and voiding any return now. 60 bucks down the drain. I am tired of buying from these companies whose names are just a word salad of letters that is unpronounceable. Yes the product is cheap but it's exactly that cheap. Will do my best to not buy from this company anymore.
5,Libère la place de travail du bureau et malléable
5,I like this
4,Built it mock-up monitors out of cardboard and hand it in your garage or on a wall you can practice on to figure out the range of motion and angles.  Nice product
5,Easy to install works well.
5,Super produit. tres robuste
5,Mount works perfect for holding two 24" monitors. Very impressed with ease of install. I actually have four monitors and use two of these.
5,Easy to assemble move and adjust
