5,I've been looking for a pen that actually works on my Envy! I can't believe how well this pen worked (it can actually write legibly with minimal lag) and I'm glad I decided to make this purchase. (My only regret is not buying the rechargeable version but I can always switch over after this product breaks. lol)Although there aren't any directions on how to use the buttons you will eventually figure it out after some playing around: The button closer to the tip can be used for clicking and the one further away can be used to highlight. (Of course the function changes a little bit depending on the app you have open).
5,Excellent stylus for 1/4 the price!It works perfectly and I could not be happier.Save yourself money and get the job done.
5,It writes like a regular pencil. It’s compatible with my Microsoft Go 2. It does come with replacement tips. The buttons can be confusing to use or know what they do. When writing it’s easy to accidentally press them.
5,Works really well with my Surface laptop!
4,Good
5,Haven't had issues since I purchased it. its links up great!  it works awesome.  I purchased the Microsoft pen twice and still wouldn't work.. so disappointed... but this pen works great for half the cost.  no magnet but I have the microsoft protector and it holds the pen nicely.  The pen does what I need it to do.. I am sure there are way finely sharper faster pens but for the price it works great!
5,Great pen for a fraction of the cost of a first party but with the same features and quality. Appreciate that it comes with several replacement tips.
4,Useful for large-scale manipulations (dragging images around and resizing) but give up the dream of handwriting with it. It's not that kind of stylus.
5,I love how easy it was to use I really don't like how I can't tell when I need to charge the pen though.
5,Great value for $10 (it was $10 when I bought it). I have no idea how it works but it's better than my surface pro 4 pen (barely any jitter with no loss in pressure sensitivity). It works with the touch screen disabled - my pro 3's touch screen went out so I had to disable it in order for the PC to run properly but the pen still works on it. I can switch between my pro 3 and my surface book 2 without an issue - just tap and go. My surface pro 4 pen just died one day - no amount of trouble shooting would fix it and I didn't want to pay like $80 for a new pen or whatever it is they cost. It is weird because you don't have to connect this pen at all no bluetooth just start drawing with it. Kind of sketched out by that but by god it just works so it's great in a pinch.Only downside imo is that it's non magnetic. I loved being able to clip my pen to my tablet or to my pegboard on my desk. I have to store it in a pen tray/cup to avoid losing it now. It takes the same battery as a surface pen as well so no loss/change there if you've already got the batteries (which I have a ton of because I was trying to get my old pen to work and I thought my batteries might have been the problem).
3,I brought this for a Microsoft Surface Pro &.The delivery was on time.  It was ell packaged and appeared like an excellent product comfortable to hold as a pen. In spite of multiple attempts to pair it with  the Microsoft Surface it  would recognize only as an unidentified Pen  and could never get paired had to return it. The return was very easy. Will try to order another brand and see if that works.
5,I bought the Microsoft surface pro 7 last year and after purchasing the keyboard and everything else I did not want to spend $100 for a “Microsoft brand name” stylus. I did a bunch of research and decided I would try this one. I am a college student and constantly take notes and write on my surface pro. This pen has been perfect for everything I’ve needed! There are multiple tips that you can put on it depending on how thin or thick you want your line it senses how hard you are pushing to make the line thicker or thinner and it never has to be charged. It comes with a battery to put in it and since purchasing it in September of last year I have not had to change it once. It automatically connects to my screen when I am using it and does not read my fingers/hand unless I remove the stylus from the screen so I can rest my hand on the screen without any problems. Each of the buttons work perfectly. One is for erasing and the other is for “right clicking”. Overall it has been perfect I cannot recommend this stylus more!
5,I’m glad that affordable replacement options like this exist. My 80 dollar surface pro 7 pen magically stopped working (after 6 months of use) three days before a research paper was due. First world problems bleh I know… but I use the pen to annotate and highlight literally hundreds of pages a week for graduate school. I’ll air my grievances about that garbage pen over on their Amazon page but it literally felt like I’d lost a limb lmao. School demands do not cease to exist when/if technology fails. This cheap alternative was delivered the very next day. I like the weight distribution on it better… but I miss the magnetic attachment. That aside this saved my life and will likely get me through the remaining 7 weeks of my degree. Eventually I’ll switch back to the Microsoft Pen when/if I can afford to throw away 80 dollars every 6 months. Until then you can buy three of these and still wind up paying less! If it happens to poop out in the next couple of months I won’t be NEAR as upset as I was about the Microsoft pen.
4,I like this.  However this is my 2nd one of the same product within 3 months.  My 14 yo son uses this for his school-issued surface and I had already gotten him a replacement before and it broke again so I needed to purchase another one.  I am not entirely sure what he did to break the first two but it would be great if the product could be sturdy.
1,I don't like an aluminum body now that I see it won't attach to the laptop like the last one using the magnet feature.  I would not have picked it had I known this.  At this point it's not serving a useful feature and can just scratch stuff in addition to hampering grip.  If I put a little lotion on my hands it just slips around my hand.  I took a long time to decide on this type and did so because of the rounded tip.  Thus I deducted another star when I received it and found that the replacement tips which I thought would be good to have around are not the same.  That seems wrong.  Next point of irritation I put in the battery it came with and my computer says the battery only has 22%.  So before I got to use it I already ended up irritated with the device.  I should also mention that directions are poor.  I logged into Amazon to look at the order in order to find out what the buttons do because that was not in the directions so I figured I'd write this review while I'm here.  I have one big issue that nags me pertaining to pairing.  As soon as I plugged in the battery it started working and my comptuer recognized it.  I didn't have to tell my comptuer it was my device.  IS THAT A CONCERN MY BRAIN SAID?  MAYBE SOMEONE KNOWS...I'm going to ask around but because of this I may just return it.  I think I should have given it permission to be on my computer first which I did not.  I was trying to figure out how to do that by coming on Amazon and looking around to see if anyone posted information.  There was nothing about that in the directions.  I just realized it was working and thought "huh that doesn't seem like a good thing."  There was nobody else around me with which I could check if they had access to it too but I won't be leaving it paired.  Sadly the more I read over what I wrote I can't think of a strong positive thus I can't think of a good reason to go through the trouble of keeping it.  I like the tip it had installed but I don't want to get used to it and not have the same replacement tips so the only good thing is actually not such a good thing.I am editing this response to include this:  I downrated to 1 star after email exchanges with the seller which proved to be a waste of my time.  I was contacted by the seller and replied to explain my concerns and ask for information.  I was essentially told to trust that everything is fine with this product regarding my security risk.  I feel this is insulting and wasteful of my time.  They asked to assist with my concerns just to provide no useful information.  I informed that I told my computer to "forget" the device due to concerns of leaving it connected and that the pen did not pair again afterwards.  I informed of steps I took to get to reconnect which did not work.  The reply from the seller did not even acknowledge my raising the issue that I didn't have a functioning pen.Edit again:  4/2020.  I was contacted by the company and offered money to remove my review.  I will not as I think this is wrong.  I chose instead to report it here.  They said they appreciated my comments and have enacted changes though couldn’t bother to provide details if what was changed.  The email to me was poorly composed showing to me lack of interest in communicating clearly an issue I raised originally.
4,All in all this is a great pen for the price I would be hard pressed to find another one. It came right out of the box and all I had to do was insert the provided battery couldn't be easier. That being said while it works great the one problem I have with it is the fact that the palm rejection doesn't work until the tip of the pen is touching the screen which means you need to hold the pen against lay your hand down and then continue. This can make for small dots or lines depending on what you are working on. I have never used a pen before this one so maybe this is a common issue or simply unavoidable with given technology.  Everything considered I would buy this product again.
5,Easy to use programmable buttons and extra pieces.
5,I use three Microsoft Surfaces in my home: 4th gen 6th gen and a Surface Book 3.  This pen works with all of them.  My kids use the oldest Surface for their chore lists homework and digital art.  We. go. through. pens.  This one is affordable and has all the features we need.  At first it was a little weird to get used to this pen not having an eraser at the back like Microsoft brand pens do.  However this pen erases when you click the button rather than when you invert it.  I think I actually prefer how this one is designed over the Microsoft brand.  I definitely prefer the price point!
5,Used mainly for school activity and works great. Definitely recommend this pen.
5,My daughter uses an MS Surface device for school but they didn’t give her the stylus that goes with it.  The surface device cannot use just any stylus and needs the one that is made to go with it in order to work properly.  It was important for us to get the right one because the school no longer uses paper and pencil to write out math problems All written work is done exclusively via the surface device.  I did a search and found that the OEM stylus is much more expensive.  So after looking at Amazon at multiple options and checking reviews we decided to try the Uogic pen.  Her device type was listed as functional with this one so we bought it. It came promptly and works perfectly with the device.  I recommend this product for use with the Microsoft surface device.  Just check which version of the MS Surface you have and make sure it is listed as compatible with this stylus.
5,Way better then my surface pen thank you.
3,Thought it was defective  so I got it replaced. Both worked with my surface pro neither worked with surface laptop as advertised.I updated from a 1 star because it does work with the pro. But I purchased specifically for the laptop and the description said it was compatible. It doesn't work at all with the surface laptop
4,I can't compare this to the official Microsoft active pen but it works good. Sometimes it's not very accurate however and it becomes even less accurate after calibration. It becomes less accurate on corners and sides. So I erased the calibration settings. Other than that it does it's job properly.
4,As a surface user I have been looking for a good stylus that works well without breaking the bank. Having lost the one that cam with my surface I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a replacement. I also didn't want to skimp on quality either so enters the Uogic Surface Pen. This is a good replacement at a good price. It feels good in your hand as it has a rounded barrel - much like the pens you are used to. Its light weight  and its two buttons are comfortable to use as you are working. If you are looking to use the erase feature from a more expensive pen or want it to be magnetized so you can have it attach to your surface this is not the pen for you. It pares easily with the surface and I have found it to be very easy to use.
5,I bought it because I needed a replacement for school they didn't accept it but it definitely works!
3,Just as said
5,The button closest to the pen tip is for erasing any sketch the button above it is to use the lasso tool. Just these functions are enough to continue writing notes for four hours straight. I completely love this pen. Works how it should in the simplest form!
2,The pen worked well when I first purchased it. I was able to use it very easily with minor issues. I was disappointed when a few months in it just randomly stopped working. I tried replacing the battery and it still would not write anymore. Now it's useless. I'm very disappointed considering that I really enjoyed the pen when it was working.
5,I got this product so I would be able to write notes on PDFs and easily navigate the screen. The pen is incredible accurate and works like I am writing on paper. It doesn't cause breaks in my letter like other stylus pens might and works seamlessly. Additionally it is easy to erase mistake by simply clicking one of the buttons on the pen. I didn't even have to try to pair it with my computer or anything its so compatible that your computer just understands what your trying to do without having to deal with any settings or installation. Simply just got the pen put the battery in and it started working perfectly.
5,I use the pen for my surface pro mostly for drawing. It’s easy to use and I’m happy with the product because it delivers what it promises.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I got this pen to use with my laptop; which also doubles as a tablet if I want it to. It took me a minute to figure out the right clicking the pen has to be touching the screen where you want to right click and then click the button on the pen. None the less the pen works exceptionally well. It also came with the battery. It feels comfortable to hold in my hand. It’s made drawing and writing and signing my name on my laptop exceptionally easy. It was pretty mind blowing using it for the first time. I could have used this pen a long time ago. But I’m so glad I have it now.
5,This works great and is affordable
4,This pen is comparable if not better than a Microsoft pen for a fraction of the price. It does not however have a clickable eraser with programmable actions. This seems well worth avoiding the rediculous premium on the Microsoft pen and I would recommend this product.
1,Firstly for those with issues about Bluetooth security or recognition this is NOT BT enabled! I believe it's written to reflect that but could change depending on time and post. It connects like a regular stylus.Moving on...I get my new pen quickly. I used the battery it came with first. Surface pro recognized it immediately. Seemed okay for point and click/selection purposes but then I got into a detailed art project...which is literally the reason I purchased this! It immediately started lagging and then not registering at all for several tries making my work nearly impossible to do. So I replaced the battery with no improvement. Then I tried two more batteries. Now it's simply not registering at all period.If you purchase this pen and leave a positive review please try using it to do something that it is made to do...the whole point behind using something than an average stylus...before your return period has passed. You will be sorely disappointed if you wait only to lose out on $30-$35.Also the two extra nibs it comes with are NOT the soft tip nibs as the one already installed. This is a drawback but not a deal breaker if the damn thing worked properly! Oh and yes I tried both of them just to cover my bases.No it's not magnetic and won't stick to the side of your surface. This was a non-issue as I have a case with a pen holder and it is in the description that it is not magnetic.Because it takes a day or few after they receive the item back to send my refund I am going to opt for a replacement out of convenience. Honestly I do not expect anything to be different but I will be updating my review to reflect the replacement process and product.For now though if you are looking for a pen worthy of what the Surface pro has to offer spend the extra cash and get the overpriced-should have come with it-MS pen.
4,It’s great for the cost but the buttons don’t work at all like an actual Microsoft Surface pen. The way I understood it you could use the buttons and then erase with the eraser but that part doesn’t work (or didn’t work for me at least). Still I’ve had two Microsoft Pens now and they just don’t seem to last that long so I’ve got high hopes for this one
3,I'm definitely going to keep this as a backup but honestly it doesn't compare to the brand name surface pen which I guess can be expected for a cheaper model. It doesn't erase on the top like the surface pen even though it looks like it in the pics. Instead it erases with buttons on the side which I constantly accidently press while trying to write because they're right where you grip the pen. Additionally it doesn't write as smoothly and sometimes little lags and gaps in my writing appear though that's only occasionally. Also while it doesn't bother me becaus my case has a pen holder it is important to note it's not magnetic in case anyone particularly likes that feature. Honestly I'd rather save up for Microsoft's version.
5,Sensitivity is much better than my old one but I have to take a star off for easy to use because I find the buttons to be hard to distinguish. I accidentally press the wrong button all the time. I feel the design would be better if the buttons were raised.
2,OK. Would be perfect if the tip was tighter. And had rechargeable batteries
4,It connected to my surface pro 6 immediately and the nib isn't pointy like my last one was
5,Not a direct replacement. It doesn't have the purple one note button thing but otherwise has all the desires functions and feels close to the original.
3,Thr pen was easy to use: insert battery and just use it on your screen. The accuracy can be spotty at times but it's not a large issue. I dropped the pen and the tip broke. It still can work on the screen but the accuracy/feeling of writing is off
3,it is usable. better than nothing
5,It worked first time as soon as I opened it it connected.
2,I bought this pen based on Amazon's suggestion and some of the reviews but my pen stopped working after less than a year.  I have to buy a new one already!  I strongly suggest you do not buy this pen!
3,Microsoft Surface Pro 8
3,The only issue is accidentally pressing the erase or select buttons on the pen when trying to write. It kind of gets annoying.
5,Well first of all i bought it for the price. Less expensive that the real one. So I decided to trust the others reviews i read...And i am so happy it is juste like the real one. I did not test every single spec but as soon as i insert the battery the pen was working very well without doing anything with my surface pro 7.
5,Compared to the original Microsoft pen  I think this is a good quality and good price for it. Glides so well very smooth. I love it
3,My old pen broke so I decided to buy this one.  With the decent price but the pen didn’t have magnetic peace included… it was hard to keep it with the laptop.  The pen works okay but I would look for another one
5,Seems accurate and works well on my Surface 3
5,love this so amazing's just what i wanted for Graphic drawing ill Recommend this Product
4,Works well didn't come with any directions on how to change the tips
4,The pen is overall a good deal for the price. It has a nice feel when holding and operating the pen.What I dislike about the pen is that it sometimes disconnects for no reason. What I wish the product came with is a case to keep the pen protected when not in use.
5,Bought this to replace the lost microsoft pen for my husband.  He says he prefers the weight/balance on this one better than the microsoft version (though his was older they could have upgraded) but he did say the stylus tip was a little better on the old one but not worth the extra cost of getting the name brand.  Save yourself some money on this!  Works and feels great!
3,The pen stopped writing within the first few hours of using it.
4,It’s actually really good!
4,I like the idea that I can change the battery an not have to buy a new one every time the internal battery dies. It handles great an I can do everything I did with the original Microsoft pen I got when I bought my surface at half the price.
3,Do not like the fact that the pen does not always work.  A lot of times I have to touch three or more time to get a response.  Sometimes nothing happen and I have to use my finger to make it happen.
5,Easily synced and intuitive use. Pen is well balanced and functions as well the Microsoft pen.
5,Exelente
4,Should have come with instructions but support online helped me figure it out. Great product one you figure it out. Responsive and sturdy
4,Great substitute for the really expensive Surface Pro pens. A lot cheaper too. Battery has since died though so I need to figure out how to replace it
4,This pen is great with my Surface Pro. The one thing I didn't consider when buying a pen is that it doesn't have the magnetic strip the standard pen has. You also don't have the eraser button on top (it is the second button on the tip) and does not function as an eraser. If you want these features this pen is not for you.
5,This pen worked right out of the box. Doesn't have bluetooth so it doesn't require any setup. It's about 1/4 of the cost of a Microsoft pen so if you're looking for something a lot less expensive this is what you need.
4,It connects by itself to the surface pro 7 and works very well the only con is that for some programs (Xodo docs) the hand isn't  recognized and sometimes erases what was written with the pen. Otherwise it works great for sketching!
4,I like the pen and it work great I used it for two days but then the pen stop working. I first I thought it was the battery but I checked again and the battery is fine. Sooooo i actually don't know.
5,For onenote users you can press the side button to use the rubber function.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Really good for the price. Highly recommend for digital artists (anyone really I just use it mostly for art) using this on their Surface Go (mine is a Surface Go 2). Havent had any issues at all got here really fast.
5,This is my first Surface Pro Pen and I found it quite simple to setup following the included directions. I bought it for a singular purpose and for this it works quite well. I use it with Akai MPC Music software for a much more accurate touch device than my fingers as well as for inputting and deleting notes. For this use the device works FLAWLESSLY. I simply turned the Surface Pro on put the battery in and like magic the Pen worked with MPC Studio 2.7 I’m a happy camper.
4,Easy to use and great to get to those fine points on my Surface Go 2; however I would like to see this pen improved to a strong magnetic connection with my Surface. Although I enjoy this cool pen!
5,Works very well with the surface go.
5,As a college student you are always on your computer and are in need of drawing or creating things for classes. After losing my original pen I bought this one. I should have bought this one right away because it was cheaper and works just as good as the original pen I bought at Best Buy for like $100. You’re way better off buying this than spending so much more elsewhere. 10/10.
4,Works like the pricey Microsoft pens . I use it for my Microsoft 5 Windows Pro . My only dislike is that the magnet inside the pen doesn’t hold well onto my laptop to hold the pen in place .
4,Relying on the battery to connect to magnetic side of the surface wear connection
1,It doesn't let you write continuously without breaks in the lines. I made video and shared customer service they didn't help with replacement. I have this pen lying with me with almost no use.I take lot of notes during work and expected this pen to improve that experience on my surface laptop. But with some many breaks in letter I'd prefer to use my phone with stylus.Two stars just for ease of use part of this product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 If you are like me and in search of a stylus that would work well with your Galaxy Book Flex Alpha look no further this is it. Works well doesn't skip and has palm rejection. I was this 👌🏾 to refunding my Flex and this pen saves my purchase.
5,i have a surface go pro 2. its pretty compatible with it. writes well. right click and eraser works. its not as heavy as the real microsoft stylus pen but its pretty good for me. i go to med school and i find this pen very helpful with anatomy and physiology homework.
5,Automatically connects. I was told at the store that off brands would not work with Microsoft surface pro. The guy was trying to make a sell and I would have been out of 100.00 dollars on the name brand. This pen is awesome and works very well. The only difference it doesn’t have a magnet to stick to the surface pro like a Microsoft pen does. I can live without the magnet for 60.00 something dollars cheaper. Works GREAT!
4,Magnet could be better. It doesn’t magnetize to my surface book 2.
4,I can’t figure out the buttons on the side. For some reason they won’t work for me but other than that it’s works nicely for touchscreen
4,my only issue with this stylus is that it feels too sleek. I have a hard time gripping the pen and sometimes it will slid through my fingers
5,I ordered this stylus for my daughter's Surface Pro 7 and it works great!
3,Not a terrible product but the minor annoyances are too much to overcome for my taste. A little laggy not as precise as a surface pen and overall lower quality. No magnet to attach to the device.Not a bad product for the price just not for detailed or quick note writing.
4,Its good but not exactly what I expected. I should have read the description more closely.
4,If you have a device that doesn't come with a pen like some of the smaller surfaces and you're just getting started with drawing this is a good inexpensive starting pen.
3,Cheap and affordable but will cost you to lose functionality and accuracy. There are two buttons on the pen that are not programable. Their function is to erase and select only. The button placement is perfect for me but the reactivity of the buttons is where it falls short especially for the erase button. While holding the button and moving your pen on the area you want to erase it will also leave unintended marks on your area making erasing a hassle. Other than that the tool itself is quite accuarate when it comes to writing.
5,This pen is amazing. It is very durable and is great quality!
1,This pen pairs with my Surface Pro but after a few months of using it it doesn't draw anymore. The cursor moves along the screen but doesn't draw or select anything! Moreover it will delete or select drawings in OneNote but cannot draw anymore.
1,I need a pen to be precise on my surface computer.  It ran out of battery so quickly.  I thought maybe my battery is old.  I bought new ones.  It turned out to be the same.  I had one before.  This is a trash. It is not accurate and difficult to use.  I was on vacation and passed by the return date.  Otherwise I would have returned it. Now I  have to throw it away
5,I bought this for my 15 year old daughter who does a lot of graphic drawing. She said she loves it she feels that it is "more sturdy" than the Microsoft pen. Plus for the price it can't be beat!
5,Works right out of the box once you put in the battery.  Battery install is quick and easy.  Performs well and is easy to use.  Took a bit to learn how to use it ( 20 minutes) but is easy to figure out.  I have had zero negative issues with it so far.  Highly recommend.
2,The pen was good for when it worked about a month after I bought it the glue from the cap fell off. A few months later the pen stopped working when using it the pen it would automatically trigger both shortcut buttons rapidly rendering it useless. I have never dropped the pen or know of any damage that it has received. Any issues that would arise I would end up needing to troubleshoot it myself.In Conclusion: This is a very nice pen however the battery it came with lasted longer than the actual pen. The accessibility to support with this is very very minimal due to the official microsoft product support that shows up in searches. The OS was made to work best with the official surface pro pen and it shows 100 times over. I will be getting an official pen next.
5,I like to my surface for drawing and drafting and the pen allows for a smooth draw and response.
5,I do love it tho. Much better than a mouse in my opinion.
5,This worked great with my children’s Microsoft surface laptop for school!!
5,Works just as advertised.
1,I chose to ignore all of the one star reviews for this product and much to my dismay(though I shluldnt have been surprised) this product fell short of the bar. My Surface Pro 7+ could connect to this pen but it wouldn't write. The erase and right click functions worked absolutely flawlessly but when I would go to write with it the cursor would just follow the pen. It would not write at all. About 1 in every 30 taps on the screen with the pen would register and make a dot but otherwise it wouldn't write. Do yourself a MASSIVE favor and don't make the same mistake I did. I had it for less than an hour before I filed the return papers with Amazon. Heed the 1 star reviews and DO NOT buy this product.
3,It's a good pen but I always have connection issues with it. Feels a little less sensitive than the official Surface Pen. But once I get drawing with it it's easy to get used to.
1,My order did not come with extra tips as described. There were places for extra tips but none included.
5,I got two of these pens to use on multiple surface pros.  So far they have worked well.
5,I love this pen for my surface pro laptop! It’s great to draw notes with or just to click around. It’s accurate and easy to use! Love it.
5,This pen works great with my surface. I use it for school and I absolutely love it
4,Works amazing.
4,Works well!
3,Fells great butt the buttons are in a bad place
1,The tip fell off of my pen after one use and now I can’t use it
1,my original surface pen all of sudden stopped working within a year and the customer service from Microsoft is literally non responsive. I felt frustrated and started searching alternates in the amazon and decided to buy this pen due to lots of good reviews. The bottom-line is this pen is a piece of crap...literally I  am always not sure whether the pen is  connected successfully or not and the functions advertised here is very limited...most functions are literally not working for my surface pro 7.  I am not sure if they sent me faulty pen though because  it was working for a while....1500h batter life? No way to prove. This pen is  not intuitively designed...probably this is what you get for amount of money that you paid.  this is a worst $30 that I spent in my life. I am going to deal with Microsoft customer service or get another genuine surface pen.
5,this was super easy to set up is accurate and simple to use. Very very happy with my purchase
5,Great Product works perfectly fine with my pro surface 4 tablet! I draw alot on my tablet and it works great! I recommend getting it!
5,Connected with my IPRO tablet with ease and accuracy.  Good on a touchscreen. Works well.
5,Seriously this is just as good in my opinion. Considering the price i think its BETTER than the real pen. I lost my pen and i angsted over buying a new one but this one is perfect and i didn't have to sell my soul for it.
5,This pen functions just as advertised I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice working and feeling Surface Pen.
3,Well I didn’t know that it need a pen tip replacement tool to take the tip out. So the tip won’t come out and now it’s broken lol. I ordered one that came with the tool. Works well just don’t forget the replacement tool if you buy this one.
2,Did work the one time used….however went to change tip and it fell apart.  Was not able to put back together.
2,The pen will be detected by the surface but will not actually “click” and will not draw using other functions. Just buy the MicroSoft Version.
4,Works out of the box no need to pair or anything. Just works. Specially liked doing vision with this.
5,But at this price that's a good trade-off.
5,It is easy to use feels better in my hand than the original Microsoft pen.  It has a clip on the pen to hang on to my pocket like a pen.  I had an original Microsoft surface pen that broke after two weeks of use.  This is definitely better.
2,Using on windows surface laptop. Pen doesn’t work well on touchscreen doesn’t fill in colors and 90% of the time drawing feature doesn’t work. Will purchase from a different seller.
4,Using it since last one and half month no issue so far
5,I love that it works just like the surface pen with just half the price. I definitely enjoy using it and recommend to other surface users who don’t wish to spend almost $80 for a Microsoft bar and surface pen.
3,one soft tip and the others are hard plastic tips. no button at the top. thats fake. (i wanted the clicker button). And it seems to be off center compared to my other one... Id rather have my other cheapy pen lol
5,Perfect pen for my Samsung galaxy Notebook alpha laptop that doesn’t come with a pen. Love that one click allows me to erase without having to go into the computer settings to do so.
4,Could use an on-off switch and much better instructions for use. Otherwise it works well with Surface 7.
5,Works great and at a great price
5,This pen works as well as the original! I’m impressed! And for the price you really can’t go wrong. Love it!
2,it started fine but the longer I used it the less responsive it got. I thought it was an issue with the batteries so I replaced them but still the stylus works randomly. there'd be times where it would work without problem but more often than not I have to wait a bit of time before the stylus decides to respond to where I am pointing.
5,This pen does a great job when drawing. Easy to use right out the box. No lag at all.
3,It was patchy against the screen. So it wasn’t smooth if I was trying to draw something.
2,It will start writing and then stop it’s extremely frusterating
4,Shy of the original pen but still a great product
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have a HP Pavillion x360 convertible and it works awesome!! I have been using it for 2 weeks and haven’t come across any problems.
5,Exactly what we were looking for. Writes on touch screen great. Great for drawing.
1,Don't say I didn't warn you... I’m not going to tell you to go out and buy an original Microsoft pen because the price is ABSURD but I will tell you to find another alternative other than this one. First of all it’s not magnetic. DEAL BREAKER right there! How could they not make it magnetic? Secondly there is no LED light to pair it with my Surface. Really? It connects to your Surface without even asking. The problem here is my Son has a surface also so it kept connecting to his. VERY ANNOYING!!! Another thing is the erasure tip doesn't push in. You have to use one of the 2 buttons on the side of the pen. Are you kidding me??? With these issues alone it was getting returned regardless of how it actually wrote on my Surface. Thats how bad this pen is. It didn't even touch my Surface and I put it back in the box. DO NOT BUY!!!
5,The stylus was easy to use.  Plug and play with little to no need for training.  I use it for online white board instruction and it is great.
5,Nice simple and practical.
5,The first one never made it due to delivery but the one that came worked really well. Although it doesn't operate exactly as the surface pro pen it works very well! Accurate for writing and easy to operate
4,Smooth writing
5,Great pen really like that the button near the stylus is the erase button instead of like others where you have to hit the button on the bottom.
5,Works perfectly great value for the price
5,Product easy to use & cost effective
5,Works with my surface pro 7 just fine no issues!
5,Worked well with my Surface .
3,It started out working great but after three weeks stopped working. Tried to change the battery but that didn’t help. Needed to return
5,Nothing to dislike. Identical functionality at a fraction of the price.
5,This was a birthday gift for my son. He loves it and said it works great!
5,Love it!!
5,Got this for my husband’s surface Pro and he is so glad I did. The pen works great is easy to use and he uses it all the time.
5,Very Happy with product and good service
3,Didn't realize that unlike the original stylus this doesn't have the magnet to attach to the tablet... Otherwise works great.
5,Looks high quality works perfectly on my Microsoft Surface Book.  And the clip keeps it from rolling off the desk unlike the other lo-cost generic pen.
4,But it works fine.
2,Took a chance with this Lightning Deal on a replacement Pen for my Surface Pro 3 since I lost a nib in the original. Pen arrived quickly with Prime shipping. Unfortunately this pen turned out to be too low quality to be useful for art. It often would skip during drawing or the connection would cut out while being used. No eraser feature. Wound up returning it within a couple days for a refund and buying a different brand.
1,Update: after months of using it it's trash. It's constantly trying to right click so you can't use it worth squat for anything. it wasn't me abusing it it did a little bit out of the package and it's only gone downhill from there. Would not recommend at all.Original review:Pros:It feeIs just like my (old but functional) surface pen most of the time.It cost me ~ $30.Looks pretty similar.The 2 buttons it does have work as expectedCons:It doesn't have the top buttonRandomly right clicks during use. Means that it erases stuff that I'm working on. :(Overall I might not recommend it because of the right click issue but maybe I just got a defect.
5,Pen doesn't require a bluetooth connection. Writes a little bit thinner than the microsoft surface pen but I just increased the font thickness to make up for that. Overall works great!
1,Could not get it to work with my Surface Go laptop.
5,Love this pen it is perfect for the Microsoft go and is way cheaper comes with both replacement tips and a battery
5,As described
5,This pen is amazing and it works so well.
5,Nice
1,Do not buy this pen. It says that it will work right out of the package and this is not the case. I tried to then pair it through Bluetooth and that did not work either. Moreover it is only a two-button pen and what appears to be a button on the back of the pen where an eraser typically is with a normal pencil is only a design and not actually a button. As I was trying to pair this pen to my Surface Pro 7 my Pro 7 forgot my old pen I was trying to replace and now I'm having issues with that one.Do yourself a favor and do NOT purchase this product. I will be returning for sure.
2,from reading reviews  this pen is not as good as expected. it's not accurate when I try to write wit it sometimes it doesn't work right. very disappointed with this pick
5,It does exactly what it’s supposed to! No complaints here.
5,Works great
5,Works just as well as the Microsoft brand.I have a surface laptop and I love being able to use the pen to take notes.
5,The product was delivered extremely quickly and was exactly what I ordered and needed.
1,As many other reviews have mentioned the pen is easy to get started with as all you have to do is to install the battery and it works with the Surface. However I found it to have a few issues. I couldn't seem to get the right click feature to do anything noticeably different and as you bring the stylus to the screen it begins moving the cursor but it wouldn't line up accurately until touching the screen.Ultimately I wouldn't recommend this to someone trying to write math problems on their screens as was the intention with my purchase. Might work for something less precise than that.
5,works really well
1,Doesn't even hold a candle to any of the Microsoft Surface Pens. Do not waste your time with this product. Very poor tracking and general function
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works better then I expected
5,Absolutely perfect.  With extra tip. Very precise.  Have marked to buy again
5,Easy to use. Syncs with Surface Pro.
5,It works!
1,I did not like this pen. It stopped working after two months for no reason.  I changed batteries in case that was the issue but even with new batteries it will not work at all. It is very disappointing.
1,Would give it zero stars if I could. Honestly it is not worth it I read in a previous review that they send out defective ones once in a while and that was my case. Once I revived it I was very excited to start using it out of the box but as soon as I put the battery in it worked for about a minute then goes off. I’ve bought batteries thinking that was the case and it is not. Now I have to go through the refund process. Save your money there is better dupes READ THE REVIEWS
5,Worked when I turned it on!
5,The quality of product. So far quality of product is great!
5,Light weight but solid feel. Works as advertised. I'd definitely recommend this as a great addition to any surface laptop/ tablet.
5,Happy. Happy. Happy!
5,I found the pen very easy to use. Buttons are nicely placed in a natural position. Very accurate tracking on my surface.
5,it is Made thing Easy
5,The stylus works great and it arrived 2 weeks earlier than the date originally given.
5,I lost my original pen and bought this as a replacement. For the money its amazing!
5,Great item at a great price!
5,Out of the box worked well no pairing works well with all intended programs.  Love the pen !
2,This item is misleading in all fashions. The Microsoft pen is magnetized and can be placed on the side of the computer. Also the Microsoft pen has an eraser functionality. This pen does not. But you get what you pay for. If you want a pen this will do but if you are looking for the Microsoft pen this is not it
5,Worls as good or better than original!!!
5,no longer works after a few weeks of use.Edit- Was given a replacement that has been working great! Amazing customer service.
5,Great cost efficient stylus for my surface. Works amazingly I’ll be using this quite a bit
5,Great
2,Feels cheap! I thought it was magnetic and its not... i mean its fine but i guess i shouldve payed a littler more. There is no "eraser" like the other ones... it says Microsoft but im sure its not
5,Sleek great quality.  For the price an absolute steal!  Works like a charm with the Surface Pro.
5,Works excellent and working on contact it's been extremely well
1,I need it to write for class. I’m testing it out beforehand and thank goodness I did. Constantly dots out writing so everything is extremely hard to read and a large part of text is white space. Overall wish I had gotten a better pen. Do not buy.
5,This product works great with my Surface 5.
5,works better than the original stylus. easy to use and use immediately. arrive on time and in satisfactory condition.
1,No instructions the company's customer support doesn't reply. Waste of money.
5,Works well with my surface pro tablet !!
5,Very similar to my original stylud
5,Great value and feels great to write/draw with.
5,Lightweight  works great for the price
5,I didn't realize that this has so many features.
1,I tried over and over it only clicks while holding down the eraser button. Making it COMPLETELY useless for drawing. A complete waste of money.
5,Put in the battery works instantly!
5,everything I expected in a styles
5,Great product for the price
2,The magnet in the pen is so weak unlike the Surface OEM pen that the pen magnet will not hold the pen in place at all when attached to the computer wherE the Pro 7 magnet is located on the display left side.
5,The Surface Pen works as it should. Good value for the money.
1,I wouldn't recommend buying this item. It stopped working only after less than a week of use. This was only used for maybe an hour each day and when looking up how long AAAA batteries should last its way longer than this. Buy literally any other product but this one.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This pen will randomly activate the erase or undo functions during any drawing leaving any work (notes drawing etc) completely functionally impossible. It is certain to happen and is extremely interruptive. If I wanted a mere stylus I would have used my own. Do not buy this product if you actually want to use it for anything beyond scrolling and clicking. You will be severely disappointed.Note: I tested the included battery; it was fully functional at 1.6 Volts and 0.56 Amps.
5,Pen works great and is very responsive.  Very pleased with purchase.
5,Pens works very well and a gear bang for the buck.
5,Great product. Great price.
5,good
5,Product as advertised - delivered as promised.
5,It works great and hasnt stoped
5,El producto excelente
5,I like everything about the pen.
5,Perfect for our Surface Pro 6.
5,Awesome product super easy to use :)
5,Love this product
5,Very satisfied with the product.
5,Works great. I’m really impressed!
5,The Pen works really great!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Randomly right clicks by itself. Perhaps I got a defective one. Makes using it nearly impossible because it won't reliably write.
5,Love this product
2,This stylus had poor performance with creating continuous lines when trying to write or draw on my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. After a day of frustration I'm returning to try a different equally priced option.
2,Didn’t end up working for my surface pro.
1,This pen did not automatically turn off and used up the power of three batteries in 2 days.
1,Terrible. Maybe it was just mine but even after buying a new Duracell battery it skipped and jumped. In my photo the line on the left is an hp pen and on the right is the this one. I'll be returning it. I know it was an affordable gamble. I lost. I'm going to use the refund towards an official surface pen. My advice just spend the extra dollars for quality.
5,I love this pen.....
5,Works great
5,Works great
1,THE PEN IS ACCURATE HOWEVER IT DOES NOT AUTO SHUT OFF SO I AM CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE BATTERY.  MY BUTTONS DONT ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING.
1,This pen doesn’t pair with my surface pro 4 tablet. Tried a brand new battery still not working. Written instructions state you need to press down on the top  but the top is not even a button? I have a feeling I got ripped off on this purchase. I can not recommend this product.
5,na
1,Does not sync with my surface Laptop does not seem to have any power will be contacting the manufacturer to get some troubleshooting
1,It did not come with the two refill tips like it said it would. The instructions are barely anything. It is not clear. Not what I expected. I spent a seamless amount on this pen for it not to do absolutely nothing.
1,Falsely advertised.
1,I don't understand what happened but it paired automatically and worked for a day and then stopped completely no matter what I try...
2,Touch sensing was very inconsistent. Tracers after I picked up the stylus etc.
1,The writing was not smooth at all. The instructions were for a completely different pen. I am not impressed at all.Updated 04/16/2020.  Now this company is writing me offering a refund if I remove this review. I find this deceptive and dishonest. I will not remove the review. I want shoppers to know honestly what my experience was.
2,Wish I had bought diffent pen with good directions.
1,Does not work with with my surface pro 4 at all. Changed the battery with negative results. No longer have the box or any of the packaging so I’m out of luck returning in it. Money wasted unless I can get a functional replacement.
1,This pen did not work at all for me (I followed all directions and suggestions) and I sent it back.
1,Worked for an hour with my surface pro 2. Then stopped. Waste of money.
1,i used this pen only twice to write notes and it completely stopped working. i even tried putting a new pen tip in and it still didn't work. very disappointed because it was somewhat pricey for something that didn't even work.
1,Won’t work after a few days.
1,The magnetic can quit working in 2 minutes I'm trying to send it back now
1,It didn't even connect to my phone it was a waste of money. I have to buy another one.
1,The nib of this stylus broke off after less than a month of normal use. Very disappointing. Suggestion: Look for a different stylus.
1,Total piece of crap. Do not buy. Didn't even work with my surface pro. This is a total rip off and waste of money. If I could give this 0 stars I would.
1,I have to return this because it would not work with my surface pro 2. Instructions do not really have any work around other then put in battery and go....
1,Deceptive Advertising does not work with Surface 3.Proc Intel AtomOS Windows 10 HomeAnd the two nibs were not inside the package incorrect instructions.Returning. Do not buy.
1,I did not like this pen and I would like to return it. Only used it once and it won’t work on my other products.
1,Absolutely useless. I replaced the battery and it still won’t turn on or even show up as a usable device on my surface pro 5. Don’t waste your money!!!
1,Never linked
1,This was a little laggy but generally worked fine. For about two weeks. Then it would be spotty. Now it doesn't work at all.
1,A key feature of the Microsoft pen is that it magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface.  Removing that key feature makes stylus this of little value.
1,Wow ... if you want to just give your money away and get nothing in return this product is for you.
1,I wasn't able to pair it with my Surface pro4.
1,One of 3 didn't last a month.  Swapped battery.  I'd spend more next time.
1,No instructions or way to connect to Surface not a Microsoft Product which is what the ad leads you to believ
1,Received in what appears to be good condition however it does not work. Not even discoverable on any device.
1,Needed this for a project but can't even return it now because of quarantine. Burn your money before buying.
1,Got it in April and it already broken in June. Disappointed it the quality of this product
1,It’s just not good and I wasn’t expecting much at the price point.
1,Despite ad this stylus did not work with my hp probook x360.
1,Didn't work at all. Doesn't connect to the Surface 4 Pro as described.
1,Item did not work.  No help.  don't waste your money
1,Sorry but it wouldn't connect to my Surface so I returned it.
1,Garbage used it for 1 month then bought a genuine Microsoft replacement.
1,Just not what i hoped for. Battery operated. No magnet. Literally useless
1,It doesnt work the good with surface. Seems theirs a delay
1,It didn’t work. It wouldn’t sync. Sent back for refund.
1,Excelente
1,Doesn't work
1,Misleading.
1,Just came in today and won’t sync. Keeps saying “we didn’t get any response from the device. Try connecting again”.
5,I have a Dell Inspiron 7405 2-in-1 that works with the Dell PN350M pen. I originally bought one but it broke in only a year and a half so I bought this instead. It has a clip instead of magnets which is actually better than the original pen which does have magnets but doesn't stick to the laptop. This one is lighter but the build quality is comparable and it has a higher hover distance. The button layout is the same and everything works as expected.
5,This makes using my tablet so easy!
2,I bought this to replace the original pen I lost. I miss the magnetic function of the original but not enough to make up for the price difference unless that would just lead to me losing this pen more often.It takes a really long time and a lot of finicking with the pen to get it to connect. Connection is very spotty with this since it doesn't connect via bluetooth I can't troubleshoot it just wait until it does decide to connect. I've only had this for 2 days and I'm disappointed. I liked it while it worked.... when it decides to.
2,The pen after a couple hours of use started to glitch it kept writing even though the tip and the screen were not in contact at all. This made my handwriting look all wrong and messy. Also on the second day I already had to replace tip because it was all worn out...on the second day... After replacing the tip the pen started to glitch even more it stops writing for a few seconds and then continues "normally". When I bought this I expected some problems but I didn't expect the pen to be bad at the one thing its supposed to be good at. Im not returning it because im in desperate need of one for my online classes and because of the virus lock down im unable yo find a local solution.
2,I didn't purchase this but my employer did and let me say you get what you pay for.  Adequate is about its only shining quality.  If you do multiple documents with it such as signing or literally anything else you won't be happy with this pen.  With occasional use it might be ok but I don't like it.
5,Evenly weighted and connects automatically.
5,Update: this pen didn’t end up working with my device however the customer service I received from the company was excellent. They were able to answer my questions and worked out a better fit for what I needed. I would recommend this brand to anyone even if I didn’t get to use the pen.
5,I ordered this one because it was Microsoft Certified. Not sure what this exactly means but I figure it's better than other knockoffs. I didn't want to up to $100 for the original pen. This was works well.Pros:Pen works well without skipping.The tip is very similar to the original surface pen. Doesn't leave marks on the screen protector.Recognized instantly by my Surface Go. No need to power on.Has a quality feel to the pen.Cons:Does not stick to the side of the Surface Go like the original pen.No erase button on the pen.
5,I bought this product because my MS official surface pen would periodically disconnect and go unresponsive. I could not get it to re-pair unless I removed/replaced the battery. This happened even with a fresh battery. Honestly I wish they had put a reset button in the pen to cut off/on the battery. That would have been acceptable to me because I could them re-pair the pen in a second or less.I've only had it a few days but so far this pen does not seem to have the problem. I can run a whiteboard session again without having my pen cr^p out in the middle of my dialog.Pros:- Inexpensive- Works as expected- Feels good in the hand.- Mine works with magnetic mounting but some reviews here so it does not. (different models?)- It has a wider spacing for the pen clip making it easy to clip onto the surface 3 type cover for storage and easy access.- Very similar to the original surface 3 pen so it's no learning curve.- It just f&*#ing works.Cons:- No bluetooth 'eraser' button to launch an app but I never use that feature on my surface pen ether. It requires separate button cell batteries for that and I never bothered getting them- It has a slightly different "feel" from the original surface pen but I'm getting used to it and my writing is legible.- Only works with MS pen screens. I have a Dell laptop that has a stylus digitizer and it does not work.- These are all minor cons and take very little away from this product especially given the price and overall value.
5,Review update 4/16/2020:A few days ago the pen stopped working probably the pen fell from my daughter's hand. I contact the seller and he sent a new one no question ask. The service is amazing and I'm sure it is my problem and not the product. I really appreciate this service.This product works extremely well. It's very comfortable in your hand. This is my first pen so I don't know the difference between this and the original Microsoft pen but this one costs less than half price and does the work perfectly.One thing amazing is you don't need Bluetooth to connect the pen to the computer. I just installed the battery and that's it connected. Easy to use highly recommended.I will update in a few days...
5,I ordered this one when my original Surface stylus somehow found its way into the washing machine. I did not want to pay the price for the original one and I decided to give this one a try.I have to say I am ultra-happy with this one. First it pairs with the Surface automatically contrary to the pairing procedure of the original pen which I have found to be a pain on multiple occasions. Touchscreen response is very good. I was a little bit confused about the eraser function but soon I figured out that the eraser would work with the side button.I use the pen mostly to write on either PowerPoint slides or to Microsoft Whiteboard during presentations and it certainly doesn't disappoint.
5,This pen is unlike the ridiculously expensive mircrosoft pen given the fact that it does not have a magnet but i have a great case and am not worried about losing the pen. Even if I do the replacement cost is cheap. This pen comes with a button for the right click function unlike Microsoft's pen. I use this pen for art programs such as photoshop gimp and paint tool sai. I had an issue where the pen disconnected after putting my surface pro to sleep but I just assumed it was the battery. When I turned it on the following day everything was working again smoothly.
5,This stylus writes just as well as the $70 microsoft brand stylus for the Surface. It does require a AAA battery but the eraser function is a button you push where you are naturally holding the pen you don't have to flip the pen over to use the "eraser." Much more convenient. It does not have the magnet but I do not miss it.
5,This pen is extremely light weight for a smart pen. In comparison to the Surface Pro pens it is more comfortable to hold has better accuracy and is rechargeable.It works great and clings to the side great. It even has more levels of touch than the original pen. It sticks very well to the side of the Surface and for my purposes works just as well as the MS stylus for a fraction of the cost.Great value.
5,I absolutely love this pen!I recently purchased this stylus to use with my Surface Go. Setup was easy and it worked right away just put the battery in and off you go. However after a bit of using it I noticed that it was activating buttons (opening / closing windows) and even writing (when in an app that supports it) without the pen even touching the screen.Getting a replacement was fast and easy. The new stylus works perfectly.
5,This pain is beautifully made feels right and it really works perfectly on my Galaxy Alpha book 21. I tried three other quote unquote active pens and they all skipped all missed bits or didn’t work properly and this one is flawless for around the same price
5,Me confundí al comprarlo  pensé que me sería útil para mi IPad ya estoy en el trámite de devolución.El producto en si es de buena calidad bien diseño cómodo al usarlo pero lamentablemente me confundí al realizar la compra
1,It doesn’t write well and it stopped working in less than 2 months. Do not waste your money. I am not the type that writes bad reviews but believe me this is a disaster.
5,"I use a tablet a lot for design sketches and it is very important to me that I have a pen that is both responsive and accurate. I don't really want to pay 100+ dollars for an apple pen so I bought this instead. It honestly works almost just as good as the apple pen did when I used my friend's minus the exclusive features that apple provides (hence the price)The pen is very comfortable and feels like your actually writing with an artist pen"
5,Better price than the $100 official pen.I only use the pen to draw and it works well for that.
5,Instantly connected to my computer and I'm glad I bought it. I hope this lasts a while and that I don't lose it.
5,Great pen and i am sure that the Microsoft surface pro 7 pen that is sold for a 100 or something like that isnt any better
5,I like the style and price instead of bluetooth just add the battery. Work better than expected enjoying my pen with my Surface Pro 6.
5,I have no qualms with this pen.  Works exactly as described and paired very easily.
5,Pleased with item works great
5,Great Pen for Surface.
5,I received the pen today and in less than 5 min I had it connected and using. Its pretty straight forward comes with 2 extra tips and a battery. I bought this to replace my original surface pen and I have to say so for I like much better than the MS Surface pen I had!
5,Buen precio y elegante diseño y fácil de usar.
5,The stylus pen arrived well on time and to my surprise it is extremely good. The installation went smoothly. It can work directly after insert the battery. It will recognize the surface when touching the screen. For Drawings work great as the pen notices how much pressure is being exerted to create a thinner or thicker line. Really pleased with my purchase and it’s better value for mine.
5,Me agrado funciona excelente
4,The pen works fine but some drawing program like clip studio don’t work well with itI have to press the menu items twice at timesDrawing pencils and pens result in many skipped pixels especially at my drawing speedSelection of screen area is troublesome tooI don’t know if is the apps (paint or clip studio) or the penI lost the original pen so I cannot compare it to anything else as such
4,The pen performs to specifications one drawback its not magnetic.
5,This stylus seems very responsive and writes well in OneNote. I had some issues getting it to connect/power on at first but the service team was helpful and it started working quickly after I messaged them. Very happy to have an alternative to my Surface Pen (which has intermittently stopped working).
5,Was excellent!!!
5,My daughter uses this on her Surface Go for school. Makes it easy to do Math take notes and draw. Worth the money.
5,Pen works well
5,Love it 😊
5,Works great for my Microsoft tablet and the erase option is really easy to use while taking notes
1,Just didn't work with my computer. Turned out it was a compatibility issue.
5,Out of the box insert the battery and voila it works.  Immediately tested it out on my surface touch point was great and the smoothness of writing was even better.  I believe I actually like this better than the oem pen that you purchase from Microsoft.
5,Works really good for the surface duo. Was worried at first but the hand writing via gboard  was cool reminded me of the treo days.
4,This pen works super well considering the price. Just wish it were magnetic!
5,Very Smooth on the Laptop and couldn't wait to get it
5,Still getting use to both the Surface and the pen so think the accuracy and easy of use will improve in time
5,I bought this pen for my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Worked instantly as soon as I touched the screen. Did not have to connect it through Bluetooth. Comes with 3 tips (one already in the pen and 2 extra ones) Very sleek and great quality for the price!
5,Excellent product working fine with my MS Surface GO 2
5,Love it
5,Pen automatically works and doesn’t have to be Bluetooth connected has a nice weight and feel. Works well with HP 2-in-1 laptop.
5,So simple. Easy to use. Responsive. Great purchase. Thanks amazon!
1,Took this out of the box . Put the battery in it. Tried to connect it to my surface go. Would not do anything.  Checked battery power level. Battery is good. Pen is bad.
5,It is very accurate the surface recognizes it as a stylus so there is indeed palm rejection. The non-tip end of the stylus cannot act as an eraser and the seller does not advertise it that way so that's good. It is non-magnetic it cannot stick to the side of the tablet.
1,Total failure to interact with microsoft surface.  Tried two thinking it was a single item defect.  Avoid product!
5,Much better than I thought it would work for the price.
5,I'm really finicky on pens and this one is one I really likeIt's weighted well nice smooth finish and it's a good size.I am a fidgiter so I pull the tip out alot I would like it if it had a grove to it so the tip would like 'click' back into place.Only thing I would change would be to add a spring to the back so you could click it like a real pen it looks like you should be able to click it and Everytime I pick it up I want to click it.
5,Using this on a Surface Go for work and it has worked beautifully. Only issue I have run into (which I have with every stylus that has buttons)  is that due to the way I learned to hold a pen I have to rotate the Uogic Pen or I will inadvertently press the erase button. Smooth as silk on the screen and no problems with Windows 10 Pro. Clip fits perfectly onto the edge of the keyboard when it's closed so I can always keep the pen with the system. I am quite impressed.
5,As described. So far so good.
5,Parfait et tres bonne qualité pour le 1/4 du prix
2,I've never used a tablet stylus until I bought this one for my new surface tablet pro 7. It worked right out of the box without setup which was nice and was very intuitive to use. I really liked it.However it was unreliable. It would stop working periodically. It would start to function again after a short interval without me doing anything. Occasionally it wouldn't work for hours.. Now it seems to have stopped working permanently.This seems to be a common problem with this model based on what I'm seeing in reviews. I'd love a replacement but I'm not sure how to request it as the return window has closed but I've had it for less than 2 months.
5,I bought this pen for my Microsoft surface Go  It was well-shaped and easy to use but it constantly got disconnected from my tablet I sent an email to customer service and after a few days they sent me a new one The new one works well so far and after 5 hours use today never got disconnected I use the pen for writing and I write a lot every day However I thought it good for drawing as well I am really satisfied with this product and their amazing customer care.I don't have any idea about battery life yet I will add to my review later.
1,You are taking a chance at getting a working one or one that doesn't work. It said it would be compatible with my surface laptop. All you have to do is load Onenote and put the battery in... No response from the computer. Now I have to go through the whole refund deal and look for a company that actually makes a quality product (..hard to find these days) .
2,The clip at the top of the pen fell off in less than a weeks of having it but that did not affect its ability to write. I twisted the end off to change the battery and it somehow wore out the ability to screw it back on so the cap will not reattach and it will no longer work. It also would frequently start erasing while I was writing without my pressing the erase button which was very annoying.
1,Right click doesn't work properly. Its constantly activating on its own. Once I touch pen to screen it works flawlessly. But if I lift it sends a right click immediately. Which I then have to double tap. Not sure if there's a fix.
5,I actually really like this product. I am not really a person that knows a lot about tech but I thought it was nice to order since a lot is only due to Corona. I am actually glad that I bought it it makes using OneNote way easier on my surface pro. I can recommend it especially for the price in comparison to the real Microsoft pen.
5,Had a small issue with first Stylus received. The seller was amazing in figuring out problem and sending me a replacement within a couple days!! New stylus works great very happy and well worth the cost!!
5,This is exactly working like the original surface pen. The tip can be replaced by the original tip. Also there is no need to sync via Bluetooth. And the response time of writing and drawing is very fast. I would recommend it to teachers in these covid-19 situation !
5,work good wish the magnet on the pen to stronger so that it can be attach to the side of the surface pro !
4,It looks and feels like the original Microsoft stylus for the surface but it does not stick to the magnet on the side of the surface tablet like the original Microsoft one. Other than that it works fine.
5,The product was as advertised. I also have a Microsoft surface pen. This is one is for home. I have no complaints. For the price I am very impressed.
1,Pen came in excited to use it opened up the package and the pen literally fell apart. Sending it back
1,i places pen in case holder and then the clip on it fell off immediately AND NOW THERE3 IS SOMTHING RATTLING AROUND INSIDE OF IT. I am retuning this item today.
4,The pen is fine overall. The nib is nice but unfortunately the eraser doesn’t work as an eraser. You have to choose the eraser in whatever program you are using and then erase and after choose pen again.
4,Works as intended great for the price - however the battery life leaves much to be desired.
5,Working good in my asus mini windows tablet
3,Works with my tablet but the buttons are in the way when you write. A bit choppy at times but other than that it works well and worth the price.
5,good product excellent
1,This pen skips a lot. Like the pointer goes to the edge of the screen and it keeps getting worse. I don't recommend
3,overall about what you would expect when paying 1/3 of the price of a microsoft pen. Smooth writing occasionally deactivates but not for long. Overall 7/10
4,A durable nice looking stylus. Didn’t need any installation time as it was already paired to my device!
1,Was broken when I got it very disappointed please don’t waist your money I’m not kidding it’s literally broken and doesn’t work
2,The pen worked for about 6 months and then died. Changing its battery did not help.
5,Love this pen. Works perfectly just like the originalbut costs less.
1,Completely dead after some very light use. Avoid this garbage!
5,Love the product . Fast delivery (got it in less that a day). Works like the original. Highly recommended
1,False product description not working with HP Spectre at all!
1,doesn’t work well for some reason. Maybe its my screen that’s broken?
4,I like it. I am not one to make notes on my computer but this helps
5,It does everything it claims.
5,Works well with my surface 3.
4,Great bang for buck.
1,I was hoping to use it with my surface pro 7. However I put the battery in and did everything that I am supposed to and it doesn't work.
3,El lápiz ha funcionado hasta que cambie la punta. Se desconfiguró y ya no hay manera. He preguntado al vendedor por puntas de recambio y nada silencio por respuesta. Al final  30 euros para 1 mes de uso
5,The only bad thing I can think of for this pen is unlike others it’s not magnetic to the surface pro and the top of the pen doesn’t act as an eraser. Otherwise the nib is wayyy better than the on-brand/more expensive ones as it isn’t as flexible and it comes with 2 spare ones and a 2 year warranty so amazing value for money :)
3,I have tried everything with my laptop to fix it but the pen randomly stopped working and changing the battery/nib doesn't help at all.
5,Sehr Hochwertiger Stift der dem Original im nicht nachsteht.Sehr hochwertiges Metallgehäuse mit Federclip und sehr guter Haptik/Fingergefühl. Fühlt sich wie ein guter Kugelschreiber an.Das Problem ist die Glasoberfläche des Tablet oder Surface ist halt nicht wie auf Papier schreiben es fehlt der Widerstand/Reibung. Aber dafür kann der Stift nichts
3,Seems to be ok not sure the pressure sensitivity works but may not be in the right apps.The hot keys don't seem to do anything and it didn't come with a battery despite saying it did.Otherwise it will do for work for basic writing and navigation.
4,The changeable heads are a good idea but not that easy to replace and stay in properly. It's a good replacement for the Microsoft version being half the price but think they missed a trick with the strip down the middle being magnetised so it's always to hand on your laptop.
5,Benutzung für das Surface pro 6:Ich hatte lange Probleme mit dem "Original" von Microsoft und ärgere mich richtig dass ich diesen Stift nicht schon früher gekauft habe! 200x besser und viel günstiger! Absolute Empfehlung
2,Da der Stift sehr günstig war habe ich keinen hohen Anspruch an die Schreibqualität gehabt welche auch nicht mit dem Original vergleichbar ist. Für handschriftliche Notizen also nicht so gut geeignet.Alle anderen Funktionen haben gut funktioniert.Leider hat der Stift bereits nach 10 Monaten den Geist aufgegeben...
4,Ce stylet fonctionne très bien.
5,Ich hatte Angst und wusste nicht ob der stift dann gut schreiben kannAber bin zufrieden für den Preis so einen Stift bekommen zu haben
2,Ich habe den Stift für mein Surface go gekauft. Leider musste man den Stift in einem sehr speziellen Winkel halten damit die Stiftspitze erkannt wird. Ansonsten entsteht statt einer Linie nur viele Punkte. Ich konnte mit dem Stift keine Mitschriften anfertigen (z.B. für die Uni).Ansonsten sieht der Stift gut aus liegt angenehm in der Hand und hat eine praktische Stifthalterung am Ende.
5,Super
1,non serve a niente
1,Ya esta dicho todo en el título. Un saludo
2,オンオフスイッチ欲しいわ。すぐ反応しない
5,Parfait
5,Affidabile e precisa sia nel passatempo che con applicazioni professionali.
5,Très bon produit
1,le stylo ne fonctionne pas j ai du le renvoyer passer votre chemin pour cet article
1,J'ai acheté ce stylet le 17 septembre depuis j'ai changé 4 fois de pile. Ce qui fait qu'il reviendra TRÈS cher en pile.Il était spécifié qu'il devait tenir 1500h ce qui est faux.Je ne peux plus me faire rembourser et je n'arrive pas à contacter le vendeur.
1,+ funktioniert direkt ohne großes Installierungsproblem+ leicht- war leider nach 35 Monaten ohne Sturz oder ähnliches nicht mehr zu benutzen. Batteriewechsel ohne Erfolg. Leider war auch hier schon die Zeit zur Rückgabe schon vorbei...-> würde den Stift nicht empfehlen
1,die spitze ist nach einer woche kapput gegangen und ich kann den Stift jetzt in müll schmeißen
1,Nicht zu frieden
1,Leider funktioniert der Stift nicht auf dem Surface Laptop. Deswegen geht er direkt wieder zurück.
1,Surface用と書いてあったので購入して使おうとしたが、使えず、良くインターネットを調べたら、Surface Laptop Goは適用外だと書いてあったので、これから購入する人は、注意して下さい‼️(このタッチペンは、Surface Proを使っている知人に譲るつもりです‼️)
1,Surface proが使えると書いてあったのに，全く書けない．反応しない．設定を開いて試しても全く反応なし．この商品のためにお金を出したことに後悔．二度と買いません．
1,ne fonctionne pas pour la surface pro 3
1,Keine Bindung am surface 4 möglich. Geht zurück.
1,Did not work
5,Product is working as expected so far.
5,I absolutely love this pen! same dimensions as my surface pen seems to be as accurate aswell.. i only see it for not taking and haven't noticed a difference between the two. The only con about this pen is its much lighter BUT its weight is balanced just like the OEM pen. Also the pen is not magnetic but for the price that's ok
5,Works great exactly as needed
4,Arrived on time and seems to work great
1,I literally broke the next day and it lags a bit.
5,I love this pen my only gripe is that’s it’s not rechargable
