5,With three kids under the age of four we are always running and lugging things around like bikes water coolers helmets scooters toys etc.  The last few months we have had to replace helmets that were left behind coolers that never made it back to the car and now just waiting for the new bikes to go missing too.  We stuck two of these on the two new bikes our Yeti cooler and slapped one on our stroller.  Now we know if we forgot something right away and hoping to keep these items for longer than a few months thanks to these amazing TagVault Surfaces we bought.  I think we need about 20 more!
5,I put one of these on my electric bike and asked my wife if she could spot it. She couldn't. When I pointed it out she said it just looked like a part of the bike. That's exactly what I was hoping. Nicely made too.
5,I was quite skeptical at the lack of reviews but I took a chance and it worked out great! I’m a university student and I used this to keep an AirTag on my scooter and so far so good!
5,I like these.  I used one to hide an AirTag in my truck. Seems to stick on well and the things not going anywhere unless the vault falls.  I mounted it on an interior location behind the dash. I think would be fine on an exterior (clean) spot but I would look for a review from someone who did mounted it that way.  Overall it’s a good option in my opinion.  Time will tell.
5,Love how perfectly it fits on my bike and looks like part of it so no one can tell there is an air tag. A must have!
5,I was able to attach this to my standup paddle board with my AirTag in seconds. I can tell it’s very durable and love that it’s waterproof for my SUP. I also love that it doesn’t really look like an AirTag. I haven’t had to replace the battery yet but I know it’ll be super easy. Will be buying more of these for all my gear!
5,In an effort to keep track of all my items I ordered a bunch of these along with AirTags. The 3m tape is redicilously strong. I placed this one on my iKamper roof top tent. Elevation Labs doesn’t disappoint.
5,The product secures with 3M brand tape adhesive. I like that it does not openly display the air tag and it uses a screw mount as opposed to a snap mount to hold the AirTag. The screw mount makes battery replacement easier. My main reason for attaching an air tag is to prevent me from leaving the iPad behind when powered off. You can set the notification to exclude home or other addresses.
5,Bought to tag a bike and is appropriate for that purpose. The cap is tight and will not loosen normally.I still keep an eye on it but am satisfied. The bike istelf had a flat surface that it could be affixed to.
5,We're using these AirTag mounts at our real estate company to track when the highway department takes a real estate sign or the sign gets stolen. I bought 3 different kinds of mounts but these work the best. There is a gasket that keeps the water out and the 3M tape is really strong.
5,I love this thing and would buy it again. I love the screw on feature the 3M tape and it’s blending in with my other scooter parts and when people see it they don’t even know what it is and that’s the whole point
5,Fit perfect
5,I’m a touring musician and these leveled up my AirTag game big time.
3,The product is awesome however I'm not certain the 3M tape is real. It wouldn't stay where I placed it and kept falling off. I then used my own 3M tape and it stuck perfectly.
1,The quality of the case itself was very nice. Unfortunately I had to use this to keep track of my utility trailer since we’ve had multiple rainy days since the application it appears the adhesive has failed and has fallen off and lost on the road.
5,Advertised as “Unbreakable” so I assume they are made of high grade materials. IP68 waterproof as well I’m confident my AirTags will stay secure and operational while encased in these. I put them inside my hard cases under the foam padding. It’s an added security measure until I get a vault but it can used be for longer term usages.
5,Seems to work very well. I will be buying more.
5,I got a new pellet grill/smoker and it sits on the back porch which is open to a common area. I can't fence it in etc so I used this to hide an Air Tag in a hidden place on the grill. If it's ever stolen I'll know where it is. I checked to make sure it still transmitted well and the sound was still audible. Check! All is well and I'm a happy camper!
5,These things are great build quality and I am pretty picky on that. Thick durable plastic great overall finish high quality rubber gasket for waterproofing. They are super low profile and nowhere show an Apple logo or advertise it’s a tracking device which is important because anyone will to steal a snowboard is willing to rip off the tracking device and leave it behind. The goal is for it to be completely unnoticed or if seen someone might think it’s always been a part of the board. They use 3M adhesive which is the adhesive industry standard. I am going to apply these now while it’s 75° out and allow the adhesive to cure for several weeks before they hit the slopes so there is no excuse if the adhesive fails. I cannot speak on long term durability or waterproofing. I am placing these on a pair of skis and a snowboard so they will be subject to water very cold conditions and outdoor environments. I will update the review as time goes on or if any issues arise.
