5,Its a 50' cat5e cable. so it works.
5,I literally needed all 50 ' of this cable it's the proper gage to maintain my wifi speed
4,Mediabridge Ethernet Cable (50 ft) – Supports Cat6 / Cat5e / Cat5 Standards 550Mhz 10Gbps – RJ45 Computer Networking CordA hero with a shroud... and a beltProsRubberized shroud protects lock leverGood amount of insulationBelt to tie cable for storageConsI wish additional belt was included for tidier storageThere's something exciting about characters enveloped with shrouds and belts. And there's a networking cable that is equipped in a similar way... and really helps: Mediabridge Ethernet Cable.Most of us ended up having to or liking to work or socialize from home recently learned to use computers and internet connecting devices along the way. In the beginning WiFi was enough for my occasional social meetings but when I realized that video conferencing was needed I found that WiFi was...iffy. So after trying WiFi extenders I decided to run a length of 50 ft of Ethernet cable from my router to the computer I setup for video conferencing. After some research I choose the Mediabridge Ethernet Cable.From simple ping tests to video streaming off YouTube it showed me it worked fine with my current provider and router. Based on this my assumption about gaming is that this cable should do fine for the playing set. Networking tech folks possibly have better tools to test it the bit level but for me this solution is wonderful. The insulation used on it is beefier than your usual Ethernet cable run which makes the cable more 'kink-resistant' than the average.Did I mention a shroud? Yes. Each RJ45 connector is shrouded by a rubberized cover that prevents the lock lever to be bent upwards downwards or teared up by accident. Compare it with a 'standard' RJ45 connector on a cable in one of the series of photos (all photos (c) 2021 by reviewer) which has the lever already bent inwards and weakened or the other photo were the lever already broke off.And about that belt while many wire providers sent their cables tied with a one-time use plastic or plastic and tin core tie or just a plastic tie rod Mediabridge provides a reusable black tie to tidy up the cable for storage. Nice.I wish they provided an extra belt to tie the cable at 2 extremes of the cable coil for tidier storage. And of course I hope that the cable will last for a long while: we'll see. But you can count on this one if you need a cabling solution that is easy to continually deploy and store. I grant it 4 of 5 stars.
4,50 long fast and good quality
5,Works as advertised
5,Worked great at a great price!!
4,good for price. works.
5,Works well and is 50ft. Haven't had any issues and does what it needs to.
5,no
5,My room is on the bottom floor and the router is on the second. This cable is long enough to go from my room to the router with no issues highly recommend!
5,I needed a long ethernet cable to reach my computer and this has done the trick. 4x my internet speed because the router was behind a wall and now I have this ethernet cable.
5,I use this cable for my home CCTV system it works great connected it to my Wi-Fi for signal strength go to my camera perfect
5,Simple and neat cardboard packaging along with a velcro strap to tie the coil of ethernet cord with. Would buy again for internet routing needs.
5,Works great for my cam
4,The Wi-Fi part of my laptop busted???? And I bought this and it works. Only use computer on internet couple times a week. Saved me from having to buy new laptop. So far it works but only used one time  I don’t leave plug in when not in use.
5,Works really well and is quite sturdy. I'm a digital nomad and I travel with it everywhere.
5,There is not too much for me to say other than it does exactly what a Cat 6 cable is supposed to do.  No problems to report after using for close to 2 years.  The 50 foot length did transmit signal just as well as all the shorter runs I purchased.
5,So I got this cord to do a run from my basement to my first floor where my main computer is. The previous owners had a tiny hole in the floor where they ran coax and they must've put the terminals/heads on afterwards because the cable wouldn't fit through it with the end on. A bit of widening and one coax cable removed and I'm now ready to install my 50 foot run. Only thing was the head was a wee bit too big and me being stubborn just rammed the cable through.It worked gig speeds and no dropped packets a perfect 5/7 (10/10).UPDATE: 4/24/22: Was putting carpet in my computer room and accidentally sliced through 2-4 wires of this still had full 100mbps (not gigabit) even with the destroyed wires. Went ahead and ordered a new one to replace the old one and had to literally hammer it through a hole that was just a wee bit too small. I smashed the crap out of the shielding right behind the terminator and it is working perfectly regardless. These are durable cables!
5,Works as advertised
5,I like the way the cable is made and the speed it gives for gaming.
5,I've been using Mediabridge products for some time now and they have never disappointed! Their cables/lines are high quality professional products that perform great. I highly recommend Mediabridge products!!
5,Currently using 2 of these cables one for my Xbox in my living room and one in my office for my desktop pc.Long enough to run through my walls to reach my electronics that way they are on a hardwire connection instead of wireless. I can game all day without a single problem unlike before on a wireless connection. Would defiantly buy again!
5,Great quality and half the price of in store
4,Usable
5,When recently receiving a "free" upgraded service to 150 Mbps internet connection I had my doubts. So naturally I navigated to the trusty SpeedTest dot net to confirm that this wasn't just more fake news.After testing I was receiving some 120s to 140 at times over the airwaves - while higher than the 100 Mbps I originally signed up for it wasn't quite 150. Hot and bothered I came up with my own - non technical - theory. I knew my wireless card in my computer was is totally capable of receiving all 150 of them mega babies my router was broadcasting but there had to be an outside force in the air swatting some down.I did what all home owners would do naturally... I had a few local companies quote to re-configure my houses HVAC and add an air purifying system to reduce the crud in my air slowing down the internets. However after realizing how time consuming the project would be I figured maybe I should start with this $9.95 cord-o-blue. (Which came next day)Sure enough I was now blasting past 140 to over 170 Mbps. Attached is an image tested with WiFi and hardwiring after.In the world of WiFi's - sometimes being hardwired is a beautiful thing.Disclaimer: I'm still rocking a late 2013 iMac with 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking;2 IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatibility. My Nighthawk router is approximately 10ft (~3 meters) behind me.
4,I purchased this ethernet cable to run from my AT&T modem router to a bedroom on the other side of the house. Running a cable through a low pitched attic crawl space isn’t fun!After running the ethernet cable I connected it to my laptop and ran a speed test. I was only able to get 58 mbps. When I run a speed test on the Wi-Fi signal it’s 115 mbps download upload. I called AT&T support but they did not know why I did not have a stronger signal wired directly from the modem? They did suggest that I log into the Wi-Fi modem and see what Devices may be connected to the Wi-Fi router modem.
5,This is a solid cable with good cable ends and no communication errors i am recieving full bandwidth throughput it is well worth the low cost
5,I love the length of the cable. It works perfectly.
5,this chord makes it good for a computer that is on the other side of the room
5,I needed a long cable for my flat panel installation. This cable was perfect for the task. Wall port to hub then hub to various pieces of equipment. Works great.
4,I've bought many network cables over the years mediabridge makes a quality product.
5,I bought this for reliable connection during virtual meetings.  Well worth it.  Quick shipping; excellent product and value for money.
5,I bought this back in May 2020 when I started working from home. I have my computer hardwired to the router and I have zero complaints with the ethernet cord. My only bummer is it is a lot cheaper then when I bought it! I had tried other cords prior to purchasing this one and the connector would always get snagged and eventually break off. I really like this cord with the little protective covering so it doesn't get snagged. I live in a Hobbit sized house so the length is even longer than what I really needed but I'd rather have more than not enough. I'd purchase this again if needed.
5,I just needed to find the right equipment to set up a new workspace at home. Packaging was good. Cable was in excellent condition. Doing the job it needs to do.
5,able to make better connection to remote tv from main unit
5,Do you want a cable that works? Cool. This one will probably do that for you. Mine sure did.
5,I finally got tired of the lag I get while playing Overwatch and COD: MW on my PS4. I am in the same room as the modem/router and the internet just keeps on dropping to the point that I am losing gun fights I should be winning.Since I have gotten it I have no internet connection problems extremely better download and upload speeds and FPS has also gone up!Little tip for reader: Please measure the distance between your modem/router to your console or PC before you buy. I over estimated how much I need and 50ft is overkill but that is completely on me and not on Mediabridge.
5,This cable is exactly as described.  It's flexible enough to wind behind furniture bookcases filing cabinets and through a wall.  Two things that make it worth the time to write this review.1. GREAT PRICE. You will likely never be able to find this 50 foot ethernet cable locally at anywhere near this price. It was so cheap compared to local stores in fact that I was reluctant to buy it. But am sure glad I did!2. QUALITY. The feature that makes this cable worth buying (even if it were far more expensive) is the solid heavy duty clip that click/locks it into place. I haven't bought a new cable in several years so I don't know if all the new cables have changed.  Older cables often had puny weak clips that would break off and then the cable would fall out easily.  Mine were always breaking. You'd probably have to work at it to break off this one. I used it to hook up my Mac desktop to my modem. Far faster and more secure than wireless.  I didn't test the speed but it already seems faster than the much older cable I replaced. I'm happy with it.
3,It works great until you have to put it away. It twist and tangles more then it should. I ended up just purchasing a flat cat6 cable and it works much better for one that has to disconnect their cord every night.
5,I bought this cable so I can work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I hooked it to the back of my router in my great room and ran the 50-feet of cable to my computer in my upstairs bedroom now home office.  The blue cable is just the right length for my purpose.  It coils up perfectly when I'm not using it.  No kinks or knots because it's flexible yet rigid enough to hold its shape.  So far its durable enough for my use and the price is spot on.  It's a fair price for my health and safety.
5,We have 2 Fire-sticks and running them on Wi-Fi but the one in the bedroom is always telling me that I am not connected to the internet… So we have been trying to figure out how to fix the problem I saw that there was an Ethernet adapter made for the Chromecast and it had the same type connection as the Fire-stick so figure why not try it but I needed a long Ethernet wire. So I found Mediabridge which showed me being the #1 best seller on Amazon with top reviews and a decent price better than my local store. So far works great have had it connected now for about 3-4 weeks no problems at all.My husband likes that the cables seem to be good quality and me that I got an email from them shortly after I got it delivered. They weren’t trying to sell me anything they just wanted to thank me for my purchase and see if I needed any assistance. I thought that was a lovely gesture so when I am ready to buy the next set of cables I know who to come back to.
5,i bought 2 of these so far and never gotten any problem.
5,I replaced a CAT5 cable with this one and now I can use my NAS in my office as a media server in the living room over my streaming device.  With the old cable I had a lot of buffering and delays.  They are gone!!  This stuff works great.  I was a little concerned before I bought it because it didn't seem to have a CAT6 rating but promised CAT6 speed.  I'm a believer now.  I had to cut one of the RJ45 connectors off to pass the cable through a 1/4" hole in a couple of walls but I crimped on a new one (B pattern) and it works great.  The center twisted pair separator was a little difficult to work around in attaching the new connector but I got it right the first time.  I could have used bulk cable but I don't need 250+ feet of cable so I used this one.  Glad I did.
5,I must say that I was a little hesitant to purchase a 50 feet Ethernet cable because there is always talk that it makes for a slower internet connection. Against my better judgment I made the purchase anyway. I bought a Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable(50 Feet)- RJ42 Computer Networking Cord- Blue I have NOT regretted this decision in anyway because:1)  Product was very well made and sturdy. 2) I also was VERY impressed with the packaging of the product. It came in a very sturdy cardboard box( something you don't see now-a-days).This showed me that I was dealing with a company that cared about their products. So with anticipation I set up my cable excepting a slow connection  Although its 50 feet long my internet connection is just as fast as when I used my 10feet cable. It is also connected to my router which has three other Ethernet cords which are shorter and this one; however this cable hasn't missed a beat. As a matter of fact it is faster than the other three cables. I have only been using this product for approximately four(4) days but I am in love with the performance of this cable.  This is why I don't have a problem with giving them  5 stars.
5,My daughter moved into a newly constructed home with all the latest and greatest technologies. “The Cable Company” (not naming names but one of the biggies) installed their “latest & greatest” WiFi. Cell phones and iPads worked fine. I sat 3 feet from the router & was rarely able to get speeds of 100mps on my less than year old laptop. When I did after less than 5 minutes it would drop down to about 20mps OR LESS!! I did not experience this problem at any other place I visited. The cable company solution was to sell my daughter additional equipment for hundreds of dollars. Since I only visited ( but some times for a few weeks at a time) this cable was my solution. Works great! No complaints!
4,Works great just when opened it had a weird smell sorta like a grandma smell type of smell
4,be very careful when installing them.I am an electrician and I have literally ran miles of wires and cables in my 40 years of being an electrician.  As a general rule I always test every cable prior to installing them. Out of the three I ordered this time one of the cables worked before the installation but not after.This is a first for me.Being as how this cable worked out of the box but not after the only thing that makes sense to me is that I somehow damaged it during the installation.  I inspected to cable for physical damage but there does not appear to be ANY damage to it.Although I am positive they would have replaced it I hesitated to return it because I am not positive that I didn't damage it so I let the 30 return date pass (by 4 days). However being as how this is a first.time this has happened  I will continue to use their cables with high confidence that their cables will work as they should.
5,It's the Cable Quality I expected This is for my CCTV camera system. It works well.
5,I like that it is easy to plug in and out of the router. Cable can also be easily routed around the room. It's not like those stiff and difficult to deal with cables
4,This ethernet cable is great for anyone looking to have a stable internet connection on their laptop or game system. I personally ordered 2 to use on both my laptop and PS3. My laptop is in really bad condition. Ive dropped it a couple times and now the wifi card inside either moved out of place of something else inside is causing my wifi not work I have to be sitting right next to my router for my laptop to connect to the wifi. I don't have  money right now to buy a new laptop so buying the ethernet cord was the next best option. My internet speed has increased some and the laptop barely gets disconnected from the network. Although there are random times say around 2am-4am when it will randomly disconnect but a simple restart of the router fixes that issue.  one thing I will say is like many people have said before don't expect this cord to give your laptop or game system a crazy ass boost. That largely depends on your ISP
5,My previous “CAT6” flat Ethernet cable was not providing PoE from my Ethernet switch to my access point. After lots of troubleshooting I replaced it with this and it works perfectly now. It’s a great price and the quality on the cable is very good. The jacket is quite flexible so I was able to properly route it under the mouldings to where I needed it. This is also a TIA/EIA certified cable and can also be used in-wall. I would recommend this cable over others which aren’t. While they may work for basic needs this one is not much more expensive but the quality is much better. It can meet more use cases (such as PoE in-wall installation etc) if you decide to upgrade your equipment/setup later. I had no issues with the other cable I was using until I tried to use POE from my switch. It was a pain to figure out it was the cable that was causing the issue.
5,I was having extreme lag issues with my  wifi/wireless adapter at home. To the point where I wanted to pull my hair out by even just turning it on. I had switched to it originally because my previous wire I had just wouldn't work half the time and eventually just stopped because it broke apart far too easily.I was extremely impressed with the price for this cord. At Wal Mart a simple 50' cord was like $30 and this was less than $10.I've only had it for a few weeks but it works great. I have it going from the living room into my bedroom and it works like it would if it were even just 5' away. I have yet to experience any lag at all and it works 100% of the time.I accidentally slammed it in my door the other day but you couldn't even tell. The material that it is made out of is durable and I don't see it deteriorating anytime soon.I also had an issue with my old cord curling and me tripping over it all the time. This cord just lays there and so far hasn't plotted to trip me.I am overall very happy with this cord and have yet to see a downfall :)
5,This product arrived nicely packaged in a simple box and includes a product & accessories informational pamphlet which includes plenty of contact info for the company and their customer service. For the price I expected a cable in a plastic bag and not much more so I was impressed with what I received.Within a day or two of receiving the cable the manufacturer sent me an email to make sure I was satisfied and to offer human customer support if needed. I just got a second email from them again to see if I was happy and to let me know this was the FINAL unsolicited email they would send and will not be emailing me ad-infinitum. They care about customer satisfaction.The cable itself seems to be designed and built well with a sturdy yet not stiff cable casing that is pliable and does NOT keep its rolled-up curl to dight with--something that irritates me. There is good strain relief rubber at each connector and the connector seems strong and unlikely to break as easily as many have before it.I don't have a single complaint and already feel some brand loyalty. They offer a wide array of other cable types and wireless/Bluetooth accessories.Medialink. A name I'll remember.
5,Used to help connect security cameras. It made it where I didn't have to remove the cameras from the installed location.
5,I liked my previous purchase of Mediabridge so I'm already familiar with this Ethernet Cable. I've had no problems with my previous purchase so I'm not expecting to have any problems with this purchase. I haven't connected it to any tech as of yet. After that I do; I'll rate it at that time. However though I'll rate according to my experience with my previous purchase of the same Ethernet Cable.
5,It works.
5,Purchased this 50ft cable for family overseas. It was used to connect two routers together and was more than adequate for their needs.
5,WORKS PERFECTLY. WOULD RECOMMEND.
2,Length was perfect for running. After getting everything plugged in it was found that the cable can only reach 100 mbps not a gig. I have different cables that I tried just to make sure I didn't do anything wrong but all others ran a gig...this one didn't.
4,The length of the cord does make it easy to get misshaped. However the quality is good and I have faced no connection issues.
5,I been using mediabridge cables for years started buying them when Cat5 was new so what 10-12 years ago they have NEVER failed me. Oh every once in a while the tips at the end that clicks to hold the connector in those sometimes break but not since they went with the never rubber covers on them. I just recently replaced all my Cat5e with their newer Cat6 cables for 3ft to 100ft just happen to like this 50ft blue cable.
5,This cable manages to corral all those little pixies out on the interweb and get them in line to march right into our computer all the way across the room. Amazing!! I would do it again in a heartbeat.
4,A desktop computer hardwired to my wifi.
5,Perfect length. Worked out great for working at home and you have to have direct access to the modem and not disrupt what entertainment set up in the other room. Perfect!
5,Still in box so can’t say other than it was fast shipping good price
2,Box arrived open and securing ties were gone. clearly used and returned.  No confidence that cable is operational.
5,Consistent speeds compared to another advertised cat5e cable. The other cable was 25ft and I bought the 50ft model from Mediabridge. I also bought 100ft of their 16ga speaker wire on the same day and it was a helluva deal as well. Can't go wrong with this. If you're looking at this you might as well pick up this exact cable. I use it on my gaming rig which if I listed the specs would take entirely too long and people might think I'm showing off. Compared to the other cable which was from Cable Matters it is night and day consistency wise and the speeds observed were roughly 30% higher on the download side. Upload was nearly identical just more consistent. I know I keep saying consistent but if you're playing video games often like me you want your connection to be very reliable. Thought I was going to say consistent huh?
5,Well my cats don't chew on it. Guess Cat6 doesn't taste as good as the charging cable for my phone.If your wireless is as bad as mine then you'll probably need a 50 foot Ethernet cable at some point in your life. The cable hookup is on one side of my living room and my computer is in the dining room. I get something terrible like 2mbps when I use my wireless (sometimes it's nice and give me 20mbps and sometimes it'll give me 0.1mbps never mind that I pay for 100). But I strung this cable across my apartment and then BOOM no more lag. I can cheat at video games to my heart's content.
5,We had our 22 year old nephew staying with us for 3 weeks.  His super high tech computer could not be accessed by our wireless.  He asked if we had a cord (as described to us a blue cord).  he and I went on Amazon and ordered the 25 ft cord.  2 days  problem solved.  Time not such an issue he also had an IPad but not his first choice.  He happily took the cord when he left as offered  and I immediately ordered the 50 ft one for our next young guest.  This will reach upstairs to the guest room.  So inexpensive such quick delivery.  If it helps our visitors we can look generous and  suggest they keep it with their travel items. Solved the problem of us older adults not really knowing what the younger tech smart kids are talking about.  Will make sure we have one at the ready at all times.  Easier than trying to understand the explanation of what is the issue.
3,It's not durable if the user plug in and off after 20 times.
5,This is a great bargain. I was running my games off of a WiFi 150 Mbps router and it just wasn't cutting it. My connection would slow down a lot when my sisters would start using the WiFi. I decided to just connect my computer to our router to see if that would help. My connection no longer slows down and I can play my games stream HD movies and download music without it throttling down. I shopped around before I bought this cable from mediabridge and let me tell you you are probably not going to find this cable at this length for any cheaper. Everywhere I looked they were charging 30 to 40 bucks for a 50 foot Ethernet cable. Why spend 20 to 30 dollars more when you can have this one for 10? I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to set up a network in their home or anyone who is tired of their wireless connections slowing down from over use. Overall I was very satisfied with Mediabridge's products and will be buying from them in the future.
5,Works great Fios gigabit customer. Needed to run almost 40 foot of cat 5/5e/6 ethernet cable from my FiOS router to a 5 way splitter. Now my son gets 400-500 Mbs on each hard wired device (load dependant of course). Couldn't have done the job with Mediabridge cables. Also the snag free end was great for fishing thru the wood framing 👍
5,My gaming console was struggling on wifi so I attached it directly to the router with this cable.  Was easy to install and "hide" the cable along the moulding between the two points AND I now get a blazing fast connection for gaming.  Best part was the excellent customer service from Mediabridge.
5,I purchased this product to wire my second AppleTV2 in the basement.  I had been running it on a wireless network but had connection problems because it was on the other side of the house from the router.  Then I got the bright idea that I could just get a long cable like this and plug it into the wired router I use behind the TV on the main level and run it to the TV in the basement with relative ease.  Sure enough the 50 ft cable was the exact length.  No fuss involved.  The no snag connectors are a big plus and the cable is smooth and easy to pull through holes.  I've had no connection problems since installing it.  It may just be my imagination but it does seem a tad slower then the AppleTV2 that is at the router upstairs but it's another 50 ft away from the connection source so I would expect some signal drop.  It's a gigabit network so it's not a big deal.  Videos start without a few seconds of selecting them on the menu.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,Nice!
5,Fantastic. Helps me get my Ethernet through multiple rooms in my home. Very highly quality design. Includes helpful Velcro holder to tidy up extra cable
5,My computer is set up with direct Ethernet and my wife was using hers on WiFi.  She was experiencing so many fluctuations on her internet speed that I purchased this cable to give her direct connection as well.  WOW!!!!  What a difference in signal strength and  signal continuity.The quality of the wire and end connectors is fantastic.  I could not ask for a better product and highly recommend them to everyone that appreciates a top-quality product at a very reasonable price.  (YOU GET VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY)I was impressed by Mediabridge's follow-up after the sale.  I received an email from them prior to delivery that gave me full information on how to contact them if I had a need.  Two week's later a follow-up email simple stated that they appreciated my business and wanted me to have their contact information just in case I lost the first email and needed help.This company truly "stands head and shoulders" above any companies I have bought from.
5,I bought this cable to replace a cable that my basset hound puppy had demolished.  Within 30 seconds of getting this out of the package and unrolling it the puppy had it in her mouth.  I turned my head just for a second and she had it!  Low and behold it held up!!!  She put several deep bites in it and it still works!  I'm sure if left alone with the cable the puppy would have completely bit it in two but I was impressed that it lasted those few seconds.Onto the details.....I ordered it on a Wednesday and it arrived less than 24 hours later on Thursday! WooHoo!!!!  It works like it's suppose to.  The ends seem sturdy.  My last cable the little end clip things snapped off almost instantly.  These seem like they're gonna hold up for a while.What else can I say?  It's an ethernet cable and it works like it's suppose to.  The shipping was unbelievably fast the price was amazing (Wal-Mart charges $25 for a 7 footer) and the puppy hasn't chewed through it yet.  I'm as happy as a tick on a fat dog!
5,A few months ago I ordered 2 of these 50 feet Cat5e patch cables from Mediabridge and they both have been used some periodically since then.  They are less expensive than ethernet cables from other brands of comparable length and they work exactly how ethernet cables should.I recommend this model of ethernet cable to anyone.  Mediabridge's products have mostly five-star feedback on Amazon for a reason.  I also recommend spending the extra dollar or two to get an extra long one ethernet cable such as this one (50 feet).  Having an extra long ethernet cable or two on hand is often helpful.  For example I recently uploaded about 70 video clips to Youtube at one time for educational purposes which (even with fairly high bandwidth internet access) took several hours and I needed a wired connection for its speed and stability.  Having this cable on hand allowed me to have my laptop situated on my desk in a different room from the cable modem for the duration of the project.
5,For the price it worked great i used it to connect all my og xbox's to my router im super happy
4,While it's a very good cable worth the money I would rather use the flat braided cables of today then this older design. Suggest getting a minimum CAT 6 cable if your going to have it awhile and could use the extra bandwidth assuming the devices can utilize the extra bandwidth.
5,I use this for my Xbox and will be using it for my pc as well. So far it’s carrying my gigabit connection great.
4,Good price works as advertised- although the PC and laptop I use two of them for are a few years old so they don't provide 100Mbps throughput- 70Mbps at most via Speedtest.net. Still faster than my wifi. I may have a configuration problem on the older PC. I use these cables for my laptops as well the 2019 laptop gets at least 100Mbps regularly.
5,Arrived on time as stated unfortunately USPS delivery person decided not to walk fifty feet to my front door from the street due to snow (3”) and preferred to leave a note for me to come to post office to pick up. Because of this I actually got the item two days later. I’m using the cable to hardwired signal to my daughter’s Nintendo Switch dock from my gigabytes router and modem and it quadruple the amount of speed versus over the air WiFi I had before. Just make sure you measure the length you need really good because fifty feet once stretch out is not that long if you go from upstairs to downstairs. Good product. Will definitely order item again if the need arises.
5,This is a MUST buy if you are looking for an ethernet cord.  The shipping was EXTREMELY fast (I live in PA) and the reviews were right on.  I ordered the 50 footer simply because it was only a few more dollars than the 25 footer and thank god I did.  I use this cord to connect my Xbox Live and it works flawlessly. I ran it from my Xbox through the drywall into the attic and back down through the drywall to the room where my router is and I just made it; being able to connect and hide all the wires with about 2 feet to spare. I second guessed myself in buying the 50 footer for the reason that it may be too long and/or since it is long the connectivity might not be as good.  Well I was wrong about both. Just a suggestion unless you are going only a couple feet get the 50 footer it can always come in handy and the connectivity isnt an issue. HIGHLY SATISFIED!
5,i have this thing strung all over the place behind pictures over doorways and its just barely long enough to reach my desktop. infinitely better then my wifi dongle get you an ethernet cord if you are sick of being dropped.
5,All Cables that I have ever bought on Amazon have always been the best. On Amazon is where I have learned that a vast majority of retailers make a lot of their money on hawking on the innocent that don't realize this fact. The HDMI cable that you used to buy for $100 is the same one they sell today for 9.99. Cables used to be a racket so let's all thank God that Amazon decided to tell us the truth and sell us cables for what their worth: next to nothing. It's also worth noting that for every salesman trying to convince you how you need platinum this or gold that there's Amazon selling the Gold plated deal for next to nothing.I use this cable for long hauls in a testing enviornment so it's one that gets moved around a lot. The heads are very sturdy with a guard to make sure the clip doesn't get caught up and the cable is well insulated.
5,Was used to move printer closer to my study from the router area.  Works great.
4,Quality duraility price point are all pluses.
5,I bought this cable because I moved my printer to the opposite side of the room and it has been working great not a single issue.
5,Originally I wrote this review and rated it 3 stars: Although this seems to work okay it is much less substantial than the small Ethernet cable that I was replacing because I needed a longer cable.  It feels really flimsy.  But it works.  So I guess it is okay.But then Mediabridge commented that there had been a few counterfeits.  So I sent a picture of the information on my flimsy cable and it turned out that it was a counterfeit.  So Mediabridge sent me a new replacement.  It is a WONDERFUL cable very substantial!  I can't speak highly enough about this company for coming through without me even asking.
4,Good product but I was unable to feed it through the 1/2 conduit in our walls. It wouldn't go through the fitting that attached the flexible conduit to the boxes.  I ended up cutting it on one end and feeding it into the attic and it was too short anyway (I miscalculated the length required to reach the living room from our office.  So I bought another 25 foot length and will cut it also and splice all the wires carefully and solder it up in the attic.  Not so easy but it will work well if I do a good job.  I am an electronic hobbiest so I am sure it will go OK.  Just have to match up the colors since I bought the same brand and same type of cable.
4,Perfect needed to be able to work from home.
5,Great quality no signal loss
5,I needed a long ethernet cable to connect to the router located on the window sill in the other room that I share with the tenant downstairs. The signal is excellent and exactly what I needed.
5,I’m gaming with these on my PS4. I am getting the full 30MBPS that my ISP is rated at giving me. I bought the 50feet and have no issues so far after 4 days of hard gaming. No lag anymore YAY! Cable came very nicely packaged and even has a Velcro strap if you wanted to store it away neatly. Cat6 is fast enough for basically any of your needs and at this price it’s more than worth it over the Cat7 offered.
5,Mediabridge has always been very reliable for us.  I've purchased several times over the years and I was saddened when they disappeared from Amazon for a while.  So glad that they are now back.  Every product I've ever purchased has worked as-described and how could I possibly beat the price of $9.99 for 50 feet of cable?!  That's $0.20 per foot people!  Not sure how they do it but this is a number one product for a reason not just because of the sales but the quality of the product itself.  I honestly only look for Mediabridge products when it comes to ethernet cable for my home and office.  Always reliable and always extremely affordable.  Thanks again Mediabridge and so glad to see you back on Amazon!
5,no complaints.  does as advertised
5,Excellent quality cables I purchased two of these along with a bag of RG6 Dual Cable Clips and just discreetly ran them across my living room (no need to drill holes through your walls). The length was plenty and the speed of my connection was not compromised at all. I used one of these cables on a desktop PC for streaming HD video and just general internet use.The main reason for obtaining these cables was to use for broadcasting on a PS4 system across the room from my internet modem. My connection now worked perfectly as compared to just wirelessly I was now able to broadcast HD video for almost 5 hours with no connection interruption (I had to take a break).I would definitely recommend these and purchase again.
5,Arrived on time we'll packaged and performed as expected. What more could you ask for!
5,It's just an ethernet cord.  Not much to say about it.  We have 1GB fiber connection and the computer connected with it through our router gets the same speeds as the rest of the PCs in the house and the price was great.
5,Well made and sturdy plus handles the job it was purchased for .
5,Just got it but I like that the it has a built in light indicator and is heavy duty. It also have a solid clip lock .Time will tell if it holds up but so far I’m happy for the price!
4,Great value for the money so far the cable has held up after a few months. Only downside is the outer layer is not flexible therefore it crunches up fairly quick and quite noticeable.
5,These have been my goto for network cabling.  Happy with every one I have purchased.
5,Cable arrived within a couple days and was professionally packaged and wrapped.  The extra length is just what I needed.  The connections snap in quickly and are very tight...they do not wiggle around and lose connections occasionally like my last cable.  Reception is same as it has been at about 250 but that is the max I pay for with my provider so would not be able to exceed that anyway.  I would recommend this cable to anyone.  Great product and quick and professional service.
5,Works great. High speed ethernet cable for my hard wired set up. Doest drop connection. Great for gaming.
5,Worked as promised and as needed. Good value. Shipped fast and no problems at all. Highly recommend
5,Going on about 4 years with using this cable and I have had zero problems. I use it on my PlayStation 4 and my download mbph had went from about 35 mbph on WiFi to 350 mbph on the cable. But that’s mostly because of my internet provider but it is still a really good product as I have had no problems with this cable through the 4 years I’ve had it!
5,Works as it should.
5,I got this Ethernet cable one day in advance and was surprised at how much cord was left ( I got more than I expected - which isn't bad but you should measure how much you need first). It works perfectly - I noticed immediately how my download speeds increased - as opposed to just using "wifi"( for it was with wifi = 2.0 mbs - and with ethernet = 8.0 mbs small I know but depending on your ISP this changes). It clips in to the socket of my pc really snug and my router/modem ( I have comcast ). I only wish I could have changed the wire color... All in all - great choice for an ether net cable;  WAAAY less expensive than buying one from say Walmart or a regular hardware store.Absolutely would recommend.
4,Good product
5,WiFi wasn’t working for our gamer. This cable gave him the fast response he needed. Great buy.
5,The blue color helps people see it so they don’t trip over it and the conductivity is perfect. Great speed and reception.
5,First I just have to say I am completely thrilled with this product.  Let me give you a little back round.  I purchased my Xbox 360 for my children and I wanted to watch Netflix through my Xbox until I found out you have to upgrade to Xbox Gold which has a monthly fee.  I was not going to pay for that.  Not when I have to pay a monthly fee for Netflix.  So I realized I could watch it through my Smart u-Ray Player.  Well I needed a long Ethernet cable to reach from my upstairs to my basement.  So stupidly I went to best buy and they wanted 60.00!!!!!!  Absolutely NOT!!!!  So I decided look on Amazon and only $8.00!!!!! I was so happy I brought it that second and It works GREAT!!!  Thanks so much Mediabridge Products:)
5,Works great. Very long cord that reaches from my bedroom to the living room easily. Speed is great. No complaints. Good buy.
4,This cable definitely does its job and is good for use in scenarios where you need this kind of length in an ethernet cable. However I have to knock off a star because most aspects of the cable do feel a bit cheaper which could work against the long term operation of the cable however ethernet cables have been made for so long now and the standards are so well known to the manufacturers that I'm sure it will be fine plus it won't cost that much to replace in the worst case scenario anyways. Overall a good cable but definitely not a premium one.
4,Plugged it in and it works.  Can't complain much about it.  I put the cable modem in the closet and hook this into a small 7-port switch next to my TV where I hook up my Chromecast NAS PC laptop dock XBOX etc.  On the XBOX One I still get ping times of 16ms which is better than when it was on wifi of course.  So basically it's not saying the cable is special but it's saying that it works over a 1Gbps connection as I expected it to for a great price.
5,Talk about a lifesaver. This has changed my gaming sessions. Get mommy’s credit card and get good kid
5,No issues works as it should  good value for the money!
5,I have been having problems with my TIVO for a few weeks.  It simply would not update.  I was using wireless but the computer and wireless were in another room and the TIVO download was too large (according to TIVO reps) and the wireless not strong enough to push the download through.  I finally bought this cable figuring it would be less expensive than a new wireless (that worked quite well generally).  I was worried about signal loss over the long run through the house but it doesn't seem to have lost anything.  My TIVO updated and I was able to remove the cable and store it until the next overly large update attempts to come through.  I was quite happy with the cable and the price.
5,There is nothing special probably about this cable.  It did what I wanted it for thickly shielded good connectors no problems.  Good enough price. Problem is I recently bought all kinds of media bridge HDMI rca splitters cables etc. and some of them solved HUMMM problems with subwoofers so ofc I went that way when I saw they made ethernet cables.  Am no less impressed just need you know my confirmation bias. Irregardless think you would like this cable.  For the price.
5,Works perfectly. Signal has been very reliable and steady. I use it for my work computer for a VPN connection and LOTS of video conferencing and it's been flawless.
5,YOU SAVED ME!For some reason my internet at my new place is spotty. They told me it would be faster than my old place (much faster) and that is just... not the case! The wireless is absolute crap.However it works ok with an ethernet cord but I can't move my router around the house and I refuse to be stuck in the kitchen where the stupid router has to be!This cord is long enough I can literally go anywhere in my apartment and use ethernet internet. It's so fast and it shipped fast and it absolutely is the best purchase I've made in a long time.YAY GIANT ETHERNET CORD! HAIL INTERNET!
4,For gaming
5,Good quality cable. I was able to run it from my router in the living room to the basement and up to the second floor where my gaming computer is. Speed test is 490mps.
5,just what we wanted
5,I have three of the 50' cables installed one for a printer and two for TV's.  All work perfectly and I detect no attenuation in bandwidth.  That said if you have a situation where running cables will be difficult and your device can operate on the 5 ghz band and you have (or buy) a decent router that operates on that band you might find the better bandwidth at 5 ghz (compared to 2.4 ghz) obviates any need for hard wiring.  Of course if you are worried about the signal being intercepted that's another matter.
5,The cable arrived a day before expected. It appears to be well made and it provides the expected high speed data transfer on my LAN. The bright blue color makes it highly visible so I'm less likely to trip on it.
5,Just as pictured and good quality.
5,I have had this ethernet cord for about a month and I have not had any issues.  It works has a strong signal coming thru it and works just fine for my work from home job.
5,It's a cable either it works or it doesn't simple as that who cares if it says monster on the insulation or its double quadruple triple shielded with some wire made out of exotic metal alloy it's a frickin Ethernet cable why pay $30 for the possibility of slightly faster speed. If it was audio cable I could justify spending top dollar but just no way for an Ethernet cableBought it to hook my PS4 right into the router instead of using the wifi for whatever reason the wifi is sketchy on my PS4 maybe it's where it's located don't really care what the reason is or have any desire to figure it out five minutes of my time running the cable and Problem solved.
5,good cable smooth gaming
5,When I got this i was like BOOYAH TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT!  I was so excited!  When i finally used it and got amazing data speeds!  I was like triple BOOYAH TIGHT TIGHT!  I love the way it looks.  The copper conductor with its high bandwidth speed is super tight.  The only thing i don't like is the little rubber things on the plug.  But EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SUPER TIGHT!
5,This is my second time purchasing this item. Works excellent with no issues on both purchases.
5,Both ends plugin like they're supposed to. Seems to be decent quality no indication it's not.
5,I have purchased several Mediabridge cables at this point. No reason for me to have selected the brand at first. Was just based on price vs. what I needed. I'm no cable expert but I can say that I haven't had any problems with any of them. I continue to buy from Mediabridge when I need something not only because the cables seem to be of good quality but also because of the service. I get an email from them shortly after a purchase. Just a thank you for the business and an offer to assist should I have any questions. Doubt I will ever need the help but really nice that they offer. Little things like that is why I end up be loyal to a specific brand/seller.
5,I purchased in Dec. of 2016 to hardwire my son's gaming systems in the basement.  He was complaining of the WiFi speeds.  The run was pretty long and of the 50' cable have about 6" to spare!  I tested the cable with a laptop and we are not losing any speed.  We ran speed tests from the PS4 and Xbox One S and also hitting 50MB down 6MB up.  The boy is happy and I don't see any reason why the cable will not last for a long time.  It is plugged into a switch and fixed will not be touched at all.
4,It was the exact length needed for the job.
5,Comes in a nice solid cardboard box. Package came with velcro cable tie nice little bonus. I use this for when I want to game and wifi is not good enough; I roll this out through the house from router to PC then pack it up after my session. Cable is durable and has secure locking mechanism for ports. No complaints. Simple and effective.
5,no more wifi woes with this fab cord.  i can circle my office with cable now if i wanted to!
5,Decent quality snag less . Well pressed contacts.
4,Because I have to work from home now got this cable because my company laptop (HP) has has WIFI connections problems. Cable is a definite improvement. I would recommend this product.
5,The Mediabridge ethernet cable is very duarable and works well with the wifi signal.
5,Our sons used it to run under the house to their room to directly connect their xbox and get off wifi. It has been some time since it was installed and is working flawlessly to this day. The shielding is thick and the ends are of a high quality too. I would buy again and recommend it to anyone looking for one.
5,I needed to connect an older laptop with a bad wifi card to my modem. The modem was in a different part of the house. This did the job beautifully. Good strong signal and the cable was easy to manipulate. I used Command removable wall mounts to raise the cable above head level for safety in the hallway. I tried just moving the modem but the cabling in the front room was either disconnected or had transmission issues. Thus the 50 ft Mediabridge cable met my needs beautifully.
5,The product came in a box great condition and as described. I use it to run it from my kitchen to my living room connecting the modem and Play Station 4. The length is more then enough and it has been working great!I was told by a technician from my Internet provider that it would cost me $80 for him to connect the modem and PS4 via ethernet cable. So I got online and started looking for 30-50 ft cable that do not cost a fortune. This was by far the cheapest I could possibly find. Saved so much money and it's easy to use. Sturdy and does not tangle. Love it!
5,So I purchased 2 of the 100 foot Ethernet cables around 6 months ago then we got a new dog who decided that they were delisious. Deciding that those had been way too long I purchased 2 of the 50 foot cables instead this time.They work great making sure my Hopper 3 and XBox 360 stay connected to the internet at all times. Were havent had ANY problems with buffering or lagging since headlining our products.Now it doesn't matter if my kids are eating all the Wi-Fi band with I can still download and binge watch Game of Thrones to my hearts content.
5,I bought this cable to run through the attic of my garage before I bought bulk wire and ends and started making my own cables...it worked great.
5,I am very satisfy with this product. The item is perfectly prescribed by the seller. After 5 years of wireless connection the wired connection works 10 time better on the game console Xbox one and Xbox 360! No more lagging issues!
5,Hahahahah did not read or comprehend what 50 ft actually means. I got it and realized the mistake I made. Still great quality and easy to use. Just it’s 50 ft and I was using it for my dorm room.
5,Bought this for working at home perfect length
5,This cable is very long. I brought a 50 ft cable because I want to move my router near my room. The cable modem is place in the living room and therefore the signal of my router is not great there. So I brought this cable to bring my router closer to where I use my laptop the most. It covers the enter house length with ease. The cable feels really sturdy. It works well and cheap. Highly Recommended!Pro:1) Very long cable that can reach almost anywhere in your house2) It is sturdy and work great3) It is cheap for the amount of cable you get.
5,Bought this because my router hates my Xbox 360 and I needed to connect it directly to the router. Which was against a different wall.Pros1. It feels well made. Heavy cable and the connectors feel like they'll last a while.2. 50ft of cable was way too much but hey it'll come in handy if I ever move.3. I like blue.Cons1. None.There are some things where you get what you pay for. This is one of those rare instances where I feel like I got more than I paid for. It earned its high rating. The company even emailed me after delivery to make sure the cable was okay. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,Great value for the money. No issues what so ever.
5,At the time of this review I've had this cable for about two months. It's been working great. I was able to run it along my ceiling fairly easily.
5,I purchased this product because I needed an ethernet cable that was long enough to reach my room and connect directly to the router without compromising the connection. I hooked this up directly to my TV and my laptop and was able to get max speeds without and connection issues. I can cast 4k quality videos on my TV without a hitch and I can do the same on my laptop through USB-C. I've purchased more expensive cables from Walmart in assorted lengths that are terrible. This ethernet cable is a worthy and reliable investment for your internet usages.
5,I needed this because upstairs wifi would slow yo a stop downloading 3 and 4g files. No problem using this from my pc to switch. I’ve maade hundreds of cables but for the price of 50 ft alredy terminated and amazon prime free and next day shipping it was well worth me not having to bother making my own.
5,I used the product for working from home
5,So thankful for this cable as it has saved me from my terribly inconsistent wireless router. I love knowing that when my internet is out I can take the piss out of my ISP instead of Belkin. I probably have this thing making a few turns that are too tight but it's still working like a champ.I have this cable connected to another shorter cable with just a double female adapter and I get about 65 Mbps on my computer. not actually sure what I pay for though.
5,Needed the length so I could move my desk into another room. Signal strength still same high  quality. Great price too.
5,I ordered this item worried about receiving a counterfeit product but I received a genuine product / exactly what I ordered. The cable came in a box clearly labeled Mediabridge. Also the cable itself has Mediabridge written on it at regular intervals.The quality of the cable I received is good. I have been using this cable with my Xbox One. The speed I am seeing during internet speed tests is almost exactly what I pay for from my ISP. I have no complaints. I've been using it for several days without any issues at all.
5,I bought this cable to hook my Xbox 360 up to the internet after having numerous issues with interference with my system's built in wifi and moving the Xbox closer to the router really isn't an option for me.I was a little concerned with the quality of this cable since it is very inexpensive and due to its length. After having used it for a few weeks though my fears have vanished!!!Not only do I have a much better connection in my games but my streaming Netflix movies and shows no longer have video quality changes due to varying signal strength!!!The build quality seems okay. I don't think it could hold up to constant plugging and unplugging but what do you expect for the price?If you need a long ethernet cable for gaming or video streaming I say forego its more expensive counterparts and pick this baby up. You won't regret it!!!
3,I wasn't sure exactly how many stars I should give this.  Upon arrival the cord looked great and like it would hold up.  Its a 50 foot Mediabridge Ethernet cable in the color blue.  It was definitely long enough to reach through the house from the router to the room it needed to get to for hooking internet up to the computer in my son's room.  It did go under two sets of doors but the doors didn't in any way smash the cord or even kink it.  Around day 3 we noticed the cord started to look stressed almost as if it was coming apart already.  We had this cord placed behind things and under carpets to minimize wear and tear from people walking on it.  About a week after receiving the cord it broke completely in half and was obviously unable to be used any longer.  I am just happy this cord was fairly cheap because it lasted us no time at all.
4,Its a fine product.Does what its supposed to do.The casing is some what thin and the cord seems thinner then what AT&T hooked up to the wall when they installed my internet but it seems to be fine.Its very flexible so it goes around walls and joints quite well.I haven't cut it open to see if its twisted copper coated wire which its suppose to be so I don't know if what the seller say's is true on the quality but so far I haven't seen any hick ups with it and I bought 2 of theses to run a 100' length stretch through my housebut Its been only one day so far. For the price though you can't go wrong.Heck try buying this at Best buy at this price ya good luck.
4,Ordered this 50 foot cable to upload software from my router to my mounted smart TV.  I was concerned with the the distance but was very satisfied with the quality and the end results. No problems at all.  You can tell the manufacturing of the product is well done and the packaging was great as well.  Shipped on time as was expected.  I would highly recommend any of their products.
5,This 50 foot Ethernet cable is the right length for nearly any situation. I had previously purchased a 15 foot one for my dormroom but because it had to wrap around the room it was too short; I am now living in an apartment and I actually have it hooked up to my router in another room. The price is excellent and I haven't had any issues using it for over a year now. If you need a good Ethernet cable look no further!Unless you have meticulously planned your room such that the cable can be 15 feet this cable is better for nearly every other situation. Spend the extra dollar or two and get something that can be used in more situations.
5,Works great looks like pic.
5,This product works great.
5,I purchased this cable on Amazon to have on hand just "in case" I had a problem with wifi in the future.  I don't think I had it a week when my computer couldn't connect to the internet.  I tried all the settings etc. and did everything I knew to remedy the problem.  It became evident I would have to call Dell Support and boy was I glad I had this cable since they can connect to your computer over the internet.  My problem was solved!  The cable was plenty long to reach any computer in the house and I was amazed at the great quality of the cable particularly for the price.  You can't go wrong with this cable and I highly recommend having one on hand for the unexpected problem even for when you need the fastest speed with a direct connect.  Great product!
5,The cable was really good quality and is very heavy duty. Its really long but its manageable. Surprising it doesn't curl up over time by twisting on the cable.
5,We needed a super long ethernet cord for our home to run underneath the house. Our router is located by the only phone jack in the room and our computer is on the other wall. For the longest time we were walking over a short cord we dangerously had just laying across the floor waiting to take out unsuspecting visitors. So happy with my purchase. We now have this ethernet cable running under the house through an inconspicuous hole we drilled in the floor. Length is great and we have more than enough lengthwise. Haven't had any connection issues so far.
5,Works great. Took a guess on the length I needed and happened to be right.
4,Good cable not a 'cheap kind a works' cable. I purchased this cable to go between an amp head and footswitch (guitar items). I used other cables (more expensive) that did not work correctly thought something was wrong with the amp head at first until I discovered it was cheap cables that could not handle the load. This cable is working great for what I use it for.
5,Good quality well made. Worked fine.
4,Needed the length.
4,Works good so far
5,I haven't had a cord quite as durable so far for hanging around. It's signal is pretty dang good and works great for my PS4. Normally the other cords I grab from retail stores always seem to get a "spike" of latency when watching movies or gaming but with this one I haven't ran into that problem.Pros:+Works exceptionally well+Great Price+RealibleCons:None so far after 2 weeks
5,The cable is surprisingly well made considering its lower than average price.  The speed and consistency of the cable's signal is great.  I read many positive reviews about it as well as many negative ones and I was uncertain.  Having bought it though my concerns were unfounded.  The cable is absolutely great and it does indeed deliver the gigabit connection it promises if your network is capable of it
5,I like
5,Went from 30 to 40 ping now i run 10 to 20 good for gaming
5,Very good cable for a great price.  My definition of "very good" is not based upon electrical characteristics...which as far as I can tell are fine...but instead quality/mechanical instruction.  This terminal ends of this cable are definitely constructed better than average which is a fantastic feature at this price.  I just "pulled" this cable through a pretty long run...with some definitely twists/turns/tight spots along the way...and it survived just fine...I just put a little electrical tape over the front to keep the locking tab down....and I now have a 50ft home run from router to computer.
5,For the price i was afraid of buying this but has been working great so far at 100+ megabytes a second downloads. Seems a good price for 50 ft.
5,Good cable for the price
5,I haven't had the need to buy a 25+ feet cable for a very long time. Last I did something like this still costed like 40+ dollars. I was pleasantly surprised to find this at about 10 bucks. A quick search on google also shows that it's a reputable brand so I pulled the trigger. Glad I did! It works just as intended no loss of speed. More color options would be nice. Overall great purchase!
5,well they worked great for a day or so to separate my modem from my router but then it crashed not sure if it was the cables or my equipment.
5,I needed a cable to connect my printer to the internet. It needed to communicate with HP the status of my ink supply. For whatever reason the printer was not doing this wirelessly. I couldn't physically move it to the modern so I ordered this cable. It  worked well. I disconnected it until the next time I need it. It arrived earlier on the day than expected. That was a plus. It came in a sturdy box just the right size for storage.
5,I needed the 50 ft. length to snake through a lot of rooms to reach my computer. It unraveled easily and is a lightweight but sturdy cord. I was able to weave it underneath furniture and under my carpets and it is just perfect. I can watch movies better on my Mac lap top and not get any messages that I do not have enough power. It has taken a lot of frustration out of that for me. I am so glad I bought it.
5,i was in need of an ethernet cable to connect my xbox one to my router which was far away. i was playing online using wifi and i kept getting kicked off my internet. it was frustrating for me so i decided to buy this one which was more than enough length for me and my problems were gone. my internet was not only keeping me from going offline at random times but it increased my internet speed on my xbox one. i highly recommend this to people looking to get themselves an ethernet cable.
5,Would buy again
5,Ran a 50ft from my modem to my router and another 50ft to my desktop for direct connection. Speeds are very good. Quality construction. Would buy again!
5,This has helped with my speeds so much I thought it was my signal but this cord is well made and is doing the job just fine.
5,The Meidabridge ethernet cable can be utilized by any person or family that uses wifi on a regular basis. This cord in particularly is 50 feet long so it can reach from your internet box to a more convenient location. Being directly hooked up to the wifi box improves wifi capability and performance.Perks of the ethernet cable:1. Faster better gaming experience2. Reliability (Skype interviews online exams--times when you really don't want your internet disconnecting!)3. 50 feet of flexibility so you don't need to sit right next to the box.Would definitely recommend to a friend.
4,I had these lining my apartment from the living room (we had an Xbox set up to a projector out there) and two bedrooms. Under the door these kind of got really frayed (but somehow they function well? SO that is a bonus). The dog also chewed straight through one (not Mediabridge's fault but it was a puppy so it goes to show how durable this cable is).Solid product I would buy from Mediabridge again but I am just warning you that if you plan on traveling a lot or want your cable to withstand abuse then this might not be the cable for you.
5,This is my first experience with wireless technology. I recently bought an iPad and so I wanted wireless internet access in my house. I read the reviews on this Medialink router and they were mostly positive. I have a Comcast/Xfinity broadband modem installed in my basement along with my PC. I followed the instructions (very simple) and within 10 minutes I was up and running with my wireless internet access. It's nice to be able to sit on my couch upstairs and access my email via my iPad. I even used the wireless access for my LG 55' LED smart TV works great. I have had the unit installed for a week now and no problems. This is a great wireless router for someone that is not a network savvy person just a typical casual user of the internet.
5,I needed a long CAT5 cable to run into the attic and connect my router to other systems since my home did not have CAT5 running throughout. I was presently surprised when opening the box. The cable was cleanly rolled and came with a velcro tie. It sounds simple but I felt the reliable product sense when installing the cable.
5,This was for my daughter's school Chromebook that had trouble connecting to our WIFI.  My son (our in-home computer guru) set it up but she said it works and the cord is long enough to stretch from the cable  (or WIFI box not sure how he connected it) to her bedroom and it works.  My son said longer cords aren't as good but all I know is that this one (50 ft.) works.
4,Did the job
5,I do most of my work via Skype so having stable upload speeds is a must.  I purchased several of these 50ft cables for my network and they're working like a charm.  The connectors on both ends are solid and protected by a rubberized flap.  The cables appear sturdy and were easy to affix to my baseboards and run under my floor mats to prevent a tripping hazard.  The cables arrive in hassle free cardboard packaging which I prefer over bags or hard plastic for this length.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.
5,They work as expected with decent speed on my network! I would buy again.
5,IT arrived quickly looks great and is working fine.  not sure what else to say.
5,Great deal on a long lenth high speed top CAT5e cable.  I use this for my 100//100 mbps connection and after speed testing it over the stock cable that came with my router I am actually achieving slightly better results. If you're skeptical of the difference a good quality ethernet cable can  make I advise you to do a bit of research online if you're doing high data-load work.  Try [...] to see what your connection speed is providing before you replace a lesser cable with this high quality one. Highly recommended.
5,Good quality cable & my gaming performance has improved greatly since switching from wifi to Ethernet.
5,Continues to function after about a year's worth of use.
5,Quick delivery works as expected. Recommended
5,I replaced an older cable with the new media bridge cable and my Wi-Fi speed quadrupled even at a distance.
5,Home office work computer use.  Came earlier than promised which is a plus...just as advertised it works great.  it is a good valued product.
5,Bought this years ago. Still use it today. Great for gaming but if you are hard wired you would not need to use wifi.
5,Just what I needed!! Couldnt get internet to my Back bedroom from where my Modem is in the front of the house Bought this 50ft ethernet stretched it as far as the connection from the modem was still strong and solid and What do ya know! Now I can use my New RCA Roku stick installed TV with Excellent strength! I searched hours and Hours for a Solution to my problem and My son suggested I give this a Try and It was just right!! And a lot cheaper than other avenues I was thinking of trying!!  Thanks guys!!
5,Needed a hardline for my work computer for temporarily working from home.  Works as expected.  Great value definitely recommend.
5,Perfect.  Exactly what was needed. Arrived early.  Works as it should and plenty long enough.
5,Product does exactly what it’s needed to do. Doesn’t get any easier than plugging it in & reaping the benefits! Much better than relying on WiFi as well!
5,Internet speeds as fast as your system offers -- even with a 50 foot cord.  Delighted.
5,Wire still faster than wireless.. good for office use
5,I needed to directly connect my laptop to my router but needed a very long cable. I have been doing video calls weekly sometimes even daily. This cable helped reach the length of my apartment
5,Length of cord; good value
5,Definitely super functional. My work required it but was to set up for someone not familiar with computers.
5,The cable works as advertised its nice and sturdy and its great for getting to those areas that need internet! I had a desktop that was able to pick up WiFi but it was at a ridiculously slow speed since the router was at the other side of the hallway. Using this Ethernet cable solved all my problems and now my internet speeds are nice and fast.Pro Tip: Make sure you measure the amount of cabling that you need before purchasing or else you'll run short!
4,As described.
5,I needed a long LAM Cable for working at home.  This cable worked great was a high-quality construction shipped fasts and help stabilize my video conferences.  Thanks and would buy it again.
5,A great Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable works perfectly and the 50 feet was the exact length that we needed. I like the rubber protector that goes over the insert clip that way my son cannot break it as easily. I need to buy another and I have what I need right here in this Ethernet cord. White would be great though. Thank you for having what I needed at 1/2 the price of my local store.  Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable (50 Feet) - RJ45 Computer Networking Cord - Blue
5,Despite what people may think there can be significant differences in the quality of CAT cables.The   Mediabridge - Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (50 Feet)         is an excellent cable. The cable sheathing is thick yet flexible. The connectors are excellent also. My biggest gripe with Ethernet cables is that the connectors can be short (making them difficult to unplug once plugged in) and the exposed clips often break. The Mediabridge has nice long connectors and also have a small protector over the clips which make them easier to unplug. These may seem like minor points until a cheap connector breaks and 50 feet of cabling winds up in the garbage. Yeah you can replace the connector but often at a significant loss of transfer quality. Oh I like the blue cable color too.
5,Works really well.
5,Used to run to my TV from router throu attic. Working perfectly
5,Just what I needed!!
5,An excellent product. It worked just as described
4,It works as you would think. Great signal and great value. Only thing is that it's not very durable so don't treat it rough.
5,Although it was never my intention to use a cable this long on a long term basis I had need for one for occasional use.  The great price for this cable made that possible as I'd hate to spend a lot of money for something I rarely used.  The extra protection provided for the exposed plastic catch is an additional bonus as I was also concerned about that part breaking off as has happened to me in the past.  This is just a great product and well worth the price!
5,I have cable internet and the speeds are super fast now. With this cable my speeds are triple what my wifi can do. The cable has been used for gaming and PC sometimes with the router having three other active data cables at the same time with no latency issues. I've had it 3 months and no issues happy with the purchase.This is cat5 cableI've used all kinds and they all can kink pay attention and this will last you a long time.
5,Due to repeated problems with my Wifi network I decided to buy this cable to connect my PC to the Comcast router in the other corner of the living room. The cable seems to be of good quality mechanically very flexible but not too thin with connectors that don't break or fall apart when you disconnect and reconnect them a few times. And the signal strength is good enough to indicate a speed of 28 Mbps on speedtest.net which must be close to the speed I am supposed to get from Comcast and much faster than any speed I have seen with the Wifi connection. In conclusion this is a very good cable for the price.
5,No issues with the cable connecting my Router to my Switch in the months I have had it.  However Amazon Basic offers the same type of cable cheaper.
5,Fast ship great communication professionally packaged. This purchase was for business use. Length was perfect so wasn't the quality of the product.  Works absolutely perfectly.Strongly recommend. If you can satisfy me then you can satisfy anyone Yes I am that fussy.Anthony.HBurlington MA.
5,Works great!!
4,Great cable.  Probably ordered a little too long for what we needed but 25ft was too short and I was not aware We have the slowest high speed they have with our provider so my son uses the cable to connect to xbox live and so forth.  We purchased this cable in Dec of 2013 and today it stopped working which means it did not last a year.  Sadly I am having to order a cable again.  This is why the 4 stars and not 5.
5,Had a difficult feed in my house (thru walls floor etc. so I protected the end of the cable by using a large tube through which I fed the cable. After the job was done I hooked up the computer to the cable and voila! the internet came right up so your cable was a big success. I was also pleased with the good price on the cable. I will keep your name in my vendor list and if Amazon.com doesn't handle a product you have that I want I will order direct.Jim Reynolds Mountlake Terrace WA
5,Perfect for my home office. Works as its supposed to.
5,Even with the new fiber optic service I have for internet now my WiFi connection didn't stream at the speed it should have.  Not that 19 or 20 mbps is bad but I'm paying for 30.  After putting a great deal of time and effort into trying to increase the speed wirelessly to my computer I finally decided to connect the old fashioned way...with cable.  This ethernet cable now delivers 30 to 33 mbps to my laptop.  I can also connect it to my ROKU player for faster movie downloads.  Sometimes the old was is still the better way.
5,This cable was purchased to resolve the wireless connectivity issues for a supposedly wireless blu-ray player.  We purchased and returned three different units from three different manufacturers-Sony Samsung Panasonic-because the wireless connection was constantly lost and each time had to be reprogrammed to find the wireless connection.  This occured even though we have the most advanced and best reviewed wireless router on the market which is located only 15 feet away from the blu-ray player. This cable completely solved this connectivity problem. An added bonus is that Netflix no longer buffers during long movies it just plays all the way through without buffering like it did when it was connected wirelessly.  I would definitely recommend the Mediabridge Cat5e ethernet cable to anyone looking for an inexpensive ethernet cable.
5,Our router is located by our desktop in the back room over 30’ away and around corners and walls. We’ve had problems w downloading and streaming to our tv using the smart tv apps. This connection takes away the hiccups of buffering or dropping programs. Easy to connect and run along the path on walls and corners and through a doorway.
5,life saver fixed the weak signal strenght
4,Nice and long.  As described
5,I've purchased this brand before and love it.  I have the 25' and now the 50'.  Cable is sturdy and the couplers are solid.  I'm not a tech geek but these cables are working for me.  I've wired my old house to connect directly from the modem to the computers.All is well and these cables more than adequately do the job.  Thanks!
5,I needed a long Ethernet cable to run from my home office to my living room and kitchen for my laptop. I have a home based business that requires a lot of Internet usage for research and recipes and if I had to get very far from my router I'd start dropping my wifi signal despite having a good router. This cable works perfectly and is a great length. I love how thick the coating is and the protective tips. My only complaint is that the cord likes to wind up like a telephone cord which has caused some crimped spots but it still works perfectly so I'm still happy.
3,The price was comparable with box stores. The cable was easy to uncoil and to layout. I didn’t see any problems with speed degradation. However  I am rating this product lower because of removal issues. The connectors are hard to remove from your computer or modem. If fact I one still in my computer I can’t remove without breaking one or the other.
5,Work's as expected. No complaints here!
5,The cable was exactly what I needed to connect my printer that I had moved across my office.  I have not noticed any drop in efficiency.  I did not rate the cable for gaming as I did not use it for that purpose.
5,Perfect for what we needed! Great quality and great price!
5,I purchased these cables for IP cameras and like the quality.  These are not the cheap thin cables but are rugged enough when running cable thru attics and walls.  I have purchased several 50 ft. cables so far and no issues.  Will buy again.
5,Ran this under the floor to connect to another computer and it works just fine. Zero complaints.
5,Purchased to run from our router to the smart tv. We were having delay issues with WiFi not all the time but once in a while so we ran this direct through the basement to the router and it worked perfect. Movie nights were a hit again!
5,Needed a long run for a video streaming project and this cable delivered excellent performance at a good price.
5,I like vanilla ice cream the best
5,Works great for working at home
5,Cable works fine.
5,Wifi signal value for money and for gaming
5,Above all the price is what stands out about this product. It works great and seems to be made of high quality components. My only complaint is that even though I have had it unwound for a number of days now it still wants to retain kinks and curl up in spots. I'm sure if you were to install it for good it would be fine.
5,It does what I need it to do happy with it! :)
5,Liked the cable just fine. The reason I ordered another one was that the dog used it as a chew toy and it was too late to stop him. Other than thatI'm very happy with the cable . Good product good price.
5,Mediabridge has always been a reliable brand to buy from to me another quality product and I'll buy from you next time I need an ethernet cable.
5,Its an ethernet cable as i ordered. I didnt measure it.It works. What else do you want me to say?The cord was the most beautiful tone of off-blue
5,This cord was the perfect length that I needed. I had searched for one at the store and it was over double the price that I paid here. I used it to hook my television to the internet which had to be run under the floor and up to our modem. We kept losing our signal when we used wireless and have had perfect service since hooking it up direct.Very happy with the cable and have had no problems with it. Love that the length is 50 ft. Perfect size for running longer distances.
5,Arrived on time. I needed This to hook up my PS4 through LAN my LAN is in the next room over so we drilled a hole to pass the wire through. Works like a charm NO MORE LAG to very minimal when my ping randomly goes up but it is no longer a lag due to my wi fi connection. Love the fast streaming too when I'm watching Netflix Hulu Amazon prime etc.
5,I ordered the Ethernet Cable for my son to use for his gaming system and his room is not close to our router. It arrived from Amazon.com quickly  easily and at a great price. We like the color blue because it is easier to see than the gray one we had to replace. I soon received an email from Mediabridge Products to check on its arrival and quality which is something I highly appreciate in customer service.  Thank you.
4,Works just as expected especially when watching videos online or downloading a document. It's really faster internet. The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because for some reason whenever I played online even though my ping was lower I ended up receiving lags things I did not experience when I connected to the wifi.Overall it does it's job well when using the internet for other things.
5,I don't  usually give five stars for anything but this wire is very well constructed.  Good and well designed strain relief injection molded to the clear plastic RJ-45.  The wire is more flexible than I have seen with some others--nice to handle.  All and all  this is a really nice product and I would buy it again in an instant.
5,Works as supposed to. No complaints  and tabs did not snap while using them.
5,I bought a new computer but wanted to keep my one one on the basement and still access the internet.  I made an ethernet cable but it didn't work.  Not easy to troubleshoot with one end in the den and the other the basement . This solved my problem. Looks to be quality construction.
5,Bought this to connect a Tablos (OTA antenna transmitter to my home wifi).  Was having buffering issues using the Tablos wireless feature so decided to do a hard wire.  Ordered 50ft only need 35ft.  I have the extra coiled behind a desk.  Product solved the buffering issue and is working fine.  A++
5,My dog murders the ethernet cable in protest when we leave him alone sometimes. I think I've bought this cable like 4 times now. It's nice and inexpensive and I seem to get good results from it when the dog doesn't eat it. Would be interested in a dog-proof cable if you guys are looking for niche markets.
4,I was surprised at the nice cardboard box with fancy printed labels that these cables came in.  I was expecting your usual bundle of cable in a plastic bag or a chintzy cardboard backed display pack.  It was almost like an iPad "unboxing".  The cables are good quality.  The only down side I've noticed is that they're just a hair tight in both my router and my cable modem and from my router to my machine.  I had to tug quite a bit to unplug and replug them but I don't do that often.
5,I didn't want to review this cable right away because we've had Ethernet cables in the past that didn't last. This one I'm happy to say is not only performing well it is not showing any sign of cracking or damage at any time even though family members are stepping on pretty often.
5,i've had the ethernet cable for 3 months now and it works great is still in great condition i unhook it and move it to different rooms every day for gaming and it is durable it has a good reach so it can go from my dsl modem to any room in the house it was at a good price too
5,Ethernet cable worked great for tele-working with a desktop requiring hard line connection. Response is really good and no system latency. Well made cable...not thin junk.
5,Very good and sturdy cable.
5,Excellent cable for use as a feline chew toy. The build quality is pretty high which my cat really seems to enjoy. The ends are quite strong which is good as I don't want my cat eating hard plastic bits. 50 feet is long enough for me to run around the entirety of my small apartment bedroom but not long enough to feed more than two cats.10/5 would buy from PetSmart.
5,Exactly as described! Don't stupidly pay 50 dollars at your local electronics store. This cable will literally do the EXACT SAME THING!  While your reading this know that almost all cables should be purchased online. Take HDMI cables for instance Best Buy would tell you to get the special gold plated cables they market for 80 dollars to "ensure you get the most from your new HDTV".  Please do not fall for their lies! Think about what a digital means 1001010101010011.  Either your TV is receiving this series of 0's and 1's or it isn't. There is absolutely no middle ground. A 3 dollar HDMI cable from amazon works exactly the same as the 80 dollar cable sold at Best Buy and other greedy retailers.
5,Needed this for work and it works great no problems
5,Very high quality cables IMPRESSED!!!
5,It's a cable! Ran a line from my router to my desktop performed exactly as expected and everything looks good. Just because I know how to make my own cables doesn't mean I wouldn't rather pay a small amount and just buy the length I need pre-made at this point and have it just work from the beginning rather than clipping color-coding and crimping wires and all the hassle keeping extra tools and wire around entails. This is well-priced and effective. Definitely recommend.
4,Fast shipping received the item exactly as described! I connected the cable from my internet box to my Samsung Blu-Ray player and instantly received access to the internet! I would highly recommend this seller! I was so excited about the length for the price that I did not pay attention to the color so I suggest that if you going to leave it exposed make sure you get a color that does not stand out as much as the blue one does. Other than that the product is great!
5,My work computer needs to be hardlined but my router is in the living room so I bought this to run to my office.  Works great and I never have connection issues.
5,The cable arrived coiled up in a nice cardboard box.  It was a striking blue color as ordered.  The ends fit snugly into my router and computer.  So far it has worked flawlessly.  Because the cable is twice as long as the old one I can hide it behind the furniture instead of going straight across the living room floor.I also bought one for my son to connect up his X-Box.  He ran his cable from the router through three doorways across the walls and under the carpet.  This cable also works flawlessly but I am not wild about the way my son ran it through the house.  However that is not Mediabridge's fault.
5,Great value for the price. Works great.
5,Couldn't have found a better ethernet cable for the price. It's thick enough that I don't have to worry about it being damaged from a little wear. I'm able to hook it up to my PS4 in my living room and around the boarders of my room to my router and still have a huge amount of slack. I highly recommend this.
5,Good cable. Been dealing with pain-in-the-behind internet reception for the past couple of years on my desktop computer which is just in the other room from my wireless router. May have been a problem with the internet card in the desktop as all other devices work fine in the house. Anyway I finally decided to get this cable and just run a wired connection and my problems are solved. Yeyy!
5,Nice quality and affordable
5,As expected
5,Just what I needed to keep a stable connection to the Internet to teach classes online. Wifi couldn't handle the stream.  I wish my classroom setup was closer to the router in my home but it is what it is and this little jewel run through the house keeps me humming right along with my little kiddos from China!  Came as quickly as I needed it too!
5,extremely fast delivery item as described and working great
4,My son has a tv/game system which is located upstairs. Unfortunately our wi-fi doesn't connect all that great because of where it is located.  So my son purchased this so that he could run an actual cable from our server to the computer. PERFECT!!  No lagging etc.  Highly recommend it if you need a good fast connection.
5,Great product headlined to my computer and internet speed is incredibly fast. Cable is sturdy
5,Everything about the product is awesome. Still is very durable after a while WiFi has been amazing and playing online has been almost lag free since I’ve connected the Ethernet cable.
5,I red a Longer EthernetvCable for my heart machine.  Rather than go to the company I come to my Amazon Store...this 50' Mediabridge Product is exactly what I needed.  It is id nit all in color size to my 4' Cable.  This is an excellent and I stronglyrecommend buying this Mediabridge Caable.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.  Exceptionally made.
5,I have had this cable for a while now. I have to run it through my house and I walk on it frequently. Even tho I walk on it often it still holds strong and looks as good as the day I bought it. Overall good product would recommend to a friend
5,I use this cable to update older components without wifi. It also came in handy to download updates to a wifi component that wouldn't respond without an update.  I needed the length because my modem is located in a central room away from y living room.
5,Cable works good
5,Pros: Cheap blue durablecons: noneBought this for a new PC build a week or so ago because I did not want to purchase a wireless adapter. The cord worked as expected. It's also pretty durable; I had to drill a hole in the floor to route the cable through the basement and up to another room with a router. It had to squeeze through some holes barely big enough and didn't get any damage.It comes in simple packaging just a simple cardboard box with the cord wrapped up neatly inside don't need much more from packaging for a simple cord. This is my second Mediabridge product and they have not disappointed my so far.
5,I got one in 2016 love it. So I got another. Worth the money. Yes it was for gaming.
5,Fast and easy networking cable
5,Speed is wonderful from the router 115 was the reading!
5,Before I retired I was a MCSE (Microsoft certified systems engineer). Troubleshooting network problems and building small to medium sized networking was what I did for a living. I still have some of my testing equipment for testing cat 5 cables. This cable tested perfect and after installing it I expect years of trouble free service. It was exactly what I ordered.
5,Good product and excellent service.
5,works as expected
5,I use it to have a direct router to PlayStation line it works great
5,I can always count on Mediabridge for a quality product.  Their cables are just what you need if you’re hard wiring items in your home or office network.
5,Works great. Only needed 35ishft of the 50ft but just in case I need extra in the future.
3,I had bought a managed switch that gave me stats on individual ports and I had a home made cable run to my office downstairs from my router.  After installing the bridge I saw I was getting about 1 in 350 packets received with an error.  I ordered the cabel and ran it making sure the cable did not run past any EMI devices and still am seeing the same error rate.  I swapped ports on my router and slowed the run to 100Mb and still the same error rate.  No idea what could be happening on this run.  I've supported networks from the mid 80's to current and this one has me stumped.  Guess I'll need to mirror a port and set up a sniffer app and see what is happening.  I believe the cable is fine there must be some other interference I have not isolated yet.
5,WiFi signal and gaming.
5,It do the work but the images are not that clear on video call. Has to get the Cat 8.
5,Shipped fast and works great
5,The wire seems well made and durable. I have to use it to Skype since I can’t do so over wireless and it has worked very well. The price was great! What more could I ask?
5,This is a high quality cable.  The plug is extremely rugged and I have no fear whatsoever that it is going to break or get damaged.  This is my second time purchasing this cable and I would definitely purchase it again.  You simply cannot match the price and quality.I have two of these cables and have never had a problem.  They sent me exactly one follow-up e-mail (no more) both times to ensure that I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  I would comment on their customer service but I have no need which is even better.
5,easy to hook up.
5,I would highly recommend this company and it’s ethernet cables they do it right I have bought many many cable from staples and online store. This product and price are excellent I now buy all my Ethernet cables from this company.
5,Ordered this because the ethernet ports in the room were on the opposite side of the room from my workstation. It has a decent build quality and I have as to of yet experience any drops. Speeds are adequate so I can't really find any faults in this product.I'm sure you're aware of this if you're ordering it but be sure to account for the whole 50 ft and know where to put the remaining length in case you can't use it all up.
3,Good cable for the first 3 months. Then it would constantly lose signal. I’ll have days where it’s okay but overall not worth it.
4,Product is used for my connection to my modem/router.  I wanted a hard wire connection.
5,It gives me the internet speed I'm supposed to receive. It feels robust as if you can drop the device and nothing will happen to it. Best of all you don't need to spend time trying to install or update drivers for it. Just plug and enjoy. GREAT PRODUCT SO FAR!!!
5,Great Ethernet cable. I'm using this cable to go from our router to our TV and that length spans our family room. It works beautifully. I'm not a tech by any means but I do know when a product performs the way I hope it will. I've bought several Mediabridge Products since I've had my Amazon Prime account and I've been nothing but pleased with everyone of them. Sturdy functional and reliable at a reasonable price. I highly recommend Mediabridge.
5,Extremely durable Ethernet cable! I don't really like the rubber flap over the release tab because I use it on my Xbox one and it gets stuck. I just cut it off and boom perfect. I wired it through some pretty tight holes in my house and this cable did just fine while others get the plastic peeled off while doing it. Would totally buy this again when I need another Ethernet cable!
5,Needed t ok add an additional router to our down stairs. This cable worked out well 👍
5,I use the cable in a common space in a dorm hall for gaming. Even in a heavily trafficked area I’ve had no issues with fraying and the WiFi signal is fantastic. Very great product overall and great for the price point.
5,Well boxed for delivery and high quality cable. That's why I ordered a second Mediabridge cable for other needs. It also is at an amazingly low price as I would have expected this quality to be at a higher price. For my future cable need I first search for Mediabridge products.
5,Glad I bought this item.
5,I bought this rj-45 cable to hook up a wireless router upstairs. I have a 2 story house with basement. The modem is in the basement and I have been having a hard time getting a good wireless connection upstairs on the top level of the house. So I ran this cable through the cool air return and hooked up a wireless router upstairs now I have a very strong connection for my Ipad upstairs. Worked great I would recommend this cable to anyone.
5,Needed a lot no cable to connect my upstairs desktop system to my first floor router via the basement. Flexible cache was easy to work with. Got my full 300 Mb bandwidth!  I bought the same cable for my daughter for a similar hookup at her place.
5,It works great
5,Ordered the blue Mediabridge Cat5e Patch Cable to replace a yellow Cat5e PatchCable. Needed a lengthier cord from the Internet router to my pc and the blue one works just fine.  I have not noticed any slow downs or interruptions. The blue cord arrived when told it would arrive.The price was great on Amazon. I got a 50 foot cord for less than the price ($25) of a 25 foot cord from Radio Shack. Happy with this purchase and would recommend this cable.
5,Resolved my internet issues!
5,Value for your money! Highly suggest this product.
5,Great for work at home or office setting. It was bigger then expected.
5,Flexible with strong clips no problem found and data speed tests show it is working as it should.  Think I'm going to have to replace all my current CAT5 cables with theseEnds will fit though a 1/2" holePrice / quality / length make it a five star item for me....
5,Great turn around time and exactly what we ordered
5,This is the second Ethernet cable I have purchased from Mediabridge  the first purchased over a year ago has worked fine but it was not long enough my new computer  location.the first was a 25' cable this is a 50' cable even at twice the length there is no loss of internet speed.I am very pleased not only with both cables but also the price and fast delivery.Based uopn my experience so far I would be willing to buy other products from this company.
5,There really isn't much that I can say about ethernet cable except that it works.  As much as I love computers I am ignorant when it comes to cables.  I guess the only thing I can go off by is that I notice a difference in my internet connection when I am wired vs wireless.  My internet speed is obviously faster when wired than wireless.  Also since I am an online gamer my ping is significantly low vs wireless.  I have never had an issue with Mediabridge's products or services.  I also recommend buying their HDMI cables too.  They are reasonably priced and never had an issue with those too.
5,I used 3 of these for several years to go from my router in one bedroom of my apartment to Xboxes and Roku in the living room.  They were set up and not moved so not subjected to any abuse or stresses but all performed perfectly until I upgraded to all wifi and didn't need them anymore.  They're quality cables with reliable transmission.
5,I needed 50 feet of Cat 6 for a PoE security camera installation. I like this Mediabridge cable with its snag free connectors. Actually came neatly coiled in a box like somebody at Mediabridge cared to go the extra yard. Good product. Low price. Thanks.
5,Hardwire is almost always superior to wireless.
5,The marine blue color of this cable is memorizing. I really think it's the calming color that has had a huge impact on my overall happiness. I get along better with others I'm content with my work and overall experience a level of euphoria that I never thought possible.Thank you Mediabridge Ethernet Cable!
5,I got this mainly for my Xbox. Whenever I have a digital download it can take forever. So I connect this guy to my router which is in the other room when I need it. My data is kind of slow anyways so it does take awhile but I do notice the difference with it. Its a life saver! Next time I'll probably get a smaller one..I went a little crazy and got a gigantic one which you never know I might need it one day.
5,I needed a long run to set up an access point to expand my wifi capabilities.  Works great and was received quickly.
5,I hooked it up and got great results.......beauty
5,Great Product and Fast Delivery...Highly Recommend Using Mediabridge Cables !
5,Using  this product to upgrade my system from WiFi to Ethernet. Tripled my speed. Fast and affordable.
5,Arrived on time and good quality.
5,It's an ethernet cable.  It came quickly and it works.Normally I use wifi in my house for day-to-day needs but I also work from home sometimes.  When I do that I want a nice steady connection over the VPN to my office and I make use of terminal sessions and whatnot.  So I drape this long cable across the house from the router to my computer and plug it directly into the PC.  Over the cable I get a 12ms ping 28Mbps down and 3.5Mbps up...which is about what I pay for.  I can't complain.
5,Nice Product.  Quick shipping.
5,Better than WiFi speed for Zoom!
5,Strong
5,it was perfect fit for my job.
5,I got two of these to string wired connections to our game consoles. We don't like having to deal with wireless glitches during online gaming.They have high quality ends and seem durable. I expected to pay more for a cable this long. It's about the same prices as an eight foot cable at a local retailer. If you need to run a wired network connection from a hub into the next room or to the other end of a large rec room this will likely fill the bill.
5,Worked perfectly. Rolled in box with a clean presentation.Edit: TWO YEARS LATER STILL WORKS LIKE A CHARM. I have rolled and unrolled this cable a hundred times in a hundred different ways. It's been tangled up and vigorously untangled plugged in and unplugged too many times to count. Great product 5 star review remains.
5,I ran this from my internet router to my tv under the floor boards. It was super easy to super charge my smart tv. I really recomend doing this it imporves netflix hulu etc watching greatly if you have a tv that has a lot inbetween it and the internet router. I can speak to the quality of this one as top notch it pluged in works great and was as long as i wanted. A+++
5,The best option by far.  It does exactly what it should.  Durable and provides a stable connection for everything you would need to do with an internet connection.  I had previously tried the $5 cable listed on amazon and the insulation/ protection felt very cheep.  That cable was stepped on a couple times and instantly the insulation started to fray. This one is mush sturdier and just feels better made.  Highly recommend.
5,I purchased one of these 50' cables as a way to connect a network printer to the router and another 50' cable as a backup / spare for any use.  The cables came packaged well in a simple box without a lot of waste.  They were coiled in a circle about 6" in diameter and visual inspection did not pick up any defects.  I've confirmed both function one with the network printer and the other hard-wiring a laptop to the network.  Can't get much better than quick service (Prime) good quality and inexpensive product.  I have definitely chosen this brand over others when in comes to this type of product.
4,This is a good cord for both connecting directly to a router and for connecting to an Ethernet splittter. Only downside is that the cable does not seem to be very durable. It has begun to fray in parts where it has to bend at a fair angle in order to reach a well located modem.
5,Works for what needed. Puter works great.
5,I like it it’s great! Great WiFi with this!!
5,I don't know how this thing is still alive but I'm impressed. I haven't been treating it gently. Every time I think it's finally dead it turns out I've just messed up some router settings. Good job mediabridge A+ cable would tape to every ceiling in my apartment again.
5,Great wire for a great price. Just needed a temp wire for my computer until we can run ethernets in the walls.
1,This purchase was a huge disappointment. I received it in a timely manner however it was only about 10-12 feet long not 50 feet. I'm sort of glad that it didn't work out. As it turns out I only needed a 25 feet cord!
5,It works
5,Good inexpensive cable that is made solid.  Will purchase again.
5,Cord i needed
3,it is much more delicate than expected granted these cables are not meant to be out near pathways or anything that can pinch it but small pressure or bends slows down the speed much more than my previous 5e ethernet cable did which is ironic seeing that this one is supposed to be just a little more durable.that being said its an ethernet cable and it does its job pretty well. my main gripe with it could easily be solved with proper cable management but i need a long cable to be portable
5,It's a network cable. It worked perfectly and was very cheap compared to many others. Only thing to be careful of is the boot on the end isn't a full boot just a tab that covers the RJ45 clip (it can get snagged on things).
5,Been using this over a year now. Has not gone out once. I have had many issues with Ethernet before with working from home. No drop in speeds either considering how far we have it going room to room to ensure 2 hardwire set ups
3,This thing is great but to get it to reach my computer I had to carve holes in 4 walls (don't want it just laying on the ground). After I had pushed it through so many holes it was all mangled and broken on the end so I cut off the top bit and twisted all the copper parts around the head I cut off a different ether cable I had lying around. It worked for a little bit but it stopped. Not sure if that's the cable or the landlord turning off my internet for drilling holes in his walls.
5,The Product is great. Came on time. With good Packaging. I actually wanted about 30 feet cable. But since they don't sell 30 feet. They sell 25 and then 50 feet. I thought to try out 50 feet.This was for my Smart TV to connect to my Modem.Works great. In Wi-Fi My TV used to drop the signals over the time and the Apps stopped responding.With this cable it's continuous Connectivity. It's always connected with my router and every time I turn on my TV. It's connected.
5,Thank you!  Came a day earlier than expected.  Nice to have wired capability along with WiFi.
2,I like the length of the cable I can move around the house and work anywhere.
5,No problems and no almost no lag
5,Working from home and love it !! No issues at all!
4,Needed a long cord to run from my router to my outside home monitoring camera so I didn't have to unscrew it when needing to reconnect camera. Works great and an excellent price!
5,Bought to hook up a PS4 to the modem it is much faster that WiFi.
1,It may be the individual cable but this is the ONLY ethernet cable I've ever bought that would not connect to with any device.  And that includes custom cables I've terminated myself.  It is NOT CAT5/CAT5e compatible as advertised.I've got a 10 year old 50' CAT5 this was to replace and it could not be made to work.  The old worn and loose CAT5 I have still works.  But NOT this one.
5,It is a 50' cable that works as advertised. I am neither over nor under whelmed. I simply whelmed. Would buy again.
5,I have a 50 mb download and a 10 upload at my home. I havent been able to hit 35 on any of my devices even when they are directly plugged into my router that is until I bought this cable. I built a desktop and I put it in my room but I did not purchase a wireless card for it. I bought this simply for it's length and good price and I ran it from my router into my bedroom and I was instantly getting 55 down and 12 up even more than what I am paying for.
5,It worked great with my husband’s desktop. His computer stopped connecting to our WiFi so we needed to hardwire it to our modem. This cord is long enough and the signal is great.
5,A+ Trader!!!!!
5,Used to have direct line to xbox now i get "full" use of my internet. Was 80mb down 20 up.. now 400 down and 20 up
5,Its an Ethernet  cord
5,Good product
5,Great cable especially for the price. I purchased it for my brother so that he could connect his Xbox to the Ethernet port that is located in a different room in our house. It works perfectly for him. Feels very durable.
5,Seems to be working fine.  Used it for temporarily moving a cable box to another room to use on a TV that was not hooked to cable.  Not being used for any gaming.
5,Works very well it was for my son to play his videogames
5,I purchased this more than 6 months ago. This one replaced my old cable since wires near the connector were severed after years of using it for laptop internet connection (I was tired of my spotty/unreliable wireless connection). This new ethernet cable however has sturdy "blue" cable sheath firmly attached to the clear plastic end of the connector so the wires inside the connector are not subject to exposure/twist/bend. If my old one had this sturdy design I would not had to purchase a new one.
5,This is currently my 4th year of using this cable thus far and I have yet to run into any issues with it. Highly recommend for those whose routers aren't within a 3+ foot radius.
5,Good networking cable
5,Its wire.  Quality connectors
5,Having a direct Cat 5/6 line helped speed up my internet dramatically. Wifi is good but not the best. The line helped a lot.
5,Its a cat 5 cable. And works great.Highly recommended
5,Works as advertised. Still waiting on ISP for upgrade on speed will know more then.
5,I ran this up a wall through an attic and down a wall. Everything held up being pulled across splintered wood etc. Has resolved our Wifi issues we faced when gaming on an xBox for significantly less $ than upgrading router and/or adding extender.
5,I needed a way to set up a new Linux machine in my basement but had to download all new drivers for the wireless card etc.  Rather than pack the computer to my living room where the cable box/internet is located I just bought this 50 ft. cable and made the connection down to my workroom.  Everything worked fine - I was able to get all the software and wireless card updates got the wireless working and now have my Linux box up and running.  Also now I've got a backup connection in case I every loose my home wireless network.  Very happy with this product.
5,Use a lot of patch cables in our commercial building sick of putting them together from scratch for low voltage projects so buy roughly the size pre-made patch cable have found this brand to be the highest quality.  Price works about the same as buying cable and ends definitely if you count your time wiring as worth something.  Other brands 30% of the cables are defective once installed probably from unwinding process.  Only 2 cables out of 20 were from this brand were defective and it was probably my fault from unwinding with brute force while rushing. Once installed no problems whatsoever other brands not so much.
5,Good value foe money
5,At first I used this to run cable for an event I help set up once. Then I used it to cut my own cat5 cables. There is no ripcord but it's easy enough to rip it by hand after making a small cut.
5,I was working from home and needed the long cable to reach my dining room table.
5,Nice quality cable at a good price. I like that it came in its own box not with a cable tie around it. Fast shipping.
5,In building a home theater computer a while back I did my research and learned what a sad expensive joke Monster HDMI cables are. I purchased MediaBridge and couldn't be happier with the quality performance and the money that I saved. Now needing to move that equipment to another location I needed Cat5e and coax for the TV HTPC and PS3. Once again MediaBridge came through with an excellent product at a very reasonable price. They offer colored network cabling so it makes it easy to identify at the router what cable goes to which device. I'm definitely a MediaBridge customer and buying through Amazon only makes it better.
5,It's almost criminal what Walmart Bestbuy and every other store charges for some of these products but I guess that is why I compare everything to Amazon. This cable really increased my download speed for my wi-fi network and keeps my computer cooler. When you plug this into your computer be sure to turn OFF the wi-fi to keep your computer cooler and save a ton of battery life. Cruising the internet with this cable saves a lot of battery life as compared to using the wireless internet (granted you remember to turn on airplane mode).
4,The cable connected my computer to the modem three rooms away just fine.  I suppose I could have given it five stars but I have a hard time clicking on "I love it" for a piece of ethernet cable! :)
5,It's an Ethernet Cable.It can't be bad
5,Initially I was pleased visually and physically it seemed fine but it was somewhat slower than I expected. I figured it was due to its length.When I re-routed the cable behind my desk about 2 feet from my wireless mouse it became very erratic. I had to go back to its original position about 5 feet awayto restore function. Clearly the shielding on the cable is either defective or insufficient.I identified this problem after about 2 years of use and contacted the company. Frankly I didn't really expect much after that time but they instantly offered a replacement which works great; therefor the upgrade from 1 to 5 stars.
5,It was less than 48 hours before Halloween eve when I started brainstorming costume ideas. I thought about a ghost... A vampire... I wanted this year to be different. Then I thought of one of my favorite things the Internet.But how could I dress as the Internet?The heavens sent the answer in the form of a 50 foot blue CAT5 cable. It's the perfect color and fits great. I decided to tie everything together with the addition of a few of my favorite memes and cat pictures.
5,Good quality and great price
5,Good value
5,Saved a ton buying this cable from Amazon instead of buying at the big box store.Very good cable. Very durable and well made.
5,Excellent Wi-Fi cable
5,Exactly as described. Quick shipment. Works great.
5,Exactly as ordered.
5,I use this cable to connect my telescope mount controller to my laptop.  As this is setup outdoors it takes a bit of a beating ... dirt ... moisture ... getting walked on.  It has held up well and never let me down.
5,Comes with one Velcro strap tie for cable management. The rubber cover for the clip on the plug is softer than ones I've had in the past which makes it easier to disconnect while still keeping it safe from accidentally unplugging it.
4,This cable does work but I would not place it in an area with heavy walking traffic even if you place a rug over it. The plastic covering of the cable is pretty cheap. If you intend to place this cable around your baseboard molding in your wall or ceiling then it should be fine.
5,Good cat cable.
5,It works
5,I do not leave reviews for items until I have had some time to use them.Moved in to an old house that does not have any Cat5 wall outlets. Needed a wire long enough to run from my router to the other side of the house because the WiFi signal wouldn't reach some parts of the house. This was perfect ran along the wall right into the router now we get signal all over
5,Working great
5,Perfect. I bought 2 cause my twitch setup is across the room so I made a hole in the wall to get the wire through and it works. I love it. The first goes in my Gaming Desktop and the other one goes in my PS4 or Xbox One which ever one I'm playing. Great buy and very affordable.
5,Gaming on ps4
5,Added to existing cable that was short and used a coupler to connect this to existing cable and hooked to smart TV!  Worked right out of the packaging!  Great Quality in cable thickness not flimsy at all and would recommend to anyone needing additional cable.  Would buy again! A+++
5,Great.
5,We have 4 computers in our home office A smart tv and a security system I have ordered these each time 6 in total and very happy good money spent highly recomend
5,This snake will spit interweb venom in your compuper for gaming juice. Is gud BuY.Lol it's an ethernet cable that's reliable. That's all you need Mate.
5,Got this for gaming. I mean its a ethernet cable. Does the job. Quality isnt bad either.
5,This bad boy gives me one solid connection ordered 3 to run around my house and let me tell you something the data it will transfer! Works like a charm and is exactly what you would expect from a ethernet cable.
5,I've used multiple Mediabridge cables and never had any problems.  This is a Cat5 cable that would have cost double at the very least even at a big box store.  I run it from the modem/router combo to my father's PS3 that sits in his living room.. this way he can do the online updates and stuff.  He also has a backup cable now in case he has trouble getting his wireless connection to function properly (no excuse to get out of work anymore).  There isn't much more to say about it.  Great cable at an incredible price!
5,Works great
4,good product
5,Like I said above good value & does the job.
5,Works great
5,We bought about 4 of these for our 4 gaming PCs and they held up. We eventually switched to wifi cards (ASUS WiFi PCI Express adapter (PCE-AC56) and those have been excellent. But if you need a cord like I said we bought 4 none were bad. All worked as expected.
5,Does what it is supposed to do. My son got it to connect the router to his xbox in order to enable connection. Router was in a different part of the basement so he needed long cord. This was way more expensive at staples so this was a good deal.
5,I connected my table top computer to my WiFi router. I have full internet bars and am connected without interruption!
5,What can I really say about a cable? It works well was appropriate length for my purchase (50ft). My cats can't tear it up even though they have tried. Throughput seems good but my internet isn't quite fast enough to test it anyways. I MOSTLY bought this because I was tired of extra latency over wireless and this cable definitely solved that issue.
5,It works; this message has been sent with the Mediabridge 50’ cable.  I did not measure the cable but it is long.  I did not test it to see if it CAT6. For my needs it was worth the price.
5,Best decision I've made concerning gaming and how to get the fastest internet speed to my console. My computer is in my room along with my router while as my PS4 and my 2 other roommates' PS4's are in the living room. Hooked this up to my router then to a splitter and finally into each PS4. 50mbps+ download speeds on all 3! No more lag and no more issues. (Will vary due to your ISP}
5,It works what else can I say except it was a lot cheaper than the ones at the store.
5,Well made and streamed without a glitch.
5,This cable is all that I needed. I bought this for a project I had at school since I needed a fairly long Ethernet cable. The cables are well made and the only thing that really bugs me are the small rubber parts on top of the connectors. Some people like them but they feel kinda weird to me personally. The speeds are fast reliable and in general the cable is cheap. What more do you ask? I wouldn't look any further to be honest and I would definitely buy again.
4,I really didn't know what to expect for the price but I was pleasantly surprised when I received the cable. It worked without a hitch it's flexible the correct length and the right color blue. I have paid more than 3 times as much for a network cable the same length. I would rate it a 5 star but I just can't bring myself to equate love with a network cable.I am a satisfied customer!
5,Na
5,Great cable very sturdy and helpful for download boost. I bought this for my Xbox because it was taking a long time to download my games and I went from 10 mb/s to 70 mb/s with the help of this Ethernet cable.
4,This item is just as described in the listing.  I plan to use it to tie my laptop directly into my router in another part of my home so that I can work from home. My initial test proves that it works fine. I may get a longer cable in the future. Its price can't be beat! These things run $35 and up... I only gave it 4 stars because I have only used 1 time.
5,After having a media center built from spare parts for several year I suspected that the WiFi twas having problems with HD streams despite having enough bandwidth. Research showed this can be an issue and people were using power outlet routers to solve it. Given the old farmhouse's roughshod wiring that wasn't going to work. So I measured out how much Cat5 was needed to run along the walls and ordered this.Problem solved. HD streaming works like a charm now.I'm very pleased with the price/performance ratio of Mediabridge's products since this isn't the first cable I've gotten of theirs. Recommended.
4,Muy bueno
5,Does its job
5,Used for my son's DVD player
4,It's a 50ft ethernet cable.  It connects my electronic stuff.  It's blue.  C'mon help me out here.....what more can I say about an ethernet cable?  Oh I know.....I wish it was available in lime green.  I like lime green.  I'm taking away one star until you make it available in lime green.
5,Great value
5,Works as should
5,Came in a plain brown box with a velocro cable tie. Perfect length for what i needed and it works great! Also they sent an email with contact info for people less knowledgeable top have a way to get answers for ant questions they may have.
5,Connects my router to laptop
5,Works as described
5,I got this cable to run a gigabit connection between my Verizon Gigabit Router and my Linksys Wi-Fi router which is on the other side of the house. Good connectivity on both ends and works with no problems.
5,This is my second order for this RJ45 cable but this time needed a 50' length to enable me to take my tablet from the upstairs office down to the main level and outside to the patio.This is a well made cable with sturdy connectors on both ends of the cable.SteveAustin Tejas
5,Works simple cat5 cable seems durable although I don't have it running through anything nor do I have it under anything. So durability was not a problem was simply performance + distance. My new place only allows a demarcation point (DP) in one spot in the place so instead of using WiFi to game I have it set up on this cat5 for reliable and consistent connection.
5,Works quite well.  I needed it because for some reason my computer's wireless suddenly stopped working and I needed an Ethernet cable to connect to the Internet.  I had ordered another less expensive Ethernet cable a couple weeks before same length and it constantly kept going in and out of connectivity if plug moved at all in USB port.  But the Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch cable has constantly worked without interruption.  I like it a lot!  Thanks.
5,There are many reasons to buy Mediabridge cable. The price you pay for the quality you get is great. Now add the fact the cable is a bright color and easy to trace. This is a first rate deal. If you have a typical installation with a nest of all black cables just think how trouble free your life would be with easy to trace cable from point to point. Get the length you need with a great color to trace. Mediabridge is the answer.
5,Amazing cable with an amazingly low price doesn't hurt to get a little extra in case the line isn't long enough for your purpose!Bought my cable so that I could connect my router from one side of the living room to the other.Despite the long cord I didn't lose any bandwidth from it.Overall a great buy. Bang for the buck.
5,Reliable
4,Received the cable a few days before delivery date (nice surprise!). Used it to move our WiFi router to a new spot in the house (@ 30 ft from original location)  We needed the signal up on the second floor. Plugged everything in and booted up in no time. Good quality cable too. Purchased this cable on Amazon - it was half the price then Walmart (in store).
5,Solved my problem for Apple TV 4K freezing up on WiFi. Connected the router and Apple TV and now not only does it not freeze up but the picture is sharper and the video is noticeably improved.
5,Good
5,It's blue wire. It follows the handrail supports from my cable modem up the stairway under a throw rug up the back of a wooden storage shelf to my Nighthawk X6 (which beams its' 2G and 5G signals outward and downward). Just plug and play no setup required!
4,Edit:Got a new cable shipped in the mail. Will be buying more.I ordered a 50 foot long cable but in the package I received a 25 foot cable. I am very disappointed as I needed at least a 30 foot long Ethernet.
5,Exactly as described. I bought this cable because it was a cheaper alternative to a $30-40 priced cable at a retailer. Since having this cable I have had zero issues and it works like a charm. Will be my go to for ethernet cables from now on!
5,Works great use it for work laptop
4,the head is nice and tight and not made of flimsey plastic that breaks the first time you touch it. the cable itself as far as I can tell has no issues. Overall very good.
5,Arrived on time as promised.  I used this to expand my network along with a switch to hook up additional devices. Worked great.
5,Excellent device. I bought the FixMeStick computer cleaner but it needs a wire connection to update. I thought I would have to call my provider out to fix this instead of the little wifi antenna. This little baby did the trick beautiful. And now my computer runs much smoother.
5,Exactly as described
4,Used it for home security. Really good quality for the price
4,Good price
5,I ordered this rather late in the day on October 8th intending to use to to connect my xbox360 to my hub across the room. Needless to say I was hoping it wouldn't take too long because no one wants to go long without Netflix or Xbox Live. And lo-and-behold it arrived early on Wednesday the 10th. The product is of good quality and the positive reviews for this product did not mislead me. It's a sturdy cable and it arrived with lightning speed. I am a satisfied customer who is now happily streaming all of my entertainment networking needs.
5,It is a really nice product and would recommend it an older version i have disconnects easier but it don't mind and the new one i ordered for my brother is great and i'm jealous because it has a little click.
4,Package arrived promptly and in good condition. I was careful in the installation and once installed the cable worked as expected.
4,No issues very happy with this cable
5,This cable and its sister coaxial cable saved me a lot of money. I had been enduring really spotty wireless quality in my home network and was planning to get an extender to solve the problem. At my son's suggestion I got the two extra-long cables and moved my wireless router to a better location. Result: an unbelievable jump in quality—instantaneously. Couldn't be happier.
5,Extremely pleased with this product
5,Great quality
5,Arrived in a sturdy box uncoiled well. It did increase my speed (Obviously) from a USB net dongle. No breakages frays or exposed wires.
5,Awesome!!!  Great price for a lot of cable.  My husband needed at least 30' of cable for his computer at work and wasAbout to get some at the computer store but hesitated cause it was over $30.00.  I told him let me check on amazonAnd there it was 50' for less than $10.00.  Came in in two days works great!  Now he has internet at work and is veryHappy with this purchase.  Thanks.
5,Used product to hook up to PC for work at home during quarantine.
5,My ISP is Warner Cable and my box allows for 4 devices to be connected to the net.  I wanted to connect mu big screen TV to the net to get HULU Net Flex etc to display on the 60" TV. So i got the 50' Ethernet Cable and ran it under the house and up through the floor behind TV. Now I watch movies and all an the TV. Life is good TV a snack and something to drink. I'm all set for an enjoyable evening.
5,Solid cable value. Perfect for connecting the home office to the router in another room.
5,What can I say it's a 100' ethernet cord. Does the job didn't notice any decrease in internet speed while using it. Much more affordable than buying from a brick and mortar store
5,I have rated the 'features' although it has only been installed for a short time but it works and the 'cable' seem to be as good as the short one it is replacing.
4,Arrived on time and was well packed so no kinks or bends.  Long cable seems to hold the transfer rate very well and the connectors are easy to open.  Would have been five star if further protection on the plastic connectors old style connectors with overwrap.  If you are not taking in an out of connectors often I would definitely recommend for value and quality.
5,Exactly what we needed !
5,I have been having terrible trouble with my Spectrum wireless network - it drops constantly and I am paying a fortune for my fast internet service. It was recommended to me that I use a cable like this one so of course I purchased it from Amazon - perfect! Yay!
5,Nothing to dislike.  We use it to get internet from router to tv when tv is moved across the room.  Our wifi never has worked on our new Visio tv so this was a fix for that.
5,This is a wonderful item it has more than done its job since I got it. Easily stretched the span from one end of my house to the other and despite the changing weather conditions from super-hot to ice-cold up here in the mountains it has endured and continues to work. It was extremely cheap but even if it costed 3x as much I would still buy this product again if I needed to for something else. Best of all? I literally ordered this on a Friday for one-day shipping and had it on Saturday. Absolutely wonderful.
4,Just as expected
5,So far I've gotten 269 out of the 300 MHz download and 9 upload ( and his is on the PS4)seemed a bit flimsy but its great don't really like the color I am actually going get 2 more (for the PS3s) if I'm able to hook them to my router
4,It’s a cable No problem with the cable itself but with a connecting jack head snapped off right away
5,I forgot to review the 2nd one I bought.  I purchased 2 of these cables to help fix a wireless issue in our house.  Both are working well with no problems. Considering how thin this cable is I was concerned about interference but so far there has been none.
4,This was a good buy for the price. I have wifi but I have several devices running off the wifi so when I'm streaming movies on Netflix vudu or any of the other apps they would run slowly. This cord is both durable and inexpensive. Great buy.
5,Works perfect arrived on time👌. I have a laptop in my room and the Wi-Fi box is in the living room so it doesn't really reach this far. I bought this so I didn't have to go to the living room every time I use my laptop
5,I have no complains
5,After buying this Ethernet Cable with the length up to 50 feet I can extend the signal range from the main router to the sub-one. Amazon should refer those who buy this products also to buy the Cat5/6 Inline Coupler in case the cable is still not long enough and also the Router.
5,I purchased a few of these cables to direct wire an internet connection to my TV's. They worked flawlessly at 1gbit speeds without any transmission errors. The connectors are also snagless. This was a great cable for the price. Works well and was long enough. I would buy another.  This is a dependable product. I am happy with the purchase.
5,I have this cable running from one room to another along the floor for a secure LAN connection. So far it has proven very durable even where it gets rubber by two doors and walked on daily. Does just what a ethernet cable should do.
5,Used the cable for a computer in another room. It was exactly what I needed.
3,Purchased this to hook up our Internet to our DVD player to start watching Netflix. Netflix would sporadically come on at first I thought it was our Internet speed when that turned out OK I thought it was our Sony DVD but after calling and checking on that it was OK.  I took a chance and purchased another ethernet cord from Walmart and since then everything has worked fine. I kept this as a three star because it did arrive as described it also arrived promptly however unfortunately mine was faulty.
5,Worked perfect. I needed to reinstall a security camera. Instead of having to take the camera down from where it was mounted I just ran the lan cable from the router  to the cameras lan connection that was run through the wall.
4,Works great  gave 4 stars because it came unplugged once kind of randomly.  Use this to hook my internet to my tv  and it works great  fast as can be.
5,I love that I can get a hold of a super long ethernet cord for a direct connection to my game console for faster loading and seemless video chats.
5,I needed some cables didn't want to spend the money on an entire 500 ft spool. Obviously the spool is cheaper in the long run but for what I needed  right now this fit the price and requirements.if you plan on running a lot of wires you'd be better off getting a spool and making your own wires but this is great if you just need to make one medium length run.
5,Great product sturdy jacket on the outside and great price to boot. I needed this cable to reach from my living room to my bedroom and it did the trick. Thanks to it being CAT6 I'm getting exceptional download speeds then my previous cable.
5,Thanks item came fast it works
5,This is a very sturdy cable even at 50' long. My internet access is not choppy anymore.
5,After ordering this cable I moved and rotated the router which so far has precluded having to move it to another room. Thus the cable has not been used. I'm happy to keep it on hand for possible future use as it looks well made. Delivery was prompt.
5,This product as supplied by Mediabridge is justly rated; an excellent patch cable.  Be aware if you order it from another seller as I did initially you may not receive the item as described.  Thomas Jr Toney supplied an off brand @ 30' which was returned. (photo supplied).  Mediabridge supplied the cable as described.
5,It is 50 feet long.  I have a dead spot at my couch in my home.  I love fast internet.  My router is >25 ft from my couch and <50 ft.  I think you can see why this was a natural choice for me. It doesn't pop out unexpectedly from my computer and the network and sharing utility shows 1 Gigabit speed (actual speeds will vary).  Great stuff all around.
5,Once again Mediabridge has outdone itself again.This Cable works like a champ I've bought this brand here a few times before and I am very happy. The internet speed sound imagery and color are all excellent. It is very sturdy strong and well made I like the thickness. I've had thinner ones in another brand not good. I will buy this brand again
4,Only 4 stars because I need a length between this and the next one but the next one would have been too long.
4,Great sturdy up to date product.Was pleased with the length as I have a to use it for a downstairs room.
5,I bought this for my son's college dorm room.  He needed to hardwire his connection and it had to be routed along the walls from the other side of his room.  Worked out perfectly.
5,Good quality Ethernet Cable ran cable from router to ethernet adapter on to my amazon fire stick.  Just perfect 50 feet and no issues.  Now I can stream video with no problems without wireless WIFI issues.
5,My wifi kept dropping in my home and my local internet company brighthouse recommended I do a hard connect on my laptop if I'm connecting to a VPN network. I have to connect for work and they said it should improve. Where my wifi setup is to where my desk is about 37 feet so I decided to get this cable. I started using this for almost 3 weeks and no issues now. I'm happy with it and I can notice my internet is quicker as expected when I'm hard wired in. I'm happy!
5,It's a good buy and does what it's supposed to. No complaints.
4,I purchased this cable to hook up to my older model xbox 360 in order to have access to online play. Cable works fine and the price can't be beat. It was less then half the price that I would have paid at Wally world radio shack or office depot here in my town. If you need an inexpensive 50ft cable for internet this is the one to buy. Thanks.
5,I have been using the computer networking cat5e cable50 ft.-in blue for about a month. It has been working fine and was very well priced. One adjustment I did do though was to reenforce the cable at the points where the cable is attached to the plugs with some duct tape. Just because I am moving it around a bit. I do this with every cord though. It bends quite a bit there and is worth doing to extend the proper function of the cord. I recommend it. Very glad I got it.
5,Ok
5,I love using Amazon because I get the best product for my money.  I have bought 2-100’ and 1-50’. Good quality.
5,Quality of the product Mediabridge product are none to one one of the best good quality control.
5,Thank you so much it is exactly what I wanted
4,My main complaint with this cord is when I try to unplug it from the computer it is very hard to remove.
5,Installed 50' cable to add extra computer to home network in next room and had no issues.  No interference between rooms.  Great cable and very efficient lost no signal strength between rooms!!!
5,works very well and is long and thick so don't worry about it snapping. I have mine going above me on the chilling so no one will trip on it. I'm getting speeds about 150 mgs a sec down a 10 mgs up
5,I mean it's a cable. it functions. what else do you want? works for my 100mbps connection.
5,I needed to extend the connection between my cable modem and my router.  I live in a 3 level home and the modem is in the basement therefore wifi was not as strong upstairs.  This cable did exactly what I needed it allowed me to move my router to the middle level of my home.  Wifi problem solved !!
5,Its 50 foot long and works great
5,I have purchased several Mediabridge ethernet and optical audio cables from Amazon.  They have all been well made and each cable is packaged in an individual cardboard box which makes me think the company is going a little farther to provide a satisfactory product and a sense that this is not a cheap unimportant commodity.They also include a small brochure containing helpful information about their other networking products.
5,All is as it was to be. Nice tad that koops it from snagging on other cords.
5,This Ethernet cable was packaged really well and it works great in my home office! I decided to get an Ethernet cable to maximize the efficiency of my internet speed at home.  My wireless network was running a bit slow but when I hooked this Ethernet cable to my computer speeds dramatically increased.  I'd definitely recommend this cable to anyone who's looking for an Ethernet cable!
5,Item was delivered in time and with the product as expected without issues during transit. The free velcro strap is a nice addition unless you plan to stretch it the full 50 feet all the time.
5,I am very happy with the ethernet cable.  It arrived very quickly!  It is in perfect condition and it is working great!  Thank you so much!  I will remember you for my future orders!
5,Had a problem with Netflix on my television in the den.  Evidently my high speed internet wasn't high speed enough to support Netflix.  My son (who was born tech savvy) told me to get a Cat 5 cable and connect from modem to television.  It worked like a charm and we are now able to watch any and all netflix movies.  The cable is excellent quality and arrived exactly when it was supposed to.  Thanks to all involved!
5,I couldn't believe I could get a 50ft Cat5e Ethernet Cable for such a low price---figured it would be very cheaply made but if it lasted a year I'd be happy.  Imagine my surprise when it arrived and was a very well made cable indeed!  Nice thick covering sturdy connectors...and one of the biggest bargains I've gotten this year to date.  I get excellent internet speeds when using this cable as well.  You won't be disappointed with this cable---or any other Mediabridge brand Cat5e cable I bet.
5,This was perfect for streaming to a fire stick with appropriate hardware and versions
5,I purchased this cable based on the positive reviews on Amazon. The reviews were right in that this cable performs flawlessly. I wanted to be able to have a direct connection to my Roku streaming video player as the wireless signal although strong kept getting interference from an unknown source. Now that I have a direct connection to my router and my Roku player the streaming video is simply gorgeous and I no longer experience any buffering or loading issues. I'm really glad that I purchased this item.
5,Great stuff to wire our rasberry pi's.  Looks tough to travel and last.
3,UPDATE: I took off another star because the cable is just simply too flimsy. Also added photos.Pros: Cheap pricing for what it is. Works fine.Cons: cheaply made. The tubing is pretty flimsy.But for the price and the length that it provides I think its definitely worth the buy. Although I wouldn't recommend this cable if you are constantly tugging and arranging it since it may come apart with heavy usage. I think its perfect for just simply leaving it into a tower or stationary laptop.
4,good price fast delivery
5,Exactly what I needed and the price was better than anticipated.
5,Got high speed internet
5,I haven’t had the cable for long but it seems well made especially for the price. I also like that it came with a cord keeper. I kept the box so that I could wind up the cord and store it in there.
5,Has worked great
5,came in very handy I am pleased!
5,Best price for what I needed works as it should let's me complete my work wired in rather than a weak wifi signal across the house.
5,Fast shipping considering what's going on right now
5,Exactly what I needed with quick delivery
5,Been playing online video games with Wi-Fi for so long. Got tired of the occasional connection hiccups whenever somebody was streaming videos in our household so I decided to go wired. This product worked perfectly for me. Now the connections are constantly stable. No more complaining about lag now.
5,good
5,Nothing
5,I have a wireless router but for some reason when streaming big downloads to my laptop the speed slows. Connected this directly to my laptop in the living room and I have fast reliable downloads 100% of the time.
4,Great cables.  Tis 50 foot cable is just as good as the 25 foot that I bought earlier
4,Moved my computer and this is exactly the right amount needed
5,Glad I bought this item from Amazon. I looked on several other websites and no one else competed with the price that Amazon was offering this item at. I now have super fast internet from about 30feet from the modem. So far it hasn't broken down at all and the wire is nice and flexible for all your bending needs.
5,I've had this cable for a couple of weeks and so far very happy with my purchase.  The build quality is excellent.  The cable is very pliable what I mean by that is some cables have a hard shell that makes it difficult to bend or coil as it tends to tangle easily.  This one is different very soft and easy to work with.  I priced similar length rj45 cables at several local stores and they were 2-3 times the cost of this one.
5,We are hail from the ethernet tribe. Secure clip protectors that prevent breakage along with efficient packaging. Perfect size for my purposes. I am going to buy this size again in a few days.
5,Bought this cord to give internet access to an officemate in a shared office. Didn't want to spend a lot of money but also didn't want to end up with a crappy cheap cord that wouldn't last (as I've seen these complaints with other cords). I did a bit of research and found the Mediabridge cord. This Ethernet cord is well constructed and durable. I'm very pleased with this product and if I need another cord in the future will be happy to purchase another from Mediabridge.
5,Metabridge has definitely exceeded my expectations. The cable arrived within 3 days packaging was nice an of course it was a 50' blue cable as advertised. Connected it to the router down the hall in my roomates room strung it down the hall and plugged it into my laptop.  The speed was perfect no hassle and no setup! You would have to be a complete stranger to computers or routers to not be able to install this yourself within minutes.  Great work metabridge keep it up!
4,not industrial strenth cable. guard is hard to use. good cable for the money
5,Purchased this to run a lan cable from the router to a PC where I have weird issues with wifi connections. Kind of an ugly solution as running a cable across the hallway through rooms etc is just ugly! Ended up getting a powerline adapter as well and this now runs quietly against the wall and behind furniture. Cable is perfect.
5,At first I thought the price was a little too good to be true I thought that there must be some kind of catch. But so far the cable has been working great. It's a bit longer than what I needed it for but I was afraid that if i got a smaller length that it wouldn't reach. So I decided on getting this 50 foot cable. It's pretty much what you would expect a 50ft cable with good protection. For under 10$ it's worth looking into.
5,Works as described.
5,We received the 2 cables on time and I ran the cable immediately and it is exactly as described; 50" RJ45 connectors and fast.Thank you
5,This was great! My son went away for the summer to an art program. He needed an Ethernet cable for internet access. This fit perfectly and was easy to set up. He had enough length to carry his laptop from his room to the living room in the dorm. I especially liked the customer service of the company. They emailed me a few times offering their service if I had any questions. That's just amazing!
5,Secure very sturdy and connects very well from my router to my laptop. There isn't much to say about it but it is convenient that the cord if 50 feet long so I can be anywhere in the nearby vicinity so it works out.
5,Good cable. Wanted to run Ethernet cable to my TV in order to free up WIFI congestion and get better signal for 4k content. This cable is of high quality material. the connectors seem to be well made and not going to break. Works very well for my purpose.
5,Exactly what I needed for school! We have to take tests at home "wired in" and this product is a great length so I don't have to sit on the floor close to my router to take the test.
2,My intention was to use it as a hard wire from modem to a router and then use other ethernet cables from router to playstation TV and laptop if I wanted to stream something to TV.  Set it up and tested and everything worked as planned.  I had run the wire under house with support and never touched again.  I used it maybe 3/4 times and it quit working.  I had a friend who's IT expert stop by.  Router receives signal from wireless but not from cable.  Now I have to order another go under house and do again.  Anyone who''s been under a house before knows that's not something to look forward to.  Especially during snake season.  Not sure if I'll try this brand again or use another company.
5,I had this cable for ever and never used it but the price was right and I finally had a need for it and it works as it should.
4,Works well but when I put it into my computer I have to fold back the blue tab on top and just push on the plastic piece because the blue tab constantly gets caught on the side of my computer.
5,I bought three of these 50 ft Cat5e cables for a recent tradeshow event at a total cost that was less than 1/2 the price of renting one cable from the tradeshow expo center! They work fine have good integrated boots and the shielding is nice and flexible -- which makes it easier to deal with routing and coiling cables of this long length. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for good solid perfoming cables that just happen to be low cost too.
5,Perfect size for running a cable from the back of house to the front while hiding it. Runs great and got here in a timely manner.
5,This is the second cable I've bought from Mediabridge; the first was a 25' cable to run between our router and the Blu Ray player so we can watch NetFlix. Got this 50 footer to run from the router under the floor and back up at the other end of our family room so my wife can plug her laptop in without having cables running all over the floor. Same great quality as the first well made works perfectly way cheaper than a wireless adapter.
5,Only had to use a couple of times but thank goodness I had it. Dragging devices within range when re-setup is necessary is not at all convenient. Even in this wireless world wires are often required. Re-connection made simple. Purchased originally to extend connection strength in awkward areas moved making wireless service stronger.
5,Love that they make a cable this long. 10 times the price in the store inexpensive on Amazon performs just as well as expensive cable.
5,Good cable good last resort. Animals destroy it if you have any cats/dogs (i have both) .
5,My grandson uses for his gaming. He would hook it to my computer across the hallway and then into his things.
4,We got two of these 50-foot ethernet cables. They are strong and well insulated and seem to be working reliably. Occasionally there will be a slight lag in the morning before I get a connection to my MacBook Pro off in another room from the router but I think that's to be expected. No cut-outs after that.
5,This cable saved my life when I used it to choke a grizzly bear to death that somehow got into my apartment in New York. Oh and it also works as advertised is of nice quality and quite cheap. But I bet that grizzly bear wouldn't give it 5 stars... Because he saw more than that... When he was being choked... Because of oxygen deprivation... Anyways buy this.
5,We need to hard wire my husband xbox when it was moved to a different room (not sure why since it is wireless).  Using the Cat 5e along with a splitter and an extra bridge box we accomplished the work in no time.  Now our television and our xbox work so much better.  The cost was very reasonable.  Beats buying another router.
5,This product arrived quickly. It works great. I really didn't need 50 ft. but I am glad that I have it because it allows me to take my lap top into another room. I have wireless internet but sometimes I have problems with being off line or not getting a signal. This cable eliminates that problem. I can connect it right to the modem and not have to worry about anything. I would recommend this product to others. It was very reasonably priced. No complaints.
4,It is exactly as described and works great. Fast shipping. Thank you.
5,For the price sold and length it is quite a steal compared to if you were to get the same length at retail stores. Works as intended and better yet it arrived in a storage box with a Velcro clasp.
4,Little difficult releasing plug from terminal. Have to press clip very hard.
5,Bought this for my brothers Xbox 1 that has a sluggish wifi connection...so yeah we plug this in directly to the modem and we are good to go. -=80)
5,Works great! Speedy delivery!
4,Sent back it wasn't the right cord..
4,Good quality cable although it comes in a cardboard box as opposed to a bag like most. I can't figure out if that is a positive or a negative but it seems a little wasteful.
5,I ordered 4 of these. All worked fine with my PoE switch. No problems.Other info* Made in China* Snagless connectors* Only 1 year warranty* Cat 5e should handle gigabit ethernet* Came in an easy to open cardboard box* Manual says "when you call us during normal business hours an American based representative will take your phone call" and no talking to a machine (no phone system). That's refreshing.
5,As Described
5,had a really old ehternet cable and upgraded to this and works great and video games download so much faster now
5,Girlfriend is having problems with her laptops WiFi and the cable company's having problems figuring it out. For the price and fast shipping this is a nice temporary fix and will come in handy if (or when lol) it happens again. With this length she is able to use it any where in the house with no problems.
5,Got this for a Steam Link because the cable needed to run up a flight of stairs. It came with a cable tie which makes it great for stowing behind the TV when not in use. No connection problems and it reaches with some slack to spare.
5,Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and price point.Only thing I would mention is that the blue cover piece that protects the clip is fairly substantial in size and got in the way of me putting it through a small hole in my wall.  Ended up cutting off the rubber tab easily but just something to think about.
5,Needed some network cable and local businesses didn't have. Went out to Amazon and found this company. Cables came in quick and price was amazing. Recommend again!
5,Great product but not a gamer.
5,Bought these flr my ps4s since i needed the boost since wireless was not helping and it did the works for me ran it across the house and connected it to my ps4 and other devices and presto it works and for the price you cant go wrong its 50 feet
5,I have bought 2 of these for my grandson this is so he doesn't have to take it house to house. He loves it
5,Long story short I had some issues with WiFi interference in my apartment. I measured all along the walls so see how long of a cord I would need to have it be out of sight (as I can't drill holes in my walls) and I needed 50 feet.  Seemed like a lot and was expecting it to be much more expensive but it wasn't.  It was affordable the perfect length and a speedy delivery.  Just what I needed.
5,running this to the router downstairs through the garage walls and it works great it has really been taking the heat in the garage like a champ but you should keep this cable out of the sun it will damage it over time because it is not UV sheathed.
5,While comparing this product against others available there are less expensive alternatives. However the durability of the cable jacket was important to us as the product was to be installed on the floor. The lower cost alternative had many complaints regarding the jacket. To date we have had no problems its been installed six weeks. It does what we bought it for extending internet service into a bedroom for an xbox 360.BTW why in world doesn't the crapbox come with wifi?
5,This cable works great. It's exactly what you would expect from a good cable without the shoddy craftsmanship of cheap cables. Would purchase again.
5,Great flexible Ethernet cable.  Ran directly from Wireless router to my Dell Desktop and it is fantastic improvement.  The wireless adapter on a brand new Dell is still a 2.4 card not even able to upgrade to a dual band 5G card.  With this cable the internet flies! and it is flexible enough to snake behind desks without a problem.
5,This product is great!  The product came in original packaging was very easy to open and was not damaged.  It provides a fast connection from my modem to my Samsung Smart TV which allows for a much faster response rate when streaming movies through the internet.  I would highly recommend this product especially the value received.  In addition I ordered Sunday afternoon and received Monday afternoon which was faster than Amazon Prime guarantees.  Great product great company.
5,I needed to move my router to a different part of the house but I had no jacks to move it. I bought this as an extension for my router works fairly well. My order did get messed up when I ordered it with other products and was fee'd a ridiculous extra 10$ for shipping (could have been my fault). All in all 10/10 would buy again.
5,This was a replacement for a previous one that was DOA.  No hassle refund I suspect the bad one was just a manufacturing defect which is going to happen from time to time.
5,I needed a long patch cable and after looking at a couple brick and mortar stores I got on Amazon and found this.  Feels good and sturdy including the ends.  Received it quickly.
4,Product arrived as advertised and on schedule.  Exactly what I needed.  Would order from this vendor again.
5,This cable works great!  I needed a cable to reach from my bedroom to the living room.  Wi-fi doesn't always work great in my house so having this cord is good for when I absolutely need the best internet speeds (streaming movies video games etc...)  The quality of the cable is very good so I see this lasting a long time.
5,Good quality and no connections issues. Great for gaming.
5,We purchased this cable as after we changed the location of one of the PCs the cable we had wasn't long enough.  I just selected this one at random because it was the length we needed.  It arrived promptly even before the promised date which was a pleasant surprise.  We swapped out the old cable for this one and have never had a second's worth of problem with it.  No loss in speed everything is just fine.
5,I'm not a techie so let me go with what I noticed. Right out of the box this cable felt heavier and more solid than the one it was replacing including the connectors. This is a good thing as the previous cable had twisted horribly about itself and the sleeve had split to where I had to tape it up. Hooked it up and the data flowed. Since I'm no techie I'll leave it at that.
5,Great price and fast delivery thank you.
5,Perfect cable. Ran a line from the second floor down to the first to run the Amazon Fire TV wired and it is perfect. The unit ran very nicely wirelessly buy I'm a wired kind of guy what can I say? Good quality cable connectors construction and price! What more can you ask for!
5,Reached across my 1000sq ft house. My router is near the front door living room & my office next to the back door. This was the perfect solution to still be able to have internet since my work doesn't allow wireless & would have cost more to have a technician to move the router
5,I've only used it for a few days so can't speak to longevity but for me this long cable saved my job.  I was doing an online job that involved downloading videos and relying on my wifi which went in and out -- not good.  So for a while I dragged my desktop computer into the other room to hook it directly to the DSL modem with a short cable I had -- not so convenient.  Then I bought this cable -- yeah!  Now I can do my job (whew).Follow-up 1.5 years later -- still works great.
5,It completely stopped the issues of the Internet cutting out of my Xbox one. it was also long enough to go from the modem which was a room away all the way to my room also this cable is much stronger than ones I have purchased in stores.
5,I purchased this item to connect a security system's DVR box to a router (had to go up through the ceiling tiles requiring this length).  Everything worked and the quality of this cable makes me believe that it will work as advertised for years to come and will not be needing replaced any time soon.
5,Met my expectations.  Item arrived in 1 day. No complaints.
5,I ran this from my home office under my house to the Den to connect to a 5-port switch and add ethernet to my AV receiver Apple TV and Channel Master DVR+.  I've seen significant improvements in speed on the Apple TV load times.  I'm no longer watching trailers in SD.  This cable came at a great price and has done the job so far.
5,Fantastic price! More length than I needed! Will be able to use this bad boy for a life time due to using it's length when ever I move since it can reach anywhere in the house. It also saved the internet speed in my room since my wireless have been acting up lately.
5,i got it withough ever knowing if i would need it a year down the line i ended up using it to directly connect my desktop pc to the router 50 feet was just enough to hook up my pc.
4,Cable is good quality
5,I was using the Sony 802.11g WIFI (USB) unit and was only getting two out of five bars; and that was with the unit in it's adapter harness and taped to the top of my TV (distance 25 ft.).  I disconnected the Sony unit and am going directly into my Sony BRAVIA T V's Eathernet connection and am getting a much higher download speed with no dropouts or long searches.  Additionally my other WIFI equipment is operating better.
5,Good quality product. I connected a desktop PC in the bedroom directly to the Verizon router model 7550 located in the kitchen. The cable works as expected.After reading about complaints of some wireless USB adapters dropping off connection intermittently I decided to play it safe and hard wire my PC to the router. For me the connection to the internet is up ALL the time and the cable is a lot less expensive than some high end USB adapters.
1,I ordered a 100 ft Mediabridge cable (  Mediabridge Ethernet Cable (100 Feet) - Supports Cat6 / Cat5e / Cat5 Standards 550MHz 10Gbps - RJ45 Computer Networking Cord (Part# 31-399-100B )        ) and was HIGHLY impressed with the quality and packaging. I also  ordered two 50 ft and one 25 ft length (  Mediabridge Ethernet Cable (25 Feet) - Supports Cat6 / Cat5e / Cat5 Standards 550MHz 10Gbps - RJ45 Computer Networking Cord (Part# 31-399-25B )        ) in the same order. The cable lengths all came from different shipping warehouses. The quality of the 25 ft and 50 ft cables were SIGNIFICANTLY inferior to the 100 foot cable.  They felt very cheaply made they did not come with the same professional cardboard packaging (in a bag with no Mediabridge markings KFK brand instead of Mediabridge and the promised cable tie was not included. Note the difference in the attached pictures.  Be cautious if you care about quality or if you are doing a time sensitive project and don't have time to wait for new cables!  Very disappointed.
5,I bought this cable because it has a pretty good review and is long enough for my specific usage. The router in my home is placed out side out room because we share it with the other 2 roommates. Before I got this cable I used a wireless chip in my PC. Although we have 75mb/35mb fios but the wireless speed is very low something like 20mb or less.  But this cable gives us 80mb speed. Just so cool.
5,Great solution for teleworkers with a not so great VPN network. Being wired in improves the overall experience of all internet stuff. 50 feet allows you to hook up laptops and sit wherever in the room you want.
5,Bought a 50ft Cat5e cable came fast and was super inexpensive... I was buying all my cables from walmart and found these guys...thought it was too good to be true and took the gamble expecting to get ripped off to be honest!  Well it came and works great and is of good quality and I have business ethernet and have had no slow ups...I will be buying all my cables here waaaaay cheaper than anyone else!  thanks!
5,This cable came in just one day as promised. It was easy to connect and works really well. I'm glad I bought it!
5,I use these to have old school Xbox LAN parties. Thy seek to handle all the data just fine from three Xbox’s playing Halo with 12 players. Now to test 4!
5,Well made I like that the connector doesn't have that enclosed clip part that you push to disconnect it.  This has a nice piece of the rubber that protects it and it is easier to push.
5,Excellent quality. Cable material flexibility was excellent.  Definitely will recommend this product
4,I would have given five stars but the shipping was not on time. I run a small business from home and it set me back by two days. Other than that it is a great product.
5,Very good value for the length of cable. Sturdy clip.
3,This is not a high speed cable only 50-60 mbps just a standard patch cable.  Shipped as advertised in only a few days.  It was not the product I was led to believe as a 5e cable it should be able to move data at 1gbps and did not. As I posted 50-60mbps from a good modem and internet.
5,Works well.
4,Quality
5,Right now on my iMac I can see 38 wireless networks within range in our apartment complex.As a result the wifi frequency is crowded and thus wifi doesn't work so well here.We got a couple of these cords to plug in old school style and it works great.Also great for Skype calls or streaming video as there is no packet loss with ethernet.
5,Worked perfectly for me.  I had to move my computer Desk from one side of my living room to the other. I needed a cable long enough to run from my cable modem to the desk top. I ran it along the wall with small clips and it worked great.  Been using it for a few months now & still works perfectly.
4,The cable performs well carrying internet signals from a router to a smart TV. The picture and audio look and sound good.
2,I bought this for when I work from home and need to be hard-wired connected. I haven't had it for very long and only use it once or twice a week. Today however when I went to disconnect the cable from my laptop it wouldn't budge. It didn't matter if I squeezed very hard or hardly at all I couldn't get the laptop disconnected.  When I was finally able to get it out I noticed the clear plastic piece was cracked. Now I'm afraid to use it again. I need to be able to disconnect when I take my laptop into the office.  Very disappointed.
3,I recieved it quickly but it is for a project over 100 miles away and I might not get there to install it for another week - will check back but it should work fine
5,I bought this to help with my PC Gaming and to get away from wifi devices for better internet connection. simple plug in and go. Works great. Great fast connection. Highly suggest if your looking for a good ethernet cable. Plenty of length to work with.
5,Does exactly what it claims to do. My internet speed went up by at least 10Mbps. My husband and I can game without any lags now
5,This blue cable is for ethernet it is blue 50 ft long and provides internet from my router to my devices via the plug and wire. It is a cable and it complete's it's prime objective.
5,Cable is very well constructed and there is no signal loss over the 50 ft. span.
4,Good cable but the rubber shielding can get in the way sometimes making it hard to remove from an Ethernet port
5,I didn't use it for gaming. Just websurfing. It's been working great.
5,I needed a long ethernet cable to connect my TV to my router to prove to Samsung that the problems I was experiencing were not due to wireless connection. This cable was the right length at an attractive price.I was quite happy with how quickly the order was processed and the cable is certainly a good quality cable.
5,Appreciate it’s functionality. Not for typical needs but if you want to be safe about the length it’s great.
5,I ordered a 50-feet cable and a 15-feet cable and I'm very happy with my two cables! The cables look and feel like high-quality product. I don't know much about "cables" but I know everyone recommends Cat5e so I purchased them. This was my first time buying a cable but I'm certain I (as always) made the a great purchase.I trust the quality and reliability of these cables.Happy customer. +5 stars
4,decent cables for price but not top end quality.
5,This is exactly what I ordered and needed.
5,I bought the cable to replace a long phone cord connecting my dsl modem to my wireless router. I was told the signal degrades on long phone cords but not on an ethernet cable. The delivery was prompt and mediabridge also included more information on their products with the cable which i thought was a smart marketing move and followed up to see if the item had arrived promptly. All in all a pleasant retail encounter.
5,does what it's supposed to do actually transmits AT LEAST 1gbit. Haven't plugged into anything faster yet
5,great product for the price if you like using cable for your pc instead of using wifi this is a must have. Gonna buy more of this in the future
5,For something so cheap I expected it to have more issues but everything was in pristine condition! Great item I would recommend to others!
5,"50 feet Ethernet cable for only $10!? WOW!!& The best part this isn't one of those cheap Ethernet cables. If your looking for an Ethernet cable I would RECOMMEND THIS ONE! Although I bought the 50 feet one it's always good to have extra length just in case and this seller also have the 25 feet one for about $2 cheaper. SO IF YOU NEED AN ETHERNET CABLE STOP LOOKING AND BUY THIS ONE! "
5,Works great
5,Bought this cable to connect my Denon AVR X3300 receiver to Netgear router because of problem with downloading firmware update using wireless transmission. Attached this cable between AVR and  router and had no problem installing update.
5,Worked the minute I received it and is still working great. I have current certification as a CNCT so I know a good computer cable when I see one. And this company definitely provides professional grade products.
5,Works great.  Using this to connect my high speed internet hub in my livingroom downstairs to my bedroom tv upstairs.  Plenty of length to go around everything and hide the cable.  Connected for 8 months and working great.  Mainly added as protection against lag of wifi connection when streaming tv.
5,Just what I needed for my apartment. I needed to run an ethernet cable throughout half of my house and this did the trick. Nice durable wire coating and solid plastic snap locks that do not look like they will break.
5,Great cables and great price. These are high quality cables with great plugs fimly attached and with a built in stress relief at the bottom of the plug. They attach solidly and I have had no signal loss even over a fifty foot run in less than ideal conditions. I was initially concerned with the low price but when i used these all concerns went away I would certainly buy a mediabridge product again.
4,little longer than i needed no issues yet :)
5,Boyfriend needed it for his gaming pc and it runs everything perfectly no lag
5,It's a really long cable that seems very sturdy. I ran it through several rooms in my apartment and after months of being walked on randomly or kicked around it still performs perfectly.
5,Got this for $10 and it's well worth the money considering they sell the same thing in the store for up to $40. Ethernet is much faster than Wi-Fi and cheaper in most cases than just getting a better modem
5,The first Mediabridge product I bought was a Medialink   Medialink Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - NEW Design w/ Internal Antenna         router. Wow what a difference it made compared with old router plus the costs of these products are inexpensive! Anyways I bought the 50 foot blue cable and it's high quality then I purchased the 25 foot cable. No complaints at all!!! Great price great product.
5,I'm not sure if it is that important but I checked my computer download speed with this 50 foot cable vs a 6 foot cable and all tests came out similar. The jacket appears to be of high quality and it has a little protector for the clip that none of my other cables have and I have had problems with the clip on other cables so that is a nice little extra.
5,Works as intended. It's a substitute for working on things across the room from the router. Using only as a back up cord. I purchased and use all Cat6 cables as permanent tansmission.
5,Simple CAT 5 cable received as advertised.  Good price and attentive customer service follow-up.  Very good!
5,Router isn't close to where TV sits.  Sometimes Wifi won't stay connected but with this cable I'm able to run it from the TV  LAN  input to the router when needed.  Doesn't seem to bleed or sense a loss or lag in signal strength due to length either
5,works as it should
5,I purchased this cable to extend my existing network.  The price was very good for a 50' long CAT5e cable. It seems to be of good quality and has been in service for about a week with no issues.  I purchased an optical cable from Mediabridge and found it to be of excellent quality so. I decided to use their Ethernet cable as well and I am not disappointed.
5,I've been using Mediabridge products for several years and have yet to have one not work out of the box nor in extended usage.  I believe they will outlast the electronics they are connected to.  I highly recommend them for all your cable needs!!!
5,I have wi-fi available but direct connect to my modem increases speed close to 2X  and being as my modem and computer are over 25 ft apart this cable did me just fine.
3,This is certainly not a CAT6 cable.  The conductors were 24 gauge (cat5e) and so soft that they felt like cat5 copper clad aluminium.  Next to a Mediabridge CAT6 cable there is a huge and obvious difference.  This needs to be relabeled as CAT5e or even CAT5.
5,I've used this cable for over a year now with no signs of issues great for my desktop PC across the house. The rubbertip makes it a bit difficult for removal but likely is a good thing instead especially if you've had issues with cables slipping out in the past. Highly recommended.
5,Its a good durable cord. We actually have it running outside to another modem in our garage and it has held up to the weather just fine. The plastic on the ends are good quality and have not broken like the last one we had. Its a very good price for 50ft.
5,Worked great
5,Great quality. 50 feet more than need but better to have it and not needed than to need it and not have it.
5,I picked up two of these to relocate my wireless router from my basement where my cable modem is to the garage up on a shelf which extended my coverage to the range I needed.  Saved me from having to redo my modem and a few switches already located in the basement.  Product is working well.  Speeds remained constant.
5,As described
5,Works as it should. I mainly got it to back up a desktop mac to my Airport time capsule for the first time since the data load is so much. The computer is really far away from TC so this was good. Then also used it to back up a screen broken laptop that is always far away from TC.
5,I purchased this product because I need to runs internet line from my leaving room to my bed room to hook up my Smart TV into the internet firs I thought it will cost me alot to buy this cable but when I found this product it is hard to beleive that the price is very cheap!.They ship the product quick The company is great!.I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,So far two months service the cord has been OK. No problems installing it and the transmission of data is perfect. I hope it continues.
5,It Works!I purchased the cable to connect my computer to the router.  Works perfectly.  There is no visible loss in speed by using this 50 ft. cable over a shorter say 6 ft. cable.
4,I got this to connect my computer to the modem so I could play online computer games with my buddy. I think I had something wrong with my wireless router this was the cheaper fix since the wireless still allowed connection just not gameplay. This product is nicely made and haven't had any problems I would recommend this.
5,Flexible resistent the type of material used by Apple products which are nice to handle and responsive. I have seen all kinds of RJ45 already in my life; however this is one that actually does wnat you want and stays were you need and does not have a mind of its own and move by it self like a Toy Story toy while you are away from your network. Greate product. Bought two alredy. unbeatable prices.
5,The price is great! The value you get for an ethernet cable that is this long and works well is all you can ask for as the customer! When your router sucks for wi-fi connectivity or your device sucks at receiving the wi-fi signal this is a great solution to an annoying problem
5,I do online gaming and every now and then I will go on YouTube and stream videos and such and everything looks great. Great performance with gaming and streaming. Everything loads up pretty fast and I have no problems while using this Ethernet cable. I also use my computer for school stuff as well and I couldn't be happier with this Ethernet cable. I am totally satisfied.
5,This is a quality product and the pricing was very good. I needed a cable to run  to my laptop because for some reason our WiFi has slowed down. This worked perfectly and I will definitely but from this seller as I have in the past also with other products.
5,I ordered this to connect my new computer to my router. I am getting great speed through the cable. The only problem I have is cosmetic I don't care but my wife wishes I ordered a white cable so it would blend in better running along the wall and door frame but that is just cosmetic and I don't mind. I like blue and like the look of it in my office.
5,I bought 2 they went from one side of the house to my computer then the other one went even further to my PS4. Internet is good. These gave me internet. These are good.
5,I've been struggling with low download and upload speeds on my ps4. Our Internet is up to 150 mbps. Before the wired connection I would average 12-15 mb download 2-3 mb upload. Now it averages 120 download and 7-8 upload. Not bad.
5,When I first looked at this i wasn't sure it would be enough. But for the price I couldn't help but try. Turns out it is the exact length I needed and fast as hell! If you need 100mbps of open bandwidth. This should be your go to. Can't beat it for the price!
5,I have to write something here so its blue.
5,Used this to replace an existing cable with a bad connector.  The difference in quality was huge.  Even though these are inexpensive the are very nice quality and highly recommended.
5,The cable is a quality cable and works perfect for my application (connecting a dvd which supports the internet to my router). The cable came on schedule in a good shipping box. The price is sooo reasonable I was hesitant to buy  afrraid of poor qualitybut it is just a good buy! This my 1st buy from Mediabridge but ithey are now on my favorites for future buys
5,This has the added advantage (that I didn't know til I bought the cables) of reducing the heat transfer via the mac lightening cable adaptor.  Thanks to 50 feet of ethernet cable the lightening connector & mac get warm but haven't overheated.
5,The wifi extender I bought didn't really work so I just drilled a hole in the floor and strung this across the ceiling of the basement to my downstairs office.  Now there are no worries whether I'm connected.  I shut of the wifi button on the side of my Dell to make sure this is the only connection.  How can you beat this low price!
4,I purchased a Blu-ray DVD Player and thought it had WIFI...I needed Ethernet to connect to the internet to watch my Netflix movies online.... My TV is not that close to my computer and I needed a cable long enough to connect to the computer...This did the job...This item arrived quickly and in time for movie night.
5,I was shopping around for an Ethernet cable for my Xbox 360 after I started having some signal strength issues with my wifi. I checked then local brick and mortar stores around my area but the prices were ridiculous compared to this product. The cable itself seems well made and its long enough for me to run it around my room with no issue or worry that I would damage it.
5,Cord reaches from out upstairs playroom where WiFi modem is located all the way downstairs to my office.
5,Connects great works great but if you know you don’t need this much length but something smaller unless you’re good at wire management the cable goes everywhere 😫
5,I'm very happy with the cable. Seems to be high quality and there's no problems using it. What I especially like is that it's flexible. Some cables are stiffer and stick up on the floor and are hard to turn around corners and they won't stay where you put them. This is nice to work with. Seems well built too.
4,I ordered 4 of these cables from Mediabridge - 3 of them came in blue and 1 came white. I'm picky when it comes to color coordination and it astounds me that they would assume that it's alright to detour from the product description "Mediabridge - Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (50 Feet)" At least it's 50' long and everything else was correct.
5,The product came on time was in good condition and it seems okay. I like the design of the clips - how they are covered. I think it's a little more secure than other network cables that lack them.I didn't measure from the basement to the router upstairs properly so I won't be able to use this cable for a while. I ended up ordering a 100 ft cable.
5,Works wonderfully. I was worried about a lag being that the cord is 50 feet long but the ethernet cord works like a charm. I have owned other cords in the past and this one is well made and feels less likely to tangle than others.
5,My computer is situated about 40 feet from my cable tv input and I don't like WiFi all that much.  Consequently I run extension cables from cable modem to my office.  This cable is very good - flexible durable (so far) and easy to run behind furniture out of the way.  When I need more cable it will be my first choice.  Can't say better than that.
5,This works perfectly and I've had no issues.  For some reason these always die on me and I have to use for my hime office but perfect so far and I need every inch of these 50 feet.
5,When i have to outfit a home office or wire something up i just search for "mediabridge" on amazon and find what i need within a click or two. The ends aren't cheap they're normal like they should be. I also got the 100 ft cables and those perform with no problems. Repeat customer.
3,it took 2 extra days to arrive but everything seems fine
5,Very durable cable with nice locking mechanism.  They are well insulated both inside and out.  The interior of the cable uses an "X" shaped plastic pirce to shield the wires from each other and keep them in place.
5,I bought this a few years ago I have not had to buy a new ethernet cord since! this thing is very long but perfect in every way.
5,Used this to connect my house to my shop and it worked great
5,Now my PS4 isn't on wifi. Yay for faster downloads and streaming!  Wife is happy I actually ran this through the ceiling and down the wall instead of just across the floor.  50 feet was what I needed.
5,50 feet was perfect to stick through the wall ran under the house back up through the other wall to my wired blu ray player.  And now the blu ray player has a direct connection to Comcast via our wireless router.  Now we can finally think about signing up for Netflix.  woo hoo.
5,awesome product definitely recommend this
5,I have plenty of slack but it works perfectly. WiFi disconnections are no longer a problem and I’m satisfied with the product. Also is very sturdy.
5,This is the second cable I have bought from these people.  They are good cables. The work great.
5,Worked perfected very durable. Had it going from one room to another and was able to withstand having doors closing on it and still worked fine.
5,I bought this for hubby because our cable wifi wasn't allowing him to game properly. He decided to hard wire and this has been very helpful. No lag or glitches
5,Mediabridge Ethernet Cable (50 Feet) - Supports...  SOLD BY:  Mediabridge Products LLC.Good average type cable for cat5 uses.  New conditon handy to have a spare around.170921 1515
5,Pretty blue color!  Clips clip into port with amazing speed!  Cats love the way the 50 feet of cable snake across the entire house  -- clumsy husband not so much!  You won't find a better cable than this!Kidding aside cable works as I would expect.  Waaay less expensive than anything I could have bought at a brick & mortor store; arrived promptly and am happy with purchase.
5,Great quality cable. I replaced the old one I had because I had let someone else borrow it and broke one of the connectors.
5,Does what its supposed to do.
5,You wouldn't think a cable makes much difference but this one really improved our network speeds. I had an old Radio Shack ethernet cable I was using to extend my network with a second wireless router for upstairs in our home. So I check the speeds before and after and I know for a fact that the wireless network was then operating about 25% faster.
5,I needed a long cable to connect to my lan to update my Netgear in this cord work great cuz it was about 50 feet away from me to do that
5,Exactly what I needed. A bargain at twice the price! Nothing cheap or poorly constructed about it. Really light but sturdy. Fits nicely under the door to the study. Unobtrusive and well-made. I know because I unplug it every night so I don't trip over it on the way to the bathroom in the dark. Great quality--have been using it for a week and will update if anything goes wrong (doubt it will).
5,Quick Delivery. plugged cable into my xbox one and I dont why I didn't do it sooner! I had to run it almost the full length and it worked fine!
5,The cable is very good. It has a light that shows that it is connected and it has that small blue part protecting the very fragile transparent part that guarantees the proper attachment to the computer. I like it a lot!
5,My wireless connection on my laptop has been questionable lately.  I needed an Ethernet cord that was durable (I have a 3 yr old who thinks brightly colord cords are toys) and long enough to allow me to maneuver as if I had a wireless connection.  This is meeting my needs.  Plus you can never go wrong with the service and shipping speed via Amazon.
5,Exelente
5,Got it for work and it is affordable longer than what Best Buy tried to charge in store.
5,Durable and perfect for my internet speeds. I bought two cables to run them through my home's walls and they've held up nicely with no problems!
5,When we checked prices prices for this productI was a little concerned at how inexpensive it was but felt I could return it if not satisfied.The delivery was as promised and I was completely happy to see that it was of the same quality as the one I had to replace from another company at twice the cost.Thank you we will order from your company again if needed
5,Not much to say it's an ethernet cord and it does the job.
5,I bought it to work from home so that I can freely move all over the house working and doing some house works as well. Cable is durable doesnt bend at the plug port which I really needed. Definitely gonna buy other cat cables from these guys to work on my switches and routers.
5,Works greatEDIT: Lasted about 2 1/2 years before it went out on me. Had to replace the cable with a new one because I was getting about 30Mbps when I was paying for 300Mbps
5,This cord was a steal! Plenty of cord play . Wish there was a band to help keep it together but overall good buy with good connection.
4,This cable comes quickly and does the job right. I'm an avid internet gamer and I shopped around quite a bit before settling on this chord; it's absolutely the best quality and size to the price that is possible to find. If you ever buy a cable from a retail store; you have wasted you're money.
5,great buy for durable cable
5,My son needed a faster connection for his online gaming than wifi would give him. This is an incredible value for a long cable
3,This works perfectly a Cat5e cable. Great speeds used with router and computer (I play a lot of video games). My issues is the cheap plastic housings. Over about a year of the plastic housing around all the wires started cracking in a lot of places. I rarely moved the cable so it could not have been due to "wear and tear." It was a result of sunlight and regular air exposure. This definitely works if you're on a tight budget but I'd spend more if you want it to last.
5,Came as ordered and has been in use on the floor for over a year. Withheld foot traffic great.
5,The cable arrived in the same package as the new laptop I ordered. I hooked it all up to the router and within a few minutes I was sharing files between my two machines and accessing the Internet on each. I decided not to go with WI-FI in the house as there seems to be too much RF interference so this cable is perfect.
5,Can't beat price. Works excellent.  I no longer hear the screams of my boy "I'M LAGGING".. He's lagging all right but that's another story. And it can also be used as a whip or if doubled over a noose.. So again for the price BINGO -BANGO!
4,It's an Ethernet cable. It's 50 ft long. It's blue. It works. The cable is a tad stiff but can easily be straightened out with a little diligence. The little plastic tabs that cover the jack release can get in the way with some device jacks but are not a problem with wall outlets. I'd be comfortable running this through a wall if necessary.
5,Worked for our Xbox to our router
5,Absolutely perfect no complaints whatsoever. It was the perfect size to wrap around the living room from the router to the tv
5,Good standard Ethernet cable.  Good price and fast shipping
5,It's works exactly as expected. I use it to hard-wire my laptop in the basement to the router upstairs. I use it so there's enough bandwidth to stream Blu-ray quality videos and Steam games in 1080p. It's not failed me once.
3,Update: it lasted one year and now it isn’t working. I guess you get what you pay for.My Office is in the only wifi deadzone although I have blast internet and am pulling 50mbs in wifi everywhere else in the house. I used this to hardwire my computer to the modem across the house. This was so much less than any computer supply store. I was a bit skeptical given the price but I haven't noticed any delays in internet signal.
5,Lengthy Ethernet cable I needed for my big ass house. Worked its way from the master bedroom to the basement to connect to my computer.
3,Right length
5,Great sturdy cable I have running through the apt and up some stairs into the bedroom. The door has actually been catching it (not good on my part) but the cord is tough and I'm having no trouble as of yet!
5,Gr
4,I needed a cord from my room "upstairs" to my router "downstairs" I was able to line the cord against the wall with some slack stil left. It's for my PS4 and now I don't have to worry about signal strength now
5,Mediabridge provides cost-effective yet high quality network (as well as audio video) cables. I ordered two 50-foot CAT 5e cables which arrived just a few days after placing the order. The cables present good build quality with snag shields for the RJ45 tabs. Past experience demonstrates that Mediabridge cables stand up to the rigors of constant use. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again. Definitely worth a try!
5,I don't pretend to know anything about the internal difference in cables.  These are well made as I discovered when trying to get the ends through the hole in the floor. The cable greatly improved my Hulu and Netflix performance over the wireless connection.  Mediabridge sent a follow-up email to make sure that I was happy with my purchase which was nice touch.
5,Works as advertised.
5,The extra length is useful and it has those clip release aids at the ends which make getting these out of a port so much easier. Haven't had any issues with the cable itself as I've only had it for about a week but there shouldn't be too much to go wrong with a cable anyway. The cost was definitely a deciding factor for me for the whole cost:length ratio.
5,I have this cable run through the walls of my living room and into my basement without any problems.  Very happy with this cable at a very reasonable price.
5,Having a LAN party?  Great! these work.  Connectors are awesome.  Cord is sturdy and hard to get gnarled up.
5,This is a quality product. Gave good performance. Well packaged and arrived quickly. Value for money.
1,I tried two of these for a 50' run to a high end HP rackmount gigabit switch and neither one could do gigabit just 100Mbps.  I also tried both of these with USB 2.0 over ethernet and neither one worked.  Replaced with two other cables that were only slightly more expensive and the other brand worked no problem for both gigabit ethernet and USB 2.0 over ethernet.To be fair these were running near power lines for 8' of the run so I suspect it's the lack of shielding and thin jacket that make these cables problematic for longer runs although I also tried them away from power lines and they still didn't work.  The replacement cables I purchased were individually shielded twisted pair with gold connectors Cat7 rated for $5 more.
5,A great length many uses
5,This cord is long. Has had no issue of quality for using it for the past year. Very good quality product. Would recommend
5,Standard good quality Ethernet cable. I'm no networking specialist so I can't tell you how great "such-and-such" feature would be. I have other Mediabridge cables and thrust their products quality and longevity. One non-techie feature I like; the cable attaches itself securely to the device and doesn't let go easily. This has turned out to be a big plus for our video game console as we move it in and out of the entertainment unit.
5,Works great super high speed..
4,Does it's job but the cable is hard to position the way u want it
5,This has real twisted pairs shielding and boots to protect the clips.  Had to cut off the rubber boots to squeeze the connectors through the holes that were already here that I didn't want to widen.  Length was perfect.  Never any problems with it when you get quality cables you know you'll stay connected!  I'll definitely come back to buy more from Mediabridge when I need it.
5,It is an amazing cable! I was taking a chance on it and it paid off. Super cheap and has constant reliable internet connection. I use this for my studies as well as gaming on my laptop. I don't regret buying this and i recommend to all of my friends and anyone reading these reviews to GET THIS CABLE!
4,does what i need it to.
5,Does exactly what I need it to do
5,Perfect
4,I was hoping this would fix our download speed issue but it hasn't.  I will have to try a new or better router.
5,Exactly what I was looking for
5,I work with an aged CPU (doesn't have wi-fi capabilities) so this item was used to link my computer with the external modem.  Works great!
5,This is exactly what I needed.  My wi-fi was no longer safe to use.  Someone was stealing my internet.  This 50ft cord will let me use my computer in any room in my home while connected to the modum & is turned off when not using.  Thank you Amazon & Mediabridge Products for fast delivery.
5,Only company i trust for a good product without being gauge for price. Huge value
5,This cable was perfect for extending my original ethernet cable to where I needed it to be.
5,Works so far.  Product is what was described.
5,I bought this networking cable for my blu ray player that is in a different location than my computer modem and router. The blu ray player I purchased only supports a wired connection. This item works perfectly. It was just what I needed and wanted. I am very happy with the functionality of this item. I received it quickly as well. I just love Amazon.
5,It's long enough to make it from my bedroom to the living room where the router is. Glad I didn't need to buy a 100 footer. It doesn't really tangle that much at all very nice. It's all pretty blue and it does what it's supposed to do. Would buy again if I needed to.
5,Arrived quicker than expected. Very nice and long cord durable and reliable. What order it again if and when I need it.
5,Fairly thick rubber material but don’t shut doors on it for sure. Works great and has lasted for months 10/10
5,Doesn't get any better for the price. Works very well with Xbox One. Would definitely recommend.
5,Excellent length I’m not confined to one area! Works great 👍🏽
5,Works exceptionally well. Connects to the router and download speeds are much faster.
5,Great cable at a great price.  Not as heavy-duty or as thick as some commercial-grade cable but perfectly fine for home network use especially given the good price.  Works flawlessly with no problems at all and beats a wireless connection in terms of speed and reliability all day long!  I will buy again if/when needed.
5,I use this to hook my PS3 up to the rooter to stream PS Vue. Satisfied gives me a much more stable connection than over wifi and consistent speeds
5,I received the product a day earlier then expected. The service was fast.  The product was inexpensive and I am very happy with the product.
5,Great cable great delivery no reason not to purchase from this vendor again.
5,"boss A** product" is the words i want to use to explain this product. it works great no issues and no speed lag due to how long the wire is.currently part of a 7 hardwired set up using as a running wire from downstairs to upstairs splitting to its own wireless router
5,The price and delivery
5,Quick delivery works perfectly detailed correctly.Use it for gaming on the Xbox One get 20 ping while with WiFi i get 35 and lag.
5,Great product for pricing.
5,It's an ethernet cable. It works and seems well built. Was pliable enough as well.
5,Its been two weeks it works well no complaints it seem a little slower but that's it
4,I bought this to connect my TV to a computer to view movies and such a cheap version of a Roku box. It works fine the connectors are solid. My only concern is that the cable covering may not be rugged enough to run under carpet so I will probably beef it up with some duct tape.
5,The cable arrived quickly and it was exactly as advertised. It is working very well so far. I've had it for two days. The real test is its longevity and how the outer chord endures over time. I'd ordered another one previously (from another vendor) and the outer blue covering shredded within about a year.This one looks very sturdy and I have great expectations.
5,It works great!!! I'm able to remain connected whereas with my wifi connection I was constantly loosing signal
5,I ordered the cable on a Friday and it was delivered on Sunday morning - pretty good. Cable works fine; maybe not the highest quality cable but perfectly fine for my needs.  And the price? Awesome.
5,Bought this to run a direct line from my Home Security system's DVR. Works great durable but still flexible. Connections good on both side and network port is not detecting any errors.
5,Lots of cord to as needed nice connector locks high speeds all good here.
4,worked as advertised perfect length for my application. speeds are right on point.
5,No frills works as it should and it's a great price. I needed a little over 40 feet of cord to reach my computer so this works nicely.
4,Good for the money 💰
4,This is a high quality RJ45 connector cable that is suitable for outdoor use and very durable. I have never sen or used a better one. the downside is they charged me almost as much as the price of the cable for shipping and handling which is outrageous!
5,This cable was priced well shipped on time and is still working perfectly.  What more could I ask?
5,Works as promised. Used it to connect a personal server up with a wired connection after seeing how unreliable wireless was.
5,It works!Darn cats always chewing on my cables. I even looked into how to repair damaged cables but at this price it's easier to just buy a new one. Will recommend to friends.
5,Nice cable for the money
5,My router can only be in one spot in he entire apartment but now I can hardwire anything in it. Great consistent connection and good speeds
5,It's a cable that fits and it works. It looks like a quality item and it's at a good price. Packed well and arrived on time. Plus it comes with a nice cable tie.
5,This is a very excellent product. Great price. Highly recommend buying from this company.
5,Well made product. Using it instead of WiFi for streaming on tv.
5,Does exactly what it is suppose to. Good quality thick material and perfect length. It came sooner than expected and is great quality.
5,Works as described.  Appears to be a well made product and priced right.
5,Great product at a really great price. I was going to go to Best Buy when we decided to run ethernet directly to our second computer and our TiVo instead of relying on our wireless connection but was shocked at the price. These cables are great and the price is amazing. We ran them under our house and they are performing great.
5,So far it’s been an excellent cable. Haven’t had it for too long yet so I can’t comment on its durability.
4,It's a cable.  It works.. It's a pretty blue color if you like that color of blue..
4,The length of the cable was perfect for my needs. I use this cable to have faster connection while using my Xbox One. I experience a significantly less amount of lag while playing. It's great!
4,Great value.  The jacket is a little thin.
5,not much to be said about this besides it works. my computer is showing that its 1gbps & im getting good internet speed so thats all thats required from me. it came in a brown box thats about 6" x 6". inside there is the cable and an advertisement paper of some sort(junk lol)
5,The length was just right for my set up having said I had to set it up from my router which is located in my living room to my bedroom where I connect it to my ps3.
5,Does it's job feels and looks like a good quality ethernet cord! Also it can basically stretch over most of my house so it's definitely useful for me. Especially since it's 50 feet long. This is going to connect to my PS3 and to my computer for whenever I go to LAN parties. Worth the price and high quality!
5,Worked just as supposed to
5,Works
5,Was using an old ethernet cable and after replacing with this we are seeing better speeds.
5,I used this to connect my router remotely worked great
5,bought this one about 2 weeks ago ...nicely made...well worth it...beware of cheaper versions of this cord....i went and bought a cheaper kind 2 days ago and it broke already...This is the one worth the money
4,Perfect cat5 cable for the job
5,Internet be good with this internet string. 5 Stars.
5,came with a nice extra velcro strap for that chance of getting stuck with a few extra loops needing to get bundled together in a jiffy!
5,Well worth the money....perfect
5,This is one of many cables I have ordered from Mediabridge! At this price it's not even worth my time to buying the cable by the foot and installing my own connectors. A+Thanks Mediabridge!
5,High speed long length great connectors low price and quick delivery - what's not to like?Would buy again - in fact probably will.5e will handle ANY A/V related bandwidth to well over 160 feet so spending any more on Cat6 would be silly.If you need to get AV signals farther than 160 feet your house is too big.  Cut back and simplify a little.
5,I was setting up a new home theater system and have used Mediabridge products before and decided that is who I wanted to stay with.  I am not disappointed in the least.  Easy to work with cable great length and affordable!  No problems with data transfers or speeds... clips are nice and tight no worries of them coming out of the jacks.  Don't hesitate... just buy!
5,What can i say works just fine.
5,Cables are tough and manageable when installing in walls and around baseboards. Connectorso are easy to handle and use. The price and quality of these cables make it a 5 star all around.
5,My PS4 was over 50 feet from the router and the wifi was just not connecting well enough after running this through the attic problem solved!
5,Works great .god quality . Bought it for that and the 50 ft length
5,Any company can throw something in a box and ship it.  This company not only provides an excellent product which works flawlessly first time around it also goes out of its way to make sure of it.  Great communication and a caring attitude sets them a cut above in my opinion.  A true pleasure to do business with!
5,Simple cheap and each one was individually wrapped. Great quality.
4,It’s pretty good. It really helped my internet speed for my PS4.
4,Purchased to replace a defective cable. Works great
5,I needed a longer cable to hard wire my setup and this cable fits just about perfect.  The cable itself is well constructed. The price was reasonable so everything works out
5,Had for quite a few months with no issues. Don't loose any speed hardwired with this
5,Great price for great product. Plenty of cord to run through a couple rooms. Fast internet and great quality.
5,Cable didnt work so they sent me a new one.  Work great now. Ty
5,Worked as it should
5,Was exactly what it was suppose to be.  Arrived when it was suppose to. Great product and service
5,I needed to connect my tv to my internet modem.  I had to go through the floor in one room then under through the basement and up to still another room.  The cable I got was 50 ft. long.  It was perfect. the connectors are great and I cannot beat the price.  This is a good buy. Jan
5,This item was over half as much as the same type of cable at Best Buy (it was $30 there). I have been using it for 4 months now and it is still working perfectly!
5,Was exactly as presented and works very well for my purposes. I am very happy with the beautiful blue and am now planning to buy a couple of other similar cables. Thank you Mediabridge!
5,Great price for ethernet cable.  Nothing else to add really..beats buying it at ripoff best buy prices.
5,Great does it's job. Just wish it was offered in a brown to match wood floors. It runs from one side room to other and is blue.
5,Great product made well. Some cables are weak on the tips but this one is great especially for the price.
5,Works perfectly for my X-Box One to download updates faster while keeping my system in my room.  Doesn't work on my laptop though.  Guess it is not rated for that.
5,These are awesome.They come coiled in some pretty tough and long lasting boxes that flip open.And there are velcro ties inside as well.I was pleasantly surprised.Thank you Mediabridge Products!
5,Very good
5,Cat6 hardwire works great!
5,its a cable...
5,We were looking for a low cost solution to hooking up a computer to our router which was thirty-five feet away. We knew from past experience that Mediabridge made quality cord products so we ordered the 50 ft Cat5e. Plugged it in and we were happy- our internet access has never been faster. Great product at an even greater price! Would buy again without hesitation.
5,Replaced the horrible cable I bought from Walmart that would constantly drop connections for seemingly no reason. No problems since. Works as intended.
5,Bought this cable to hardwire my PC to the modem after the wireless card started acting up. 50 feet was probably overkill but all the little 1s and 0s seem to be able to find their way from the modem to the computer and back just fine so I ain't complaining.
5,Great cord. Good condition. Overestimated the length I needed; 50 feet is a lot of cord. Connects with no problem.
5,This cable does everything it is supposed to. Bought it for my dorm room in order to set up a router in my room and have had no problems. The cable itself is of good build quality but the piece of rubber over the clip does not always stay in place. Nothing bad though; you could always clip it off if you wanted to. Highly recommend.
5,For months my Panasonic tv would randomly disconnect from wifi had no wired connection. Ran this from my router to tv now no more disconnects!  Just need to wait for my 100 degree attic to cool down.
5,Perfect for a home computer. Seems like it will last a long time - held up under a staple gun. Little button near the plug is flexible enough to be usable but doesn't pop off. Keep in mind that 50 feet is A LOT of feet - I didn't measure and I have about 20 ft of cable coiled at my router.
5,used to connect computer direct to router
5,Performs as advertised. No reason to buy anything more expensive.
4,Really long cord great alternative to wifi.  Faster than wifi and ideal for desktop remote access when you are working from home.
5,It seems very sturdy unlike the ones you get at the brick and motor stores and it is a lot cheaper as well.  No problems and the speed is great.  It connects to a roku in our basement that didn't have the best WiFi reception and no more lag!
5,No complaints. Came on time and packaged fine. Comes with a strap to keep the mess of such a long cord under control. The price is right. Not sure what else I would want.
5,We had problems with our wireless blu ray player having lots of interruptions while using Netflix or Hulu especially when someone was online. I learned that computers have priority for wireless so I hooked it up with the Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (50 ft) and the difference is wonderful! It stays put is easy to install and in very durable.
5,So much easier to order the various lengths than having to learn how to make the end connections and buy the subsequent tools. Simple packaging appears to be great customer service based on the follow up email i received asking me to call if i had any questions (assuming this is for more sophisticated products but still the offer is nice!)
5,product works as advertised
5,I'm a long term fan of Mediabridge for their cablesmodems and router. They offer great customer service for us older generation.
5,Product works as intended. I bought this 50' Cat5 cable to run from my router to my new Samsung Smart TV since I prefered LAN to wi-fi. I cut off the RJ45 connector at one end so I would not have to drill big holes in wall and floor. Then I connected a new RJ45 connector to that end myself. Cable works without any problem
4,Ok
5,When I bought this cord I was expecting to have some loss in speeds or some downside to it. There was no such thing and this cord is holding up nicely.
4,It's a 50 foot long Ethernet cable. Works as advertised stays securely in its port. I haven't had any problems whatsoever. Not particularly outstanding but it's fine.
5,Yeah that's right.  Only needed four feet of cable but for the price I couldn't go wrong.  The cable works well enough arrived quickly without complaint and its a great color.  Does that matter?  Always been parcial to blue.  Anyway the cable is 50 feet and If I need that extra length it will really come in handy.
4,I ordered one too manyI only needed one
5,Works like any other cable would and it works Great!!  I've had this cable for awhile now and it hasn't stripped or anything that would make it not work anymore. So its a Great Ethernet cable to have.
5,FIFA was running like crap on wireless so I purchased this 50 footer. Much better.
5,Works great nothing cheap about it. My home's internet isn't top notch. The wifi is fine for Netflix the cat5 is for gaming and game I will. Tastes funny but I think I can fix that.
5,Well worth it very quick connection no lag use for streaming 👍👍👍👍
5,I have no complaints or issues with the cable. It is a standard ethernet cable and does its job well.
5,Thanks a million. Worked fine.
5,Can't go wrong with this ethernet cable.  I needed a longer cable to stretch across my entire basement to hook up my new home theatre receiver and this did the job.  In stores they were asking $30+ for a 50ft cable.  Happy I found this for under $10.  Does just what I needed good connection and fast speed.
5,Great product highly recommended
5,Have not used the cable to date but it looks good.
5,We needed a long ethernet cable to reach my son's room (he does alot of gaming etc)  This works perfectly and arrived at perfect timing.
5,when you need direct connection for gaming you buy mediabridge this bad boy is durable (someone kept sitting sharp objects on the cable but only squeeze not cut through the cable) good looking and best of all maintains the speeds i need for gaming(leagueeso)
5,The product is well packaged and works great! Would buy again.
5,Sure this cable costs a little more than some of the bargain cables offered but it's great. I needed it because my wifi was getting bogged down by all of the devices that access it. I work from home twice a week and need fast reliable internet. This has me back in action after dealing with unreliable wifi.
5,I always buy media bridge and will continue to do so.
5,Cable signal is great ans works well with a network
5,It gives excellent connection!
5,Good ethernet cable super long for a great price bring it to places without wifi and only wired connection and your speed can be double or even triple them what it was on wifi
4,Product works fine and shipping was great
5,Works like it it supposed to. Plug and play to a neanderthal can install
4,Ok
5,I first purchased a cheaper ethernet cord and it worked just fine until a door was slammed on it. This cord seems much more durable and of course works as expected. I use this cord to connect my xbox 360 to my router and sometimes my laptop to my router for a faster connection. Cheap durable works... can't ask for much more.
5,Great cable. Amazon censures reviews of a political nature. Zionist Jeff Bezos is head of the Washington Post so I'm not surprised. Y'all can kiss my ass.
5,My cable signal is perfect. no more stopping what I am doing.
4,It’s alright
5,It does the trick what more can I say? The cord is long efficient and above all pretty good quality.The best kinds of technologies are the ones where you set and forget and this one's no exception. Great product!
5,This was a great cord and I was excited to use.  I'll be buying another one though because my dog ate it before I could plug it in.
5,Dang! I totally forgot I had this. Now that I know it is coiled and connected to my second desktop computer I'll unplug it and run it around the room for my laptop on the table so people don't trip on the 20' one I have. Good product. Never had a problem with it. Thank you.
5,Works well.
4,Needed an Ethernet cable to get my television internet access which I could not do it via WIFI. Would give it five stars but have only used it a month so far works great and the pricing was very good.
5,Love it
5,Now the boy can game with the rest of them
5,This is our 2nd order and everything as far as the order was great! Haven't finished the project but will update then.
5,Great price for a gigabit cable.  There is no noticable decrease in speed from the short cables I had been using.  Have only used it for about a month but does not seem to have any issues.
5,Perfect length and worked as expected.
5,This cable is just what I needed and the blue color really pops!
5,Great cable great speeds I use it for an XBOX 360 and can do gaming no problem. I have the cable running from the living room all the way to my room and I still have some cable left. This was exactly what I needed.
5,This cable does exactly what I needed at a price that can't be beat. It even comes with a little Velcro fastener to keep it rolled up.
5,Awesome cable. Plugs in with a nice 'snap' and stays. Bought one to replace a cheaper version that couldn't do gigabit this one had no issues. Immediately bought another for the next room.
2,The end gets stuck in the computer. I have to take a wrench to get it out. I would not buy the cable again.
5,I have a tower with no wireless card. This extra long cable goes straight from my router to the tower and works very well. I was worried it might be slow (do longer cables mean slower speed?) but it seems comparable to my wireless machines on the same router.The casing seems sturdy no kinks when delivered.
5,Solid construction does what it's supposed to do good value. Will purchase this again should the need arise for another one.
5,I liked it
5,Works great for gaming. Quality Ethernet cable.
5,Great quality cable and keeps data speeds high even for it being a long cable.
5,Quality ether net cord. We use it for streaming TV. Since we got it we've had no more buffering problems!
5,Works great  Just what I needed to get my computer going  Thank you for a great product
5,Fits perfectly into my router and it feels durable.
5,Don't like the color but you don't see it up under the floor running across the ceiling of the basement anyway. Great internet connection from these.  I prefer to run everything directly from the wireless router as the connection is much faster then running wireless.  So I am very happy with these as I bought more then one!
5,Cables are perfect and at a fraction of the cost at a physical store.  I purchase 8 for a school tech lab and they all work great.
5,One of the wires propriety is to get tangle and mangle... Well it didn't happen with this 50 feet roll.  This is sooooo cheap and works so good I wonder if I didn't rip-off the provider.  I couldn't find this wire for much less than 40$ locally (best-buy Comp-USA) now I got it in 2 days its working perfectly and perfectly boxed...  Just get-it it's good fast and cheap...  What can you want more?
5,Good design
5,I was having trouble maintaining a wi-fi connection with my is ISP.  I purchased a replacement for my router which proved no stronger than the old one.  I solved my problem by purchasing the Ethernet Patch Cable and connecting my laptop directly to the modem.  The product is of excellent quality and the service by the vendor was as promised.
5,Cool!
5,I have ordered this twice and both times it has met my expectations. This product has a excellent quality compared to products at my local stores. I would definitely recommend this product for somebody who needs an Ethernet cable. The price was excellent as well.
5,I needed a long cable that works well and gets the job done and this does that perfectly. Comes in a pretty sweet box that I ended up using for my art supplies. Has a good snap click that ensures its it the Ethernet slot and stays in. I would buy again. Especially at the cheap price
4,Works as expected. I needed a long ethernet cable to reach a far wall and this did the job. No need for a random splice or switch to extend reach.
5,This product is as described.  The 50 foot length was needed because we moved our modem from the downstairs computer to our upstairs so that the phone and laptop had better signals. Works great.
5,Fast delivery exactly what I expected for a great price. Beats the hell outta the crazy overcharge Target was going to charge me for the same product........as of 12/15/2015 product is still going strong with no signs of the cable quitting anytime soon!
5,Nice cable sturdy but but not stiff. it works perfectly for my needs which is as a ethernet connection between my computer and router.
5,Not knowing much about computers I just needed a simple ethernet cable that would reach from my living room to my bedroom so I could get online. This one did the trick. I was a bit concerned about quality since it's so long and was worried about kinks causing the wires to not connect but this one has been working fine.
4,The cord is great.  I can't say much for the shipping the shipping company(probably UPS) lost the first one so I had to get a replacement. I highly recommend this cord.
5,Cable works well
5,Great product. Initial quality appears to be very good. Would be great if was shielded. For the price it works great.
5,Good cable. Works as intended. Doesn't cure cancer or anything but it gives me my max promised speeds in college more or less. With WiFi I got 20 mbps. With this cable I get about 100 mbps average. My router is like 10 feet away if you want reference
5,by jove is transfers data at a reasonable speed and a pretty good distance! modern technology is great aint it.
5,It is the correct cable with the length I need.
5,This is a good quality cable at a reasonable price. You can find this same product for a little cheaper price but Mediabridge consistently produces great cables for just penny's more. There packaging looks good too!
5,This jawns a beast of a cable.
5,Installed this to change ROKU from WiFi to Cat5. Picture quality has improved.
5,Even at 50 feet it made my xbox live super fast on my 30mbps.  No more disconnected from xbox live message cause of a junk ass wireless router.  I have a lot of mediabridge cables and they are all great.  They even come in a nice box to keep them in when not in use.
5,good cable
5,I bought this in a hurry and I wasn't sure if it was a good buy. It was. It has been walked on for over a year and no problems. Its long and does the job.
5,I pay for 75 mbps and with this i get around 69 mbps. Way better than WiFi.
5,It's exactly what you asked for. Great cable in great packaging now giving my laptop fast internet from my living room router to my upstairs room. In the months that I had this 0 problems at all.
5,Cable works great and well within the margin of error for cat6 and cat5e
5,Great product
5,great value reaches just shy of 51 feet and just over 49.
5,My gaming
5,I wanted to hardwire my PS4 but it was in the living room while my modem and router were in my spare bedroom/computer room. In-store options cost twice as much. This cable cheaply took care of my problem.
5,Great service... quick delivery... excellent price. Works well and as expected. No issues. Great value!
5,Cheapest 50ft cable i could find. I have this running along the ceeling up the stairs to a second router in my house. I now have 2 wifi networks. No complaints.
5,I’m not using it for gaming but works well
5,designed to pull through cleanly and it worked just fine.  Used it for POE security camera
5,This cable is exactly what I needed. Works great having no issues with it. If I need any others I will buy from this company.
5,I may have bought too long of a cord but luckily I can just roll it up and tie however much I don't use. As I've used it it has seemed to be very study. A good product all in all giving me a stable connection at all times.
5,You simply can't beat the price for this quality cable. It solved my connection issue with ease. Definitely buy from here again!
5,I needed a patch cable to connect an HTPC with a switch on the far side of the basement.  This cable was a good choice - it was a reasonable price for a 50' cable.  The RJ-45 ends snapped nicely and have remained in place.  I would recommend this for anyone needing a lengthy Ethernet cable.
5,Great cable 50 feet lots of length to reach various devices. I use it to talk to cars with my pc through an interface. Works flawlessly.
4,Not much to critique but the one negative I have is that the first time it was unrolled there were kinks that made it impossible to roll back up in a small circle so storing it is not as easy as I would have hoped.
5,The cable I had before cost me 3 times as much and was twice as thin.When the plastic clips snapped off I gave up.This cable is heavy duty and has clip protectors you can feel the quality.I used it to hook up our 55" 3D TV directly to the router (50 ft. away) with no lag in 3D streaming.
5,very satisfied with the cable.  it allows me to be hard wired on my streaming device.  great product for the money!
5,Fast and worked great
5,Needed 50' to run from my modem to my Xbox in the basement. Worked perfectly. Lag issues I associated with the wireless connection no longer exist.
5,My Google TV wireless connection started going downhill skipping when streaming so we decided to try hard wiring instead of using the wi-fi. Stretched this 50 feet down my basement steps to the router from the TV. Working great! Would order again. Been using daily for almost 3 weeks now for streaming Amazon Prime and Netflix.
5,Great quality and works great with our router.
5,Not bad just wish I hadn't bought blue so that I could hide the cord better!
4,Worked great.
5,Really thick wire hard to accidentally break or pull apart. Works awesome.
5,Great quality affordable price.  I have purchased three of these czbles
5,This is a reorder for me.  I have 2 but needed a third one for another area of the house from the router box.  I am not disappointed and the cables are the best I have had in my home.  They are sturdy and durable.  Thank you for this opportunity to reorder this item.
5,And It really is 50 feet long.
5,Worth it buy it great quality!
5,This appears to be a very high quality cable.  I've been using mine a couple of weeks now and it has performed flawlessly.  Highly recommended!
5,It worked good
5,Arrived in time
5,I do a great deal of shopping online. Big things a sometimes very small things. This wan a simple "CAT5" cable. It was perfecttt was well packed and was exactly what I had ordered. That's not the end of the story. It arrived in two days without extra cost! This small order far exceeded my expectations. THANKS!
5,Very good deal!I bought this to run from my crawl space to a computer across the house. Works very well and seems durable also.
5,Nice thick cable and definitely got the job done for my pc
5,It’s a functional internet cable not much to say
5,What can I say really it's a great length and my internet is working so I can write this review.
5,If you're having problems with your cord check in the driver settings and tinker around with them.  I was able to get my issues fixed by changing the settings in the device manager (rightclick computer under the start menu then click manage)
5,They work great and it was able to reach through out my whole house. 5 stars for me. I would totally reccomend it to anybody who's router is 30+ feet away from your computersystems etc.
5,DURABLE cable ends- ours made it through floor joints ceilings drywall and being stepped on a time or two!! Quality CLICK!
5,I loved this product. it has helped my ps4 significantly.
5,I got fifty feet of this Ethernet cable. It comes rolled up in about an 8" box. After stretching it out and plugging it in it works as any Ethernet cable should. Sometimes it's just better to use a wired connection over WiFi. Man I can't believe the great price on Amazon for this!
5,Great product!
5,Have Router upstairs and hanging out in the wall bedroom frame downstairs and connected to the cpu. Thank God I got it longer. Next time I'm going to get the 100. Lol.
5,Used the cable to hardwire a security camera.
5,Work perfectly
5,Happy with purchase. I would buy it again! I have since purchased two more.
5,Ran this across my whole house through the basement. It's perfect. Picture of my gaming PC that it's routed to.
5,Was glad to find this on amazon. I have had no problems at all works great.
5,We are using the Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable from Amazon now on a GPS telephone extender and it appears to be working fine.  It is a beautiful blue color and is well made.
5,It's great not to have to mount cable ends.  When I did that in the past I've never had a 100% success rate.  You can't miss with these cables.  I've purchased a second cable for another application since installing this one.  I'll never fiddle with connectors again.
4,Works great. Wal-Mart had it for $30.
5,Love this ethernet cable it works great with my internet and security system.
5,Great cable with a great color making it easy to discern from the other cables of mine which are black.\
1,I got this cable because when i got a apple tv 4K that has a Gigabit connection . i would hook it up . however  my router can tell me if its a gigabit connection with a white solid white on the router . amber means it is not. . This cable plugged in was saying amber light NOT GIGABIT .  i did other connections with different cable to be sure . and sure enough my router is white light connected to apple tv . gigabit.  i realized this after 2 years . but i did not have a gigabit apple tv then so now i do !
5,Functions as its supposed to.
5,Product just as described
5,Works like a charm. I have WiFi in my house so I did a speed test on my computer (on the WiFi vs on the ethernet cable). The ethernet cable works. My internet goes full speed when I connect my laptop to this cable.
5,Just what I need. Thanks.
5,Great Ethernet cable
5,It worked perfectly for me and allowed me to work through my WiFi issue.
4,It's a cable.... I don't know what else to say. Works great!
5,Mediabridge never disappoints!  This cable is flexible yet sturdy and makes a solid connection into my Ethernet ports.
5,Straightforward and sturdy.  Internet is blazing fast now.  Much better than wifi in the basement.
5,Our XBox wireless adapter has been acting strange so instead of buying another $60 adapter I bought this cable to connect the Xbox to the router.  Tried playing some matchmaking and had no trouble at all.  Works really well even thout it s a 50 feet cable.  For the price this is highly recommended.
5,From what I can tell (I'm not going to do a thorough test of this cable sorry if this upsets any of you) this is a good quality cable that does what it's supposed to do. It's nice and long. I didn't measure if it was 50 ft but it was long enough to reach from my router to my computer.
5,needed this for tv  works perfect well package great price thanks
5,I ordered the 50 ft ethernet cable to avoid having to continue to do wireless for netflix and amazon videos to my Tivo.  It works great. It is nice to not have any more issues with signal strength. This a great value an equivalent product is 3 times the price at the local big box store.
5,Does just what it says it does. Disappointing that it doesn't make me a better gamer but it works just as well for what I really bought it for.
5,This Cat5e patch cable works great!  It took me a while to run it up out of the way as I drilled holes thru the intervening floor joists but now that it's in place two computers can be run from one cable modem.Your cable seems well-made and worked great from the beginning.  Thanks!
5,Use for security system to router to enable remote access.  Works as it should
5,Face it if you are ordering 50 feet it's going to be somewhere where it doesn't move much. This is great quality cable. If you going to use it and it's being moved and drug about may not be. I installed internet to all my internet ready tv's in the house and this cable works perfect.
5,Finally got brother out of living room with his xbox and into his own room
5,We purchased this Mediabridge - Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (50 Feet) to hard-wire connect our new Yamaha RX-A3010BL 11.2-Channel Network AV Receiver to our Cisco-Linksys E4200 Maximum Performance Simultaneous Dual-Band Wireless-N Router.  The cable works perfectly!  I recommend it with no reservations due to the quality of the build and its performance.
5,Worked great high quality. Much much much cheaper than going to Best Buy and buying one. Plus this product is just as good if not better quality.
5,This cable is perfect for the price. It works very well and the length is more than enough. The strap that comes with is useful as well. Excellent price too!
5,We were looking to extend our internet connection connections in the basement and this cord was just what we needed and works well.  We did notice the package was very dusty when it arrive like it had been sitting on the shelf for a long time.  But it functions well. Fast shipping!!!
5,It was the perfect length I needed. The connectors are protected which is real plus.Highly recommend this product
5,Works great
5,Quality of the cable feels good and it works as expected.
5,Worked and came packaged nice.  Price was right.  All is well
5,Really long haven't measured it exactly but it is just what I needed to hook up my xbox one via ethernet to the Time Capsule which sits outside the living room by the kitchen.
5,The shipping was fast and the Cord is very long and it works great!
5,i should have gotten one of these along time ago...
5,This was exactly what I needed! I have a desktop computer that I needed to connect because it wouldn't connect through Wi-Fi. Great product for a great price! I'm a happy customer! :)
5,It's really 50 ft long. I'm very satisfied. Cable feels sturdy. I plugged it into my xbox directly into the router and now I experience little to no lag. Very good 5e cable.
5,Works great for adding internet access to other side of house.
5,I use these all the time and can get gigabit speeds out of these cables.
5,Ran "SpeedNet" tests on tablet and laptop and line is fine on the wireless router I used this for. Same speeds as being near the main access point in my house. Judging from quick check of pricing and reviews here on Amazon this pretty much followed the positive reviews already here that made me choose this vendor.
5,The product came on time perfectly packed and worked as expected.Reviews were bery good and I was just worried because price was too good to be truth.Excellend brand with an outstanding after sales service. I didn't need but seller offers support and professional documentation for their products.Highly recomend this seller!
5,Awesome and high quality as usual from Mediabridge
5,I liked the cable so much i bought a second one excellent quality
5,As I have come to expect from Mediabridge this cable was very study and a great value. Similar cables that I have seen cost twice as much. And Meidiabridge stands behind their product so I have faith in everything I buy from them. They have become my primary source for any cables now.
5,I ordered this to run from one side of my room to the other by going around the bottom perimeter and it was an excellent buy. Connected easily and never had any issues with it while connected to a Roku.
5,This cable is perfect for what I need it for.  It is nice and thick and well made.  I love the safety clips on the ends.  I can get my full speed (50mbps) that I pay for.  Nothing is lost along this cable.  I am very happy.
5,If you are like me and still require the use of ethernet cables every now and then this is definitely the product for you.  Great price quick delivery and the product is as advertised.  Now I didn't measure out the full 50 feet but it's pretty darn long and that was good enough.
5,This 50' ethernet cable was exactly what was needed. I checked at the others offered and this one seemed to have the most consistent positive reviews. It works great. I am not sure if it is possible but my internet seems to be working even faster then with the cable provided by my installer. Pleased.
5,great service and fast shipping is just what I expect and what I got. quality product five stars .
5,This cable is the perfect length and does what I needed it to do!
5,My ping got lower with this cable
5,I used to hook up my satellite receiver directly to my modem
5,Awesome product!
5,Just what I needed and I got what I asked for. Quality feel quality assembly worked great for my needs. Shipping was on time as usual. Thanks.
4,Good length. Very very fast speed
5,High quality cable. Use it with my USB 2.0 Over Ethernet Extender for Oculas Rift Sensors.
5,Solid cable excellent shielding.  Price was better than other prominent cable vendors.  Shipping was on time.
5,It's what I wanted what I needed and it works. Also it was offered at a good price.
5,I loved the length of the cord! Would recommend it!
5,Loved it
5,Good cable. Had it for sometime now and still no problems with it!
4,son purchased it. it does the job!
5,Perfect!  I didn't know they had cords this long.  Certainly opens up one's networking options!
5,Sturdy cable works as expected. This cable allows me to hardwire equipment that is not in the same room as my cable modem.
5,I used to be stuck sitting practically on top of my modem when connecting to the internet using my short 3-ft long ethernet cable. With this 50-foot length I am finally free to move around. Very useful!
5,works as intended  super long and sturdy. nothing came broken and came with a cord tie.
5,Seems like a fine cable.  I didn't measure it to see if it really is 50 FT however it's working as it should and is flexible so the coil it came in didn't take long to work out.  I'm pleased with this cable.
5,Awesome cable.  I had ordered a 100 foot one and needed to run a different line so I purchased the item again but it 50 foot.  Works flawlessly!
5,Wal-Mart wanted $37 to $43 for a similar product.  I refused to pay three times as much for a similar product ordered it on Amazon and had it the next day.  This kind of savings and service is why I own Amazon stock - returns on my investment have been spectacular.
5,I needed a cord for temporary use while we remodeled a couple of rooms and this let me put the computer out of the way in another location worked great and a great price too.
5,It's a really long ethernet cable - exactly what I needed. Shipment was prompt it does the internets well. I probably could have gotten a 25 foot honestly.
5,Need it to hook up my surveillance camera.Price was goodSuper fast shipping
5,No issues with connection get 5ping when playing cs go and other games dowload speed and upload run strong
5,Good cord for my security cameras.
5,I like every thing about this cable. Recommend it to others
5,This cable is well made performs just fine and is priced right.  I always wonder if you elect to go/choose a relatively inexpensive option for a commodity-type product if you'll be getting what you believe or if you'll end up buying a problem; in this case I got exactly what was advertised and at a very good price.
5,Quality and rugged. The molded connection between the clip and the wire means that the wires will not pull out of the clip head. I use it outdoors and there have not been any issues to report yet.
5,Reasonable price for the length of cord you receive. Much more secure than cords I've used in the past. Highly recommended.
5,Husband is happy he can play his Call of Duty World War II now online with no lag.
5,Works as described with no issues would buy again.
4,Works good except the rubber clip seems to break down easily
4,The product itself is fine but it was not delivered until two business days after was promised - normally not a problem but this required me to mail it onto a family member who was visiting.  Please deliver when stated it will be.
4,Ethernet cable has given good service. It was run up through the ceiling tiles & into another room for a computer connection. Would purchase again.
5,on time great price
5,Need to run some Ethernet cable in my shop and this fit perfectly works as expected
5,This is a long standard Ethernet cable that's very high value for the price. Cheaper without sacrificing quality!
5,does the job and I didn't have to go to the store and hunt this thing down.
5,What can I say about an Ethernet cable?  Works great and can't beat the price.
5,Needed the extended cable.  This was simply plug-&-play.  Works fine.
5,I needed a long run of cable to connect my TiVo to the internet and this was exactly what I needed! A very well constructed cable at a great price it was packaged in a nice and neat easy to use coil instead of a tightly clasped bundle that's difficult to straighten out. A highly recommended product!
5,Lots of cable at a great price.  Try to find a better deal I doubt you can.  My only issue is that the cable is too long and coils up.  Granted that is my fault. Beside that the cable is strong and well put together. Stores try to sell you half as much cable at double the price.
5,Got this Ethernet Cable to connect my computer to my router both are in separate rooms.  Works great.  No problems.  Mediabridge also seems very friendly.  Received an email from them giving thanks for the purchase and to let me know they're available if I need their help.
5,Okay 50-ft is a LOT of cabling.  They were nice enough to provide a velcro strap so that I can roll it up neatly.  A nice bargain!
5,What can I say?  It is a cable.  It does seem to be well made and does the intended job well.  A very good value for the price.  I used it to provide a wired interface to my Roku 3.  Signal is excellent at the interface.
5,Yup fiddy foot
5,Great cable..
5,Pretty hard to review this thing i guess.  Its an Ethernet cord 50ft long and it works as designed.  Enough said!Update many years after purchase:. Still works great.  Glad I have it for a PC that doesn't get good wifi on the other side of the house.
5,as expected
5,While wireless works well most of the time my garage internet was sporadic. Going to wired resolved all problems and it's faster. This 50 foot cable was easy to run because of its flexibility. Pulling though walls and running over and under rafters had no kinks or bends. Great cable for long runs.
4,I was looking for a 50 foot ethernet cable to run from one room to another. I saw this one at Amazon and for the price decided to give it a try. I am happy to report that the product works as advertised and I have no complaints about it.
5,Great Ethernet Cable. Needed the length to reach across the house
5,I used this to attach my internet modem in the loft to my living room Amazon FireTV box for internet streaming (Amazon Prime Netflix etc.) and I used almost the entire length. It is working perfectly.
3,Was about to use this cable for about two months until now it can no longer connect to the internet.  Tried on several electronics and it doesn't connect.  At first if I unplugged and plugged back in it would work but now- no matter how many times I replug it still does not work.  Could just be this one that was a defect I don't know usually cables like these would last longer.
5,This ethernet cable was long enough to reach the area I needed a cable too.
5,This is extremely long but gives high-quality connection exactly the same as the short ones!!
5,It's a strong basic cable. Wireless is great but signals get dropped so I prefer to remain connected for uninterrupted streaming entertainment. I ran this extension into the basement along a wall and back into the living space. It allows wired access to another part of the home and the price is right.
5,It's a networking cable with rj45 ends. Goes from one component to the other. Works like it should. The quality is good as is the little thingy that keeps that stupid plastic tab from breaking. Would buy again if I needed two 50 foot cables. Blue is my favorite color too!
5,Heavy duty wiring that does a great job and seems to be holding up well.
5,Long cord is great but has its drawback.  It can become like spaghetti (tangled) if not careful.  Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable (50 Feet) - RJ45 Computer Networking Cord - Blue
5,If you're looking for this type of ethernet cable it certainly works and does it's job really well. No problems for me. One of the best you can get. excellent!
5,Good price fast delivery works fine.
5,The Ethernet cable was delivered on time and was well packaged in it's own well marked box.  The cable was soft and easy to manage when installing along a fifty-foot run and the connecting ends are well formed and locked on with a solid click... Transfers data fast and complete. Well worth the money.
5,50 ft ethernet cable what else? Very good deal on lots of footage and the cable seems pretty durable; not made of cheap material. I like that the ends have the little protector so the clamp things don't break off. Worth the price.
5,Well Made.  Used this to connect my cable system to equipment in my bedroom.  Item well made and functioned fine.  Does not appear to diminish signal in the least.  Material I have read suggests that you  can go up to 100' without loss of signal.
5,Great cable. Ends are nice and secure
5,Works great sturdy and good price
5,What can I say?  It's an ethernet cord.  Functions well.
5,This ethernet cable works great! Shipped quickly and was packaged well. I couldn't have asked for anything better. I personaly used it to connect my PS2 to my router to get internet and it worked fantastically! No problems at all. Highly recommend this product!
5,I was having problems getting a good signal from my router to my Blu-Ray player WiFi. I purchased this cable to directly connect my router to the player. This cable is good quality and worked perfect
5,The cable worked flawlessly right out of the box. Cable and connector quality were good not top-of-the-line but much better than the cheapest brands. I liked that the product was nicely packaged in a cardboard box and not a plastic bag.
5,Getting near 200mbps. I'll post more if I have any noteworthy issues come up with it.
3,Does what it says and at a decent price.UPDATE: After about a month of use mine stopped working correctly. It was drastically hindering my internet connection so I disconnected it and turned on my Wi-Fi then I was able to do things online again.
5,It was exactly what I needed and I am very pleased.  Timing on shipping was great too.  Will definitely use again in future.
5,Works perfectly.
5,Good product. connectors are heavy duty as well as the cable. Works great.
5,Excellent quality cable at a nice price. Cost one third of what Staples wants and is CAT6 instead of just CAT5.
5,Great product  Great price Would buy again.
5,Good quality cable seems very well made I used this cable to move my router from upstairs to down stairs for better coverage using it on 2 iPads a laptop and 2 phones many at the same time with no loss of WiFi signal would reccomend this product to anyone.
5,When I ordered this cable I had checked out the prices up here in Canada and found that this item is half the price and the exactly the same. I would recommend this product to any one that needs to expand there home network or there office to run a new computer
5,It’s great not a knock off
5,It's a cable and I use it for my desktop while my other I have is for my xbox one .. Not really sure how you can review a Ethernet cable but umm good? Haha it hasn't broken yet.
5,Solid Cat5 cables. 50 feet is plenty to work with. I currently have it running across my home. Speed tests put it about at the cat5e spec so no complaints there.
5,excellent cable. It might be just an Ethernet cable but it is excellent in providing good signal. long enough to reach my Xbox one. The cable is strong and will not break easily like other Ethernet cables. overall good buy.
5,good price. good for long distance
4,very nice
5,Works fine seems sturdy. I expect to use this for years to come.
5,I formatted my computer and this cable was the perfect fit for me to reprogram it.
5,What can I say? Does what it's supposed to do. I hate that Amazon makes you write a review when a "star rating" would be perfectly adequate...
5,Ordered the 50' cable to run through the floor and under my house from a router to a TV. Worked perfectly.
5,Well no directions or anything but I plugged one end into my router and the other into my device... the two started communicating.  I believe they were using this wire as the communication medium.  Brilliant!
5,Great cable with molded ends and clip protection.  Cat 6 at a great price.
5,I chose this cord for its cheap price to use it for my xbox 360 live connection it works fantastic and is as good quality as any other cord you can find.(UPDATE 11-7-2015)I still own this cord i still use it. It works fine almost 3 years later.
5,This RJ45 cable is as good as the one I had purchased from a local computer Store. And the price was less then half.
5,I've bought this cable multiple times.  It's the cheapest cable that works for me with no issue.  I used them to connect my security cameras to my network.
1,I have a 75 Upload/75 Download plan from my ISP.  The Ethernet cord my ISP provided (about 5 ft. long) lets my laptop reach those speeds--sometimes a bit more sometimes a few points less.  Connecting this 50 ft. Mediabridge Ethernet Cable reduces my laptop speed to about 9 U/9 D.  That is unacceptable.  I tried restarting my laptop and moving it closer to the router.  These efforts made no difference.
4,Functional as all round wiring does.  Sturdy and works as it should.
5,Nothing novel here. It is a long cable that does what it says. Would buy again.
5,I am very satisfied with this Product
5,Just what I needed
5,Durable cable.  Needed a cable to run my router from basement to main floor of my house.
4,Good cable great price. Used to extend router past wireless cameras.
5,Used product to establish Ethernet vs wifi connection for quick response while teleworking.
5,It works perfectly. It's super long and it's great because i can just coil up the rest and the line that i AM using i just tape it to the floor/wall
5,Still currently using this. Got the Ps4 hardwired. Does what it's supposed to. No complaints at all.
5,Very well made cable met all my needs and would purchase more products from this company!
4,It works.
5,Had been patching together ethernet cables to my dissatisfaction so when I found the Mediabridge I checked it out ordered it and it's not failed me once.  Great price compared to the overpricing of retail stores which charge way too much even the big W-mart couldn't give me a fair price.
5,Needed to move my modem and everything worked better than expected.  Perfect for what I needed.
5,Good value great to do business with.
5,Worked for me....fast streaming now
5,This item is of high quality.  Over the years I have purchased a few ethernet cables to wire my toys.  This cable is the best I have purchased.  It seems very sturdy and heavier then ones I have used in the past.  I highly recommend this product.
5,Pros: Well made with good releases/ Speed tests wellCons: None. Good CableOverall: Works great on my PS4
5,Works as intended and is as long as the description says.
5,Very long and helped us reach where it needed to be. Works great!
5,This is a fine cable and does the job just as advertised.  I strung 40 of the 50 feet and coiled the rest winding and fastening a lot of the cable through some tight twists and turns and sometimes concealing it under carpeting along the way.  It's durable and performs great.
5,I have no complaints with this product. It does the job perfectly. There is perhaps a slightly slower speed when connected through this although that could be expect with such a long cable.
5,Great!
5,Connects the hard drive of our security camera through the rafters to the router. Our local hardware store had maximum 25 feet. Works fine.
5,good
5,The price is great for this long Ethernet cable. My brother uses it and he is able to play his PS4 online with no problem at all.
5,Work great to connect my security camera system to my internet modem in another room
5,Exactly as described I used it to run to another room to connect to my switch for drivers for my wireless connection. I had installed windows 8 and I connected and let it auto update. Works great and it's hard to beat a hardwired connection especially when upgrading an operating system.
5,I purchased two other brands prior to Mediabridge (one from Amazon and one from a local retailer)--both of which failed miserably when I ran my cable / networking tester.  The 14 cables I bought from Mediabridge all passed just fine so I'm very happy to give them a five star rating.
5,Worked great and a nice low price.  I would definitely buy more Mediabridge  products if the need arises in the future.
5,Used patch cable to run new internet line through my office. The cable works fine. The connectors at the end of the cable are a little flimsy. I do not forsee the cables being disconnected after hooking them to the computer so breakage of the end connectors are not a big concern.
4,Work related.
5,I have used throughout my spring semester and has held out great even though I ran over it multiple times with my chair.
5,Not much to say about this cable... It came on time it's sturdy and well insulated and it does what it's supposed to. I have it running through the downstairs wall up the exterior of the house and back in through the upstairs wall and it works perfectly. Would buy again.
5,So far the cable works like it should. Is long enough to be place around a room w/cable to spare. No issues regarding connectivity from the DVR player to the router.
5,first day clips on well (that was my issue with my last ethernet cable the clip wasnt working and would come off every 30 min  i will report back in time about the status of the clip on this ethernet cable
5,Best deal ang good product
5,It just works. Have had this for over a month with no troubles at all with Ethernet
5,Great quality cable.. Only problem I have is the finger release tab being on the underside when plugged into my LP. I have arthritis and some what awkward..
5,My husband used this cord to connect his gaming console straight to our modem/router.  It has mad his online gaming experience so much more smooth and enjoyable.
5,Exactly what I was looking for
5,Your product was perfect for my needs. The cable and connectors were made to a high standards. I am glade with the choice I made by purchasing your product. Your Price was fair and Delivery was fast as I received it two days after purchase. Looking forward to future purchases.
5,If you need a long Ethernet cable this is for you
5,Satisfied with product and performance
5,Awesome pricing and awesome quality it's exactly what I needed and it came in the mail quickly.
5,T.v to computer
5,Was advertised length did (and doing) what it was supposed to do. The plugs are sturdy. Bought two in quick succession and both work just fine. The best part is that it is so cheap. Less than 1/4 the price of picking it up at a local store.
5,The cable is exactly what we needed; the blue color cable brought a cheery addition to my darker computer color too.  Thanks Mediabridge.
5,All is good.
5,I ordered and received this within 48 hours. Came in mint condition. Works perfectly.The absolute only downside would be that the rubber guard on the plastic clip isn't perfect. But it's still good enough for 5 stars.
5,Cable came neatly packaged appears to be have quality material  looks great did an excellent job for me I used it to connect my Yamaha receiver to the router no problems  works great. The price was unbeatable great quality for the price
5,Was expecting 5 cats disappointed when it's just an extremely long blue cable.But hey it connects me to the internet reliably where I can look at all the cat pictures I desire.
5,Received on time and packaged in a separate box versus a bag.  Thought that was a nice touch as it shows a desire by Mediabridge to ensure quality instead of cheaping out.  Ran both a 25' and 50' cables and both are working great.  Highly recommend Mediabridge.
5,Cheap and high quality. I've gotten several sizes of these now and never been let down. They bend really nice and don't get kinks. Will probably continue to buy this brand whenever I need another Ethernet cable.
5,Package came well packed in a box plugged it to a gigabit router and to gigabit hub and works great no issues.
5,Great cable simple to use (as it should be) and it even comes with a little Velcro strap to wrap it up with. Overall great product!
4,Not much you can say about a piece of wire. Works as advertised .
5,Got the job done my client is happy and so am I.I also appreciate that the cable was coiled in a cardboard (easily recyclable) box rather than folded into a plastic bubble pack making it so much easier to run.
5,This is precisely what it sounds like.  There are no attempts at frills or clever packaging.  I've had no issues with packet drops or broken RJ45 jacks on either end.  All in all it was a good purchase and I've had no regrets whatsoever.
5,Great product at a good price. Needed something to hook up my security cameras to my router so I could remote view when I was away. Worked perfect!
5,Does the job.  Purchased this cord for a room where the Ethernet outlet was on the opposite side of the room from where the computer would be.
5,Excellent quality and price was right for this 50 foot cable. Would order again in a heartbeat!
5,Just what I needed a long reliable Ethernet cord to link up my PS4 from my bedroom to the router in the living room.
4,Good cable for the price. 50ft was a lot longer than expected. Feels a bit fragile but so far holding up well and does the trick.
5,Works great
2,Was very excited to use this to play xbox lag free. It worked for a few days and now when i plug it in i get booted from games and parties due to no internet connection. Extremely frustrating. Was packaged fine and easy to install would buy again if i knew it would stay working instead of stop working after a few days.
3,The ends are great easy to work with and quality connection. However mine quit working after 8 months. The cord looks to be in great shape so I'm not sure what's causing the issue.
5,I never thought I would need FIFTY feet of Ethernet cable... who would? but I did and the folks at Mediabridge really came through for me. My 50 feet were packed and shipped within hours of my order and proved to be exactly what I needed. Great service and a great product.
4,Product as advertised
5,Great product w great price and fast shipping
5,Only used once.  Worked fine.  Haven't needed it since.  Good product
4,Like product
5,These are the best...check out the release on the cable end. It makes it so easy to plug and unplug especially where the connector sinks way into the receiving female plug. I would give these cables 10 stars for the disconnect design alone.
5,Bought this to extend my wired network into my upstairs man cave. Why trust WiFi when you can hardline it all?
5,I bought this cable to run from my computer room to my bedroom.  I use this to watch Amazon Prime Account since I have this account.  The cable works for me without any problem.  I was able to let my daughter watch kid programs from PBS.  Awesome.
5,Good product everything about the product seemed to be quality.
5,I used this to extend my POE security cam system. Worked great along with the couplers
5,It has been working well for over a year. My previous cable broke and I bought this one to replace it it was the cheapest available but it works better than my other cable ever did.
5,This patch cable is well constructed of heavy duty cable. We ran the cable from our study to our living room in order to connect our Smart TV to our computer so we could watch movies streamed by Amazon Prime. We are very happy with our choice of cable.
5,Perfectly good Cat5 cable.  Feels sturdy.  Installed easily. No problems with durability or functionality.  Good value for price.  I haven't put the connectors through much of a workout but they show no signs of breaking from normal use.Product shipped promptly and was professionally packaged.

5,Definitely well worth it if you have a lot of network infrastructure.  Will definitely buy again.

5,We were very happy with the service on this order.  The product was delivered in 2 days as promised and works beautifully.  The cable is well constructed and there's no obvious loss of quality even though it's 50' long.  The sound is crystal clear and the picture is perfect.
5,Well I would like likrave about this product. But it does what its supposed to do and I've had no issues. The price was very inexpensive and I use that word because there is nothing cheap  this cable.
5,Awesome blue colour augmented the beautiful landscape that is my room. This spectacular length of wire weaves across my house like an elegant blue snake connecting my laptop to the fountain-of-life router supplying the sweet ambrosia of internet.
5,I purchased two of these to connect my Blu-ray player and my xbox to my network. They work great. I have had them set up for a few months now and have not had any issues since they have been connected. I recommend these to anyone looking to get a 50foot Cat 5 cable.
5,Needed to run internet to the basement for my son's gaming computer  so far no complaints from him
5,It flawlessly carries all of that high-tech Internet mumbo jumbo from the wall hole to my computamathing! And true to form it is a LONG cable. You could wrap it around the circumference of a small room twice and still have a touch to spare.
5,Tested speed online after use. Up to par with specifications listed.
5,This is exactly what it says it is it works seems like a good quality cord.  Would buy from again.
5,Awesome
5,Although it has only been a month I've had no issues with the cable.  The connection works great.  The quality of the cable is excellent even after bending it several times around my room to get it to my component.  I recommend the product to anyone looking.
5,Great quality.  Firm fitting connectors.  Nice extra touch was the Velcro-type strap for keeping the excess length controlled.
5,It's an Ethernet cable not much else to say.
5,Good speed good cable and correct length as shown in product description. Worth buying it...definitely 5 starts
5,Although cumbersome to work with that is more due to the length of the cable. Does its job very well and has great flexibility in its usage.
5,Used the product today.  I needed to have my Dish 722 attached to the internet because I had purchased a sling.  Everything worked perfectly.  The quality of the cable is excellent the connection with my router shows no loss of speed.  Very happy.
5,The product arrived quickly everything was intact and coiled very neatly. The packaging was secure and the cable is exactly what I needed.
5,Works perfectly
5,works well
5,Great product even though I didn't end up using it
5,It's long cheap durable and does the job. Not much more to be said. If you need a 50' ethernet cable buy this.
5,It works good quality
5,Good Product will come come to know how it survives in upcoming future Stay Tuned for more on this.
5,Perfect size and length. The blue makes it stand out in the room so it is easier to find or hide if need be.
4,Works great good price
5,This Ethernet cable arrived promptly and in perfect shape. Media bridge sent a email; making sure that if you had any questions or any support they were there. The product worked great and it was simple to install. Will definitely buy more media bridge products
5,Excellent! Bought to make my internet connection to my computer faster. The speeds are very fast.
5,Hasn't broken yet. Connects me to the ethernet. 10/10.
5,works great my connection never drops. was a lot longer than expected
5,It does the job.It's really long I got the 50ft.It's sturdy specially at the connection where it counts.I don't see this thing falling apart for years.What more do you want?
5,The cable works really well I needed a 36 ft. length but this 50 foot gave me spare cable so it wasn't binding.  The blue color separates it from the other cables which helps too. I also have other Mediabridge cables and have had good luck with them too. thanks
5,Accidentally ordered way too long of a cable ended up gaming outside
5,Fácil y buena
5,Just what I needed to run a cable from my router to the TV.
5,I really like the connection speed of this cable before I bought this cable I was using a wireless connection and i have got to say it is a huge step up. I recommend this cable to anybody that needs a cost effective internet connection
5,Perfect speed and length for what I needed. Could not have asked for better. Thank you!
5,They are wrong it’s 52 ft longSo you get an extra 2 ftSo extra 2 stars
4,Work's great so far & it shipped out fast. Happy with purchase.
5,Works very well I even smashed it with my door a few thousand times by accident and it's still running.
5,Still working great after two years.
5,It is blue.  It gets from here to there.  There was a tab that got in the way of disconnecting it the first few times but I figured out how to pull it back when I disconnect so that's no problem now.
5,There's not much to say about functional Ethernet cables; I got this and it worked out of the box with no issues.  I needed a long cable and 50 feet certainly suited my needs.
5,Works good but not cat proof so don't let your cat get a hold of it. Dumb of me to just run it across the ground instead of higher up on the wall.
5,Good quality .  Just what a wired network need sfor consistent streaming to smarttvs  No freezing and buffering since adding this cable to my combination wired/wireless home network.
5,Great price on cable. Beats price of local stores hands down! Cable well made compared to the ones in the stores around here for a lot more money. Great service and fast shipping  Will buy from you again when needed. Thanks so much Mike
5,Great cable works perfectly.  Excellent quality and price.
5,Best ethernet cable I have ever bought! So inexpensive too! We loved ours at college where the wifi sucked.
5,I have a wifi enabled TV which I think has problems streaming . . . so I ordered this 50 ft cable to hook up direct from TV to Verizon FOIS Internet modem.  It worked well - and this cable is good quality.
5,Perfect for wanting to improve connection speed
5,This is the perfect product my son needs to go to college. He research the Internet and said this is exactly what he needs to plug into his laptop and the provided ethernet
5,No cheapie here very robust material and workmanship! Very pleased with my purchase. So I purchased another one just like the first one.
5,The cable came in avery short period of time in fact it beat the suggested time was what I ordered and was very satisfied with the price will shop there again for any other cables I will need in the future.  Thanks  Richard from Iowa
5,Great Ethernet cable. Also liked the fact that the cable wasn't tough and tangly. If that makes any sense. It also gives me a strong wired connection to my ps4.
5,Great quality.  Works like a charm for my surveillance system to my router.
5,Excellent quality Cat5e cable. Clip holds cable plug tightly in receptacle. I used this Cat5e cable to connect two routers at opposite end of the house. Quick on time delivery. Works perfectly; no issues. I recommend this cable.
5,Yes sir it's an ether net cable. Well built and functional. I've had all good experiences with Media bridge. Their cables just work and are affordable. Not sure what more I can ask or say.
5,The cable came on time was as described worked very well. However I should have gotten a slightly longer one but that was bad on my part - not the sellers. It works very well though and I've never had an issue with it. Thank you!
5,This one was sooo much longer than I thought it'd be. It's almost too long in a way. Definitely gets the job done.
5,Does what it should
5,Arrived on time stable connections no problems here.
5,I did not realize how long this came was. The point is that it works.
5,It JUST works
5,Exactly what you would expect. It's a 50m ethernet cable. It was coiled nicely and came in a nice box. It's even one of the nicer kind where there is a nib that helps you depress the plastic locking mechanism.
5,Exactly what my son needed. Our previous cable didn't reach as far as he wanted but this one works great!
4,Changes white when bended but it's perfect for my PS4 other than it's physical looks.
5,Worked very well. Transfered from one ps4 to other ps4 all data very quickly...cable made well and length was very good
5,I just got the cable. Just hooked it up. Thank you for your email.
5,Arrived quickly no more Netflix dropping on my smart TV.  Makes a huge difference! Will probably get a smaller one for my laptop.
5,As described. Packaged neatly and arrived quickly. Connectors in good working order no broken tabs.
5,Great deal super fast shipping
5,I live in a small apartment and with my only PC in the bedroom this was the only way I could get from the modem to my computer. No loss of audio or video off the internet. An excellent heavy duty Patch Cable.
5,The cable I ordered was exactly as described at a fair price and was delivered very promptly. I would not hesitate ordering from Mediabridge again or recommending them to a friend.
4,Works Fine
5,Works great for when I plug it into my ps4. The connection is very noticeably better.
5,Works great!!
5,Had to crawl around under the house to get this installed once in it worked perfectly.  I prefer ethernet to wireless so I have a lot of wires running in the crawlspace--wife won't let me run them on the floor ; - )
4,Great price and the cables work perfectly when I need to connect to my wired connection with a guest PC at the home and I want the best speed.  The cables snap nicely on both ends.  Seems to be well made
5,Ethernet is what it is.  It works fine and fits my needs.  It seems to be of good quality.  The clips at the ends seem to be pretty strong and that is important to me because I move things around quite a bit.
5,To connect my sons ps4 in the basement
5,Served its purpose.
5,Very fast service and exactly what I ordered. No muss no fuss
5,Not much to say...for me it either works or doesn't.
5,I like is it fits my ps4 great
5,It's long! It's blue! It's ethernetty! Amaze your friends and family! Buy this cable you will not be disappointed! Oh yeah and it works like it's supposed to.
5,50 feet of greatness. Works perfectly. I've used it for over two months now and had no problems. loved the price and the prodcut!
5,It’s just a super long Ethernet cable lmao 10/10
4,well made
5,This was like the product description and I got it in a timely manner.  I am pleased with it and it was cheaper than I could get locally.
5,I use this to plug my laptop straight into the router so that I can get the fastest connection possible and not have to worry about an unreliable wifi signal.  Using this cable I get my promised 50mb/s download speed. Couldn't ask for more.
5,Mediabridge cable arrived as promised and worked perfectly.  Great product at a reasonable price and is of high quality.
4,I have my computer about 30 ft away from my router and this cable works as advertised.  No lag.
5,What can I say? Price was right it got here on time and it works. If I need more I'll purchase from these guys.
5,it was time to upgrade. Works great came on time. seems to be a little faster then the cat 5
5,Very simple packaging. Cable was easy to attach right out of the box.
5,I'm new using Mediabridge products. This item comes with a catalog of products offered by the Company . The material used on this ethernet cable looks good and for finish the shipping package is easy to open.
5,Great sealed construction for networking
5,Got this for my son at college. The amazing connection speed he is in getting on his PS4 now should translate to excellent grades.
5,Connection is hi-speed and stable with this cable I would definitely recommend.
5,Good cord used to connect an Xbox 360 in my dorm room. Sturdy construction and have not had any problems.
5,So far used 1 of the 2 I purchased with no problems.  Great price.
4,No problems works well.
5,I have bought countless products from Mediabrige and every one of them I've had good luck with. Their HDMI cords are of highest quality and if not better than most of the Monster products. And like the title says they are excellently priced. Keep 'em coming Mediabridge.
5,Oh man it came in handy!
5,My TV's wifi sucks so I used this to span around the room from the router to the TV. Works great can't beat the price.
5,Wonderful product.  Great price!  Works better than I could imagine.
5,Just as described
5,Works as expected
5,i was expecting some signal quality loss but this was great.  ran it through the rafters in the basement.  flexible yet sturdy.  what an excellent buy.  would get the same thing again if i needed another long one
4,Not much to say but it arrived quickly and work great.
4,Other than the delivery being thrown in my busheswithout a knock or bell rang everything else was perfect
5,It comes with a hat
5,Cable arrived 2 days ahead of "schedule." Great shape-it was "plug and play." Good quality connectors too. I used this cable to make a run from main floor office to my basement studio computer (which has no Airport card) and this was the very inexpensive alternative. Thanks!
5,I order this enthernet cable the 50 ft and it works perfectly.
5,Professional grade Ethernet line - arrived in less than 48 hours
5,This was pretty much the cheapest Ethernet cable I found on Amazon. It's great quality works great and you really just can't beat that price!
5,Nicely made
5,Exactly as described solid sturdy great price... does the job.  I used it to connect my DSL modem upstairs in a spare room directly to my TV in the basement.  The WiFi connection was hit and miss.

5,Works great and as expected. Going from wifi to ethernet my download speed went from 18mbps to 38mbps.
5,Long cord
5,It is exactly what it says it is so it's hard to give this a bad review! Don't bother with expensive ethernet cables because this one works as well as any other. Never buy these in store! They rip you off big time!
5,Received this product quickly exactly as it was presented.  It works perfectly does not tangle and far cheaper then Best Buy or Walmart.
5,This cord is long and utilizable it comes with enough cord to stretch around my dorm room and go into another I am really glad I have this cord it'll last me a long time because I like taking care of my things
5,Cabled no tv or need for them didn't get the items to use them. Thanks least I got your cables.
5,I use this for erotic pleasure. I.e shop on Amazon haha. Direct line is much more stable than Wifi.
5,Shipped very fast and was very reasonably priced. Figure having to go to Walmart or best buy or whatever. Paying twice as much for the same product and having to use your own gas to get there. Thanks for a great product. Will buy again if needed
5,Got these to connect my computers to the satellite system for I was having trouble with my signal. It has solved that problem. The cable is made of good materials and seems to be put together to last.
5,This product is very handy if you live in an apartment with a pre-set modem location not convenient to your needs. The cable is exactly as described and works perfectly. It has a low price and arrived promptly. .
5,The product is all what it is suppose to be. Cheaper then the stores in town they charge double price for the product. The only problem I had was it wasn't long enough to go from the router under the house to the smart T.V.ALWAYS MESSURE!!!
5,Just as advertised
5,Great signal for a long cable.
5,it was everything i expected and more
5,I love this cable. My room gets poor wifi signal but ever since I connected my laptop to this my signal has been amazing. It even cured my cancer!
5,High quality cable. As long as you don't go out of your way to ruin it it'll do the job and continue working for a long time.
5,Don't think that the low cost equates to low quality.This is a great LAN cable which works beautifully.Even though I have a great wireless card in my laptop nothing beats the dependability of a great LAN cable like this one.
5,Great Price and Great Value!!!!!
5,This cord was perfect for what I needed. My PS4 WiFi speed was awful and now that I'm using a hardline connection my speed has more than doubled and I can feel the difference! Well worth the money.
5,Just what I needed. Its been a week or two and no issues.
5,Product was exactly what we wanted. Delivery was Fast. Product was well packaged. no damage.Price was very reasonable.  I would recommend the company and products to my friends. K C
5,It's an ethernet cable. It's 50 feet long. It's blue. And it works.
5,Works great to connect 4K streaming blue ray player directly to internet router.
4,Needed a cable to run from my router to the xbox in the other room when I needed that hard-wired connection for COD... No issues with the cable. Connectors are good and rolls up nicely after use.
5,This cable was perfect and arrived quickly I am very happy
5,I needed a quality cable so I ordered this one and it has held up. Seems to perform at a high quality and with no data loss. Has a nice "rubbery" feel to it and color looks just  like the pictures.
4,I have it strung up through the house to reach what I need. It connects immediately and works fine. I am however unsure if it is the cable or my network that causes lag issues.
5,Ordered this and it was here super fast. needed to get my sons computer off wireless and on wire. we have 25 meg cable and it doesnt drop a bit at the other end of this cable. excellent buy excellent price excellent shipping and excellent product!!!
5,Very nice cable work as expected. Great price!
5,Works perfect
5,Great product will buy again
5,Used this cable to run from our front room to our dvd player in the living room. We ran it through the walls and into the attic so it looks cleaner. Works great No complaints!CHEAP!!!Way better than a 50$ cable.. Will buy again if needed!
5,My son wanted to run Xbox live in his bedroom. This was an excellent price. The 50ft length allowed him to run it up to his bedroom and connect his xbox to the modem. He;s been running for about 6 months with no problems.
5,Great price fast shipping and works great so what more can we say but good seller. Thanks Amazon and Mediabridge.
5,Worked great for getting a wired connection for my PC and my brothers. Had to run it through the attic but it was plenty and very fast local transfer speeds! Great Product.
4,Worked perfectly but on one application I had to cut off protective tab.  Good comparing similar cable sold in big box stores
5,Product is great. It was purchased to gain speeds on our home router after switching to gigabit internet speed through our provider. Speed tests showed 950+ Mbps using this cable.
5,Quality wire and excellent connectors.
5,Your basic Ethernet cable that does exactly what it is supposed to do. It held up well to me tugging on it through some wall insulation to get it where I needed it too.
5,Ordered 2 of these one for my husband and myself.  They are actually better than those I have purchased at office supply stores.  The only thing I would change would be having the 50 foot available in more then one color.
5,As described recommended
5,Very durable and strong Ethernet cables. I have had a few in the past that would break off within a month or so but these have been great!
4,Does what I wanted it to do.
2,I have this attached to a lap top. A couple times a day I take it off the shelf and put it on my lap then return it to the shelf when done. That's all it gets moved. To be fair the cord has a sharp bend when sitting on my lap.I've only used it a couple months and it is worn out. I can get it to work by jiggling the wires but if I move I lose my connection. Poor quality to say the least.
5,fast delivery. Perfect condition and does a wonderful job. Cannot beat the price.
5,I bought a network extender n it came with a small cable so i looked for a longer one and this fit the bill perfectly .
5,Nothing wrong with the product
5,I'm very impressed with the package. It was the first time in my life a network cable went inside a box very well packaged. Great job!
3,I bought this product but it does not work with my comcast modem with the cat5 patch cable.
5,My wireless router is on the other side of the house and my PS3 doesn't get a good signal. So every Friday night for BF3 with my buddies I pull out the long cable and plug it into the PS3 and Game On!
5,Works great was cheap well packaged and arrived quickly. I used this to connect my TV to my router to stream movies. The wireless spectrum is very cluttered in the apartment complex I live in and the cable works much better than trying to use wifi here.
5,Great customer Service order was shipped and received quickly.  all Cat5e cables worked great and no problems.  will buy again from Mediabridge Products.
5,Mediabridge provides great products for the dollar.  This review is for the RJ45 CAT5e cable and this is my second purchase.  The cable works as I expect.  Their routers are a great buy as well.  Highly recommend their products for their quality and value.
5,Wifi wasn't cutting it for my son and his Minecraft postings. I ran this cable from the router to his room and he hasn't complained since.
5,does the job
5,Product arrived as described and on time. I wish (not a complaint) that the cable also came in a 75 ft length; 100 ft is too much.
5,I can connect my PC to the internet from an Ethernet port that is ALL THE WAY OVER THERE! Works perfectly. Durable easy to coil and store.
5,I would recommend this cable because of it's good quality. Also the price was so much better lower than other office supply stores that I checked. I received it within 2 days from my order & the packaging was perfect.
5,This works as expected.  The price is great and gives me the ability to set up my home network without having to pay an electrician to hardwire the house.
5,Excellent product that is well built.  This a quality product at  a very competitive price.  Amazon is great as usual with shipping it's product to Prime customer.
4,I'm very pleased with my purchase and the timely fashion that it was deliversed was a plus as well thank you
5,did exactly what i wanted for the price
5,My wireless card stopped working when I was ready to play it for the holidays so I ordered this to play online even without a wireless connection. It working great and connect to online faster that with wifi on my ps3.
4,Nice Cable
5,I bought these to host a lan party. Easily reached from upstairs to downstairs at my home. Worked perfectly.
5,Wonderful product. Came nicely packaged clean  and minimal shipping materials while still being protected  and a great product overall.
5,Awesome store I will be buying a ton more from these guys. Merry Christmas!  Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable (50 Feet) - RJ45 Computer Networking Cord - Blue

5,As advertised
5,Great quality!  Use this to connect my POE Security system to my router!!  Nice snag-less molding made the running of the cable easy!!
5,Excellent product
5,Works like it should.
5,I'm currently using this outside in california sun. has been holding up good so far 5 months in summer
5,This is a standard Ethernet cable and performs it's job well.  Just plug into an Ethernet port and let it do its job!
5,Replacing the coord I had before thay lasted a good 8 years.can't complain
5,Works just as it should. Pushes every bit of our 150 mbs cable connection to our equipment (computer smart tv Roku PS3 etc.). Good quality cable.
5,used this to connect from a swithcx to a distant pc along a long hall. worked great. minimal signal loss if any - ran Verizon speed test and it was full power. tight connections strong supple. highly recommended
5,I received these the day after I place the order. The cables are of good quality and original factory packaging. I installed them the same day as I was adding a secondary router in my house. Everything is up and running without problems.
5,Wired connection was needed and quick shipment of product
5,Worked great got to my home in 2 days  very pleased
5,Plug it in and boom: Internet!
5,Haven't used it yet.  But I looked at it and I can just visualize all those bits and bytes just flying through it.
5,Very high speeds are attained with no interference.
5,No complaints about this cable.  Only remarkable thing about this cable is how lightweight it is: I don't know if they've used very thin gauge conductors or maybe it's non-cuprous.  In any case the cable & connectors seem very solid and do the job.
5,Great ethernet cable for a great price. Im a soldier stationed overseas and this reduced my latency lag to my ps4 tenfold.
5,Tagged up my desktop with direct connection ..... 9X faster than wi-fi
5,Cord is as long as advertised works just fine and even has velcro to wrap up any extra cord length. Good product!
5,I am very pleased with this ethernet cable. It is made with high quality materials and works great. Although it is a little more expensive than some others I think it was worth the extra money.  Cindy G.
5,I needed a long ethernet cable. I got a long ethernet cable. It does things I'd expect an ethernet cable to do. Great success.
5,Great quality. Great delivery time.
4,Good Product
5,I was little worried when I bought the 50 foot media cable that the data may get distorted over that length...but it works perfectly. Thanks.
5,Just what we needed to plug my lap top into the modem... We have wireless but when you are playing games that use alot of bandwidth- a direct plug in is faster
5,No issues. It does exactly what is was suppsoed to.Helped me fix an issue wiht my wireless router that's been dogging me for months.Connectors seem fine. No issues wiht getting them in or out as some otherreviews suggest.
5,My wireless internet was on hiadus so I ordered this cable to get me through until I could exchage the modem.  Now I'm getting internet conncections quicker with this cable than I was with my wireless!
5,Great cables.
5,works great doesn't tangle seems faster than the 100ft. thinner cord I already had.  GREAT PRICE TOO!!!!!
5,Works as intended. Cord isn't too tangled either and fits pretty much anywhere you pin it to. I'd recommend this cable to anyone who needs something this long. Set it up to my 360 and have speedy connections (I'm host a lot now).
5,This is a great company and a great product. I have purchased from them many times and they don't disappoint.
5,I received the cable its construction is excellent the shipping was very fast. For a fraction of the price of retail (walmart) you cant get a better deal.If you dont have to have it today and can wait 2-3 days this is the way to go...
5,I bought this about two years ago. It still works great. As good as the day I bought it. Perfect!
5,Great product and delivered on time. Great job. Thank you for great customer service.
5,This 50 ft. network cable exceeded my expectations.  It works great and has a great price.  I've used it to hook up my DSL router to my DISH DVR.  This enables me to view and download Blockbuster movies to my DISH DVR.
5,Great cable. I use to run from my modem in my basement to up stairs bedroom to my router. About 30'. Works great. Very good ship and delivery time.
5,It is run the best products had

5,Good quality and easy to use I love it!
5,High quality cable. Feels thick and rugged and works perfectly!

5,yes it work i can finnaly get wifi in my room
5,I have not had any issues in the slightest. I use it for my desktop has been working great and was well worth the cheap price a good buy.

5,Definitely got our money's worth! It came even faster than we were advised it would and it works beautifully! Would definitely purchase from this company.again!!
5,Needed a spare long run of cable and this is perfect. Not much to say but if you need a long cat5 cable this should do the job and the price is right too.
5,Amazing cable I was very happy it came with a Velcro strap to tie back excess feet you don't end up needing
5,The cable solved the issue of spotty wireless signal in my neighborhood.  Although the length of the cable was more than I needed I used it on one of the computers in the house and have noticed faster speed.
5,It connects my computer to the internet and appears to be 50 feet long. Mission accomplished!
5,This is a great product.  Well built and full of quality it delivers my bits and bytes quickly without any backtalk or mishmashed traffic.  I highly recommend this product.
5,I am fast becoming a huge fan of Mediabridge and their products.  I have purchased a number of Mediabridge cables in the past including ethernet and HDMI cables and they have all been truly quality products for an incredibly fair price.
5,Not only did the product ship and arrive on time but it was efficiently pacakged and of excellent quality. I needed this cable to run a hardwire connection to my wife's desktop computer.  Has been connected continuously for several weeks with no issues.
5,Worth the price
5,As a former Mediabridge customer (HDMI Cables) I had high expectations and no reservations.  When the product arrived my suspicions were confirmed; another great product at an excellent price.  Mediabridge - Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (50 Feet)
5,I needed a long ethernet cable to connect my computer to the router in another room.  This cable fit the bill perfectly and is very inexpensive.  Much better for connectivity reliability to use the cable than to be on wifi all day.
5,Needed a 50 foot ethernet cable to hook-up a computer in another room from the cable modem as I hate using wi-fi.  This works exceptionally well.
5,Awesome product
5,The connectors fit snugly and data transmits and damn near maximum speed. Great buy
5,Exactly what I was looking for received as described in the images.
5,You can never get too many ethernet cables.
5,Just as described. Huuuuge improvement over wireless connections.
5,Works as well as expected
5,excellent cable  its performance was all you could ask for. Data and information entered was delivered to its needed devicw without any distoration  or modification of the information. I consider the cable to be outstanding.
5,Connects my computer in the attic (rarely used) to my router whenever I need to use the old PC for updating webpages. Perfect length for what I need. Coils easily and is pleasing to the eye.
5,Shipped well packaged and in timely manner.  Ran it from the living room where the router is to the the X-box in the family room.  Connections are firm.  Does what I expected it to do.
4,Seems like nicely constructed cable. Haven't had a chance to install it yet.
5,This is a quality ethernet cable at a great price; I needed a long cable to go from my router to my video streaming box and this cable made it possible at a good price.
5,This Ethernet Cable is exactly the length as described. It is just long enough that I needed to connect my laptop to a remote router in the far end of the house and the quality of this cable seems decent.
5,I actually love it.  I can take my HP Sleek Book all around my apartment as long as I have this ethernet/patch cord attached to my motem and my computer.  I am very pleased with this product.
5,It works
5,Solid build. Good value. Used it to tie two routers together that were on different floors of the house.
5,Nice quality cable and is supporting a 100MB connection with no problems.
4,would buy again
5,The cable was exactly what I needed. Works great!
4,It's a patch cable. A long one. It works? Seems to be good quality I like that it's not stiff so makes it much easier to run through my house since my modem and computer are in 2 completely different areas.
5,Fast shipping great prices and items came just as described. Way better than buying it at best buy (lol. How are they still in business?).  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a fast secure connection.
5,Connecting the modem to  the computer.
5,Cheap and does the trick! Use this long cable to connect the router to our new blu-ray player to watch Netflix.  Has been playing Netflix videos for many months perfectly! It was much more affordable than buying a wifi blu-ray player with an adapter built in.
5,Mediabridge Networking Cat5e Patch CableI have bought several products from Mediabridge all have been of high quality excellent price and delivered in excellent condition and in a timely fashion.  I will be purchasing from them in the futrue.
5,I bought this cause it was cheap but keep in mind is blue so when you hang it up on your ceiling to keep it out of the way it's very noticeable
5,Perfect - full length - fast shipping - works great
5,not much to say really. it does exactly what its supposed to do and they are good quality. durable too because I had to run this cable through my attic and it got scrapped up and put to the test.
5,Bought this for my dorm room to reach the opposite side of my room for my laptop and it works perfect and the connection is strong. Material is sturdy and I would buy it again if I needed it!
4,It works
5,Came fast and no complaints
5,I bought this cable to move my wi-fi router closer to the place where I use my iPad and smart phone most.  The cable is good quality and I haven't had any problems with dropped connections since moving the router.
5,Great cables for the price. High quality. I installed them immediately and they work fine.
5,Great product. Thank you.
5,I use this to download movies from from internet to my bluray player. I'm pleased with this cable as well as with all of the Mediabridge products that I've purchased. Flexible easy to string and does exactly what I need it to do.
5,Item is exactly as described. Sturdy cord
4,Great cheap Cat5e cable. The thin cable and small connector made it easy to run through the walls between rooms. Great value for 50ft of cable. Not for heavy duty work.
5,Does the job and love the color
5,I bought 2 of this item and received it in 3 day time.  For the price and speed of shipment you cannot go wrong with this product.  I will gladly buy more of the same item or something else form the same company.
5,Had it a long time now and it's still fine.  It's good and the length might seem like a lot but if you're using the cord in multiple rooms of a house it's useful. Overall a worthwhile purchase.
5,1gbps no problem
5,Does the job it is intended for!
5,Great replacement and value.No disappoints at all
5,This is the cord that I have been looking for because it is very long; all I have seen in stores are the short ones. The price was great and the product was shipped out and delivered in less than a week!
5,Does what it does and its great.
5,It's a cable. It's 50 feet. The material is actually weirdly nice. Functions great!
5,I was worried that with a cable this long I would lose a little bit of speed but the cable seems to be able to give me as much internet speed as I am paying for.
5,What can I say? It's an ethernet cable. It works great to tie your dog up to a tree. Just make sure they have plenty of water and shade.
4,I have this one in 25 feet. Both work just fine.
5,Great high quality cable. Came within 24 hours! Exactly what I wanted and it has a protecting cover over the clamp to keep it from breaking!
5,Great cable.  I ran it through my house because I was too cheap to have my wifi box moved.  :)  Works fine!
5,as advertised shipped on time.
5,Working as intended. Thank you.
5,This is 50' of cat5 cable. It is doing the work expected of 50' of cat5 cable. No complaints.
5,Bought it for gaming had it for a couple of weeks now and so far it has performed as it should.
5,Sleek looking. Great weight and awsome connection. It works better than any Ethernet cable I've purchased in the past. I was not sure when I ordered it but I am glad I did at a great price and very fast delivery.
4,Nice cable well made. 50 ft has no discernible loss.
5,Great value and product. Worked great for the office space.
5,nice product
5,Works as advertised at a very very reasonable price compared to what's offered in big box stores. Will definitely be buying again as I expand my connected house.
4,Good Solid Cable
5,What needs to be said? Perfect timing using it now and works. Thank you for fast delivery
5,Great quality and cheap have it connected from a SB6183 to a Linksys ac1900 to a roku premier+
5,Lab Ethernet cables aren't in much use with all the WIFI setups but if you need them these are certainly worth purchase.
4,Does what it's supposed to.
5,I have always been buying Belkin product because they were name brand. This cable is double the length of the one I purchase at UMass Dartmouth but for half the price and better construction of the RJ-45 connectors.
5,Cable worked exactly as expected.  Has very moniro jitter (0.1-0.5ms) but that's to be expected from such a long cable.  Overall great buy for the money.
5,Works great just what i needed for my xbox one. Also good quality. I've bought two. Very good quality and easy to use with the design. Would recommend to everyone great quality.
5,Great product at a good price. My son needed a cable for his dorm room we had it within a couple days. Son was very happy which is all that is important to me.
5,Great cable and pricing at this length
4,works for me
5,Very well made.  Especially the security via twisted pairs.  Even though it is good up to the length of a football field I only needed the 15 foot length.  Works great.
5,I had ordered a MEDIABRIDGE CAT5 Patch cable 50 feet for my wired network Linksys Broadband Router  and it works perfectly and is well made!  I'll be sure to order again and they have a very fine professional technical assistance customer service!
5,Very long cord.  Reaches from 2nd floor of house to the basement to the dining room of my house.
4,As normal
5,Great!!
4,well made
5,Cable was plenty long enough for what I needed.  Clean works great.  End has snag-free tab which makes things even easier!  Fast shipping!  thanks!
5,It's a good price and 50 feet long. What else is there to say!
5,Does the job intended.  I haven't measured it to see if exactly 50' or not but it goes from point A to point B as intended supplying signal to a cascaded WiFi router.
5,Great product. Arrived on time. Quick install and up and running.
5,Super great cable!!! Will buy this again if the need arises!!
5,Awesome thanks!
5,This company knows their customer service.They will make things right.Never any problems with their cables and I look for their name brand first when searching for any cables HDMI ethernet whatever.My choice brand.
5,Just as described
5,Does its function and does it pretty good
5,Purchased this to replace a fraying cat5 cable that I was using to run between my wall jack and my wireless router. Been using it for 6 months plus and haven't had any issues.Also the connectors have not been annoying like some cables are.
5,:)
5,We needed this right away for our office so we selected next day delivery and it was still less than if we went to an office supply store or our IT vendor. Seems to the job we expected.
5,I had bought 25" and it was 6 inches to short so I decided to purchase the 50" and I have left over cable and it reaches where I need it to reach with plenty left over
5,Great Cable and I especially like the little cover over the clip which makes it easier to pull through places with out the fear of the clip getting caught on something
5,works great quality as good as can be expected
5,Love it worth it.
5,It was just the right length of wire and it reaches where I need the wire to connect to.
5,It did what I needed. I had no problems with it.
5,great
5,Laptop use in my recliner
5,I was a little weary buying such a long cable for so cheap but after pulling it across an entire house i cannot report any malfunctions. Recommended for anyone that needs to hardwire their Internet for a better connection.
5,cable I needed to hook my other pc in the bedroom
4,The cable is a little flimsy so might not be great for pulling through walls in a major wiring project but would work fine for running under/along a baseboard when your computer is far away from your Cat5 plug.
5,This ethernet cable has worked exactly like it should. I have no issues with it whatsoever. At such a cheap price I was incredibly surprised by both the length and the quality of the cable (with clip cover) is great.
5,I used this cable from my modem to another room and  plugged it directly into my laptop  i  now get 17 MBPS more speed  works great!!!
5,Great Product
5,It was certainly an ethernet cable and it was certainly 50 feet long.
5,No issues
5,It’s really good
5,Inexpensive wat to move wifi modem upstairs
5,Cable was a bit too long but still got the job done! I feel so happy now that im able to get a strong wired connection for my playstation 4!
5,Love it!
5,Great build quality and still using it.
5,Awesome cables! Works great unless you have brat cats that seem to enjoy chewing cables! Just a joke though! ~
5,This worked with the coupler as designed.  Extended my Internet line through the house.
5,I have used MediaBridge products for almost all my connections which require cables and they never fail me.  I would say this is the product that you should consider seriously among the other brands out there.  Highly recommended.
5,This is just long enough for what I needed and at a better price than I could buy where I am at.
5,It's long and better at basketball than I am. It's a slam dunk!
5,Have bought many mediabridge products never a problem. Great product
5,Needed some good quality long cable worked perfect.
5,The 50 foot cable arrived on schedule and works perfectly.  The packaging was really nice.  Nothing like a 50' Ethernet cable (LOL).If I need another one I'll buy this brand.
5,Since purchasing this product I have had absolutely no problems with it.  Works as advertised.  Be advised that I have not plugged/unplugged it frequently and also have fixed it with gaffers' tape so I have not tested its ruggedness.
5,Good quality Cat5.  I wanted a wired connection to my smart TV in another room because the WIFI signal wasn't strong enough and this was perfect.
5,Quality cable blue
4,I use this to connect my laptop to the modem. Products works fine for me.
5,A very good quality product.
5,Why pay $50 at Radio Shack for the same quality I got for $5!! Cable runs my 100 mbps off modem and was shipped very quick. Will buy from them again when I need another!!
5,This is a solid cable for the price/color.  It does exactly what it needs to do and have no complaints.
4,did what I needed
5,Great so far! Fast and durable
5,I come to Mediabridge for a variety of electronics and I'm satisfied every time I need something from them.The Ethernet cable does everything it's supposed to.
5,good quality. nice secure click into socket at a awesome price.
5,it works what else can I say long enought to run around the top of our counpter room so the new dog can't eat it
5,It's really long and works well enough.  It came curled up and went all the way from the living room to the area of the bedroom I needed it for my desktop without an aircard.
5,Works fantastically.  No kinks or fraying and the pieces lock in and function as expected!  Awesome deal for the price
5,good
4,Well made and have had no issues
5,Great product in my estimation. It is easy to use. I use it to connect a product to the internet through a router.
5,Standard shipping was quick and the cable was exactly as ordered. I was a bit scared based on a few negative comments I've seen here but despite those the cable functions without a hitch and doesn't appear flimsy or cheap.
5,Arrived on time. Well made. Works beautifully. Solved a long-standing problem at a good price.
5,I love this because for the same price as buying a wireless router card I got this and am now hard lined in running at 4x any wireless adapter I've used. And was literally the perfect length.
5,Used to connect my PC to my cable modem.  Works great!
5,My 50 foot network cables are well made and a good value.  The cord can become kinked when pulling through small holes so be mindful to keep unwinding the strand otherwise the cables have worked flawlessly.
4,Ordered the Mediabridge network cat5e patch cable 50' long from Amazon.com  I had read good reviews on this cable and it did not disappoint me.  Cable arrived on time in great condition and is working perfectly.
5,Good quality cables
5,Great product
5,Came in mail as promise thanks
5,Thanks
5,I bought this cable for my home network. The cable is very well constructed with extra push tab for easy removal.  Great price too!!!!  I would recommend these products to anyone. THANKS MEDIABRIDGE!!!
5,Good item
5,This cable is a perfect size for what I need it.
5,good cable. i ran this line for about 30 feet. I get consistent fast speeds. It was easy to tack up and didn't break.
5,I have two housesand all of my cables are mediabrige. Just the best!
5,Love the length and with this much extra length it's easy to crimp and redo the end if the end of the jack ever becomes too loose.
5,Do not use every day but cable has meet my needs and have not had any issues with speed or noise.
5,I ordered this cord after the one I had stopped working. the package arrived on time and was well packaged. it works perfectly well and I would definitely recommend it and also recommend buying it from Mediabridge Networking.
5,Great quality and price.  Quick ship too.
5,Great product; timely delivery.
5,Works great and gets the job done.
4,Works as intended
5,Its hard to believe you can get a cable of this quality for 5 bucks. for a cable of the same length at any of the big box stores would be 8x the cost and not as nice of a cable.
5,This is sturdy cable that works well it's flexible but not flimsy. Other cables I had tried are a very thin plastic that shreds when pulled the copper wire is so thin it breaks without a lot of pressure.
5,Did what I needed it to do which was run a cable from my modem to my computer in the basement.  This is the result: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu23zGWIGLw
5,Used for Xbox one
5,Fine product.  Will do business again if needed.  Would recommend to a friend.
5,Used this 50' Ethernet cable to connect my upstairs router to my wife's downstairs computer.  Had to go through a few walls and the ceiling but it works great.  Great signal.  No complaints.
4,Works as expected.
5,does what its supposed to only problem is that those plastic clips that hold the cable in the slot keep on braking for me not sure why but w.e cable on the other hand is fine.
5,Good cable pretty standard.
5,Cord does what its supposed to.  Great price
5,I have a computer that is wireless and I have had a lot of problems with the wifi my dsl keeps dropping service. After purchasing the Mediabridge ethernet cable it cleared up the dsl dropping signal. Awsome product!
5,Product was as advertised.  I really like the protective end on the cables as the plastic tab is easy to break so this offers some protection.  I will definitely look at other Mediabridge products in the future.
5,Does its job
5,Just right for the job.
5,I have ordered mediabridge cables before and they have never let me down. Replace a 50ft patch cable that mice loved with 50 mediabridge cable and it works just as I expected.
3,The Mediabridge Cat5e Ethernet cable is not really worth buying since you can buy a Cat7 ethernet cable for the same price but get better speeds. Other than that no problems with the Cat5e.
5,good quality has not broken yet looks good I like it blue too. speed is fast seems high quality I would use it to wire a nuclear bunker but I dont have one.
5,This is a really good networking cable. Especially when you want to hard wire your IT equipment at home. You don't always want your personal stuff going across the air waves.
5,Nice cable at a great price.
5,No problems at all connections  are tight and fit in the port well. I'm going to oder a 100 foot length also.
4,the cable is performed excellent as expected but the material or protection around the wires is a little weak if u need to run the cable thru walls or ceiling make short u soft pulling the cable because it can break..
5,I connected my computer to my TV and it worked immediately.  So simple and such a great price!
5,Item is exactly as described works wonderfully thank you
5,50 ft Ethernet Cable not much else to it works as expected and I haven't experienced any problems with it yet.
5,Just what I ordered thank you:)
5,Cheap No lateral play. Fairly stiff cable.Has plastic on the ends to prevent the wires from desoldering when bent.This is all you could really ask for.
5,Meets my need for the Laptop
5,50feet is better footage than 51 or 49 feet. good even number.
5,Cable arrived promptly and we are very pleased with the ease with which we are now able to use the streaming video option from Netflix.  Thanks!
5,It works. I like it. Thank you.
5,Used this to hook up my upstairs satellite receiver to my router which is in the basement level. perfect!
5,Worked out great just like the advertised. I would purchase it again.
5,This product looks as good or better than any I've bought. I like that the cable is "limp" indicating the use of many thin strands allowing routing to be easy as it lays down where you put it.
5,I bought this cable because I was having problems with my ps4 and my internet connection. This cable solved the problem and now my ps4's internet runs faster than ever.
5,went from 20 MBPS wireless to 120 MBPs wired!highly recommended if youre a gamer and you play online!
5,Good cables this is my 4 cable from them good product
5,There isn't much to review about cat 5 cable. It was clean and clearly new it works just fine and the shipping was very prompt. I have no complaints and would shop from them again.
5,This product has effectively connected my computer to the internet without exploding or causing a world wide epidemic. Everything I need from an ethernet cable.
5,Quality seems to be great. I bought this cable for my son's gaming computer and he has no complaints. Can't believe the low price on this one.
5,Just as describe.
5,This cable is working just fine. I used it for my ps3 and even for my laptop.If I were you I get this cable since is a Good price and best brand as well.
5,Really good internet cable for it's price! Extra long and speeds up my internet believe it or not! It's a great thing to use around the house with my computers and gaming consoles.
5,Does what it's supposed to and well made. Satisfied
4,So far so good
5,Good quality; fair price; prompt shipment.
5,Great product
5,used it around the office works well.
5,Bought this cable to snake through the wall to the upstairs media room. Well made cable works as advertised.
4,I bought this for my son to use in his apartment. When ask he said The cable seems just fine.  Nice enough quality that the connector tabs didn't just break right away (hate when that happens.)
4,Works well..Is a  more firm cable hook up than some other cables I have  used. Would buy again
5,I ordered this cable as I did not really want to pay a lot of money at my local office supply store.  This works just as well and saved me some money.
4,Solid cable quick delivery so far so good.
5,Didn't get a WiFi adapter for my PC so this has worked for me as an alternative. Haven't had any issues.
5,It's exactly what it states. A really long ethernet cord. The quality is good and I would recommend it for sure.
5,Muy util
1,I have gigapower. 1GBps for internet.  I was getting 94 MBps. This is less than 1/10 of internet I pay for. My wired internet was slow so I called my SP. They stated everything was fine on their end. I checked the speed using a 25 foot cord I bought from this vendor and it was fine. I checked with another cord on another computer it was fine. I got a bad cord. I was disappointed but I'll solve it by getting cords with higher transfer rates just in case.  These cords should work fine with internet that is slower than mine.
5,Does the job solid connectors heavy shield.
4,It has not tore on me nice cable though.
5,I've ordered 3x of the 50 ft from Mediabridge. They arrived in their own boxes. No issues with network performance either. I would recommend highly for everyone looking for CAT5e 50Ft Patch Cable already made plug-in-connect into your ports.
5,I needed a very long Ethernet cord and was not looking to spend a lot of money. This fit the bill perfectly. THe packaging was minimal and it was long enough for my purposes.
5,Excellent Lan !
4,works great
5,It is an Ethernet Cable as if you could tell the difference without test equipment. It works just peachy. Get a few they are cheap.
2,Wasn't sure to give this 2 or 3 stars. Its alright but the part of the plastic end that keeps it in your computer so sometimes it would often get disconnected easily. I ended up taping it to the computer. Other than that it works well and it is really long.
4,I like it.
5,Great product and great service. Thank you
5,These are high quality and the colors are great!
5,works good at great price
5,Not much to say here.  It's a quality Ethernet cable good connectors on both ends showed up packaged appropriately to protect it and it works for me when installed and connected to a router!
5,Excellent quality! Would definitely buy again when needed
5,50 foot Ethernet cord. Does what I need it to do. No complaints. Used it to hook my Xbox one to the modem in a different room.
5,Bought it needing a 50 foot Ethernet cable and I got what it said. Nothing less nothing more.
5,Very long and very blue. Works fine to connect our router to Apple TV unit. I can't say anything negative except there is a blue cord running through my living room but what can you do.
5,Great cable used for internet usage
5,Exactly as advertised
5,Great cable! Sturdy with amazing connection to internet.
5,I had a different switcher before this one and had problems with random switching. That never happens with this. Plus there's a remote. It's awesome!
5,The wifi in my computer doesn't work anymore so I had to buy this to connect my laptop to the router.  It's length is perfect and is well made.
5,Love these cables. Work great wonderful price good quality. This is my 3rd or 4th.
5,Skip the overpriced brick and mortar stores and buy it here. Great price and quality!
5,Not much to say it's very long and it does the job it is designed for!
5,A+++++
5,Works great for my Apple TV.
5,Thanks for the prompt response to my order.  It came immediately and I have absolutely nothing to complain about.I'll be checking you out if I have any further needs.
5,love these cables have purchased about 3 of the same make for wiring around my home
5,Needed to move my office and this cable facilitated the transfer.  Mediabridge products are top of the line and I will always check their availability before shopping any other brand for electronic cables.
2,Was a great cable until it just stopped working....Just like that. I bought this cable about 2 weeks ago and earlier this week I wasn't getting a connection. I checked my router and computer and both were fine. I then checked to make sure the cable was working by plugging it into a different computer but it wasn't. I'm not really sure if it was a defective cable or maybe I broke it but I checked all 50 ft of the cable and saw no damage.
4,Item arrived as scheduled. Installed without problems. Works as intended.I was concerned about one issue: in the middle of the cable it looks like it was soldered from two pieces. But this does not appear to interfere with function.
2,The tab that secures this to the back of the computer is so week the cable kept falling out.  I thought i had a bad cable so ordered a 2nd one from same person an same thing.  I had to tape them into place to secure it.  Data transfer seems slow and lots of lag when using this product.
5,No problems and arrived on time.
5,Works as advertised. Just the right length for my needs.
4,Just another ethernet cable
5,it works without any problems at all couldn`t expect better for the price. Great product for a great price!
5,Fast reasonable price and good to have for my internet
4,good
5,Works exactly as it should and I received the cable in a timely fashion.
5,Compré el cable porque necesitaba evitar estar comprando una USB para acceder a internet que cuesta alrededor de $30.00 y tenía que comprar dos al año. Ahora por $15.00 incluyendo el envío tengo un mejor servicio.
5,Dedicated hardwired connection
4,Great item.Arrived promptly.
5,Works great for our video security system. Great price
5,Amazing bought these 6 months ago and still going very strong! Very fast and I have shut it on my door quite a few times and has no penetrated the chord.
5,The perfect wire for the job.
5,Durable great color.
5,Excellent cord that works as it should and appears to be a quality cable. Fast shipping with outstanding customer service from Mediabridge. I will buy their products again!
5,For cube
5,Great Ethernet cord especially for the price.
5,Thanks as described
5,Works at intended and great Cat6 cable.
5,The Ethernet cable allows me to use a computer on another floor in addition to my main computer There seems to be very little signal loss with this cable.
5,I just got the cable and it seems to be working just great.  The cable itself is pliable enough to where I can run it up the wall and on the ceiling yet still very durable.
5,does the job there is not much else to say other then price is close to other sites that just sell cables but with prime I have free 2 day which sold me here!
5,Worked like a charm. Had no issues with it whatsoever.
5,These cords are thick and strong. Not flimsy at all. Long enough I can hook things up there the attic so i don't have cords everywhere!
5,good. what more can you say about a cable?
4,gr8 overall transaction . . .love the product!!
5,Perfect
5,Excelente quality and length. Came in nice box.
4,great Ethernet cord and durable
5,Works fine
5,Long as heck.
5,Pretty much what youd expect.
5,Works for me instead of buying a Apple TV or Amazon TV since I already have a Samsung smart tv saved me lot more money
5,It works very well
5,Absolutely perfect for what we needed. No issues whatsoever.
4,good
5,I was very surprised at the good quality of this cable much heavier than I thought it would be.
5,Works perfectly and I have had no issues.
5,Perfect. Works well. Very durable
5,This worked extremely well however a rodent found a way in my home and chewed this up.
5,great ethernet cable and the price was great
5,After discovering MediaBridge on Amazon I would never purchase any data cable from a big box store.  You pay 3x-4x as much for the exact same cable.  These works great with no issues.  Will purchase again.
5,Cable arrived ahead of promised delivery date. Works great even at 50 feet this cable showed no loss of video quality verses my 6 foot cables. Very well constructed and an excellent price. Mediabridge is my go to place.
4,Received in perfect condition as promised. Works great needed cable this long to run to computer in basement.
5,This is a simple item and one would expect something that works dependable and hassle free. Definitely delivered on all three of those areas.

5,Standard quality
5,Works great. Plenty of cable to run our router to another room. Works great.
5,Like usual they rock! I'll always check Mediabridge first to see if they carry whey I'm looking for.
4,Works nicely for the price. The chord runs a little long though. I needed something to span a large room but other sizes were too small. This was too long.
5,It worked as it should. No issues.

5,nice cable  I bought it to direct wire my streaming video player.  Does just what I wanted it to do.  Seems well made.
5,I was worried that it might lose a signal because of the long 50' length but it works just fine.
5,Long blue 50 ft cable with protective ends is what I wanted and so far the clear plastic lock part has not snapped off so all is good.
4,Good cable. nice to work with.
5,Really long and perfect to be able to get across a room.
5,It's a good cable I runs accross my house floor so people do step on it and it has stood up to it hope fully it stays this way. Very happyy after a month of having it
5,Just what I need it! Thank you :)
5,Nothing much to say good product well packaged. works as promised and much cheaper than in store. I would buy without hesitation
5,Came as it should have and is a durable soft cable so it won't stay molded as if it were on the reel still. Rolls out straight and easy.
5,Good
5,Standard Ethernet cable Works as expected. I also do like media bridge as a brand and universally recommend their products.
5,Does the job good stuff. Use it to connect from my modem to a router in a separate room in the house
5,My son needed this for his game system it's sturdy not flimsy and was a good price
5,I love having a lo-o-ng cable for those temporary connections between rooms.  This cable works perfectly and sells at a reasonable price.  The non-snag feature is great as well.

5,It was what we needed.
5,The cable works great.  The quality was very good and it even came with a Velcro cable strap.
5,The cable has worked as expected. It was delivered on time and there were no problems.
5,jjust what i needed. .ty
5,good
5,It's not short it's not red and it's not flimsy. In fact it's long blue and sturdy. It works great. End of story.
5,I bought this cable to connect my Tivo box to the internet.  Now I can watch Netflix Amazon streaming etc.  Much cheaper than retail stores which charges $30+ for the same length of cable.
5,Great shipping it it did’t work for me.
2,I received the cable in October and two months later it no longer works. The cable wasn't touch since installation so it wasn't getting moved around at all. It workee great for those two months but it really should have lasted longer.
5,What else can I say? It connects my router to my laptop on the other side of my living room. Works a lot faster than wifi and was cheaper than just about anywhere else (especially BestBuy.)
4,At this point I'd be surprised if there was an issue with a simple ethernet cable but this one still works perfectly fine. Wish it were a more neutral color though.
5,Bought for a nephew to that he didn't have to use wireless to game on. This does the trick.
5,Works as intended
5,This cable was purchased to connect my printer to the wireless router located in another room. The 50 ft cable works well.
5,I've got several 25 footers a 100 footer and this 50 footer and they all have worked fine.  If you need a cable to carry internet this is your cable.
5,50 Footer works great at a great price.  What more do you want?
5,There is nothing bad to say about this cord. It holds up well and does the job.
5,My 50 foot Cat 5 ethernet cable arrived quickly and was well packaged.  So far it has worked perfectly connecting my internet router to my laptop.  I would definitely order from Mediabridge again.
4,WORKED GREAT
5,strong cable
4,Great ethernet cable.

4,Great product. Great price.
5,Great product! Heavy duty construction. Supper fast delivery. Works great.
4,I bought this cable to connect a second desktop to our home network. So far it works fine and the cable is still intact. Seems to be decent quality and the price was good.
4,I used this to reset my security camera. Security camera is workingfine. Thanks
5,Cable was not to thick or to thin
5,Good value and seems to be durable.  The molded tab protector definitely does a better job of protecting that delicate plastic lock.
5,Product as advertised and perfect for what I needed
5,Nice sturdy cable.  Would buy everytime I need 50 foot cable lol.
5,It is what it says it is and that's a 50 foot ethernet cable.
5,I needed one of these and this seemed like the best option in terms of price length and shipping options. I would recommend this to anyone doing some home networking or networking a small office environment.

5,Really useful and its fine
5,Nice
5,I used it to reach across my living room from my cpu to xbox 360 and it worked perfectly. All I did was kept it along the wall behind my couches to avoid damaging it. So far so good.

5,worked just fine and ship fast
5,Great cable
5,Product works great.  Thanks
5,This is perfect for a larger room where you need length for connection.  The price was right and it seems to be of high quality.  I am satisfied.

5,It was exactly what i needed.Great Product.!!
5,Works. Does its job at half the price of most stores.
5,Awesome
5,PlayStation 4 connectivity is much better with this than on wireless. No noticeable difference when comparing speed tests against a 6 foot cable.
5,This cable has a solid feel to it and creates a nice speedy connection to the internet from the router. Good choice if your Wi-Fi is choking up your bandwidth.
5,Exactly what I needed. Great quality.
5,they work and priced well too.
5,It’s perfect and a great size
4,It's long enough to get my computer connected.

4,Good!
5,Affordable and very accurately described product. No damages were found while opening I will update my feed back later if material begins to break apart. But as of right now I am pretty satisfied.
5,great use it every week.cynthia
1,Failed in 2 months. That's something completely unheared of. Not to mention it just failed out of the blue while watching youtube with no real reasoning as to why. Weather here is fine the cable doesn't cross any others for interference it's never tampered with both my modem router and computer are on surge protectors even my PCs ethernet socket is branded as anti-surge both ways. By the way  yes I tested the cable on other devices/sockets and tried other cables on the same sockets. It's the cable.  I'm completely baffled.
4,High quality and very good for long in wall runs. Perfect for what I needed.
5,Not much more to say. It seems to be well made it works and it's has a very good price. I like the protector over the latch because those always seem to break off.
5,Good quality. Dont care for the color but the price is to good to pass up.
5,Works perfectly for Xbox. Very pleased with this product.
5,It works and a great price
5,good stuff
5,Sorry I forgot about it. every thing was good as shown.. thank you.
4,Long good and cheaper than the stores. Does what an Ethernet cable needs to do.
5,It does was it's meant to do. For me the 50-feet is longer than I needed but better longer than too short.
5,still working
5,Hasn't had any breaks so far seems like it will last a while.
4,Good cable. Just could have been slightly thicker I guess. Overall works good and priced well.
4,It's data cable and does the job.
4,good quality
5,Works for me I have tried cheaper generics from EBAY they didn't work connectors didn't work but this did the trick for me. I will stick with Mediabridge. Love it.
5,Its nice and long what more could you need?
5,Arrived on the exact date they said it would tried it out once before I had to leave and worked just like it should have.
5,Quick ship and worked great.
5,Works perfectly!!! Easy to hook up and use.
5,Have other cables but needed to put the TV on ethernet in another room.
5,Great as expected good work guys
5,I was sceptical but so far it has been working excellent way better than my wifi usb driver
5,I needed a long cable to reach from our modem in the garage to the family room. This cable is plenty long enough and works great!
4,Good quality and works well between my cable modem and router
2,Tried running through the walls had the unfortunate luck of this cable ripping like a cheap thread when pulling it with my fish tape.as a standard cat6 cable im sure it's fine. but don't try suggesting that this cable is durable when it is not.shoulda just paid the extra $ for a thicker cable.
5,Good quality
5,The item fully met my expectations at a fair price with prompt delivery. Who could ask for more?
5,Why spend big bucks on cables? These cables are wonderful at a fraction of the price of big box stores. Quick shipping from Amazon makes getting a new cable easier than buying in a local store.
5,Worked great to connect my Wifi directly to my TV
5,It's long and does what it needs to do
4,Yep it's a 50 foot cable works as advertised. Good reputation good deal.

5,It's a long ethernet cable
5,I PURCHASED A 30  THIRTY FOOTER FOR LONG CABLE HARD WIRE TROUBLESHOOTING ON GOOGLE BOXES IT WORKS GREAT
5,works as intended!
5,Just the right thing. Works well.
5,I've bought many Mediabridge cables in the past.Never been disappointed in either price or quality.My advice is skip the expense of the high dollar retailer.Amazon and Mediabridge won't make you say later"I paid too much."
3,I honestly can't write about this cable with any authenticity because I realized when I got my wireless router that I would not need it. I'll probably sell it to someone else. But I'm sure it's of good quality. It looks sturdy and well made and is everything shown in their ad for it.
4,The cable is well made and has nice covers on the ends so that the tab does not accidentally rip off when feeding it through a narrow hole.
5,Perfect product for a great price.
5,Cable work's well with no issues.
5,A nice thick high quality cable.
5,Had it for about half a year now have had 0 problems with it.
5,As described

5,Thnks
5,Does what it needs to do at a good price I am satisfied.
5,Worked great for networking the house.
4,The cable was delivered quickly and the price was good.The cable worked great linking my play station and DVR to the internet I would recommend this product.
5,Works like a cable should installed and works great.  No speed loss speed tests are what I pay for!
5,made with quality
5,strait forward great value.
5,I bought two of these and they both work.Wire seems durable and nice and flexible.Should serve me well.I recommend this over some of the cheaper ones that have lower quality wire.
5,50 Ft for $10. Oh best decision and savings I've ever done.
5,The price is so low compared to the ones you find in actual stores. The quality of the product is great and it works like it is supposed to.
5,Great price and worked as expected. I attached a smart TV directly to my router in another room.
5,This is just the right length of ethernet cable to enable my housemate to connect to a router to share my DSL service.  Great product and fast service.
5,Arrived on time. Good tight connections. Good data transmission without noticeable interference.
4,Good
5,Sure is a 50' Ethernet cable. Feels sturdy.
5,I got this because I was sick of my crappy wifi connection. Just took it out of the box plugged it in and it was an immediate improvement.
3,My biggest issue is the long plastic covering over the piece that helps remove the Ethernet cable. In tight spaces it makes removal tedious rather than convenient.
5,works as advertised comes in handy would buy again
5,What can I say it is an ethernet cable. Does it's job. Well satisfied.
5,Great cable. Installs easily (as if it wouldn't be) and it is fast.
5,Works great. Thanks!
4,works well. easily bends as cable is covered in a softer material than on coaxial cables or hdmi's.
5,Been using this for 10 months; ran it through a few walls and its holding up fine. Nice and durable.

4,works good
5,Works like a charm - just what we needed.
5,Length was what i needed and it's fast as far as connectivity goes also cheap!
5,It's doing the job.
5,Classic Cat5e for your internet connecting pleasure.  Price was great along with shipping.
1,The first one I received didn't work at all so I exchanged it for another. The new one cut my Internet speed way down. I'm lucky to see 50mbps with this cable while my other cables have me at my ISP speed of 400mbps. This time I'm returning and buying a different product.
5,Works great and very fast delivery.
5,Great Value. At the local big box electronics store they wanted 25$ for this cord. Ridiculous. And I use Prime so I waited 2 days and saved about $20....great deal!
5,works like it should.
5,Needed a lot longer ethernet cable as my WiFi won't reach a certain part in my room. This works great!
5,reaches about anywhere in my apartment but my apartment is 2 bedroom and not that big so its easy for my to hook this cable to anything anywhere in the house.
5,Works as described. No issues.
5,Perfect length and works perfectly good.
5,This is a high quality cable and just what I needed for emergency backup streaming when my wireless router occasionally fails.

5,Cable works great.
5,Worked as described.
5,cheap cable. what else can you say? walmart and best buy would charge you your first born. All hail Amazon!
5,Not much to say.  It's CAT5 cable.  Works great and the price is right.  Note that this item has the non-snag cover.
5,good product at a good price
4,Passes electrons like sh*t through a goose!
5,Just what I needed. I bought one more extra than I needed but I could always use a spare 50 footer for my network.
5,I love buying Mediabridge products they're well made. I highly recommend buying from this vendor. I just this Ethernet cable because I don't like gaming on wireless.
5,Very good quality cable must buy again
5,Great cable right length for my needs. It Did in fact improve my streaming over WiFi so i have them both hooked up and switch when needed.
5,Bought this cable for my mom and she loves it. Works good..

5,As advertised.
5,Good cable
5,Perfect
3,just do yourself a favor and for the expensive ethernet cable if you want superior quality if you're going to actually use it
5,The cable connects to rooms together via the attic and all systems were a go ! I'm very pleased. Also good price
5,Can not beat the price.  I paid much more for this length just last year.  works great
4,Works
5,Packaging was excellent and came with a wire tie .
5,Fast shipping and useful for my Xbox one to other room.  It work perfect.
5,Great product! Was shipped quickly and product exceeded my expectations. Very high quality ethernet cable for the price!
5,You get exactly what you pay for
5,Great for internet in adjacent room when wi-fi sometimes is unpredictable.
5,Just what we needed for tv streaming!
5,Internet works great and smooth. Needed a lengthy wire and can't imagine spending more money and receiving a better product... Maybe if it were wrapped in gold or bronze:)
5,50 ft is likely much more than I needed but you simply can't beat the price and quality. I'm actually considering hard wiring in a couple additional rooms because these cables are so good.
5,It's a good long ethernet cord and it does the job. Not much more to it.
5,Very good
5,As described
4,I needed a longer ethernet cable. This did just the trick. Plus it was fairly low cost. The quality seems great. I recommend this.
5,It is a well made item that works. Can't get any better than that.
5,just what I needed
5,Cable was easy to fish through hole I drilled and easy to move around.  Worked flawlessly once connected.
5,Great product excellent price!
5,Highly recommend.  I bought 2 of these cables to connect 2 rooms.  The cables are of good quality and I have had no issues with these.
5,great product. just what I needed..
5,Quality material. Delays in delivery.
5,Does what was needed to hook up computer.  Works well with no problems
5,works great and well priced
5,works well very pleased with this item. i bought same cable in stores at much more the cost. and seems be the same cable way cheaper.
1,Impossible to crimp or splice. The wires inside the insulation are the smallest gauge imaginable this makes it very hard to splice wires unless you have baby hands and the touch of an angel.  Also they thought it was a good idea to put a plastic part in the middle of the wire making it very hard to flatten out wires to crimp into a new connector. I would return this product but it is "damaged". Good if you want the basic use if you want to reduce the size or add more wire to it.
5,Works as advertised would buy it again
5,Mediabridge is he best. I can not beleive the prices. Fantastic! Mediabridge is the place to go when big name stores such as Staples carry the same item for twice as much.
5,Works perfect!
5,it came quickly as promised and it works fine. in fact my daughter keeps slamming it in a door hinge and it's still going strong. no complaints.
4,Works as expected. Good quality.
5,Works fine
4,holding up nicely
5,No problems works as advertised.
5,Great cable worked perfectly for a few weeks until my dog chewed it in half. Oh well alreay bought another one just like it and its great too.
5,Very nice price and fast delivery
5,Fast and strong! Great delivery!
5,I needed a connection downstairs. Worked well and my connection is much stronger.
5,Does the job its meant to
5,Good cables and good price.
5,Great quality fast delivery good price...
5,I've only used this to network XBox's together but it works fine for that.  I don't see why it would perform any worse as a computer network cable.  No complaints.  I would definitely buy this product again.
5,This cord was the perfect cord to connect my dish network directly to my modem.
3,Unravel the cable with extra care this item kinks easily and the covering split.  I hooked it up and everything works well.  I wrapped the weakened areas with electricians tape.  Once I hooked it up the cable runs around the edge of a room it's quite safe from further damage and performs well.

4,good cables
1,Stop. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere. Spent hours installing and troubleshooting only to conclude the cable was faulty. Reinstalled with new Cat6 cable from the big orange box store for 30% more money and worked As it should. I compared the cables and this Mediabridge cable is a joke! Its under constructed with an extremely thin wire gauge and it"s even missing the center insert in some places. Trust me this is no deal and only wish I compared before I spent my whole Saturday on this junk!
5,Works great. Have it running across the floor and being stepped on constantly. Still works just fine!
5,Great product
5,It is what I needed and is working very good
5,Excelente product.  Well recommend
2,Soon after I bought this the part that keeps it locked in broke from normal usage making it almost useless. The plastic covering part did not prevent this and even made it hard to connect to my router.Now I'll have to spend money to buy another -- hopefully it won't break.
5,Solved my need. Internet is better through the cable!

5,Great productworks as advertise. I have used the cable from my modem to my android tv box/hdtv with no drop in internet speed.
1,I didn't believe some of the other reviews and I should have.  One end looks like a 5 year old crimped it.  Cable tester says there is a break in the cable.  At the end.  The RJ45 IS NOT CRIMPED CORRECTLY.  Actually a 5 year old would have done a better job.STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.
5,not much more i could ask for
1,Bad quality. I installed this ethernet cable to run from my living room to my bedroom hidden under the floor routed through the basement where it couldn't be seen or touched. It has stayed plugged into my computer and hasn't moved once and it quit working. Tried plugging it into another laptop to make sure the cable was the problem and it was. Only lasted 8 months. If you were to move it around at all I would expect it to go by much quicker than 8 months. Don't waste your money
4,but...hey....it works.  It's a network cable how hard can it be.  No slowdowns noticed.  So works for me blue or not.

5,Excellent high quality cable. Very reasonable price point and works perfectly

However the very minute I upgraded my internet service last night it went down. It does not support speeds of 100mbps. I receive an error message saying the Ethernet cable is not compatible.

1,Couldn’t get it to work. Maybe you’ll have more luck.
1,It's an ethernet cable. It pretty much has two possibilities. It either works or it doesn't. Mine didn't. Kinda useless now.
2,I bought 2 of these and the connector broke over a period of time. I used this for my laptop so I was always taking it in and out and after about 4 months the side I was connecting and disconnecting just cracked. it may be my fault but it doesn't seem very sturdy
5,Long and works great!!
5,great cable
5,Just what I wanted and delivered quickly.
1,Gets far lower speeds than other cables I have laying around. Sadly I need a long cable. Looking at other reviewers it seems some of these aren't really legit--I think I got a lemon myself.Edit: Finally decided to get a new cable. 25 mbps --> 240 mbps. This one was a knock-off or a dud or the other reviewers are wrong about its performance.

5,Great.
5,good quality good product works great
2,The one I received didn't deliver the speeds that it promised. I'm paying for 200 Mbps but with this cable I was getting roughly 90. I blame it on the very cheap construction

5,Cable excellent quality
5,good price !
5,just what I wanted
1,I bought a 50-ft cable and received a 40-ft one. I would've returned it but it was noticed by the contractor who was working on my house AFTER it was halfway installed in the ceiling! So my contractor had to ran to the store and buy an extender billing me $55/hour plus the cost of the extender to make it long enough—we needed 43 feet. I am so upset with this purchase!

5,great
5,GOOD CABLE
1,It is not single core wire barely twisted. The skin is very thin and soft vinyl that can be torn with fingernail. The length is about 5 feet short of specified.  It somehow worked with  my slow network but I doubt it will cover full speed. Since I cut in two pieces I did not return and wasted money. NEVER BUY !
5,Works perfect! Fast delivery
5,Exactly what was expected
5,thanks works great
5,as described no issues
2,I would look for a better cable the next time I buy. I can only get 90Mb down with these compared to 180Mb with my previous cat5 cable.
5,It worked perfect..
3,I like this cable very much it worked great for me and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the cable
5,Fully met my needs. Good product.

5,Superb quality!
5,Very good price.
5,Good quality. No complaints here.
1,I bought 2 of these and both were only 43 feet long.  There nothing worst than pulling cable through the ceiling only to come up a few feet short at the end!  I won't buy this brand ever again.Also it is unshielded twisted pair. That fact is buried in the expanded description which I never saw on my phone.

1,Not a cat 6 but a cat 5 cable. Missing the extra insulation to prevent cross talk and interference that would make it a cat6. You get what you pay for.... If you need cat 6 DONT GET THIS

5,works perfectly.
1,Complete waste of money. The cable I received was defective. After spending an hour and a half routing this cable from my upstairs office down to my living room through 2 walls and doing painstaking cable management I found out it isn't transmitting any data whatsoever. I'm not thrilled to put it very lightly.
5,NICE
3,its a long cable........and it works.......at a good price
5,Nice
3,works as advertised
5,Excellent!
5,Perfect
5,good
5,A-ok
1,Produce received was not a cat 5e cable
2,This product works but is very cheaply made. If you have any intention of removing the cord from your device be prepared to use force. For the price it isn't terrible but you get what you pay for.
1,The cable worked decent for an Ethernet cable but within two weeks the cable started to wear thin and almost kink like a low end hose. I began to lose internet connection with these issues and ended up having to buy a new cable.I'm surprised by the quality of this cable as I've never had issues with Mediabridge before.
1,OK for the price
1,I was so happy that this 50ft cable finally arrived but as soon as I connected it up to my computer I found out that it was completely dead. Tried this cable with over 5 different machines and none of them connected. Not only was the cable dead the clips on the connectors of the cord did not clip at all.
1,First one I bought was fine worked great so I bought another and by the time I used it I could not return it but it didn’t work and it was just sitting in the box it came in so 50/50
2,You pretty much get what you pay for like anything else not too bad not too great
2,did not work once installed not sure if it can this way or happened during installation
3,functional who could ask for more
2,Worked for about 2 months very well then failed. I hooked it up to a different computer to double check and it also said the connected cable was no good.
1,Switched to this cable for a few days then the internet became really unstable. I thought it was a Comcast problem at first but my roommate had no problem with the connection at all. Borrowed another cable and then the internet works just fine. Poor quality I guess.
3,As advertised.
3,good product
3,ok
1,This product was not 50 foot or 15 meters.  It was more like 40 foot.  The company and I agreed on 1/2 credit because the cable was not long enough for my use.  I bought a longer cable which did the job the 50' foot cable should have done.It took more time and effort than I wanted to do.Jack
2,Ordered two sets and one of them didn't work.
2,Had it a month already stopped working..
1,About a week after buying the cable stopped working and caused a lot of problems and kept saying unidentified network and that the cable wasnt working and not i have to find a new cable.
2,cables were wired wrong
3,nothing fantastic.
1,Ordered one of these and it worked great ordered a second and it didn't work out of the box. Plugged into the same jacks the first one worked in and got zero connection.
2,The cable has absolutely no protection.
1,I purchased this and once it arrived I hooked it to my router then to my PS3.  It never worked although shorter CAT5 cables that I had worked fine.  I must of received a bad cable but failed to let Amazon or the company know...so never got a chance to get it replaced.  But the review still holds...I bought a cable that won't work.
1,Doesn't work. Hooked up to my TV and it will not connect under wired settings
1,I have been trying to connect the Mediabridge Ethernet Cable to my TV directly from my router so as to have a good reception but it doesn't work? This is the second one I order hoping this will work!!!
1,Internet cable to 10 bucks seems good right? Wrong. Lasted two months and ran into all sorts of Internet problems. Changed the ethernet wire and bam lightening fast Internet with no problems. Cheap piece of junk. Spend twenty extra dollars and get one that lasts a few years.
1,Didn’t work.  I mean c’mon it’s a wire.  How do you make a wire that doesn’t work?  Somehow Mediabridge figured out how to.  Very disappointing.
1,Was expecting a normal Ethernet cable. This is a really thin blue round cable compared to a normal Ethernet cable...about half the diameter. Not what is in the advertisement picture.
1,Product was defective.  Installed cable in the crawl space only to connect and discovered it was defective.  Computer connected fine with a different Ethernet cord.  Now I need to order another long cord and reinstall in the perils of the crawl space
1,Failed to work right out of the box.
1,Already quit working and I only use it once a week when I work from home!
1,The cable works as expected but the sheathing is too ridged (hard plastic sheathing that won't lay flat and not flexible at all)
1,Product seems fine but delivery was terrible because use of USPS.  Delivery made 24 hours after promise time and USPS lied about attempted delivery.  I could have gone to store and purchased for about same price and had sooner but wanted to avoid holiday shoppers on Black Friday.  Really disappointed with delivery.
2,Worked well for the 2 months it lasted. I'll be purchasing a higher quality cable.
2,it worked for a week and then when I plugged it into many different ports did not work.
2,Went out after a month and half
2,kinda bad quality
1,This cable doesn't even feel right! Yes. It will carry data but forget using with POE. Couldn't deliver power injected over just itself (which is 50 ft). Pitched it because I don't want to get it in my stock and forget it is a low end cable. It might be good for a test cable but forget production. Cheap for a reason.
2,Not very well shielded.
1,I ran 100ft to my security system plugged it all in and nothing happened so I troubleshoot it and the brand new cable was bad so ordered another one
1,worked for like maybe 10 minutes then stopped.  now it won't work no matter how much i wiggle or position the undersized head in the sockets of my router and device.
1,Product was mislabeled.  I went to install it and it was well short.  I measured and it was only 25 ft not 50 ft.  Now I'm stuck running out to Best Buy for the right cable.
1,Total waste of money. Damn cable is broken straight out of the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!  You’ve been warned!
1,just one end is terminated.
1,Ordered 3 cables none of them actually worked. The RJ45 jacks are loose and form poor connections and the rubber grip makes the poor fit worse as it puts odd pressure on the connection.
1,This product is a piece of junk. Well unraveling it it broke in half very dissatisfied with the quality.
2,I bought this product which cost more because it said it was better made than the cheaper versions.  Not true it is like all the others no difference at a higher price.
1,Unfortunately I just went to install this cable from my modem to my smart TV and what I received is an HDMI cable not an ethernet cable.
1,This cable randomly died without any visible signs of wear or tears or kinks I had to crimp my own cable from work to take home and use. It lasted for many many months but eventually just died.
1,I tried it out worked for a week and now does not work for crap; do not purchase this Ethernet cable it did not register my internet to my laptop.
1,Just didn’t work that well
1,Broken upon arrival
1,I ordered a 50 foot cord and received 30 foot was not able to use for the project I needed at the last minute. Disappointed
1,I would put zero if I could.  It stopped working yesterday.  I'm screwed until I by another one.
1,I have used this Ethernet cable for a couple of weeks now and today it is telling me that "network cable unplugged" but its not unplugged. I've checked the cable and there were no damages to the cable.
1,works
1,One star for outright lying. This cable does NOT support gigabit so those looking to take advantage of a gigabit connection should probably look elsewhere.
1,Ordered this ethernet 2 months ago and it worked fine.  But now it totally stopped working.  Only 2 months old!  Seriously very disappointed! You'd really think something like this would at least last a couple years if not longer.
1,I never ordered?
1,Until further notice this product has already failed on multiple occasions. Would recommend another supplier.
1,This came upas cat6 when I searched for 50 ft of cat 6 it is not and will not work on networks over 100 meg! Totally wasted my money!
1,Cable was flimsy and got tangled easily. Protective coating tore very easily while running the cable. Once ran cable was found to be DOA.
1,Not 50 feet measured it around 38 feet
2,Connector seems to be too loose losing connection a lot.
1,It didnt qork and by the time I tested it was already to late to return.
1,Great during the return period then stopped working. The insulation is loose with too much airspace  between it and the inner wires.
1,i purchased this cable back in Nov 2017 half year later it's broken/not working extremely disappointed!
1,Broke fast
2,it is broken at the end
1,Cable tangled up something fierce after a few days of having it. It doesn't hold a linear position only a twist-twizzler pattern that renders the product unusable.
1,I bought two of these.  One worked and the other didn't.
1,Didn’t work.
1,My Ethernet Cable is not working good.. it's shorts out all the time
1,Ordered a 50 feet long but I got a 1.5 meter. Don't know what happened. Waste my time and money
1,Received a used product.
1,Cable just stopped working after 10 days of using it
1,It didn't work. I didn't bother to return it since it didn't cost much anyway.
1,The clip that locks the cable to the ethernet port breaks super easy.  Pretty much worthless unless you'll never need to unplug it.
1,The cord was a defect.  Instead of returning and getting my money back.  They asked me to cut it up and then send them pictures and then they sent me a new cable.  Make sure you read there return policy.
1,Less than year of use and the cable will not longer stay plugged into my ethernet port.
1,This cable does not get 10gps speed it caps at 100mbs. DO NOT ORDER if you have internet faster than 100mbs.
1,The reviews for this cable were so good I felt I couldn't let it pass on. It arrived today and guess what the cable doesn't work. I tried it as ethernet cable several times and I never got a connection. This one is going back for sure :(
1,Constant connection losses within a month of use.
1,Didn't work at all and it had misspelled words. Feels cheap like nothing was inside the cable
1,Did not work when I got it
1,This product broke after 2 days.  It was the worst cable
1,Do not buy it tangle as draylax on you.
1,Very cheap quality item . Very thin cable nothing like what is in the picture
2,it works
1,Didn't work for what I needed
1,Extremely slow speed. It takes forever to load content on my computer using this cable!! Don't buy
1,Barely works. Spend the money and get a better one without paper-thin plastic
1,Very cheap quality and bend all over the place. Requested specifically for CAT6 and received CAT5e
4,works as expected no real noticeable change from my poor G band router wireless to wired. Nothing wrong with the wire at all but suspect the router being a cheap old style doesnt push the data wired or wireless as well as a higher end router would but still get video fine either way but better and more reliable with cat5 cable.
1,Would not transmit a signal. Returned.
1,I ordered a 50' cable and received a 25' cable. The box even had 50' on the side. False advertising
4,Need to connect my laptop to the router in the living. Overall product is pretty good. One little complaint is the Ethernet cable looks shorter than 50ft even tho I brought a 50ft cable. Might actually be 40ft like some of the reviewers stated previously.
1,NOT IN WALL RATED. Had tear it all out !
1,posted 5 stars for awhile but just today less than 6 months and it doesnt work....like why...kind of useless buy
1,It was very cheap looking. The outer jacket separated from the plugs while installing the cable. NO I DIDN'T YANK ON THE PLUGS.
1,does not work must have a broken internal connect\tion
1,This worked for 6 months then stopped connecting my internet. Don't buy this
1,DOA
1,Didn't even work.. want my money back you can keep the cable
1,Recieved defective cable.
1,Garbage quality does not even work.
1,Wish I could return this! Constant drop outs!
1,Don't let a rescue dog destroy your stuff but it actually works fine
1,ordered 2 cables and both are bad
1,Ran this cable above my basement ceiling. Went bad in 2 months. Cant send it back. Waste of money. Stay clear of the cable.
1,stopped working after a couple months
1,Frays very easily.
1,it is blue and plugs from one end into my computer and the other end plugs into an ethernet connection.
1,Cheap quality... Surprised by good reviews.....
1,the cord was so thin and flimsy. no strength. broke within a week
1,Did not work when I got it.
1,DOA but able to repair.  Wires seem thinner than in normal cat 5e cable.
5,My wireless internet service with the router supplied by my cable company is far slower than advertised and frequently drops. I bought this cable and problem solved. A high quality cable at a great price. 50' was far longer than I needed but I will have the added length if necessary in the future.
4,I would buy this product again for its intended purpose. I was attracted to this product due to the incredible price. I was unsure if the copper wires were twisted or solid core until I got the cable. My wiring project required me to cut the cable in half and put an end on the cut parts. Buying this product and cutting it was cheaper than buying two smaller cables. Anyhow the copper wires are braided which is a huge pain to put ends on! I would not buy it again if I needed to put ends on. If you are not looking to put your own ends on this product is for you!
5,Excellent build fast consistent speeds. Ran this cable through my attic and dropped it down into one of the bedrooms at the back of the house and its as fast as if it were plugged in right next to my router with a 3 ft cable
1,Didnt work
1,can't use it it is broken
1,Signal degradation the network speed decreases over this cable
4,Well made in structure and looks just like photo.  I love these cables.  Durable and very strong.
1,Stopped working!! Very brittle plastic..
5,I’m not a gamer so I do not know
1,This s*** broke first day
1,i dont know what this is
1,Waste of money.
5,Thank you!
1,it didn't work at all
4,Does what is was meant to do.
5,I needed a high quality cable for my surveillance  camera deck to be connected to the internet and this is definitely high quality. In fact  I've just ordered another one because my husband's old laptop can't connect with wifi  he needs an ethernet cable.
1,Cable was only 30' long.
5,Cable works perfectly no problems.  But did anyone else's cable arrive with a strange odor to it?  Mine almost smelled like stale tobacco.  I hit it with Febreeze and that knocked the smell down a bit.  Weird.
5,My XBOX360 would not properly connect wirelessly due to some XFINITY setting that Comcast nor I could fix. This cable allows my XBOX to attain a solid connection to my router that provides lag free gaming always on and super fast Xbox live connection.  This cable is perfect for a router that is in a different room or floor of your house.
1,Did not work as expected
5,Just got around to installing this up in my attic a few months ago after buying it a year ago. Works great. no problems. getting expected speeds. A+ great price was expecting poor product since the price was so great instead was pleasantly suprised with a premium product at low price. A+
5,Might be a coincidence but using this and getting wi-fi out of my house ended my visits to the chiropractor after several years of neck pain.  More people should try Ethernet Cable connections to see if they feel better!
5,Gets the job doneBought it for my PS4 cause wifi was laggy and kept getting kicked offAnd now wired my speeds are over 100mbps and runs perfect
5,Excellent price for the length compared to what Best Buy had for sale. The blue color helps it stand out. Have no issues with it.
5,My son used this from the router to his TV - improved his streaming ability and internet usage on his laptop.
5,I use this for my Xbox 360 and it works perfectly! Hooks right from the internet router to the Xbox and no problems at all!
5,Cheaper then getting a cable at a store and mediabridge is a good brand. Just stop looking and get this if you want to hook your computer up via ethernet instead of wifi and the router is <50 feet away.
5,Perfectly working Ethernet cable. Does the job.
4,It's a network cable. It works as advertised.
5,Decent quality cable. I recommend to everybody.
1,mine broke
5,working fine beats wi-fi on a desktop computer
1,Did not work
5,Works perfect. I have had one for two years and it works perfectly so I bought another one for another computer although now it's about $4 more than it was in 2015.
5,Perfect! I haven't got any problems...
5,It works
5,good quality and fun to use.
5,the 100' worked 30 well I bought 50'. I'm glad I did. they work great for me. I use them to test segments of the network.
5,Great quality!!
5,Just as described. I placed the order Friday evening and it arrived Sunday morning.
1,Doesn't work.
5,Works and has nice so did ends on it
5,Cheaper than anything you can find in a store and works great
5,Great
5,Works great. No problem with it.
5,Use it on my ps4 since the last update disabled its wifi capabilities and it works great.
5,works well
5,I am happy with this product  will buy more in the future.
5,Function OK. Fast delivery
5,I DID order two I did not have a use for the second one until now thankful I purchased it at a great price.MAHALO.
5,Very fast reliable I was getting around 20mbs on my wifi and plugged this baby up to get a constant 90mbs. 10/10 would buy again.
5,Good cords
5,Works perfectly and the size is something I really needed considering my router and TV aren't that close to each other. This came in handy!
5,Haven't had the cable but for 1 month and so far all is working perfectly. I bought these after searching Amazon for a cheaper alternative to what was available at retail stores. I found other cheaper cables for sale but went with these because they are pretty low price and seemed to have good reviews. Happy with my choice here. I actually bought two in case they were low quality and that way I'd have a backup in case the first one broke. Well the first one is working just fine so now I have an extra cable. Sweet!I actually used it to run from my router under the floor through a crawlspace and to a TV in another room. I figured the plastic around the connection might break when shoving the cable through the little holes I drilled in the floor but all I did was wrap it in electrical tape and had no issues. The TV was previously connecting wirelessly but now with this wired connection it loads up my Netflix way faster. This was seriously a steal compared to the $30 + it would have cost for this cable in retail store.
5,Great cable it does its job. Nother than that it connects to my power line adapter Duh.
5,This was a great cable and came exactly as described. I wish my dog didn't chew through it....
5,Great price for the product. These are relatively cheap products (in terms of cost to buy/build not quality) and some places ask a ridiculously high price. This was super affordable and works perfectly.
5,great cable quick delivery.  Bought for my dad looks just like the quality we have at work!
5,Price is low but works great.  Can't complain.
1,Didn't work
5,Love it. Lot's of cable neatly packed in a small box. Has a Velcro tie off to keep extra cable neat.Appears to be sturdy quality and great length for the price. Would recommend.
5,The cable tested good on all lines so it should work fine.  Nice color too.  Good value as far as I was concerned.
1,Returned...defective!
5,Very fast delivery great quality if I need more cat 5 I will get it from you guys Thank you
5,I've had one of these for years. Even cut it up into smaller ones (I have the tools). So when my daughter wanted a long cable I knew exactly what to buy - again.
5,This is a great product.
5,Shop/Buy from Mediabridge for great deals awesome service and premium products.
5,Love it. Fits everywhere I need a the speed is fast

5,Always the best works and works
5,works great I got what I ordered and got it on time. Great product.
5,good cable and long
1,Does not work
5,One of the best deals on the market. The cable itself is highly affordable but does not sacrifice durability or construction. The length of the cable is generous and perfect for those with laptops who may need to move from room to room.
5,Great cable at a great price. No complaints.
5,Use for my smart tv and works so much faster than built in wifi receiver
1,it didn't work.

5,Great product
5,Thanks It worked well.
5,Works great!
5,Exactly as required.  I'm so glad you guys make cables in the longer lengths.
5,I purchased this cable to connect my Panasonic DMP-BDT220P WiFi blue-ray player. The Blue-Ray player has built in WiFi but I only got 3 bars sometimes 2 bars since router WRT160N V3 is on second floor & player is on 1st floor.Connecting cable is super easy just click in to router/playeronce I figured out how to register my blue-ray player to my Amazon account the movies were flying I have now watched 6 movies that take 10-20 seconds to check connection & start downloading and I have yet to notice any buffering/slow down/interruptions. I do not use my desktop/laptop/printer when watching/downloading movies so that helps but other use VOIP telephone & still no interruptions.It was only $10 better than buying a new router & hassle of connecting router so BUY IT!!!!!!
5,It did make my desktop work faster the Internet speed was very good.
5,Great item that serves its function really well. I expected a very long cable when I bought this and that's exactly what I got. Great for video gaming college dorms or just connecting two polar ends of a home.Fun Fact: the clear piece that goes into the computer's Ethernet port lights up when a steady connections is sustained. It looks really cool and its super handy!
5,They seem to do what they were designed to do
5,Great product.
5,Great quality cable and for the price was a no brainer.
5,I have a very old xbox that needs a Ethernet cable that runs from the internet box to my xbox so I ordered this so it's long enough to reach my room so i have had it for about a week and it works perfect and no problems.
5,Got here fast headphones sound great and seem pretty sturdy.
5,works great great length just what i needed
5,It's very reliable because it's long enough and it locks itself nicely plugged.
5,Good quality and prompt shipping
5,Excellent cable perfect packaging.
5,Works perfectly for conecting my Directv to my router....much better than trying to go wireless!
5,Very nice quality Ethernet Cable!! For 50ft it is at a very nice price sticker.
5,No problems
5,Cords were great for the price. So much better than going to the store especially since it was two day shipping with Prime. I bought 4 of these cords and have them running all throughout my dorm room and they are durable fast and worth it.
5,good
5,Cheap and does what it says.
5,We used this to strengthen the signal for our Smart TV -- with just Wi-Fi it would drop the connection now we no longer have that problem as it is wired directly now. Fast delivery and works as advertised.  Would recommend.
5,This makes the third cable I've bought by MediaBridge. All of them are perfect. Good product at a good price. What more can you say?
5,Very good enthrrnet cable! Love it
5,Fast shipping.. works great. The wireless on our modem is terrible.. This is long enough to connect to my laptop. Much better bandwidth!
5,Huge cable cheap price works great!
5,Great product
5,Fine product. Purchased so that I could add an additional router in a distant room. Works perfectly.
5,Woo surprised is really good exactly what I need fit perfectly my  needed
5,A good quality cable at a good price.  I definitely would buy again.
5,Item was as described and appeared to be of good quality.
5,Came fast and is a really long ethernet cable what more can you ask for?
5,did what it was supposed to do
5,Excellent value and they work great.
5,It was at my house in 2 days. It has bin about 2 months and it still works perfect nice quality and a in general great cord to buy. I highly recommend it.
5,Does everything that a cable is suppose to do. Very high quality cable and very flexible. Highly recommended and definitely worth the price. Incredibly cheap compare to other cables.
5,Great cat5 cable. It met my expectations and works great. I was a little bit hesatant of buying this product because it did not come directly from amazon but the cable works great
5,Works the way it should.
5,Perfect  cable durable cheap long and has very easy to use finger buttons.Only thing i should have gotten a Black cord
5,Good stuff
5,I got a used one but it was barely used. Working fantastically. Long enough to connect the router to my desktop.
5,Works. Good price
5,Works flawlessly & a great bargain not to mention fast service & order processing.Can't ask for more than that highly recommend.
5,I ordered 10 of the 50ft ethernet cables. They arrived on-time and work as intended. The price was really good on these too. I would buy again if I need more networking supplies.
5,Shipped quickly great followup from company to make sure it was working out okay. You dont see that kind of customer service often these days.
3,We have not had a problem with this cable so far but it has a cheap feel to it and I am afraid it may break if plugged and unplugged often. You get what you pay for I guess.
5,If you are looking for an economical home networking solution these cables are the right ones for you. At the price I expected a flimsy shrink wrap coated cord but the product is comparable to high end products. The cable is sturdy and arrived within 2 days using standard shipping. Far exceeded all my expectations. Will use again in the future.Time of use: 4 weeks
5,Bought this for the college boy. Seems to work well so a good value for the price. More than adequate length for his dorm room.
5,works great
5,excellence
5,Awesome! Ty
5,Used these cables to hook up my ps3 to the internet for network gaming and they work good.Needed the extra length and cables are very durable and not cheap made. Highly recommendfor the price.
5,Great cable at a nice price.  Great cable at a nice price  Great cable at a nice price  Great cable at a nice price  Great cable at a nice price
5,This is just what you'd expect: it's a blue ethernet cable that's 50ft long. At around $5.50 and eligible for free shipping I'd say it's an easy choice if your looking for a 50ft ethernet cable.
4,It works. Well packaged.
3,There seems to interference and lagging of the signal with cable doesn't make any difference from use wifi as compared to this but it sturdy so that's a plus.
3,flimsy connectors
3,Works as expected and seems good quality.
3,It works.
1,This is the first and last time I will buy a cable from Mediabridge. Their products are clearly a shoddy quality and their warranty is a joke.  I've never had a Cat5 cable fail in my life but this one was dead after just over 3 months of sitting in place.  Due to being outside amazon's replacement window I had to deal with Mediabridge directly who want me to pay for shipping to send it to them with an additional 5 business days before they can guarantee a decision.
1,I got this ethernet cable in april and it only lasted me till today 12/16/2017 the cable has been going out slowly for the past 4 months which cause me slow internet speeds and now dose not even work at all i will not buy from here again or buy cat 5 for this reason.
1,I ended up buying two of these. One of them is awesome it works like a champ. Has not started to break or anything but the second one is a different cable and looks crappy doesn't even work plugged in.
1,Received the cable in good condition. Unfortunately max speed through this cable is only 88mbps!! With WiFi I can get 100mbps. Checked and double checked but the wired speed is slower than WiFi speed.
3,works ok. quality via cable was worse on one computer worked fine on the others. stuck with wireless connections anyway instead of using the cable
1,Would not work after a couple of weeks use. An older non name brand cable I had laying around still worked....very disappointed.
1,Didn't work right out of the box it actually disconnected my signal ...
1,Product is okay.Return policy is a different matter.Amazon provides a non working link  http://www.amazon.com/feedback.  for which makes one wonder...
1,Doesn't work...Not worth it.Can't return bec shipping n headache of process won't be worth for amount paid.If u r lucky u may get functional one
1,I bought two cables to work with my credit card machine. Both died within two months.
5,Great quality.  Your typical ethernet Cable fare.  Works as advertised and while I did not measure for length it appears to fit the bill. It's plenty long for my purposes.  Testing rigs and builds on a wired network cable along the same wall of a great room. the cable troubles behind furniture all the way so it's not an eyesore.
5,Purchased this cause I was having connectivity issues working from home.  Since connecting to the router those issues have gone away.  This is definitely long enough to connect to the router and my laptop but not make me feel stationary.  I intentionally purchased this in order to be able to move around.  I would recommend
5,I was having trouble with WiFi connecting in my bedroom so I decided to run a hard wired connection. This cable is well made with thick quality cable. The signal is good I am getting 600Mb internet speeds and over a gigabit on local network transfer speeds. I plan on buying more cables to run to all the devices that don't require a WiFi connection.
5,Cable works well
5,If your computer performance is slow extenders might not work.  The best thing is to get this cable and plug directly from router to your computer.  Have had no performance issues since getting this and wished I had done this much sooner.!
5,This item is totally AWESOME!! I have NOT had trouble with this item at all---There is a VERY good connection with it...
5,Product is Great.  We like your product.
5,Great cable and value for the money.
5,Works perfectly for my 100 Mbps connection. The RJ45 connectors aren't the greatest fit but this cable is an amazing value.
5,ran it to my TV now my WiFi  doesn't drop  at the TV
5,I got it for our commercial printer. It works great no issues. Definitely a quality Cat5.
5,works great
5,Great Sturdy Cables
5,Great Product.
5,works great thanks
5,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,exactly as described!
5,Great purchase! Thank you!
5,Arrived on time. Cheap and best !
5,Works perfect...Solid cable
5,It’s does the job. This is long enough to reach from one room of the house to the next room. I do not have any connection issues so I’d say this is made with great quality.
5,Works great.
5,Works for its function...
5,Worth the price.
5,This product gave us the best connection that we’ve ever had!!
5,I needed to rub a line from one from to another going through the attic. This definitely did the job.
5,I love how these offer so much length so I can game at top speeds even from 3 rooms away from the router
5,I bought this for my pc devices for my remote job and needed a longer cord to reach. Works perfectly fine no issues
1,Connectors are junk.
5,Perfect for gaming. I got this since my bedroom is a little far from the router. Works great I get perfect signal and all 100mbps im paying for. Extremely good value for the money.
5,Works very well
1,Piece of trash
5,I mostly use it for gaming and sometimes work and I never experience a crash. Partially because of my modem but also thanks to this cable
5,We like it very much because we’re able to use our computer with this cable. The computer table is far from the internet provision so this one helped a lot. The price is also very reasonable. Very happy with the purchase.
5,my ps5 will never disconnect again and this ethernet cable even came with a cable managememt little velcro strip and it  fit  through 3 rooms to get to my ps5 which is impressive
5,Very fast and affordable it hasn't given up on me yet so 5 star for durability5 star for speedAnd 5 star for letting me run modded minecraft
5,perfected quality works as it should. quick shipping
5,Quick delivery
5,Needed to be directly wired Into my router in a different room and it is working very well!
5,It's fine. Would prefer to purchase these pre-made rather than build my own.Would buy again.
5,It's a great product but I had to returned it it wasn't the correct cable eathernet. However I do recommend for the price value.
5,I seem to get a very good Wi-Fi signal I don't know about gaming I'm not a gamer but I do a lot of zoom meetings and it seems to be fine
5,Works for my Xbox
5,I am getting over 600mbs internet through this cable connected to the internet!
5,Value for money
5,Must have If you’re into technology with this court as long as it is you can travel at any room in your house without making holes in the walls
5,Perfect size
5,Works perfect
5,Works good like I expect it too
5,Perfect length for in home office. Speed excellent.
5,I ordered 4 of these cables because I needed to rewire my entire office to accompany my new router. Cables pulled easily with no kinks. Highly recommend!
5,Perfect length to do exactly what I needed it to do. Ethernet is faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi.  Most certainly suits my needs.
5,On WiFi my Xbox connection gets 30mbps on the download.  I plugged this Ethernet into the back of my Xbox and into my NETGEAR Switcher and I’m getting over 900mbps on the download 200mbps on the upload.  No more moderate connection for me!
5,I needed this for my work from home job
3,Dislike having to additionally purchase a phone line adapter.
5,Needed the length. Wish it was black
5,Great savings also very easy to order and great response time.

5,Nice ethernet cables and very good price.  Work nicely for gaming.
5,works great
5,Works like it should. 50ft piece and i get every bit of my 100meg charter internet. Was easy to run and didn't  tangle up.
5,great value
5,Just what I needed.
5,Works very well
5,Perfect to connect internet direct for gaming and streaming instead of WI FI connection
5,Have had this for a couple of years now and it hasn't failed me yet. Using it to run into my PS4.
5,Good product
5,just what one would expect from a good quality network cable.
5,It’s a network cable. It works exactly like I expected it should. No manufacturing issues. I’ll probably forget all about it being where it is in years to come.Bought it specifically to replace a cable that was in place for over 15 years and that one got ate by a vacuum cleaner.
