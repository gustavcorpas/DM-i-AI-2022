5,Excellent sound best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned.Reordering a new one already since I had everything outside and got a heavy downpour for half hour and destroyed it. I assumed the downpour destroyed it but in fact it still works which is amazing!
4,Great sound easy to use.
3,I did not like it such low in base so small however but there other types available that have better output . Am returning
4,Great product and good battery life
4,I work as an unloader at UPS & this speaker can hook into the snake holes or safety strap bracketing in the truck.  Of course I manage to keep it clear of falling walls but I do move it from panel to panel as I get deeper in the truck because you won't hear the sound to well keeping it hooked at the entrance of the truck. However the sound quality does suffice if you move it from panel to panel at your discretion. For such a small speaker it has great sound & suffices for the work day. Make sure you charge it nightly. I hook it up to a computer or laptop to charge & if you'redesperate you can charge in the car with an android charger head but I just bring the charger line it comes with with me in the car incase I forget to charge it at home. It usually last a couple hours with minimal quick car charging.
3,This product is very small; and the sound quality was very low no bass boost at all as advertised. You have to inspect the product thoroughly in order to find the charging ports and power buttons they are cleverly hidden and there are no instructions inside of the packaging.Respectfully
4,Bluetooth is okay although could be a bit louder. It should've out volume my phone by far but it doesn't. The radio disappoints me the most for this was why I bought the item. Very few stations with frying sounds even USB connected.
5,I bought this for when we go to the pool and beach this summer. It is the perfect size because it‚Äôs small enough not to take up too much space but it gives a lot of sound! It even has a clip so I can hang it from my bag if I need to.  The best part is it waterproof so I don‚Äôt have to be worried with it around my kids while they are splashing each other. The battery also holds a charge for a long time which is a huge plus. Great buy!
5,The speakers are small but do not let the size be a deterrent to get them! It is loud!! It is honestly great!!! And the price is not bad at all!Edit to add: took it to the beach today and it was awesome!! It still has battery left in it after a few hours!!
5,This little speaker is loud for its size. Perfect for my electric bicycle.
5,Just what I expected. Works good.I bought it for running around on my bicycle cause I don't like earphones it's loud enough to hear  in traffic also has more bass than my phone (bigger speaker). A nice plus is a small carabine enclosed so you can hang it anywhere
3,The speaker is super quiet
4,Sound at 40' full volume good sound. Mid drops out a little bass more than a little. Vocals pretty good. Close to 15'volume half nice balance of sound. Really could use a bass boost but it is what it is. Have a tzumi aquaboost so I know what I was expecting and am really satisfied with purchase. Will be used poolside smoking/grilling beach. Like the demention's as it fits my backpacks better than my aquaboost. Also more adaptable for different media.
5,I got this to use outside for my work. I work at a preschool. This it perfect to put on one side of the playground to play music for everyone! And in this heat it worked well during water play! Highly recommend especially for the price!
5,We got this for our beach days and it‚Äôs been great! Small enough to not add extra bill or weight to our beach bag but loud enough to keep us grooving. Good little speaker!
3,Es mucho m√°s peque√±a de lo que esta en la foto que decepci√≥n
4,Is good product for a good price
2,Battery life seems to be good. Sound quality is okay but this Bluetooth speaker is no louder than your phone itself. Volume all the way up on device and phone is the same as phone but a lower tone. I would not but again and now ordering a much better speaker that I can actually hear!! 2 stars at best.
4,I thought it was supposed to be bigger
5,I had bought this cool multi purpose speaker to pack in my vest and take with me when fishing or kayaking.  I would go kayaking or trolling fishing and did not want earbuds or headphones that could drop in the water. Since spring weather was beautiful and the virus gave me a break from work I have been using this speaker often and have been very impressed!  Bluetooth connects quickly with a clear audio connection with no stutter or static during my trips.  Several of my at home Bluetooth devices breaks up after walking about 25 feet or less away.  I am been satisfied with the phone operations so I don‚Äôt have to fiddle with my phone in it‚Äôs waterproof pouch when connected to the speaker.  I am unable to speak to the tf or micro sd card function since I do not have file based mp3 s.
4,Update: there was something faulty with the on/off switch with my initial speaker. It‚Äôs been a little over a month now since they sent me a new one. It has worked great! They sent a replacement right away and provided free shipment to send the other one back. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the replacement. Sound is good and I like that it has a FM radio option. Perfect for the beach‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThere were many great reviews for this little guy and I purchased him. He worked once with great sound and after shutting it off and charging it and coming back to it later it will not work now. It will not turn on charge or anything. Do not waste your money buying this item.
5,I‚Äôve had this little speaker for a while now and I use it all the time. It‚Äôs so easy to use has an awesome battery life and the sound is pretty good considering it‚Äôs small and not fancy. I use it a lot to listen to podcasts when I clean and I carry it around the house with me to the different rooms I go in. I also take it camping or to the beach with me so I can listen to music. It holds a charge and powers off on its own to preserve battery once it detects that it‚Äôs on but not in use. The value is great I‚Äôm so glad I bought it! I was fed expecting something that would crap out pretty quickly because of the price but it‚Äôs held up big time! 10/10 recommend
4,Very cute bluetooth and it most deff arrived alot soonee then what i expected. A review that i had read before i purchased the bluetooth said that the volume was great ans sounded like a bose system lol that was deff off by alot! It most deff could be alot more louder and take a charge alot quicker. When it does arrive in the package it was completely dead.
5,Well worth it for being small and inexpensive I have had nothing but great luck with this. The sound is good it's compact and easy to take hiking or kayaking waterproof and the battery actually lasts. Great buy!
5,Love this little speaker did by the pool. Small and portable with great sound quality! Waterproof is an extra bonus! Def a good buy!
3,Sound was lower than my phone smh
3,It's good for the price! The sound is decent I thought it'd be louder though. I plan to use this at work and with all the machines running and having to work ear-plugs too I don't think I'd hear it very well üòî . I'll have to buy a bigger one next time .Gave it 3 stars because the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è" (play and pause button) does NOT work . That sucks üò¢
5,It‚Äôs a good speaker
5,Came in protected had a air bag inside of packaging in amazon box and speaker package inside amazon box is well adjusted to not move out of place with air bag by its side. Small speaker but has a really good sound quality. At first it sounded really scattery with music playing and sound affect sounded really poor and low but once when i went to my settings on my phone and messed with my sound and quality effect to jazz and change the surrounding effect as well to wide effect it really made a huge difference to the muic playing on the speaker the music sounded really GOOD after that! I recommend to try if you have a issue on the way it sounds the first time you give it a go. Its a five star for me! Haven't tryed getting it wet yet but it's pleasing to know it's waterproof if a accident ever happens! Worth paying for thank you for good service!!!
2,Waste of time
5,I wanted a small cheap speaker to throw in our pool bag. This has been working out perfectly. The battery life is great we‚Äôve used it multiple times at the pool already and have not had to recharge it yet. It actually has a great volume we have only had to turn it up to about 50% for our needs. We usually put it on the side of the pool and it has been splashed multiple times and seems to be fine. All in all great little speaker for the money. I would definitely recommend this if your looking for something inexpensive to take near the water.
5,I bought this product because I needed a speaker on my desk to better listen to my audios through Bluetooth with my personal phone naturally the phones do not have as much volume and this speaker is essential it is of very good quality because I tested it in water and It worked perfectly the sound is very sharp it is made of a very resistant material its size is suitable I wear it for more than 8 continuous hours and the battery did not run out the buttons are very comfortable to use the battery charges fast  the hook fits well anywhere and the AUX cable is made of very good material. It is just what I needed and at an incredible price I feel very lucky to have obtained this product I recommend it for its quality.
4,easy to work bluetooth mode plus the volume is very low so I returned the box very small it was easy to move the box I had no difficulties with it and it came well packed. I don't know if it's water resistant because when I saw the volume I gave it back
5,Love how easy it is to move this speaker around with me especially as I work out sometimes in the backyard or different rooms in the house. Sound quality is excellent and the range is good too.
5,Great little speaker fir the price. Good sound and volume. Perfect for walking especially with the clip.  Super fast delivery!
3,This bluetooth speaker is well made and sturdy. The ports have silicone covers to prevent moisture from getting inside the housing. The only thing I would've improved is the volume I'd like 5-10% more.
5,It‚Äôs actually a lot smaller than I thought which is awesome. Easy to take with me everywhere and the sound quality is really good for the speaker size.
5,I bought this with intentions on being a bathroom speaker. The sound is clear enough and loud enough.  But again. It's just for a bathroom speaker. Also easy to use. Connected fast to the Samsung and iPhone.
4,Speaker is great value. Bought to play audiobooks on a USB flash drive for a sight-impaired person. Audiobooks played fine (named so they would play sequentially)  - the gotcha was the unit would go to sleep and the on-off switch was too close to the USB so didn't work for the individual.  Sleep mode activated (standby) even if plugged in with no audio playing - needs to be playing. Otherwise a lot for the money. Sound quality is 'meh'' on MP3 music but definitely listenable.
3,A convenient little speaker but takes time to connect to my phone and the sound is very quiet. Bought to listen to podcasts while I shower & get ready for work so I use it about an hour a day and can't speak for the battery life. Will probably work for listening to the music but not podcasts or audiobooks which is what I mostly listen to.
5,This is little but mighty! Love that I can use a cord or Bluetooth option!
1,Don‚Äôt just run away too many times Amazon has items are sold that have other reviews hidden that don‚Äôt work would not charge. After I came back to try to get it returned I found out there is a whole bunch of other reviews reviews saying the same thing it won‚Äôt charge you can‚Äôt recharge it I tried a different cord than the one it came with and I try different cubes nope
5,This a great little Bluetooth speaker. Easy to connect. Great sound. Plenty of volume. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Surprise surprise I did not know it had a radio when I bought it and when I read the Manuel it surprised me when it said it has a radio. Now I'm able to listen to my fav station 98.7 and hip hop back in the day.
3,The volume isn't very loud.
5,I absolutely love my Bluetooth speaker! Has great sounds! Long battery life! Perfect size for traveling!
5,I was really impressed with this speaker. Works great and sounds good for the size! Easy to take along anywhere! Love it!
3,good for the price. it‚Äôs not very loud compared to other speakers but it gets loud enough for like a shower or just to chill in your room which is what i only use it for. it‚Äôs a good size (picture reference) .. battery lasts long too. only thing i don‚Äôt like is that the hearing qualify is kinda shit  sounds like it fell in water or something but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected when you buy a speaker for under $20.
5,This little speaker is fairly loud for what it costs! Great for traveling
4,had trouble with shaver at first didn't cut . but e-mailed support service and they replaced the shaver with a new one. new one works awesome nice close smooth shave.
3,it's OK but for the sound is not as clear and volume is not as loud as I expected.
3,This is a decent quality Bluetooth speaker for the price.....it's good for playing at lower volumes but does not have a lot of punch.It's actually pretty small small than I expected but that's okay I just wanted this to be able to listen to the TV at lower volume when I didn't want to use my surround sound system. .
1,Bought this pos. Charge port broke and fell inside the speaker the third time I charged it. I threw it in a trash receptacle where it belongs. My beats pill lasted ten years. My Bose is ten years old. Still awesome. This isn‚Äôt worth buying
4,I like it... Its a really nice speaker but it's not very waterproof maybe water resistant but not waterproof.
4,It was a perfect speaker for listening to music or audiobooks in the shower. Clear sound volume goes more than high enough and buttons work to change track or volume. Just be careful you hold button long enough when changing volume since it's also the next track button. I only used it for showers and went weeks between recharges. Still battery stopped charging less than a year after I got it and won't stay on even while plugged in.
5,Sound is decent. It's not big but it's worth the price.
4,i love this little speaker! it‚Äôs about the size of my middle finger down to the middle of my palm and its super portable. the sound quality could be better but you do get what you pay for. it has lasted 3 months now and i‚Äôve dropped it a couple times too but its fine!
3,Quisiera no tener que escribir esta rese√±a pues esperaba algo mejor en cuanto a sonido se refiere se ha quedado corto muy poco volumen y si intento llevarlo al m√°ximo comienza a distorsionar creo que hay productos mas c√≥modos con mejor calidad.Actualizaci√≥n.No ha pasado mucho tiempo desde que lo compre y ya no funciona bien parece que se da√±aron los parlantes porque suena horrible distorsi√≥n en los bajo como si estuvieran rotos
3,It is incredible how inexpensive this speaker is and I guess it‚Äôs not too bad considering the price. But don‚Äôt expect this to sound like a $100 Bluetooth speaker. It does not get very loud at all and has very little depth or bass to the sound. I also don‚Äôt like that the power switch located under a rubber cover. I don‚Äôt want to have to open a cover to turn on the unit. I will say that the battery life seems to be pretty good. I also like that it comes with a caribiner clip which is handy for hanging the speaker from various places. At this price it is hard to complain too much. Just don‚Äôt expect much in the way of volume or sound quality.
1,It‚Äôs not a speaker it‚Äôs a Tin Box. Blue tooth brakes up and stopped working after 2 days. Didn‚Äôt have it in /for water. So I don‚Äôt know about water resistance. Thank You Mary
5,I like this little unit. I can keep it plugged in while I'm using it so the battery doesn't run down and the sound quality is great. Living in a camper with my dogs after Hurricane Michael and my only source of entertainment is my computer which I couldn't hear over the air conditioner.....until I got this speaker. I just move the speaker to where I am and I can hear very clearly. Very nice product!
1,Went to charge it initially and it was not the best connection but didn't think much of it.  Went to charge it a second time and the  order and connection spot broke.  However it was definitely waterproof and the original charged lasted a very long time.
5,Nice quality for the price and has great sound! Better than I expected!
5,I was super nervous about receiving this speaker at first because it was cheaper than my last and cheap products in general make me nervous. But it‚Äôs absolutely amazing justLike my old speaker. 10/10 would recommend xD
4,The sound quality was pretty well I like the color and I like it was  small yet still loud.
5,I bought this to take with me as I do yard and mechanical maintenance around the house and so far I‚Äôve been very impressed! I recently had to work on my mower that broke down 120-130‚Äô from my garage and I realized as I walked back and forth from the garage to the mower the Bluetooth never broke connection while the phone was in my pocket and the speaker on the mower deck. Most Bluetooth breaks up within a few yards. I am really happy with this little unit so far and the bonus feature of having FM was a nice touch! Fantastic buy
5,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Easy to use light weight and great sound. It does say it is not 100 % water proof.  There is a flap that creates a seal but water could get in it so do not submerge it into water.
4,It is great for what I needed it for.  Have a bad speaker on my tablet.  Sound is clear and loud enough for me.
1,I recommend that you DO NOT BUY THIS it will break after 2-3 weeks it is a poor product design!
4,Works as expected
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I dont usually leave reviews but this speakers were so disapointing that I just couldnt.Just receiving the package and first thing I noticed is that the box is in really bad shape and ripped as if it was dropped. Decided to test the speakers so first I let them charge till they are 100% then I went to turn it ON and nothing happens. Nothing I tried seems to work... till I decide to conect the cable it came with and when I disconnected it speaker magically enter in pair mode.So let me explain better this is as usefull as a car without a key. In order to make the speakers work you have to connect a cable and then disconnet so they will turn ON.Also have in mind this speakers can use an AUX port but u need a cable that goes from AUX to micro USB.Overall very bad speakers and Im not able to return them as I live in other country and doesnt wanna spent any other cent to deal with this thing
1,This speaker gets no louder than an iPhone speaker and has even worse audio quality it's so quiet that it needs to be turned to 100% to hear it correctly even a few feet away. The sound quality is horrible it lacks any bass but somehow the mids are so mushed together that vocal lines are not clear at all. I am no audio expert in any capacity but even laptop speakers are better than this.My previous $10 Wal-Mart speaker was loads better than this I am shocked by how many good reviews there are of this product considering how bad it actually is. It's size and water protection are the only redeeming factors of this speaker I do not recommend.
5,Will be great for small parties or tailgates as it has great volume but is compact! I currently use it in the bathroom and it works great- loud enough to hear over the water and don't have to worry about it getting wet accidentally!
5,First off this speaker is much smaller than I expected! Fits in the palm of my hand. In my case this is a great thing - it doesn't take up space in my tiny bathroom and I can carry it around the house with me as I get ready in the morning. I like to listen to the news while I get ready but just the phone speaker was never loud enough to hear over the shower. This little guy has great volume and solves the problem! Can't speak to battery life yet but I was happy that it came charged and ready to use.
3,Se escucha bien para el tama√±o q tiene
4,kayak fishing use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†It‚Äôs such a great speaker. About 8 hours of battery life.This one has a way warmer sound. The bass is there tight and clean the mids are not muffled and the highs are not forced or piercing being on a realistic side. As I said in the beginning the overall sound is very pleasant. Also this small thing can be loud without any distortion.
5,I work in a manufacturing plant with a lot of dust this speaker works well for sound as I can carry it on my work gear for sound. My surrounding drown out the best attempt of the phone speaker to be heard. I am very happy with it.
5,I have been looking for a speaker that I can use in the shower! Also I know my kids are going to use this Bluetooth Wireless Speaker a lot outside this summer! Great for the price!
5,This is a great little speaker with nice quality sound.  I use it when kayaking and it's gotten splashed a lot with water without any problems so far.  I can't speak for the battery life as of yet because I've only used it about 2 hours at a time. I'd definitely recommend this speaker!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I love this speaker. It works better than the dongle I bought for my car. There is no beeping when there is no sound going to the speaker (which I love). I also LOVE that there is a power switch on the speaker. But my favorite thing her her voice lol. Idk what kind of accent she‚Äôs got but I love ‚Äúsuccessfulaay‚Äù (see video). It‚Äôs a tad smaller than I would‚Äôve liked but the price is right and the quality is worth more than what you‚Äôll pay. It‚Äôs a good purchase for sure.
3,I was disappointed in the sound and volume - if listening to it low it will be great but I want it louder. I could not figure out any way to make it louder beyond just turning my iPod up all the way and that was not enough.
5,Reading a lot of reviews wanting to find a decent speaker for decent price I purchased this item. I used this speaker maybe 6-7 times and now it‚Äôs sound is no louder than my phone. Seems like it‚Äôs not a uncommon problem. And my return time has conveniently passed.Point of the story read the negative reviews before purchasing. This item was a piece of junk. Hard to believe so many have had success with it. Suspicious.
5,I have been impressed with the product so far. It has good sound quality.
2,Worked well for about a year occasional use nothing super wet/rough - until some water got in the compartment where the on/off switch is and now it won't turn on.
4,The sound is good
5,I purchased this to work with my iPad so that I can watch TV outside while using the hot tub.  I would not be able to hear the if not for the speaker. It syncs immediately and works great.
5,The speaker that fits in your hand but carries a punch!This is exactly what I was looking for...something that I could take with me wherever I needed to go and that was durable and sounded great.Whether working out in the garage  jumping in the shower or taking this to work these speakers do the trick.Best part of all it didn't cost a small fortune either.I'm very happy with my purchase!  Thank you!
1,Era para mi sal√≥n de clase pero no se oye volumen muy bajo üòí
4,Perfect for river trips. Small with great sound.
5,Great speaker and great customer service! Worked really well for close to a year and then stopped working- contacted the seller and they are sending a new product! Really impressed!
3,The speaker itself is not bad at all I was just let down because of the size. In the pictures it looked pretty decent sized but when I opened I was let down definitely would like a refund.
5,I absolutely love this speaker!!! Its perfect for travel  where you don't want to pack anything to bulky or heavy or on quick trips that may have water involved. The sound  quality is amazing for its size and the waterproofing is a bonus given its price point!!
4,It gives my modest Android a phenomenal sound when I stream or use my downloaded songs outside or inside üòò
5,Added a TF card and now the speaker is used frequently for hikes in the woods where I don't want to risk running down the phone battery.
4,A lot smaller than expected.
5,The sound quality is great. It's small and lightweight. I haven't tried the waterproof quality yet. Really great product.
4,Great speaker for the shower. Speaker works great up close just don't expect it to provide music for e everyone at a pool to enjoy.
3,It was good sound and good battery just your average functioning speaker. Very easy to break. The speaker broke working two weeks from the charging port. Tried to connect the charging cable and the whole port broke inside the speaker. Now it is in the trash.
5,Encantado porque puedo usarlo muy cerca la piscina y escuchar mi musica con buen volumen
4,It is small l compact and it looks nice. The sound its not so great but i think it worth the money that i gave on it. For a small room is good.
4,the plastic falls al the time
1,A
1,Way smaller than I expected
2,Poor sound clip isn't large enough.
4,I like it ok.
4,Nice according to price.  It's pretty easy for  carry anywhere.
3,Too small
3,It works.
1,This speaker was really nice the sound was good and the ease of connecting to a device was nice but it will not charge I used the cord it came with and nothing I used other cords still nothing. If you‚Äôre looking for a one and done kind of speaker this one is for you but I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money on this product.
5,Great sound holds a charge for a long time quick charge. It hasn‚Äôt been in water so I‚Äôm unsure of how water resistant it is.
5,I have been looking for a small speaker (waterproof) to go in my shower!! So glad I bought this one. It‚Äôs just the right size and the sound is so clear. I like the long battery life too.
5,Works great! It's perfect for using during yard work and being water resistant is nice. The sound is pretty decent and the volume reaches out!
3,The sound is extremely garbled/muffled sounding and the extra bass it claims in the title is almost nonexistent. While the volume is louder than listening to music through my phone the sound quality is drastically reduced by doing so. You get what you pay for lesson learned.
5,I got this because my kids broke my old one in the drop this one and it still works fine I haven‚Äôt tried it in water yet
5,This is a strong little speaker especially for the price! I was easily able to set it up and I love that I can choose between bluetooth and aux connection. It's a minor feature but the physical on/off switch is great. Most modern devices don't have that anymore and make you fiddle with buttons to turn it off.
5,This might be small but it has great sound quality I use it to listen to music in the bathroom and it‚Äôs great. I have a small bathroom and this is perfect with the keychain I can hook it on the shower curtain and listen to great music. Water does get on it but so far so good I haven‚Äôt had any problems with it. I love it!
3,Cheap. Not that great. Sound quality mediocre.  Not partuclarlt enjoyable. Like i said you get what you pay for.
5,I like the overall quality of the speaker. I do think that the volume sound could be better to hear in a slightly noisy environment. Otherwise I like the overall performance.
5,For the money you can't go wrong. Have not drop it in the lake yet so I don't know the water resistance part. Sound is ok battery life is about 1 1/2 to two hours.
4,Dont let the size fool you high quality sound from this little speaker. The SD card slot is a great feature when not using the bluetooth.
5,Great little Bluetooth speaker!  Sounds loud and clear.  Once paired connects to my iPhone every time I turn it on!  I take the speaker out by the pool and leave the phone next to the house in the shade.  I can hear the music loud over the rushing water from the waterfall.  I recommend this Bluetooth waterproof speaker.
5,I like this small speaker. It packs a nice punch in sound. It light weight and the battery life is long for volume levels of mid to low. The rubber has a nice feel to it. But if falls short it have it stick on the table if you bump in to it. The waterproof case is a nice addition which I like to have on any speaker.
4,It's okay I guess. It's really not much louder than my phone to be honest. I thought it would be louder. Kind of disappointed.
3,Para el precio muy bien todo me gusto lo √∫nico ke dec√≠a con Aux y no tiene de echo viene con el cable para el Aux pero no tiene pero de ah√≠ todo perfecto üëå
2,Product volume was no louder than a cell phone. Useless unless you want to store your phone away in waterproof environment. Would be great if the volume was higher.
4,I thought it was a bit bigger. It's small.but ok thank you.
5,Connects well but I tried to answer a call and there were issues. I didn't buy it for calls so other than that I'm happy.
5,Though I have only used this device with my phone/Pandora it seems to work great. I installed a "D" snap through the carrying ring and clip it on the handlebars of my bicycle and listen to music as I ride. I ride sometimes several hours at a time and only have charged the battery once.
2,The speaker sounds very shrill and all you can hear is static. I never used it more than once. When paired watching a movie the sound vs the mouths moving on the screen were delayed. Happened with more than one movie. Not a great product.
5,Really liked the speaker. But the aux mode connection gets loose and can't use it. Want to contact seller to find out how to fix problem.
5,I really like this speaker. It is small - only about the size of your hand but it has pretty good sound. The quality is not amazing but for the size it is very good. I use it when I project a movie.
5,Good unit for the price
4,Pretty easy to carry and use just wish the volume went a ;lttle louder.
5,If youre looking for a speaker you can bring anywhere (i mean literally everywhere because its waterproof) then this one suits you. Came with a very neat packaging its compact and very handy. It sounded like a good small stereo speaker and has fm radio too. Loved it! Its a perfect gift idea
5,Was so impressed with this speaker! First of all the sound is great and it‚Äôs WATERPROOF!! It was so easy to connect to Bluetooth... I ordered this for our pontoon boat it‚Äôs easly transportable and the quality of the sound compares to my Bose high dollar speakers... need to order three more for each kid they are fighting over this one!
2,Right out the box the on/off switch was very difficult to move.  I had to use the end of a plastic pen to turn it on but the Bluetooth synced right up!  The overall sound quality was just so-so having good volume good mid-range but not much bass.  Unfortunately the switch got worse to the point that it would barely move.  Had it not been for that it would have been a nice little speaker for the money and I would have kept it.  Now I have to box it back up and take it to the shipper üòï.  Hardly seems worth the trouble.
5,Great price!
4,Clear sound. Great product for the price.Great in the shower.
5,Liked
2,El sonido es muy bajo la bateria dura poco
4,Haven‚Äôt dunked it in water but it sounds great.
5,Awesome! Left outside and it rained still works! Great battery
4,Has nice loud sound.
1,Was not loud enough.
5,It a good sound speaker for what brought
5,Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it just tonight she texted me letting me know that you love the speaker
5,Love it great quality and can be quiet or can be loud all together just a great productüëç
5,It is waterproof and small perfect for kayaking.
3,No me gusta que el celular no puede estar lejos del aparato para funcionar bien suena entre cortado. Tienes que apagar el Bluetooth si no m√°s tarde ya no funciona.
4,Was a little shocked at the size was expecting bugger.
5,Works great louder then I thought it would be
3,Not very loud.
4,I like it!!!
1,Can not recommend it paired once to my phone lost pairing and would not pair again
3,This speaker is just ok. Not loud enough for me. Probably good for kids to use. No Bass.
5,Is small is compact it's loud but I haven't tried it in the water or the shower or in the rain or snow but I will.
4,Works like I thought it should.
5,Happy happy!! Showed up a day n a half early. Seems to be very durable. I'll put it to the test later when I go fishing.. lol main reason for buying it..
5,Amazing sound for such a small size. Bluetooth quick and easy to connect. Inexpensive great buy. Good battery life.
1,It stop working with in a week.
5,Cumple mis expectativas para el precio que tiene. El sonido es fenomenal. Lo √∫nico es que no es tan grande como dicen en las im√°genes.
1,Not a good product you can hardly hear it 5 feet away
1,We walk and listen to a book.  The sound volume is not much louder than the phone speakers.  Very disappointed. We accidently threw away the box and couldn't return it
5,finally got a chance to use it  setup was easy had a nice sound and small enough  to carry easily on  our equipment while we work
5,Has amazing sound and very durable and portable.
5,Purchased as a gift for my son. He loves it. Of course I'm annoyed because it's always too loud but I guess that's good sound quality.
5,This speaker was so small but gave a great sound! It's nice not to lug around a big speaker and hear clear music. I like that it has multiple ways to listen to music; radio usb or bluetooth. Great buy especially with summer picnics just around the corner!
5,Amazing sound for this little gadget! We use it outside so water resistant is a major selling point! For the price you can't go wrong!
4,The speaker does not project enough sound
5,This Bluetooth speaker has great sound!!! I was pleasantly surprised as the price was so reasonable. I purchased this speaker so we could primarily use it when we are sitting out on our patio area and it‚Äôs such a huge bonus that it is waterproof!
2,I just got my speaker today and it doesn't have great sound quality i was pretty disappointed with the product. üòï
5,Me parece excelente este producto es muy pr√°ctico con excelente sonido lo voy a utilizar para escuchar musica mientras duerma
5,Not sure if it is water resistant because I have not tried it in the water. I love that it shuts off after a period of time. I love the tiny size. Great sound. I would order again
5,I have been looking for a good quality and decent priced bluetooth speaker for our camping trips. This is ideal and perfect. Not to mention waterproof. Easy to use small enough to fit in or clip on backpack and the battery last forever!! I Love it!
5,Awesome for our camping trip this weekend. Connected easily with our devices. It‚Äôs small portable and has good sound.
5,I am satisfied with this speaker purchased to use near shower. Battery life is longer than others sound and controls are good. For price this is a good value for a small BT speaker.
4,Muy bueno
5,This thing is small but mighty. I travel a lot and I carry it with me especially nice when I want to hook it to my iPad and play movies without headphones.
5,This speaker was great! It works so well!
5,Just received today and it worked great right out of the box. Easy and fast to pair via Bluetooth powerful quality sound and love the lights and carrying handle. Would definitely recommend as it is a step above most portable Bluetooth speakers.
5,Bought for fianc√© and he loves it!
4,It could be bigger
5,This product still works and I purchased it a year ago.
5,For a little speaker the sound is great and love how compact it isvery impressed
5,Speaker seems to work well. I haven't had the opportunity to use it a lot.
5,It‚Äôs great I love it
3,The product has pretty decent battery life. Just know that if you plan to use the AUX system to play music wired it won't work.
5,Big sound in a small box! I use this speaker in the bathroom when bathing. This is great! Can't wait for Summer to use it by the pool.
1,only used once then it stopped working
5,Works perfect for me I'm not a judge of sound quality. I listen to talkin podcast not really any music. Suits my purpose very good. I didn't realize it was so small. Very convenient and loud sound
5,Not very loud goes up to ten
5,Sound is great for such a small speaker.
5,Great product
5,Just as good as the Bose bluetooth speaker more compact and great sound quality. Haven't used it near water yet.
5,Small and great sound for price.  Have taken kayaking and withstood water.
5,Absolutely loved it. Battery  lasted about 4.5 hours and sounds great. Had it during a spartan race and everyone loved it. Would definitely reccomend
4,They‚Äôre okay for the price
4,Sounds good.
5,I have an old car and this worked when I hooked it up to the echo auto and put the speaker in aux mode!
5,We use it on our patio for a little tunes will we roast marshmallow around the camp fire.  Good base back up could be louder but it works and does not bother the neighbors.
1,I opted for this speaker because of the good reviews it has. However I am very disappointed with it . I bought it to use it in my car since I don‚Äôt have an stereo on it.placed next to dash and when started playing found that the volume is very very low. I can barely hear to the music and is next to me.
4,Kinda small.
5,a small speaker for my office. This works well. Sound quality is good for me at least.
5,I really like the speaker I can bring it in the shower.
4,Awesome for our 13yo
5,Sound is loud for size. No distortions. Works as advertised. Havent used in water so i cannot comment on resistance of water. Other than that great deal on a great product! A+++++++
2,Literally died on me the third time I used it. Yes I did dunk it under water to test the water proof ness. And it didn‚Äôt survive. It did float though!
3,You get what u pay for not the greatest sound quality. But works for what i needed
5,I think it‚Äôs perfect!
5,Good sound quality and battery life. Works great.
1,Fm mode suck u only get one station
5,Great speaker.  Easy to connect.  Good sound.  Waterproof so I can use it in the shower to listen to the news.  Great price too.
5,Thank you. Good product for the money
5,muy adecuado para usar en el bano
3,Sound quality is not as good as I would like. Micro USB port is broken.
3,It was not what I expected.
1,Lasted less than two months. Became increasingly difficult to connect to Bluetooth and finally stopped altogether. Sound quality was never great boom-y and distorted. And the protective rubber cap that keeps it waterproof detached within days of getting it. Poor quality all around. Only bright spot was that it seemed to hold a charge for a long time -- but maybe that's because it was so hard to connect to. Our Oontz Angle 3 meanwhile is performing flawlessly -- quick connection great sound holds a charge well -- for more than a year. Buying another of those.
1,Not loud enough
2,Muy mala calidad de sonido. Mala recepci√≥n para la radio. No la recomiendo
5,Great sound
2,The pictures are deceiving the speaker is about the size of my hand make sure to read the dimension in the details (I didnt).  Sound seems decent tho.
3,Its OK
5,Thanks...
1,Took awhile to come in and when it arrived the sound didn‚Äôt work 0/10
5,This speaker was easy to connect to my phone and provides good quality sound. Loud enough to hear while doing work around the house.
2,Great little size but kind of disappointing. Online reviews were all good so maybe I got a lemon. Sound is scratchy when I turn up the volume and there is absolutely no bass whatsoever. But it's okay for the bathroom I guess.
5,Works really well and is very loud I use it almost all the time
5,Outside walking and on swimming pool.
5,Wasn't very happy with this product.  Wasn't able to work properly.  Sorry.
1,The title says it all. Its a cheap item because it doesn't have a good sound the battery life is dim and you might as well spend a few more bucks to purchase one that will actually last you longer.
2,The speaker is not too great the sound is bad.
2,Not very loud
1,This speaker‚Äôs sound quality is horrible! In addition the rubber piece which you need to take off to turn on and to charge is so cheap and flimsy it‚Äôs nearly impossible to replace after turning on. Returned for a refund. Don‚Äôt waste your money. I purchased the Bugani M99 for $25 instead. It sounds amazing for the price is super sturdy and has great bass as well. I suggest anyone looking for a budget Bluetooth speaker get one of those instead of this one.
2,Worked great until the supplied clip failed causing the speaker to fall from the umbrella onto the table. After that 3 foot fall it no longer sounds the same. As if a speaker is broken  or durable.
2,Stopped working after a few weeks
2,This speaker is not very loud at all. It's made solid and rugged but just not the sound quality we were hoping for. We sent this back for a refund.
2,I got what I paid for (something like $13 bucks). Not for music. The sound is disappointing and can barely handle voices.
5,Great speaker for the price. Very easy to pair with phones and good sound quality. Nice to use by the pool!
5,Love it always comes with me in the shower.
5,Love it.
5,I got for myself but I decided to give it to my 10 year old cousin.
5,I love how small and mighty this speaker is! The bass is wonderful and the speaker can fit almost anywhere
5,This little thing is AWESOME! Way better than I could have ever imagined. For $12 this is a STEAL
5,Just as described. Waterproof. Easy to add to the phone. I like the blue color and design of it.
5,Worked as should
2,üòìüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé‚úä
1,Smaller than expected. If I lay my phone on it it‚Äôs covered completely but in the same fact the sound is very loud for the size. I‚Äôm a mailman and I‚Äôm using this for a radio in the truck everyday for 5hrs. I‚Äôll update my review if I have any issues. Issues arose.. not even 3 months of use a few days a week and it stopped charging tired multiple cords and confirmed it was the speaker.
5,Great for a girl and boy
5,Wey good quality of sound
5,Buen sonido pero en la foto se ve√≠a m√°s grande
5,Muy bien para el precio para el tama√±o
5,It works for 40 feet or more.
5,I dont dislike anything about this product!!! Its awesome and I carry it everywhere I go.
5,teens love it
5,Excellent sound good battery life. Good volume.
1,It came out smelling horrible extremely chemical and disgusting. I had to air it out for a bit. Sound quality aint great either.  I‚Äôd usually just let this slide but apparently I've decided to have a little review spree. Feels bad man
5,Excelente fidelidad solo no tiene bajos fuertes pero el precio esta muy bien portable 100%
5,Ordered by accident  but turned out to be a good thing
3,Cheap
5,This is a very good product for the price.
5,loud enough to fill small-medium rooms. probably not good for big parties.
5,Esperaba un poco m√°s grande y m√°s volumen pero est√° bien üëç
1,use for louder sounding music but now it has no use cannot even be charged up.
5,perfecto
2,Don't waste ur time the speaker sucks and it weighs  a ton  amazon  needs  to check its products period
1,It's decent for music in the bathroom (shower/bath). Sound is ok. Barely any bass. It is TERRIBLE for phone calls. Nobody can hear me. Not even a little bit. I can hear them though. I'm told it sounds like I muted the phone when I try and talk on it. Battery life is good.
5,great bluetooth speaker small loud sound
5,This is a good speaker.
5,Works great. Loud and clear
5,Muy buen sonido y potencia .
1,I loved this speaker at first but after using it for about five times the light comes on like it is working  it doesn't have the hello greeting to let you know it is on and I can't get it to work anymore. What a waste of money.
5,Got for my husband as a gift he seems to love it.
5,Excellent but hard to know when fully charged.
5,I use it with my cell phone and works great
5,Pretty good and very good sound
5,There is a lot of punch to this little speaker!
5,Good sound
2,This speaker is very bad !! the speaker does not work and smell like it has burned.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I liked that it wasn't to loud and it was small and inexpensive but its cheaply made broke after only two months one drop a foot high drop.
5,Great product and it sounds great too
2,Very tinny sounding and light weight
5,great speaker for shower and computer nice power to it
5,I liked I used for my music
5,Music for the golf cart
5,Sound id's great
1,Bought as a gift we used it twice and now will only work when plugged in.  Not worth it.
5,Nice speaker for the price
1,This little speaker has terrible audio quality both through the aux cord and through Bluetooth. It's grainy distorted and sounds like the speakers were blown already. Even at full volume it's barely louder than my phone's speakers and sounds 20 times worse. Save your money and go with something else.
5,Works great
5,Buen producto
5,So good it‚Äôs my second purchase
5,Great speaker
1,get a different kind

1,I ordered this Oct. 21 2021
5,Works great
1,Return date was 1/31/21 stopped working a few days later. Disconnects sounds awful. Static sound like volume too loud even though it isn't.
1,Got this in April and it will no longer charge. It never would fully charge to begin with but now it won‚Äôt charge at all. Waste of money
1,This speaker is trash not worth a penny. The day I got it it stopped working. The sound was not loud at all and the bass was non existent. I don‚Äôt recommend this to anyone
5,It‚Äôs good
1,I barely had this speaker for two weeks and I loved it but then somehow a bunch of water got inside of it and now it will not work properly. Definitely not waterproof.
1,Worked good for bout a week and then would not play anymore. Wish I could return it.
1,Speaker never worked backside rubber casing came off immediately.
1,Bought this to have by the pool in summer and the first time I tried using it the sound was fuzzy and did not get loud. Very disappointing considering it had great reviews.
1,The first time I used it the music and sound were completely muffled. The sound quality is horrible.
1,Like the size. Quality not at all stop working a few weeks after purchase will not connect to device.
1,First bit of water that got on it ruined it. Not what the product says it is!!! Very disappointed.
1,Poor quality sound is so low it cant be heard.
1,Not impressed. Bass and treble really bad. No matter what I do the sound lacks 'good vibrations'  Not a great purchase for me.
1,I couldn‚Äôt give a review in this Even if I wanted to considering it won‚Äôt work ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,We took this speaker outside and could hardly hear it. Very low  and unable to hear anything outside.
1,Its not waterproof and also smaller then what the picture makes it
1,Las im√°genes son muy enga√±osas yo me la compr√© por el tama√±o que vi de las im√°genes pero el resultado fue decepcionante
1,This thing is TINY...and sounds like an a.m. radio
1,Jam√°s tocaron ami puerta cuando lo entregaron y se desapareci√≥ mi paquete

1,It messed up on the second day of me having it !

3,Didn't come with clip in description and no instructions
2,Charging port broke after 3 times of using it. Won't be buying this again. Cheap crap.
1,Just buzzed and hummed. Perhaps defective. My other set worked great
5,One of my dad's birthday gifts. I wanted to make sure he had something awesome to use whilst he grills in the rain. Since sometimes no one goes outside with him when it does rain he could bring his speaker! Man it was an hour or so I called him back to see if he figured it out he didn't answer his phone because he was busy listening to his jazz and working in his work shop. Best gift for a busy dad who loves his music!
1,it sounds very low
5,Great Quality of sound!!I Was so impressed with this speaker! the sound is great and it‚Äôs WATERPROOF!! It was one of the easiest speakers to connect to Bluetooth... I ordered this for my office it‚Äôs easly transportable and the quality of the sound compares to my high dollar speakers... need to order more for each of my kids andformy mom!
5,Its compact size is very nice for travel. The sound will surprise you. When and if it quits  another one will be bought.
5,A
5,I was hesitant to get this Bluetooth speaker because it wasn‚Äôt one of the popular brands. However I am so happy I went ahead with the purchase. It works perfect! Clear sound and quality and perfect size to through in a bag and take anywhere!
4,I thought it would be a bit bigger in size but its all worth the buck! Sound quality is alright its what to expect when theres only one side speaker. Sound would have been better if it was double internal speakers
3,Smaller then I expected but it‚Äôs good and the sound is loud but not that loud!!
1,It good sound until the speaker blows
5,Sound is good battery life good only down side is it doesn't turn off automatically you should turn off manual
4,Good volume and sound quality. I use it to replace my speakerphone when watching videos. Love it!
5,excellent good sound battery long lasting üëç
5,It looks a little cheap but it works great. Connected to bluetooth easily and works great.
5,This speaker is much smaller than I though! It's small and fits nicely my hand.  It doesn't take up space in my tiny shower and I can carry it around the house with me as I get ready in the morning. I like to listen to the music while I get ready for work but just the phone speaker was never loud enough to hear in different rooms. This small speaker has great volume and solves the problem! And the battery last longer then expected.
5,Best 15 bucks spent in a long time.  Everything is just good not great.  Don‚Äôt expect Bose quality from 15 bucks your only fooling yourself.  Everything worked as expected and I am completely satisfied using this while riding my bike with my dog in his seat.
5,I'm a big options gal &  love all the features on this speaker! I am glad it is waterproof as that was put to the test almost immediately. It got splashed pretty good with a hose and fell into a wet area in my yard while kids were spraying each other - it went unnoticed for approx 10 minutes but came out none the worse for wear. Idk if it would've survived as well with the ports exposed  but fortunately they weren't.The fm radio is a nice touch also but a little tricky to figure out. (There are directions for use included with the product but of course I didn't read those first lol.) You have to use the  aux/usb cable for reception which even then isn't great but perhaps my issue was location. I did initially have a hard time figuring it out but there are a few good tutorials on youtube so if you're afflicted like me I'd look there for help.I haven't used any other features but will eventually & as the performance thus far is great I expect they will meet expectation.I will probably buy this again.  I think they'd make a decent stocking stuffer.
5,I haven‚Äôt try to see if it water resistant yet
5,This is just what I was looking for. Perfect to take with you sounds great & easy to use.
4,Me parecen bien solo que no tiene como ver el nivel de la carga
5,I‚Äôm glad I brought this Bluetooth speaker it‚Äôs not to small not to big. The sound quality is great. Great price too. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase
5,I like the sound and look would buy again.
5,These speakers are small and powerful. Perfect for travel because of its size but the sound it produces isn‚Äôt compromised by sound. You won‚Äôt regret this purchase.
5,This little speaker is great for pool side or something where you don‚Äôt want to take a big speaker or an expensive one.The sound quality is expected for the price of the speaker. It‚Äôs definitely not super super loud but it‚Äôs loud enough. It‚Äôs super easy to use. I turned it on straight out of the package and hooked it up to my Bluetooth and tested it out. Then I put it to charge all the way and plan to use it for when we float the river!
5,Works even better than the more expensive speakers!
5,It is very good quality sound is very good and small to carry it any where
5,Using during bikecycle riding in place on ear pieces. Great sound for the size and price. My case water tightness not yet needed until I play submarine. So I have a USB flash drive with good 70's rock thats irritating to those folks that don't like rock when riding around the park. Turn it on and it plays from flash drive automatically.
5,This speaker is a good buy! It was hard to hear my phone in the shower so this product was perfect for me. It's small but loud.
5,The speaker has good sound quality. Battery life is good. Water resistance not checked though. Overall Good product in a reasonable price. Recommended to all.
5,Smaller than I thought but probably a good thing. No bigger than the size of your hand this little thing does pack a good sound. Small and lightweight. I like how there is a toggle for on and off jnstead of a button. Also the plug is handy because it's a 2 in 1 - aux into charge port/or mobile to listen. The only bad thing I could say I'd when trying to make the sound louder it often times skips to the next track - something you have to de-program yourself to do
5,It is one of the best most affordable speakers on the market. The sound quality is very good and the bass is also wonderful. I am very happy with purchasing it and definitely would buy again. Thank you.
5,For the size of the speaker it is amazing. It is so loud compared to other speakers for its size. The sound quality is also amazing. Great for using in the shower. Connecting to Bluetooth is really easy and simple. The battery last long and easy to charge. Great for a pool party.  Would recommend buying the speaker since the price is affordable and the quality is amazing.
5,This was smaller than I was expecting but boy does it pack some punch. Just received it yesterday and charged it up right away. Simple to use battery life seems great and it is nice and compact. Will definitely be bringing this along with me wherever I go!Great product and price.
5,This speaker is tiny light and sounds awesome -- I carry it in my backpack all the time -- what else do I need to say? this thing is tiny and loud. all you need in a good speaker
5,Great sound! Bought for a gift for someone who spends lots of time on the beach and he loves it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I am pleasantly surprised by this little speaker.  It's mobile size and can easily be carried in a backpack or purse.  It's got some weight to it. Not a cheaply made device.  The sound is great and the volume is more than sufficient.  It takes a memory card up to 16G.  The blue strip is rubbery so it doesn't slip on a smooth surface. I bought it for my salon so I love the small footprint and the sound fills the room.  I can now free up my android device which is runny for pictures and point of sale and music.  Works great!  I was running spotify hoping to record the sound for you but the camera wants the sound of course. I will be getting my music on a memory card for sure!
5,I bought this speaker to travel with and bring to the beach. It is the perfect size and light weight to port around. It's got great sound for it's size and pairs perfectly to my iPhone. The best part is that it's waterproof. I didn't have to worry about it getting ruined when spending a day at the beach with the kids! I'll be using this all summer long at the lake and water park!
5,My sister r uses this as she is getting to/ from school. She hooks it to her backpack when she is riding her bike or skateboarding. Much safer than using headphones in my opinion. The sound quality is good. Battery lasts her most of the week. Pairing with cell phone was very easy I like the small size and sound quality.
5,I really enjoy listening to music with this. The sound quality is very nice its portable everywhere and it looksvery nice! I really recommend it !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Awesome!!!this speaker has a very nice quality sound. It is so loud but not blasted and very handy. I can bring it anywhere and everywhere I wanted.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†‚Ä¢ La qualit√© du song est tr√®s bon je ne m'attendais pas a autant pour le prix que j'ai pay√©e.‚Ä¢ M√™me quand le son est au bout il n'est pas asourdisant et ne griche pas. Le son a une tr√®s bonne qualit√©.‚Ä¢ Je m'en sert pas comme Bluetooth je m'en sert avec une carte SD qui est beaucoup mieux car mon cellulaire se d√©charge facilement. Alors c'est vraiment un plus.‚Ä¢ Petit et pas trop pesant.‚Ä¢ Parfait pour sortie en famille au parc
5,Nice portable bluetooth speaker with effective sound quality.Easy to connect good battery life. Definitely recommend the product.
2,Good price waterproof and nice look. Aside from that it's crap. My cell phone has better volume than this speaker. The volume is terrible. The whole point of these is for extra volume for music off your phone and so on but this speaker unfortunately does not deliver.
1,This is the worst joke I‚Äôve ever heard that this product has a rate of 4 ! First  the colour of battery charging light  is always blue! No red light so you‚Äôll never know when it‚Äôs fully charged or out of charge. Second : it doesn‚Äôt have any button for volume determination! You have to use the device that is connected to the speaker to change the volume!! I have an iPhone XR and for some reason I decided to use it in my car! A small car. Well passengers in the back seat hardly could hear the anything and the sound was kind of annoying for them. No need to mention that my cellphone volume was on the highest possible. I‚Äôm very disappointed and DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
4,**update** The replacement is amazing! Got it and it works perfect. Guess theres always one bad one out there.**first review**I bought one turned the radio on then I tried to change stations and that button fully collapsed inside. Everything but that button to change radio stations was perfect. The sound was clear but I'm retuning it and ordering another one. I was very disappointed when within 2 minutes of using it something breaks. I'll give it another shot though cuz its perfect otherwise.
5,Guys this is speaker is just the most practical thing i bought in a while. I initially purchased it for my upcoming vacation week but i‚Äôve been using it non-stop since i got it. It‚Äôs small enough that it fits in my *quite small* purse but the sound quality is equal to much bugger and pricier portable speakers. It charges in no time in a usb outlet and stayed on for a whole afternoon while i was gardening on the balcony. I‚Äôm purchasing another one to lesve in my car and gifting one to my boyfriend so that he can carry it to work when he has to work outside. It small enough to fit in a pocket!! I totally recommend you purchase this. For the price it more than worth it! Cheers!
3,I bought this to replace my previous Shower speaker and FM radio that had just died.  I read the reviews and asked questions as I needed to make sure that the FM radio was also included.My disappointment comes from the fact that the USB wire must be plugged in to act as a FM antenna.  It has otherwise a very poor reception and the sound is scratchy at best.In the shower I cannot leave the wire plugged in and the rubber back cover stays opened....Not too great so I only use it as a Bluetooth speaker in the shower. I thought of returning but in this pandemic world...I decided to keep it.
2,We received this product in April. I was excited as it was an inexpensive speaker that claimed to be waterproof which is important for me as I like to fish... and well.. things get wet. Upon receiving it we were really happy. The Volume control isn't the best as you have to press and hold the button or you change songs but no a deal-breaker. We continued enjoying it for BBQ's and outdoor living since it was a nice summer but sadly I didn't go fishing. We forgot it outside one night and it started to rain. When I saw the speaker the next morning on my patio table I thought "Good thing we bought a waterproof one!" and I always made sure to close the rubber in the back "just in case". Much to my dismay the unit was SOAKED. It was on a table not submerged and I was pouring water out of it. I immediately put it in a big bin of rice but it was too late. It does not charge. It will charge for 30 seconds then the light turns off.All that to say if you buy this DO NOT LET WATER TOUCH IT. It is NOT waterproof. Oh... and my window to return closed in May so I am up the creek without a paddle.
3,It is what I bought and I should not have expected much as the price was very low. The images are miss leading for its size. It is very small. It has no volume control. It actually has about the same sound quality as my phone does so it was not an upgrade for sound as I was hoping. Other than that its ok. I would not recommend this as a source for great sound.
5,I use this at work sometimes I place down to hear it if I am working in a area where I'm lugging stuff some times I place on fork lift at loud or full sound since fork lift can be loud. Other times I have belt clip on my jeans at low volume so I can hear it while I lug stuff in various areas where I can't leave it. Over all especially with the option of FM radio (which you need the charging cord plugged in to add as antenna which is a bonus if I don't want to use data) I love it. Haven't timed it yet it will turn off (power down which is good to save battery) when not in use. Need to turn it off and back on to use again. Pay attention to volume going low briefly on sound with music meaning incoming text or notification. Keep it off Bluetooth calls and phone will call normally with sound/vibrate. Of course this is my experience. I really love this little guy bigger than smaller stuff yet smaller than the larger ones for more money. I honestly ordered a second one in case they stop making them. My work place is hard already got some dings and scratches on it iI still say 10/10 in my books.
4,This easy-to-use portable bluetooth speaker works great for such an affordable price.  If you want home theater sound then use your surround sound system but if you want something to take to the beach or such with the risk of something happening to it then this is a great purchase.  It actually blasts out the sound at a level which is surprising for its small size and price.
4,Since I enjoy sitting out on my deck with it's waterfalls and sprinklers I happy that I bought this little outdoor unit for music playing from my iPhone.  It has enough power and clarity with it's speakers.  The sound travels far in the house actually.  It's a quality-made unit in my opinion.
4,I bought after reading reviews but to add a little honesty... it is just ok for the money not that loud and no bass compared to my previous speaker (Edifier mini) So I keep it as the dusty shop beat-up speaker and it works perfectly for that up to 6 hours autonomy I have had with it reads SD cards like a champ as well as bluetooth Just loud enough for my woodshop but cracks on bassy tunes... sturdy it has fallen off shelves a few times and takes the beating... on-off switch??? will probably be the culprit in time.. we'll see..
5,The speaker is a little bit smaller than I expected but it‚Äôs actually not a problem. It just even more portable than I expected. I mainly use it in the shower. It‚Äôs been almost a month now and I got zero problem with water.Initial Bluetooth pairing was easy and it connects in a breeze every time I turn it up.Love that it has built-in radio because they all have a crappy apps or website.
4,Controls are not very intuitive but the sound quality is decent for a portable device and the size and weight is convenient for this purpose. Would recommend for activities like camping fishing hiking etc. It even has a clip to hang off a belt loop or backpack.
3,I like how compact this speaker is. I can put it on the tablet holder of my exercise bike while I'm working out or take it outside for music while I'm gardening. Lower volume it has a crisp sound but has some distortion on higher volumes. I love how you can use it on Bluetooth or micro SD card. All in all a good speaker for the price.
5,I was looking for a speaker that I could use while in my sauna. (Infrared not steam). I put my iPad on a chair outside the sauna and use the speaker inside.  Sound is very good with lots of volume and excellent overall bass and treble mix. This does exactly what I was looking for.  Battery life is exceptional. Highly recommended.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy Bluetooth connection. FM mode works well. Be aware that there is no FM dial. You have to scan to preset all the available stations and then find the one you want to listen to once its set it stays on that station until you change it. There is also no low battery indicator. However it is a very nice small and robust unit with a good sound . For the price it is hard to beat.
5,This is the best wireless speaker I have ever bought. The sound quality is great even at loud volume. I used it for over 6 hours a day 3 days in a row and it still had power and would have played longer. Great Product. I highly recommend it. Thank You!
4,I received the product quickly and on time. Great sound quality for a small speaker. The buttons could be a bit more responsive but it is very easy to figure out how to use (does come with instructions though) Sound quality in my opinion is better when connected through bluetooth connected directly to the phone caused a bit of static everytime the wire moved. I find it a bit inconvenient to have all the ports for charging and such under a flap.Overall awesome sounding quality speaker at a great price! Being waterproof is also a nice bonus. Would definitely recommend
4,Good little speaker for a smaller room.  Nice to have the FM tuner function but not sure how relevant that is now.Paired easily and decent sound for a cheaper device.  Already survived a decent fall and still pumping out music!
3,You get what you pay for. The sound is good and loud if you're listening to it somewhere with no noise a place like a loud plant for example you will not hear it. Battery life is short about 3 hours and it will still die even when plugged in. If you're looking for something with longer battery life I suggest looking elsewhere.
2,It works it sounds battery last kk but hard to connect from my phone or computer  takes a several trys or not at all.Works of you are patient with that not me.
4,Great for outside by a pool connects to the phone easily and great volume only on some songs with auto-tune or a certain tone does the quality go down and you can't really understand it. Overall great and small and easy to use!
5,Great speaker and its waterproof so great to have around the pool. Only thing I dont like is how you have to hold volume button down to turn music up or down cuz if u dont press long enough you just end up changing the song. Still a really great speaker and quick delivery.
3,Loved the product but did not expect it to be so tiny. The advertisement showed very deceptive scale size. Fortunately the price ruggedness versatility loudness sound quality and mid- bass is acceptable for it's size !
1,I'm sorry to say but due to delays and who knows what else I got it after 2 months ordering it. It is smaller than advertised. Did not come with the cable shown in the picture came with a completely different and shorter cable. Switching modes the speaker does not speak English. My phone cannot connect to it so I don't even know if it is actually finding the signal. I have to go search for a compatible cable just to see if this was even worth it.
4,Trying to change the volume is really hard. You have to hold and press the buttons there is no visual or physical feedback on volume changing.Sounds well. We have it plugged in 24hrs with a usb stick looping 10 songs.
3,The sound is not loud enough for me but item like descripe. I will give a try during kayaking but I think the sound will not be enought. I tried it in the shower and work fine. Maybe it will stay in shower. The device is small like a pocket size
1,Is a lot smaller than I thought it would be sound quality also poor was using it for my cell phone but my phones built in speaker provides better quality sound would not recommend it
2,It‚Äôs barley louder than my phone speaker. You also can not control the volume from the speaker itself only your phone.
5,Nothing bad to say at all cheap little speaker that charges up quick and has an impressive range for connectivity.  This isn't a speaker for a  raging party its loud enough to put outside with company on the deck which is what I bought it for( also for my golf bag )
5,So far so good. Great for the shower or on the boat. Sound quality is good. I can hear it without my hearing aids. Easy on off button in the back of the unit. Hoods a charge for several days.
4,This speaker sounds pretty good for it's size and price.One inconvenience is the loud prompt whenever you change modes (BLUETOOTH MODE!!!!! FM MODE!!!!). There's no way to turn this device on discretely. (Advice: lower the volume while on Bluetooth mode before changing to FM or Aux.)My other problem is with radio reception but this may have to do with the cheap wire that was sent damaged. If I use a different USB wire it works much better.
4,Really good speaker for the price and sounds excellent to be honest. The only downside is loading 2000 tunes on an external card I purchased. No random feature so I am still listening to the 200 Pink Floyd song in a row.. Need random badly.
5,I am pleasantly surprised by this little speaker. I didn‚Äôt realize how tiny it actually was until it came but that‚Äôs something I really love about it. Very easy to transport/carry around. Sound quality is great! Battery life is longer than any Bluetooth speaker I‚Äôve had in the past. I haven‚Äôt tested out the water resistance but otherwise this product is a win!
4,Le son est bon mais pas tr√®s puissantNe pas acheter pour capter la radio c‚Äôest pas superTres facile d‚Äôutilisation avec le Bluetooth
5,Great speaker sounds really nice. Small and compact which is good for carrying around. Can be hooked up practically anywhere.  Great price too.
2,It was a decent speaker. My main issue is the battery life is very short. At full charge it only lasts 4 hours. It is simple music and played at low volumes. It is not great since I was hoping it could last through a work day but sadly it does not.
1,I bought this item back in January and I‚Äôm still not able to get 10 minutes of playtime from it. As soon as I connect it to power I hear low battery and then it powers off. It remains connected to my power outlet and still no charge. I know the time to return it has passed but this was an absolute mistake to purchase!
1,a good sounding radio but NO good to take  Iphone cell phone calls on  the other party cant hear you and hangs up cause they cant hear you  so only good for a speaker for a radio or  songs you might have all ready on ur Iphone but dont buy it  if you think others can hear you on ur cell phone threw these speakers cause  it doesnt work  period ty
5,I love everything about the product except for the color would have preferred a teal pink or purple band of color as opposed to cyan
4,Sounds alot better than expected for the price you can't go wrong would definitely buy again. Good little wireless speaker. Not sure how it would sound in a large area but worked well for main areas of the house sound seem to travel really well
2,Es mucho m√°s peque√±a que como se ve en la foto. El sonido no es de muy buena calidad. Es muy bajo y si le subes al m√°ximo se distorsiona. Est√° bien si quieres una bocina que no te importe lo que suceda con ella. Por el precio le puse  2 estrellas pero el producto en si no es bueno.
5,The battery life on this unit lasts forever. I love that about it. It will thump all night outside during camping or on a hike. No need to charge more than once a week. The sound quality is decent could be a little more crisp but for such a small package no complaints. Great little speaker.
5,Smaller than expected but good sound quality !Haven't tried in the shower yet but will update this review after.Decent for the price since other i bought were in the 40-50 range
5,Batterie durable Bluetooth fonctionne bienPlus petit que sur la photo son ok poir la grosseur pour le prix c ok
3,Smaller then appeared in picture had purchased for daughter to match one I had of my own she ended up using mine anyway.
3,Ne fonctionne plus apr√®s 2 mois d'utilisation occasionnel... Update le vendeur a rapidement r√©gl√© la situation et m'a offert un remboursement ou un remplacement. Ce f√ªt tr√®s simple et agr√©able de communiquer avec le vendeur et un nouveau speaker m'a √©t√© envoy√©. Je suis bien content car je l'adore!!
3,me parece un precio justo por lo que es el producto es mas peque√±a que lo que se muestra el sonido es bueno aun que tengo la sensaci√≥n que conectado al bluetooth es un poco mas bajo ademas que a los 4 metros aprox  comienza a fallar la conexi√≥n  en cuestion a la resistencia se ve muy bien para uso rudo eso me gusto mucho  la bateria me gusto la use a todo volumen y duro un poco mas de 4 horas funcionando aun no pruebo su resistencia a el agua.
5,This speaker arrived a day early and was just as we expected. We like to go camping and being outside and its been perfect for that. It goes very loud considering how small it is! Nice and compact. Connected to bluetooth automatically. Played it for a couple days without battery dying.
1,These aren't the most expensive bluetooth speaker on the market but I can honestly say Dollar Store speakers are better than this. Very disappointing
5,Been looking for a portable waterproof speaker for when I take a shower. This one is perfect the sound quality is decent for it size. Easy to connect. It has radio mode too. For the price it‚Äôs a great buy.
5,Nice little speaker. The charge lasts through the work day. The sound is actually pretty good. The postage-stamp size manual is a bit ridic but it's easy enough to figure out :)
2,This portable speaker is handy to carry around with you. Unfortunately it doesn't go that loud. I purchased to use in my kindergarten classroom it works if we are in the classroom sitting quietly but its too quiet for our dance parties outside.
5,Je suis rest√© surprise pas sa grosseur. il est petit c'est g√©nial il ne prend pas de place. Le son est tr√®s bon. Pour le volume c'est le m√™me piton que ''Next'' chanson mais si vous pes√© une fois la chanson change mais si vous tenez enfonc√© le volume augmente.
5,For the amount of money I payed well worth it.If you expect loud big bass not for you but for around the fire pit it's great.Arrived earlier then advertised.
4,Product is great for the price my only issue is the odd time you put it down on a hard surface it power cycles. Other than that it's loud and lasts a while.
5,For the money you pay it works fantastically. Medium range (for an apartment. No multiple floors). Water resistance. Good quality sound but not amazing. Easy to utilize and most important... connects easily to the Bluetooth.
3,I've had this speaker for a few weeks now and everything was great until it fell in my pool. It's definitely not water proof but it knida floats. Was In the pool for under a minute but hasn't worked since.
5,pay attention to the size of this item as it is palm sized. has a convenient clip so you can attach to a bag. small speaker but produces a great sound. would recommend
5,Parfait pour emporter la musique partout avec soit!
5,Sound is great. The volume buttons are kinda tricky if you don‚Äôt hold the button the song changes. But that‚Äôs just being picky. Works great for me.
1,Don‚Äôt buy. We had it for 2 weeks then it suddenly ‚Äòdied‚Äô. The battery worked but we couldn‚Äôt get any sound.Forced to buy another brand.
5,It what i expected.  It louder than what i thought.  Thanks  highly recommend this .
5,I bought a couple for our airbnb guests an unexpected plus for them they are3 happy to listen to their own tunes and the volume is enoght to cover the whole apartment without being too loud.
2,Some of the reviews I read before I ordered talked about a powerful sound and "great to use on the beach".This is clearly not the case.Not very loud at all and not much base.Perhaps inside a small room this is adequate.Not for me.
5,Perfect for travelling small good sound can plug usb to play downloaded music or use radio.  It played 9 hours non stop....
4,Fonctionne bien en g√©n√©rale. Difficile pour le contr√¥le du son un peu parfois et je conseil une ralonge USB pour une bonne r√©ception Fm.
3,Its not very loud but its nice and small to clip on your backpack for a little hike
5,Bought for my daughter.  She is very pleased with it and said that the sound quality is really good.
1,Solid and pretty good sound quality.However I do not like that there is no way to indicate what radio station it‚Äôs on nor where the volume is; you turn the volume down then it just shuts it off.
1,Product stopped working after 6 months. Battery would last 10 minutes then die. Do not recommend. Also have been unable to contact the company about a warranty?? DO NOT BUY!
4,Really cute and works fine. Smaller than I imagined but great product for the price
3,Good little speaker. Voice is weird and sound is now as good as I would have hoped. Also smaller
5,It‚Äôs an easy to use water proof speaker. I was surprised by the sound that the little speaker makes . I haven‚Äôt tested much of the battery life or how well it keeps water out of itself but still happy how fast it connects to Bluetooth and how fast you can switch it to radio
5,Arrived ahead of time works good thanks.could be a little cheaper.
2,for the price its pretty damn good but if you can... buy a better one its ok but not great
3,Una bocina con la que en volumen se puede escuchar bien pero cuando quieres subirle al m√°ximo el sonido empieza a distorsionar y como suelo escuchar m√∫sica electr√≥nica suele ser algo molesto. No cuenta con una entrada para auxiliar y con manual. La bater√≠a suele acabarse pronto a√∫n con volumen bajo.
3,not a bad buy but the sound isnt that great  and had low base level.
1,Cannot connect to any phones at all. Could barely hear it at full volume
5,It‚Äôs a small speaker great for traveling with limited space. Works great and it‚Äôs nice that it can get wet at the beach.
3,Great when you are in the same room or close to it but wouldn't count on it if you are listening from another room.Overall it serves the purpose I wanted it for.This little Bluetooth speaker is worth the $$.
3,It's not complicated for someone that has a hard time with technology. Easy to use.
1,The battery doesn't stay charged too long didn't come with a charging block whatsoever just a chord and it isn't very loud at all. Cant remember what I paid for it 30 bucks or something overall meh
1,speaker I got was faulty. bloothtooth couldn't connect. and when turned on the announcement Bluetooth is on was not clear it kept repeating over and over with out finishing the word Bluetooth. faulty device.
1,I have purchased this speaker and in less than a year I cannot charge it anymore! It is impossible to use it because it cannot be charged anymore! Very disappointed with this purchase!!!
5,Perfect little speaker...dandy sound..has it out by my pool..love it
4,Its smaller then I was expecting but works good
5,C'est exactement le haut parleur que je recherchais car je voulais qu'il puisse lire les cl√©s USB qu'il soit rechargeable et fonctionn√© sans pile et √©lectricit√©.  Le son est quand m√™me assez bon pour le prix!  Tr√®s bon achat!
5,good speaker lasted a long time on charge
5,Battery last long and sound is good for its size
3,Cadeau pour mon fils il est d√©√ßus √ßa griche
2,when outside it picks up others Bluetooth who are driving by. Not very loud
5,love this speaker.  no fuss no waiting .. acknowledged connection as soon as you turn it on.
2,le son est mauvais quand on veux mettre le volume au plus fort .. et na pas lair si waterproof bref jai vue bcp mieux pour moins cher ..
4,First one I got didn't work but the replacement was awesome and the company was great when I needed to replace the defective speaker.
5,Awesome sound great quality!Definitly recommend it!
5,Awesome sounding product! I just wish the volume was easier to control
4,our laptop sound is very poor at times and this gadget makes it so much better. Glad we made this purchase.
5,Great for the shower also physically much smaller than anticipated but I don‚Äôt mind because it makes for easier travel.
1,Super small not very loud poor quality metal speaker cover fell out as I took it out of the box
5,Amazed how well this works. I strap it to my paddle board
3,The piece to make it water resistant if used too often will break. It is nice and loud.
1,Very small and cheap speaker  looks much bigger in Amazon pics.
4,Nice and solid feels heavy and made with decent material. Lots of cool features.Quite happy with my purchase
3,Les boutons + _ ET le triangle ont des fonctions multiples qui font devenir impatient.
4,Used it all winter outside in the hot tub yes in the Hottub floats and works just like a 20$ would. Radio setting was a sweet surprise I didn‚Äôt know about
4,Easy to use battery holds good but sound isn‚Äôt spectacular. Could use some more bass.
5,for what it is  it's great  saves on the cell phone speaker  great!
5,Its awsome for its size and prise and it super user friendly and quite versatile. The only problem i have with it is the little key ring bends very easily it can't take  the weight of the speaker
4,Good little portable unit ...good sound but could do with more bass.....
3,Aunque si conecta bien con el celular o con mi laptop la bocina es mas peque√±a de lo que parece. El sonido es aceptable para su tama√±o. Los controles no son muy c√≥modos para operarlos. Es de las compras en que te quedas con la idea de que pudo haber sido mejor.
3,It‚Äôs loud but lots of rumble. Not a lot of base. Over all it‚Äôs okay! Would recommend if your budget is like mine. Battery life is long..
5,Working great.
4,It's ok but there's no volume control
4,The speaker was way smaller than I thought but the sound quality is really good and the small size actually makes it easier to carry in a purse. It is a great price.

5,Good gift

5,Perfect little speaker to have near the pool.
2,Not worse it not sure if mine is deffective but i can hardly hear it will return it

3,My speaker worked amazing in the beginning but now that I‚Äôve had it a month I‚Äôve started to notice the sound bounces. It does it all the time now. Really annoying.I‚Äôm not impressed at all also the sound isn‚Äôt as great as other reviews made it out to be. I feel it has the same sound as my phone alone.
5,Perfect size super small and great sound! Love it! It fits my purse and not heavy at all!
5,Parfait
5,Advertised deep bass but bass is normal.
5,Love it perfect sounds perfect gift
2,The Bluetooth speaker was nice just wasn't what I expected it's not loud enough when your on the 4 wheeler reason why I had purchased it
5,Nice
5,Great sound very clear
5,The sound quality could be better but for the price I'm happy with it. Position of the speaker on table etc has a lot of effect on how it sounds and I can improve the sound just by being careful how it is placed.It has a radio mode as well that I'm sure must be awesome but I can't figure out how to get it to stay on one station. It connects easy via Bluetooth to any device so easily it seems to always be in pairing mode a big plus for me. The speaker can also be used via aux cord.I have gotten water on it and it was fine I take it camping.Charges fast and holds the charge seems to outlast the devices I use for Playlist!
1,Do not buy period!
1,When I first received this item I questioned how loose the charging port was. I started a return but ended up using the speaker until today (June 1/22) which it decided to quit working all together. I am now unable to send this back because today was the last day to return it. I won't have time today to ship it out.
5,Pretty inexpensive speaker connected immediately has great sound and great value for your money. Absolutely recommended!
4,It's a great deal
4,Battery life great. Last more than 2 full 8 hour work days at full volume. Compact and easy to carry around. Sound is decent. No distortion.  Have the guys asking about it on job sites. Product quality and durability is about a 6 out of 10. Will hold up I feel if taken care of. I would easily buy it again if I lost the one I already have.
4,Jecoute ma music d √† ne le garage et pour la piscine .
1,The FM radio sound quality was really poor.  We also could not pair this device with either phone.

1,Aucun moyen d'√©crire au vendeur defectueux apr√®s environ 10h d'utilisation
1,I bought this item in November. After deciding not to give it as a Christmas gift I saved it for my sons birthday in March. He was able to use it for 3 weeks before it stopped working. When we switch it on the light goes on but that's it. It also does not indicate it is charging when we put it on charge. It just stopped working! We would not buy this product again. We are greatly disappointed in our purchase.
5,It sounds great for how small it is! Easy to pair and use. Bought it for kayaking so the true test will be in the water tomorrow. So far I‚Äôm very happy with it.
1,Does not pick up radio at all and has poor sound quality
1,Le son ne marche pas il son
5,Very happy I use it all the time when I go fishing holds a chard for a long time and sounds good
5,Had this speaker for 2 years and could not get it to charge (no red light ) . Done some research and decided to take it apart as it's way past the return window . Charging port  and USB port were both broken off the motherboard.  It was never charged so it came broken . Resoldered the ports and now it's working perfectly . Very nice speaker glad I didn't toss it out .
4,Good little speaker. I really enjoyed it good battery life it's compact and loud enough for its size. I broke one becouse of my son liked to play with it and speaker has been dropped too many times so it's stop working. I wanted to order another one but the delivery date wasn't confirmed for few days even with my prime membership so I canceled my order. That is why I am giving 4 stars. But I was really pleased with the product.
5,This is great and so much sound for a little speaker. It will good for camping this summer and at the pool.
