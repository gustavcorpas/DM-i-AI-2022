4,First off the price point on this is amazing. It is a good little projector for the price.*YOU CANT WATCH NETFLIX OR DISNEY FROM IPHONE! It’s a restriction by the apps due to copyright laws. The apps won’t let you screencast. It’s important to understand that. However to get around it we plugged in our firestick directly to the projector. A Roku or chrome cast works too. Once we figured all that out it works very well. We wanted a cheaper option for our camper. Haven’t played a movie outside yet but it worked great indoors and the picture quality is outstanding!
4,I like the product sound is really low. Picture quality is great. I'm in still searching for a speaker to project the sound.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Esta muy bien.... funciona exelente
3,This is ok for the price but the coloring tends to be bright and blue.  I bought to show pictures on my iphone to a group and it connects fine but the picture quality is not that of my Phone. It also takes a while for videos to begin to play if they play at all.  One major drawback when connecting your phone wirelessly is you set it up though Wi-Fi settings therefore you cannot operate on Wi-Fi while projecting your screen image wirelessly. Overall it’s ok for the money and I would recommend if you are projecting holiday pics or lower quality movies but I was a little disappointed in the connection and quality when connecting to my phone.
4,This Vimgo projector was ok! I was able to connect my phone to it a couple times but it won't connect or find my phone anymore. So I haven't used it since.
4,This product works great and has great sound! It mentions that it’s portable but it has to be plugged into the wall and isn’t chargeable- that’s the only downfall!
4,Native 1080p resolution. Compatible with streaming devices (highly recommend pairing with a smart soundbar).Pros:Native 1080p at a very reasonable pricePicture quality is vibrant and looks better than most TVs in this price rangeLED lighting doesn’t require warmupCompact and lightweightEasy setupCon:Cooling fan can be a bit much for built-in speaker at timesWill occasionally start up with staticky image; powering off and on will fix itPicture does seem choppy rarely not sure if it’s the projector or streaming servicesThe cons are rarely an issue and once you’ve got a movie going they’re negligible. Highly recommend pairing it with a Roku Streambar for both better sound quality and access to nearly every streaming option. I’ve got that setup and projecting on a blank wall in the spare bedroom giving me a 72” screen and solid audio for the cost of a 32” TV.
4,I use this projector during the day in my bedroom by just putting up block out curtains. Though the room is small and the wall that the image is being projected on is next to a window the images are still of a good quality. Unfortunaly there was a video I wanted to watch from a flash drive and it was not picking up the flash drive. I connected my laptop to it and that was fine I also connected my fire stick 4K and that worked great. I even connected it to an Echo 1st Gen and an Echo Show 8 2nd Gen and it connected fine. At one time I had a wifi transmitter on while using an old DVD player connected to it and it worked fine but was not necessary when I realised it could connect to the Echo devices via the fire stick. One thing I found was challenging was getting the screen to be fully rectangular on the wall and all areas to be cleary visible. So to get a good image throughout I had the top of the projection wider than the bottom on the left side. It's not a problem when I'm lying down on the bed watching or positioned at an angle but viewing head on it just look weird as it's not a perfect rectangle.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The package came with HDMI and DP cords (and another one that idk what it connects to) my bf and I have been using it for a couple months now:Pros: very easy setup. There’s multiple ways to connect to my device. My room barely has stable  wifi coverage so we’ve just been using the wired option which is totally fine for us. The product image lighting and resolution is very good. (See the picture)Cons: the product makes a big noise when it’s working and i literally put it right above our head. It’s a common problem for almost all of the projectors at this price point so that’s acceptableOverall we are happy with this purchase. Who doesn’t like home theater in your own room with super affordable cost!
4,Worked great for the first couple times I used it. Started right up and picture was solid. Had to he dark tho. Which makes sense. However I put it away for about a month and went to go use it today.. and now it just won’t turn on. Red light is on but unresponsive. Have emailed the company waiting to hear back. I will be returning this for a refund if possible and looking elsewhere.**Edit to 3 stars because of the good customer service. Allowing me to exchange or refund my purchase****Edit to 4 stars - customer service was out of this world. After seeing I wasn't satisfied on my 2 star review they reached out in hopes to fix my issue. Looking forward to really putting this projector to the test.
2,Arrived without packaging just a shipping label and a small piece of Amazon paper packing tape slapped on the side.  The box was dented but the contents appeared to be fine.The provided instructions are clear and easy to use.  The projector menus are straightforward.The projector image is extremely dim and regardless of throw distance cannot be focused across the entire projection.  If the center is in focus the edges and corners are all blurry.  Totally unusable unless in a completely dark room.The manual Keystone adjustment worked fine but drifted while content was played.  This added to focus issues.  Unusable for PowerPoint or text heavy applications.Content.  Screen Mirroring and AirPlay were limited to YouTube and video files I had on my phone.  Netflix Amazon Prime Hulu Twitch and Plex would not play via this projector.  (I've learned this is common for less expensive projectors but it wasn't clear in the product description so I've added it here).Conclusions - Not a great projector but might be suitable for those who plan to connect it to a Roku/Firestick and place it in a pitch black room.Returning and rolling the dice on a more expensive projector.
4,I have this projector in my room and love it so far. it is a little finicky when it comes to screen mirroring and connecting your phone. I have a Roku hooked up to it and I love the setup. the picture is what you would expect for a projector better on a dark surface or viewing at night.
5,The only downside is the speaker isn’t the loudest but you can connect it to Bluetooth which is awesome. It was fairly easy to get started.Another downside is that apps like Netflix don’t allow you to mirror the device or play it on here so I wish there was a way for this device to bypass that :(Otherwise YouTube works great and other website browsers apps are fairly strict as I mentioned.
3,Was small and affordable. We gave it to a grandson with a projector screen since he wanted a wide screen picture
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have been using this projector for a while and so far I am quite happy with it. First of all the picture quality is clear even in the absence of projection background cloth. I can directly project it onto the wall which does not affect the normal use. Second the projector comes with a small bracket that after installation the projection angle of the projector can be adjusted appropriately and the picture effect of the projection is better. Third a one-year warranty is provided. After all many companys only offer six months warrenty.Of course. The product is not perfect. For example the instructions weren't very clear and I used a Samsung S8 Plus to connect to the projector. The step of the link was a little different from the manual so I had to spend more time figuring out how to link the phone to the projector. Second equipped with a projector bracket is plastic not very stabe. It can only meet the fine adjustment of the Angle of the projector if the adjustment Angle is very large it will not play a good support effect. Third the sound effect of the projector is ok. I like to watch action movies if the sound is better i would have a more enjoyable experience.All in all I think this is a projector suitable for most families. In terms of cost performance I am satisfied with it. Because this projector can fully meet daily use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This projector is tiny yet mighty. I really like that it is native 1080p and can project over 120" which is which most screens are. It is easy to adjust with the rotary knob. It includes a little stand but I have my own projector tripod that is sturdier. It does play sound but I usually connect my soundbar speaker to it and have everything plugged in for an amazing outdoor movie night experience. I like that it is small and portable so we can use it camping too. I plug in my Firestick connect it to my cell phone wifi and am good to go no matter where I am. I have another projector that is bigger bulkier and has some attributes that are better quality but for the price and size and performance this is a great deal.
2,When I plug in a usb the properties are on the side of the screen and the video is like a thumbnail. No instructions on how to fix this. Nothing I do changes this. I have emailed their customer support twice with no response.. called Amazon technical support and they can’t help. Having to return this and buy a totally different brand because I am I satisfied with this
4,Two people smarter than me about technology had lots of difficulty with this. It should be easier
1,This projector just wasn't what I thought it would be. There is no zoom functionality so if you already have a room set up this may or may not work. The image is based on the distance from the projector to the screen or wall. Not an issue if it is disclosed. Secondly this says you can mount from the bottom. When I asked I was told to remove the pads but there are no holes there. That is when I knew this was not a good purchase. The only way to mount from the bottom is to use the tripod mount but the screw provided does not secure it to any mount. So off I went to find a screw. Not super stable this way above your head. THEN you can navigate the menu which is now upside down to actually flip it. Remember no zoom so it doesn't fit. At that point this projector was packed up and sent back. I can't comment on picture quality because I never got that far and I was dizzy from hanging upside down the try to configure this projector. I would pass on this camera and look for one that has at least digital zoom and has true bottom mounting capabilities.
5,I bought this projector to change up family movie night and also to have a way to watch movies “on the big screen” outside as the weather warms up. I am happy with the picture quality things look really sharp. It was very easy to set up out of the box. I connected a usb stick that I had some home movies on it and it worked perfectly with the video and sound. I liked the feature to mirror your phone wirelessly. My Roku also is compatible with the projector and gives us more options of things to watch. On the side of the projector with all the input spaces there is a USB-T and USB. The T spot is for usbs with their own electric source and the USB spot is for a a thumb drive/non-electric source. I also like that this one has a large screw that comes with it that you can use to secure it to a tripod or like me use it angle the projector.Overall It is a great projector good value for the money and it is user friendly so you don’t need to be a tech junkie to figure it out.
3,I was really excited for this projector but ended up disappointed after using it. when I tried to connect it to my phone to play something it didn't work at all. I tried a bunch of different apps (netflix hulu youtube amazon prime etc) but all of them would give me an error message. I tried to connect it with both the Bluetooth and the cord but neither of them would work. It also wouldn't read my flash drive when I tried to play something from that but I don't know if that's the projector's fault or the flashdrive's. It still connected to my laptop though and would play everything fine on that but it was disappointing when that was the only thing that worked. The projection itself is fine fairly bright and good picture quality. The audio from the projector is a little quiet though and the fan is very loud. Overall just kinda disappointing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This projector is so nice I like it and my daughter likes it to 60 bucks well spent. If you purchase one you will be happy easy setup.
5,This projector must give everyone amway under finally can unlock various lying down to watch the movie position!Home theater sounoThe acoustics of this machine are really beyond myexpectations. When I bought it I just thought its appearancewas fashionable and small. I didn't expect the sound effect forsuch a small body. I originally planned to use it outside myhome's B&O A9 but it was completely unnecessary after Iexperienced it! Clear sound effect clear sound channel thefeeling of being in the cinema DDThe picture quality is high definition and smoothParameter what I also is not an expert anyway had compared a circle isthis price of the best one anyhow the eye tells me very true is goodgoods everybody can see the picture quality in my photo hair istrenchless motion picture also is extremely fluent the TV of the sittingroom in the home is much stronger; I directly project the screen on thewhite wall and ceiling of the bedroom the effect is already very goodthere is no need for curtain; I project the screen size difference is notappropriate 3 meters wide.
3,The instructions for this are grossly inadequate. I took this to camp thinking we could watch movies outside. I was disappointed. Theoretically connecting an HDMI dvd the the HDMI port seems like a no brainer. I could not get any audio this way. I tried an older dvd using the av (yellow red white ports) and the included adaptor. Except I sill got very very low audio. That’s ok I thought I have plenty on my phone like downloaded movie apps and downloaded movies. Think again. In order to play anything from my phone (movie apps and won’t work with screen mirroring) I needed to have an adapter from my iPhone to the VGA port.After two day of trying to figure something out I did manage to get some use from the old DVD player using the av setup.  I had to use an old computer speaker set plugged into the headphones port on the projector AND THEN hook a sound bar into the computer speakers headphones port! What?!? Too complicated and not worth it.
4,This is excellent price for a projector with good quality. It can be connected both iphone and PC. I personally would suggest using PC as the screen would be larger. Also I would suggest connect a speaker with the projector to maximize Home Theatre experience.
5,Having some prior projector experience in the good old days this Vimgo surpasses all of those legacy gadgets by miles.Aside from meeting the expectation of a bright and sharp projection it had also equipped with enough input/output ports when there’s a need for them. Notably is the 5v out USB-T port can adequately powered the Amazon Fire TV stick; where you can have that plugged into the adjacent HDMI port to watch your Prime programs. Or to be use in charging devices when they’re low on battery.Then there’s the other USB input port for streaming various formatted video files. Or when necessary you can use the VGA port for connecting a PC. Beyond that it’s also provided its wireless screen mirroring technology to make display changes when necessary. This will in turn allow the freedom of moving about while navigating the display by the use of the handset’s touch screen.In short this is a well worthwhile addition to a grownup’s toy chest.
4,This projector is so much fun. The image projection is really big but it allows you to size it up and down so any screen would work with it. It really gives you the feeling of being at the movies. The sound is not theater quality but it’s good for the price. My only reason to give it 4 starts is that the screen mirroring doesn’t work that well but it could be a network issue. Also the instructions manual is a bit confusing but nothing that a little reading can’t clarify. It’s perfect for outdoor entertainment. It connects to your iPhone with a lighting charger and to Apple TV with HDMI. Pretty cool inexpensive entertainment.
5,My wife wanted a projector for her sales job and a friend recommended this one.  With the coupon of $50 off I liked the price and decided to move ahead with the purchase. The projector is small and portable with various inputs (av/usb/hdmi) to connect to different media.  The projector can also connect wirelessly with wifi.  The picture is great and is easy to operate as my wife and kids have no problem watching their favorite videos or movies.  While I originally bought this for my wife's work she mainly uses it now for working out.Anywhere in the house with a power outlet internet and an empty wall  (Bedroom living room basement or garage) she takes the projector her iphone and her yoga mat and follows the workout on the wall.  Happy wife happy life.
4,This is a great little projector…the wife bought it for an art project where we needed to project an image on the wall. It is perfect for that! I was able to connect my iPhone via usb and mirroring. I do with I could connect my iPad though. … blu tooth would be handy. Overall it’s a great product though.
4,It's a good value projector for its price. The wifi connection is convenient and easy to setup. I used it to play some short youtube videos but I will not suggest for movies.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I used the projector to watch TV in my room. The images shows vivid color and sharp contrast. The screen is adjustable which is better than the traditional TV. As for the function I’m totally satisfied because it is easy to use and I’m bad at technology. The projector is nicely shaped and super easy to set-up in few minutes it’s has plugs included and can play instantly. The remote control can be used anywhere. The wifi connection is an easier way to streaming any content on my iphone but it might be slower depending on your internet connection. It’s great to have a wireless project and plugs at around $100. It’s reasonably priced and good quality. I am considering on ordering another one for my parents. They can have access to their own movie night in bed without moving. Nice choice if you’re looking for a mini projector with on a budget.
5,I wanted something light and small I could throw in my luggage when traveling. With a sale price and coupon I paid $100. I hit the jackpot. As other reviews state you may have to juggle settings cables for your desired input and maybe use an external speaker. Wired or Bluetooth is fine. Once it was all figured out this gem gets used nonstop. We’re about 7 ft from the wall getting 60” super clear1080p projection. Will go much much larger. Medium daylight is ok lights out is awesome!  When people text me what I’m doing I text them photo of my wall and they are instantly jealous. I was intending to upgrade and pass this on but I’ll stay with this.
5,i barely watch tv pulling out my projector is super easy and simple. lots of movie nights
5,I like this slide projector very much!  It has greatly improved my quality of life. I always use this projector to watch movies on weekends and it feels like watching a movie at home is no different from being in a movie theater. I also recently discovered that it can be connected to the Switch which is really useful when friends come to my house for a party game! Love it ! :)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Accidentally broke my 70" TV right after spending all my money on my children for Christmas!! What Obama?! And then I come across this beautiful little machine and I am so happy saved so much money and the picture that is shown and video that is shown is just on my white wall ! No backdrop no special cloth no projection screen just my wall and it covers my entire wall like I'm at a movie Theater so I have no complaints and if another TV breaks I know exactly what I'm getting to replace it lol
5,I have been using a home theater quality projector for the last few years for sports games and movie nights. The issue was that when my nieces and nephews came over they would always take it over. I needed a solution and this was the perfect fit. The quality size portability ease of setup and built in speakers is very reasonable for the price and the kids love it! Now the adults no longer need to share the big screen with the kids we both have our own.Over the last weekend I used it in the backyard to wirelessly stream music videos from my phone. The phone streaming feature was an awesome bonus  that I wasn't aware of prior to purchasing. Great versatility!

I have set it up in our bedroom behind the bed and project it directly onto the wall.  With the room dark or in low light we could now enjoy movies and watch youtube nicely comparing to previously watching over a small ipad.Thanks to its compact design it could also be mounted on a tripod my wife is also gonna use it to project her drawing for tufting. I think it's also small enough that we will be able to bring with us during group camping trips for movie nights.If you have available space you may consider the bigger and more high-resolution version to get an improved image.
4,For the price I got it just cannot ask for more. Easy to set-up decent picture quality and very quite unlike some other projector.Two things I wish for one is a longer power cord to get to the desired angle. The other may be a bit wishful thinking at the price but would be great if it has better brightness so I can also use it during the day.
5,This is a VERY reasonably priced yet full-featured projector for normal household use. If you’re looking for something to throw movies or TV shows up on a cheap screen for your family to enjoy THIS is your projector. Easy to set up it has the normal focus ring around the lens & other features you’re used to as well as all the input jacks you’ll need for your home theater.I bought a cheap sound bar to go with it because while the speakers do fill a room they’re not the loudest.I’ve hooked my MacBook up to it (with my own HDMI dongle) and watched a movie on a bedsheet using my AppleTV and the included HDMI cable.Good to go right out of the box. AND the instructions are well written too.
3,I was so excited to get this. But I was disappointed at every turn the first few times I used it. Nothing on my iPhone worked wirelessly as advertised. Except YouTube….. but I don’t pay for streaming services to be forced to watch YouTube….. so I tried my fire stick. Worked well with Hulu. Nothing else. HBO max Disney+ and even Netflix had video but no sound. Tonight I decided to try something different and connected it to the Xbox. We watched Nightmare Before Christmas on Disney+ and everything worked perfectly. Used an aux cable to connect a speaker and projected to a 20ft screen outside. Finally I feel like it’s working halfway correctly.
4,I bought this as a gift and they seem to be very happy with it
4,Keystone broke on the first use the customer service staff never stopped helping.  They seem very honest and dedicated to solving any issue with their product.
5,This is a very portable little projector which while the picture quality brightness and function of the remote are outstanding that’s not all it has to offer.This projector has all the various inputs you could need and it will also mirror with your source if you want it to.The focus is simple and it will “keystone” vertically to let you level your image. It has a headphone out put jack which we have used to connect to a larger speaker allowing us to fill a larger space.Altogether a very good projector which we definitely recommend!!!
5,I took it with me twice this year for road trip. We use it for an out door movie night it works great for 5 people on a large portable screen. The brightness is enough for our out door movie I didn’t expect this one could beat any pro projector in daylight or with a pro setup I use it for out door and trips. It also works great in my back yard. Very balanced  portability and picture quality. Really nice experience with it!
5,This is a great product. I wanted something that can allow me to watch sports events movies etc on a larger screen than my laptop or desktop monitor (32') and at the same time not cost too much as a huge TV would cost. This product so far works wonderfully for me. As you can see in the images even when there's light in the same room the projected image is still sharp and bright. The projector also has very easy to use interface. There's also all sorts of ports that the projector supports so I am pretty sure it can cover all sorts of usage scenarios. At $99 this is a great purchase. Would definitely recommend!
5,I have been using this product for a couple months now and I think it's time to share my review. The project is very easy to set up. You can use HDMI USB to connect to any device. I can connect it my Chrome Cast and it's very easy to project video with it. The quality is super great too! I really like this projector. Overall it's great quality. I'm happy to use it everyday while I am running on my treadmill.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a wonderful projector. It has a low price excellent quality and is a great gift option. I keep it in my bedroom for watching movies or TV shows. It's so easy to use that you only need to connect two cables to make it work. The sound from the hi-fi speakers brings you the experience of being in a movie theater. Amazing. Finally the after-sales service is perfect. They offer detailed guidance and help when you encounter difficulties. You never have to worry about getting stuck.
5,I'll never go back to a TV.It's a projector. So don't expect it to be bright in the daytime like a TV would.Although it works for my needs. It's lightweight. The fact I can just move my setup to any room easily since I rest it on a table. If I wasn't cheap I would buy one for each room where I want to view.It's fun projecting game play on the oculus via fire stick.
5,A friend recommended this projector to me and it works surprisingly well for the price! Does not take up a lot of space and both my iPhone and my laptop can connect to it wireless and play videos and movies at high definition without any lag at all. It is good that I do not have to sit in front of my desk all day anymore! The machine does make a bit of noise but at about the same level as my laptop so totally acceptable.
4,It’s cheap for a reason. Only works at night. Audio is ok but if you are in a open space or more kids around you need to bring speakers to listen. The option to share screen via IOS works if you are offline only  (AirPlay works vía wifi connection provided by the projector so no internet available at the same time).
5,bought this for entertainmentwatching video and movies. we use it as TV at bedroom. I though it is better to spend more money to buy a TV when I just watching the online shows and movices. Saving more room and more money. I do need to buy extra white board for display. my light yellow wall is great to display. And it has super clear insturction for connect the phone and projector. I recommend to buy a USB C to USB Hub adpter for iphone to connect this projector.  becuase if it is connect wireless it will use the Cellula (saving data).
4,I was hoping to use this to stream movies from Netflix via wifi and such to watch in my bedroom without getting a TV. I wish they had mentioned due to copyright issues I was unable to do so in the description of this item before purchasing. Very disappointed.
2,While this projector “might” be ok for a small audience in a small room sitting right behind the projector it is useless for a larger room if any detail needs to be seen. Picture clarity can be focused in the middle of the screen or the edges but not both. Portability is about the only good thing I can say about this projector. It is lightweight and the size is convenient. But I sadly suppose that quality is lost for this design. Not worth the money unless you need something portable in close-quarter projection scenario.
5,I had used this projector for few months. If you have enough space buy an TV definitely will be a good choice if you like me live in NYC rent a small room this projector you can add to your cart . As it is price  I don’t complain it.  I am so glad to have it in my small room and I also recommend it to my friends they like it a lot!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The first purchase did not work right out of the box. No power at all actually not even a power indicator light. Just an empty hole where it was suppose to be. Customer service is by email and they respond 2 days later telling me I must not be pushing the power button and that I should try a different outlet or power cord. They insisted I send them a video of me trying to power it on. Finally they said to return it to Amazon (which I already told them I was going to do. Amazon replaced it but the second one came out of the box with the plastic wrapping shoved in the box twist ties off and parts lying loose it  would not connect to my IOS devices wired or wireless. Another week of emails telling me to try different cords reboot my devices check my wifi etc… the screen to connect to wifi had a strange password unlike the one I was prompted to use. It must have been reset by the person who had it before me. The screen would go black 3 seconds after the screen appeared to sign onto the wifi. I’m just returned it for refund and will not consider buying another until they figure out the kinks in this product and improve customer service. The final response from the manufacture claimed it was Amazons fault I was sent a used product.
4,Now that I’ve finally figured out how to get audio for my fire stick everything seems to be great. If you’re having the same issue where everything works but Netflix and a couple other apps; try going into your <Firestick Settings<Audio<Turn off Dolby Digital> & problems solved
5,The product is good with great quality. And it's easy to figure out the functions and there are different ways to project the screens such as HDMI VGA USB and AV Connection and also works well with screen mirroring with a phone. I've been using it on my wall and watch movies from bed. The picture quality is satisfying and good. I'd recommend the purchase. Only the appearance of the product can be upgraded to be fancier.
5,My desktop monitor was too small for ring fit adventure so I got this. Now I work out in my living room. I don’t have a screen but it still projects pretty nicely onto the wall. I’ve tried it with a PS4 and a laptop too and both work well. I also wanted to project my phone but the sometimes it disconnects without any reason so I only do it occasionally.
5,We've used a few projectors over the years and this one is definitely the best. Light weight compact size and sleek design. Images are sharp and clear comparable to 4KHD TV but on a much larger screen. Good Wifi connectivity can play from both PC and phone. Also includes built-in speaker. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a home theatre experience.
5,The projector is easy to install either Wifi and HDMI.I use my white wall to show how movie easy showing on the wall. My parents love to watch YouTube use the projector. Use the wall saves money too.I use three days it has no problem playing many different video formats. The projector has cooling fan which  is almost noiselessIt very small light and easily collect in the rack.It also has perfect sound playing. I connect my Bluetooth earphone my parents use the project sound is good too.
5,Very happy with this product I can watch movie and YouTube with my kids in the bed. Pictures are clear and sounds are great. Highly recommend it to students that sometimes needs to move different places . My daughter is moving soon therefore she also want one for her new place. I like the projector’s colour and size. It is perfect for families with kids. I had a great time with my family watching movies in the bedroom and living room. If you want yo watch Netflix with this protector you might need a chrome cast for the best outcome.
3,The picture quality was great. The volume is good for some things other times it doesn’t go loud enough and is difficult to hear unless you are right next to it. It also only works with some apps and media. For example Bluetooth didn’t work neither did directly plugging it in from my phone. I didn’t try an hdmi cord so the only way it worked was through the Amazon fire stick. When using the fire stick Amazon prime doesn’t work (the audio doesn’t come through) and some other streaming platforms I have trouble streaming on. Netflix is the only one that seems to work a majority of the time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 First I project a movie on the wall. It looked great on the white wall but I wanted to get a better picture so I bought a projector screen. And that's all! Now I have my home theater. The projector audio level is a little low so I used Alexa as a speaker. The only issue that I have is when I play a video on my phone it doesn't turn horizontally. It shows my phone vertically only. I'm using my laptop with an HDMI cable to cast a movie or a TV channel on the screen. Easy to set up.
5,I love it!I bought a projector for my daughter’s room a while back and it’s been my favorite purchase since.I had been wanting another one for the living room for movie nights and this one’s perfect.It’s got great definition and the internal speaker surprised me (I wasn’t expecting it to sound so loud... it reaches a higher volume than my old one).The brightness surprised me too it looks pretty good even when it’s not totally dark but complete darkness of much better.If you want to bring the movie theatre home especially during these COVID times you should definitely get this 😁
4,We don’t use a TV enough to justify the space is takes up. So we bought this to replace a TV. We love it! I would recommend buying a separate speaker but it’s worth it! Our family feels like we are at a movie theatre!
5,I really love this projector. I’ve been using the projector in the past 2 months and watched tons of shows on YouTube and Netflix. My friends came over a couple days ago and asked me where I got the projector.I’m using iPhone to connect with the projector. The Bluetooth connection is fast and stable with no interruption. Would def recommend!
2,Don’t work and I order another the same and dint work also so I send this one back  disappointment
5,We bought this projector to play games on a larger screen. This is our first time purchasing a projector and to our surprise it projects my video games pretty clearly onto the wall. It is also easy to setup and connect to devices. Also very reliable we had no problem using this projector for a good few months.
5,Wanna win Halloween? 🎃 We bought this to upgrade from our other projector for outdoor Halloween and Christmas animated displays. At 1024p resolution and with crisp color and dark contrasts it does want I want and more! Using with USB once you select the clips you want it to play it will repeat through them on loop so you just set it and can walk away. Our display is the hit of the neighborhood!
4,Delivery was fast but giving 4 stars because it was delivered in the original package without extra security box can easily be opened damaged and also projector can surfer damage. Brought this to give as a present for my daughter so can’t review about product quality.
4,Great customer service with rapid response. Clear picture however difficult to connect my smartphone (Google Pixel 3a) to it. Otherwise a great introductory projector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Try to get a projector for my dining room for a long time. And decided  to purchase this one it really doesn’t disappoint me at all.First of all it shipped in with a nice cute hard box and keep out the damage. And most importantly the quality of the pictures is amazing. To be honest it is over my expectation for a projector like this price. And lastly it’s easy to set up and connect to the device you want to use. I would like to recommend this one.
3,It's a dump projector need a PC laptop roku or similar to work like it shows on the ad. Aside of that it's a product that Will make You a run for your money.
5,This product is easy to setup everything works smoothly after connecting to my computer. I've been using this for watching live streaming for a couple months now and no issue so far.It has built in speaker so no need for additional sound device.Definitely worth the money for this price range.
5,Bought this a few months back for a Christmas present for my kids. They love it! Great quality and the sound is surprisingly really good! They hooked it up to their Nintendo switch and had a blast! Can’t wait for summer to do movies in the back yard!
5,I was looking for a small easily portable device for occasional Powerpoint presentations. This serves the purpose well!
5,Pros :1. Very low disturbance sound of fan while playing movie etc.2. Not getting hot while playing3. Good quality in such economic price.4. very compactCons :1. Power Cable length is very short. Extension required.2. Screen mirror takes some time. Mobile wi fi disconnected while screen mirror.3. Sharpness is not as per expectation.Suggestions:1. Keep straight and in middle for best result.2. Additional speaker require for good sound effects.Overall : I am fully satisfied with projector as economic price and quality
5,I propped the projector on end with a few boxes under it to allow clearance for the power cable connection and the air circulation vent (both of which are in the rear of the projector). It sat safely and securely directed upward onto the ceiling at a distance of about 6 feet.I have a Samsung phone and used an HDMI cable to connect it to the projector.
5,We would recommend this projector to every family with kids! With larger screen and free blue light It can definitely protect kids' eyes! My kid is 4 years old and he likes watching cartoon which we are worrying his eyes. As a result we decided to buy a projector for him. We are so lucky that we choose this VIMGO projector with good quality and high resolution! It makes his eyes comfortable. We love it!!!!
5,It was delivered very fast and easy to set up and ease to use. It has enough features I need without a hefty price tag which makes it a good entry-level projector for home or office use. The clarity of the image and brightness are great and overall it's a very good machine.
5,This is the best mini projector I have used. The box can fit in a small backpack comfortably. I brought with me on a camping trip and it was great.Even though it’s not super bright it’s enough for a dark room. The machine is pretty quite while functioning as well
5,Update: I was having trouble with intermittent sound using an Amazon Firestick. Seller was quick to help with a couple back and forth messages that totally fixed the issue. Very happy with the projector now and pleased with the quick service! Thanks!Protip: I turn the projector on its back on the edge of a table and watch movies on the ceiling and while I lay in bed. Game changer.
3,Listen I get that it's a cheap Chinese projector.  But don't advertise for 9800 lumens.  This outputs barely over 2500 lumens..I would absolutely never waste my money again on this cheap piece of 💩 poop projector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just bought this projector for playing fitness games on Switch(Though I took picture of MHR). There are plenty of ports to use ( HDMI VGA USB and AV Connection) and worked with screen mirroring with a phone. I have to say this projector has a greater picture quality than I uploaded. It just played on the curtain although it was bright outside the picture was very clear and totally watchable. Also it not heavy at all! I love it.
5,This is such great projector for the price. I have owned several projectors before and I have to say this can match the higher end ones I have had. Great for movie nights and gaming. The image quality is amazing. Picture is clear and very bright. It could be a bit of a hassle to set up sometimes but I imagine that would be the case for any projector. Overall it’s a great projector.
5,Very good product. I can directly use my phone control that via share WiFi at home. The quality is so great and clear in both living room and bedroom.Also easy set up only few easy steps.I really like it!
5,I bought this projector and absolutely love it! It is really easy to use and the software is very intuitive. The colors of display is very clear especially when the light is dimmed. Watching the projector screening has become a favorite activity for me and my family.
5,Amazon logistics delivery is very fast the next day arrived the interface is rich many ways to connect but also can directly surf the Internet to watch movies the picture is very clear I was directly projected on the wall than the projector I bought before much clearer I can use to play Switch games.If there is a problem I will call customer service and the customer service will respond very quickly very good.
5,The product is very compactly designed and portable. Setup is quite easy and intuitive. The graphic and sound quality are both great and are comparable to my other projector which is at a higher price. Overall this is a great product at its price.
5,I got this projector for my media room because I don’t want a TV to be mounted to the wall. This works perfectly. When I’m not using it I can put it away. I can also link my karaoke microphone with it. I love it.
5,The brightness looks okay in a lighted room but works better in a dark context. Supports airplay when connected to the same wifi and the streaming is smooth. Might need an extra stand/tripod to better adjust the picture displayed.
5,It’s a nice projector with a  good price. Easy to to set up. It’s also very light and I can easily move it around. I use it to watch movies with my friends and the quality of videos are pretty good. Nice to have it.
5,I brought this project for my a friend reunion even and use it with chromecast. The USB power is enough to drive chromecast and works perfectly with it. I use the projector to watch netflix and youtube with my friends. The project also comes with speakers in built. The picture quality and brightness are both good. We all enjoy the projector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Really easy to set up plug it in- connected to local wifi-start mirroring from the device. Built-in speaker is loud and clear. Now we have a device to do exercise together easy! Only thing needed is probably an extension cord so you can place it somewhere more desirable without obstacles. We place it on a surface guess a ceiling installation maybe another option.
5,This product makes your room like a mini theatre! Easy to use but recommend to use HDMI to connect to get a better picture quality. I use it in my room and my child like to use it watch video too. highly recommend !
5,fair price for this projector. it is easy to use. if you using hdmi to connect to it it will be better than using wifi. for this price i would recommend this one since it has enough bright.
5,The product looks beautiful. It's easy to connect and set up. I particularly liked its portability. You can easily carry it out when you're on a vacation. It's a good value for the price. I would recommend it to my friend.
5,Really like this projector! It is very user-friendly and it can be connected with my iPad wirelessly. Its picture quality is good and it's light and beautiful. With this projector I enjoy movies every night!
5,I love it! I think it is the best option for this price. The picture quality is good it can also connect to WiFi. It is easy to understand how to use. A life saver when you can’t afford a big TV.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Uploaded a video of this powerful little projector in action playing a youtube video from my PHONE. You can connect with wifi or just your charging cable. The picture is crisp clean and the sound is great too. If you want to play Netflix or provider like that you'll need a fire stick. Great bang for your buck with this one and just in time for summer movie nights under the stars!
5,It could be connected with or without cable gives much flexibility. The angle is adjustable. Easy to operate with clear instructions.The only con found so far is some mechanical noise albeit the audio functions well.
5,Thanks to this projector I could enjoy watching movie at home during the pandemic. It is high quality and easy to use. Just connecting with the HDMI cable everything is perfect! I really enjoy this product. It’s totally worth!
5,This projector works perfect for setting up a home theater! It is easy to set up and can be used with phones and laptops. The video and audio quality is great especially considering the price. I absolutely recommend it!
5,The picture and brightness on this thing are good enough. It's nearly perfect for the price. The only thing that holds it back is the inability to adjust the size of the screen so you need to carefully calculate distance.
5,i have been using this product for several months now. The projection quality is great that I am very imprseed with the clearness of the view. Great product for family movie night and I highly recommend it!
5,I originally had an issue with the audio but VIMGO Customer Service was able to help me. They were VERY prompt and helpful. I would recommend this Projector and this company to anyone as they have integrity and will make sure the customer is happy with their purchase no kidding!
5,The shipping was very fast. Got it 3 days earlier. IT IS portable and very convenient for using at home and in my office. The quality sharpness and brightness of this projector is very impressive for such a portable size. It’s very simple and easy to use especially you have a remote to control it. It’s really fun for family movie time. Lol. Kid loves it
5,I have been using it in my bedroom. So far so good. Picture quality is decent. I usually linked it to my iphone and the transmission is fine no lag. Noise level is also decent. I usually play it before bedtime and there is no concern about the noise and heat it produces.
5,Very fast shipping! This projector has good packaging and nice white look. It is easy to set up and supports connection using HDMI VGA Screen mirroring and USB. It also comes with a HDMI cable.The project itself is light and easy to move. I tried it in my bedroom and I love the image quality. Great purchase for this project range.
5,We bought this projector for playing videos on wall mainly for kid. It's very easy to use and the projected content is very clear with high resolution. The focal and keystone adjustment process is very straightforward. The effect is also good. We were able to set up and play clear videos within minutes. Highly recommend this product.
5,Loved this! The cell phone connection is stable and clear. I have always been looking for a projector that could be connected to my phone and this projector works the best so far.
4,The projector is small and cute in appearance easy to carry and the projection screen is clear.
5,I have always wanted to buy one and put it in our new house so that my husband and I can watch  movies in our bedroom which is convenient and practical!  Compared with TV it saves more space，very satisfied that we can buy such good projector at this price！
3,I haven’t gotten any sound from projector and the picture quality is not sharp as I would expect it to be
5,Good to have it as my first projector. Easy to install and connect to my devices. Very friendly to new users. I placed it in my bedroom and it is very nice to watch movies at night.
5,This projector is definitely worth its price. It’s small and portable family can easily bring it to camp and enjoy a camping movie night. The images are clear and bright. It doesn’t have disturbing noice so I really like it. I will buy another one for my living room.
5,I've been toying with the idea in buying a new 65' tv however no need now since I've bought this projector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've never had a projector before. Bought this one for my bedroom since it comes with a large white wall. The manual is easy to follow. It took me only 1 minute to set up everything and adjust the resolution. The quality is pretty good. Turn off the light and you will feel like in a theater.
5,This is a shopping that I am very satisfied with. The projector is exactly what I need. The usage is very simple and works well. I will buy it again if needed in the future
5,It is portable with great brightness and high definition. It comes with all the cables and remote control that you will need and very easy to use. Love the keystone function that adds tilt adjustment to the focus function making the view more clear. Very suitable for a family movie night! Can also be used during a trip to add more fun!
5,I connect this to an Apple TV in my bedroom. Overall it’s a good projector that meets my needs for a secondary TV screen. The brightness is good at night. Quality is good as well.
5,I bought a larger projector last year during the pandemic. It’s a bit bulky to cart around. This one takes so little space and has so much bulb brightness for its size we don’t even take the other one out anymore. Plus the wifi connection was super easy to stream content from my iPhone. I’m impressed with this value projector that has no discernible trade offs.
3,Looks like it has potential but no matter how straight I try to get the screen it’s crooked. The Airplay function gives me issues every single time and the plug and play feature never works for my iPhone despite connecting with original cable. Want to return
5,I would totally recommend this to anyone! But need the projected you do Screen or else it'll look slightly blurry. The audio quality is good pretty Loud for it's size. Love that it came with a control. My husband connected To the Xbox so we just used the controller. It's Portable and small. Would recommend this
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very handy device easy to use: work with either phone or hdmi.Good picture quality.Convenient: Projector is integrated with a speaker then we don’t need connect with a separate speaker.
5,I bought this projector that's recommended by my friend. It's great for its portability. The design is pretty neat and clean. It's very easy to use and adds a lot of fun for my life. The quality is good for its size.
2,All I wanted was to project my images onto canvases to trace. Does this projector do that? Well yeah sort of. It's a pain to focus. You have to use your finger nails to grip the shallow groves in the focus wheel which itself doesn't turn easily. Plus the keystone is a joke. If you're not projecting at a 90 degree angle you have to rely on a keystone that cannot give you an even focused image. Bottom in focus - top out of focus. Top in focus - bottom out of focus. The tripod that comes with the projector doesn't work. The projector sags under it's own weight so I'm using my own tripod. Picture sure is bright though.
5,This projector is every easy to use and it is portable. I took it with me for camping movie night. It has good effect and all movies are clear to watch it.
5,This projector is perfect for home use.  It's easy to set up and has great picture quality. I would recommend this one to other friends as well.
5,For the money this projector is IT! It was extremely easy to setup I used my Roku stick and it was seamless. The speaker isn’t great but it does the trick. I would just recommend using actual speakers to go with it. Honestly I don’t have anything to complain about. Movie night’s just got way better :)
5,I like this projector it is easy to use and it is very clear. I can use this projector to watch movie and pictures. It  provide wire to connect it with computer. It is comfortable to use this projector instead of my phone when I do exercise follow a video.For this price the quality is good.
5,It's very light so you can carry it anywhere you like. I use it for kids cartoon mostly. Solid quality and features. I wish it could support sync with speakers since its embedded speaker is not that loud. Overall it's a good product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Me and my husband use this projector in our bedroom to cast sleeping music and let me tell you it is amazing. the picture quality is super good and does the job perfectly. We also use it to project movies outside in the backyard for movie night and it gives of as good a picture as it does inside. we love it.
5,The image is great while it being super portable. The screen mirroring also makes it very convenient to watch online videos.
5,This is a nice and handy projector that is very easy to set up.  The overall picture quality is ok for watching movies or TV.  Very user-friendly and compatible with cellphone USB devices and laptops.  I also tried for document files and it is not that very good.  Anyways quite worth spending such amount for a projector.
5,I like it so far!Working pretty well with my phone 😃Picture quality is okay just don't put it close to a natural light source. So far so good.
5,After a period of use I think the experience is very good the light of the projector is very bright and the sound is very clear and the degree of heat generation is within an acceptable range. The only shortcoming is that the logistics time is a bit long.
5,This projector is absolutely the best purchase I have made on Amazon! Wish I could stream Netflix off of my phone instead of a fire stick/computer but other than that it’s great! :)
5,I like it when we are looking movie at night the brightness is good and no need to move my TV in the livingroom.
5,Really great projector at the price range. High resolution decent brightness easy to use and connect to various devices. Fits the need I am looking for.
5,So far I used it once and I'm impressed with it.
5,Vey useful projector it was easy to connect by WIFI or use HDMI. The video quality was very nice it was similar video quality vs my television. The set up was quite easy as well. Very nice shooping experience will think about buy again!
5,Great projector for the price as its compact size easy connection acceptable brightness and resolution. Of course it can’t be comparable to professional projectors but if you want to experience big screen it is definitely a good choice!
5,It works great as a projector. Can be used with wire or bluetooth. The picture is clear and bright and large enough.
5,This is a great projector with high quality image. I like how easy it is to work with both my laptop and iPhone. It is quiet during running. Also very light and compact so I can move it around with ease.Have been using it for a week and it works perfectly.
5,It is a very cute projector it works wonderfully just liked the big one in my company. I am moving to a new home it’s for a big wall that in my new house.  It has very clear image and it works very easy mirroring my phone just perfect for iPhone users.
4,It is okay but wifi connection is so slow
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The picture quality is very good. The projector is great for watching movies with friends. I watched my favorite tv show with it and I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Light easy to use projector with internal sound. The connection is pretty convenient with either HDMI to a laptop or cast by a phone. Setting it up is straightforward and the quality of video is pretty nice. Would be a nice addition if you are doing karaoke or sports nights.
5,Nice projector! I was surprised how great picture quality was even without a white screen. It is light and quiet.  We connected it to a laptop and it worked well! Love the fact that it can be used outdoors so planning to watch some movies in our backyard when it gets warmer. Great value for the money.
5,Perfect device to create good vib at home for friends gathering. The picture quality is good for me. Fair price
5,I am obsessed! This little projector was totally plug and play. It is small with a huge clear picture. Takes up my whole wall. It doesn’t run hot or noisy. I plugged my fire stick in and watched movies all night. Highly recommend! You’re going to get a lot of bang for your buck on this one.
5,- I love this projector! It let me go over the touching story Hachi again in my bedroom. If it is a necessity bring your Apple TV from living room to bedroom. That’s how I fix it. And it worked just fine. Brightness is perfect when dark; picture quality is high; remote control is super.
5,Very clear videos from this projector! Another added plus is the easy portability. I've been lying in bed to watch videos all day long.
5,I always have this empty wall in my room that I don't know what to do with it ，so I decided to buy a projector. This projector actually surprised with the quality and clearness that it give. Definitely worth the price. Planning to but another for my friends birthday gift.
5,Good product for this price. Easy to use and easy to store. Work well with my phone. I used it playing background video in baby’s play room.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to setup vibrant color and easy to adjust display size. Great value for the money. It charges my phone while projecting which is nice. Great home projector for movie night or just phone projector for presentation.
5,This projector is amazing!!! Light weight easy to set up and great picture quality. I set it up in the living room and it creates a wonderful theater atmosphere. With that I enjoy my movie nights even more. Totally worth a 5 star!!!!
4,Great projector! Easy set up
3,Is really hard to calibrate and the picture borders are bad
5,My family enjoyed the movie time in the basement.The movie quality is good. I suggest to buy a google chromecast to if you want to put  it on the ceiling position . Project’s effect is a lot different than TV . My kids love it.
1,Horrible product it’s so hard to connect to WiFi or phone picture the worse I ever seen PLEASE DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY
5,This is my first time got this introduced from my friend.it for family movie day At my basement room.The clear image  clear just like movie theaters This machine connection is simple and easy.This projector makes it so easy good recommend.
5,It's perfectly well！I set in the bedroom.The quality and price is value！The picture is my baby watching cocomelon song～He is sooo happy.I also use it to watch moive.It do great job！Like it so much！Come on buy it now！
5,Got this for my dad so he can watch movies while he is in his pool. He looooves it. Not quite BT friendly but connects via cord really well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Projector was by far one of the best I have used so far. Great video quality audio quality perfect for late night movies! Everything was satisfactory and the projector was exactly how it was advertised. I’m a happy customer!
5,This projector works really well because it projects well and clear. This projector can take wifi and it is very portable. The range is also very nice and well.
5,I love how it came with HTMI cords and it’s very easy to use!
2,The price is this projectors only saving grace. I cannot focus the whole image. Either the top is crystal clear and the bottom is blurry or visa versa. And then there are the specks. So many specks small ones big ones riddled everywhere. This unit is half the size of my previous projector so it would be very portable but I question if it's worth all the other issues.
2,First I received a product that has been used already even though it's claimed by seller as brand new. The box has tears already. Second I bought this to replace a 720p native projector but the videos are not as crisp as I thought it would be. Third the keystone correction is just a pain to adjust. I cannot find the sweet spot where everything will be clear . There's always a corner or side that is blurred no matter how much adjustment you do with the keystone. I will be looking for something else.
5,it can rotate so you can watch it at an angle or on the ceiling. also easily adjusted focus. haven’t watched anything on it so far but you just need your charger wire for iphone and it mirrors your phone. super easy and so far i love it!
1,Light went out after about a year and now i have to upgrade when its said it has 55000 hours of life on it definitely was nott 55000 more like 1000 projecter should definitely be cheaper for the time it lasts juss a warning before anyone else buys  u will need to upgrade in a year or less
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The projector is exactly what I need. The size is suitable to watch movies in my room. I like the brightness and can hear clear sounds. I adjust to the angle I preferred. Love it!
5,Pretty good product easy to install and use. Very convenient and can directly use on my wall.
5,good picture quality easy connection to iPhone especially good sound quality. In just a few minutes I set it up in the bedroom it is a big plus to have some projector for movies
1,Took an act of God to get the lens cover off as it arrived wedged in and not aligned. Once we did that after a bit of fighting we finally got it connect to a few devices including the Fire Stick. However the tri-pod broke instantly as it refuses to support the weight of the machine (yes we had it locked). We set it on the table went to adjust the keystone and then the keystone toggle gave out and just slips back and forth loosely without doing anything so that’s broken as well. The picture is lovely and the sound isn’t bad for the size of the unit. Even with that being said I would not recommend this…nothing about it was QC’d. It’s been out of the box for 30 minutes and is now useless :( maybe it was just bad luck but for so many things to fail after not even a single use is pretty telling.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this product initially the output was grainy but I’ve changed the cable using and HDMI cable and a splitter the definition’s HD now however I’m still trying to figure out where to attached the speakers……
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love this projector for the price! Great for the size and super easy to set up. I purchased this so I can add some nice ambience to my room. It was also easy to sync to my phone and wire to other devices.
5,The video quality came out great and setting this up was surprisingly easy! We used this last night to watch a horror movie the projector made the experience much more realistic and enjoyable. Great for a small gathering of friends and family.
5,Pretty good product for the price like this. It has everything including speaker built in so you dont need anything else to get it running.
5,Product works perfect w/blue tooth and has a solid picture. Was able to project onto the side of a building and it worked great! Highly recommend
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just received this projector and let me tell you!!!! I don’t even need a TV! 🤣🤣 I’m not even using a screen and the picture quality is amazing! Connected to my Samsung sound system it’s literally a home theater 10/10!!!
5,The image and stereo sound the vimgo projector delivers also astonishing ，it's performance is outdistance competitors.I was planning to have a home movie night in my backyard next weekend.the 200”Display will surely bring a cinema vibe to that night.LOL
5,Fast shipping! This projector is easy to use! It supports HDMI VGA screen mirroring and USB. I tried screen mirroring and HDMI and it works great! The built-in speaker sounds great. The picture is clear and bright! Love it!
5,I was looking for a good projector for camping so I checked the top ten and this one came in #7 amongst  $1000+ models so I gave it a shot and I'm more than impressed with the performance for the money.
5,Nice projector with easy set up and navigation. Great for watching a movie or sports with a clear picture. The cooling fan does make some noise but it is not disruptive. Overall a nice projector
5,Impressive! The quality of the video is clear & the sound is pretty loud for its size. Its compact and looks sleek! Can’t wait to do movies on the lawn for now the home walls are GREAT!
1,Please read this before you actually buy this- spend $100 more for something else- airplay is very delayed and half the apps give you error codes. It's like watching videos from 1980- sound is absolutely terrible. Plan on getting Bluetooth speaker- I was thought to believe I could adjust picture size based on how far away the projector was.  Maybe I was incorrect but no this is not what I believed to be true- unless you are in PITCH BLACK ROOM there is no way this is 1080.- this unit feels like there is no way it last more than a week anywhere- if you cannot spend more then $140. Then fine I get it.  They claim you can watch this in daylight.  No way.....BUYER BEWARE.  Cannot return this fast enough trusted buyer **
2,I really want to like this projector but the darn thing won’t work with my apple devices.  I dug around and found my original apple cord and could get the screen mirroring to work but it kept stalling out at the movies.  I tried multiple apple devices.  I finally plugged a Roku into it and it will play movies but the USB and wireless just won’t work.  The picture quality looks good now that something plays.
5,I bought it for my phone game where I can mirror my phone up on a wall without having to looks at the smaller screen all the time the latency is rather low and works just fine!
5,This projector is worth the price! my last one costed me about 1k Optoma brand the picture quality is really almost the same to me if you're looking for a cheap and quality picture projectors you're looking at it!
5,First I tried to see how it would work for a security system I have and it looks and works great and so easy to connect. For a projector it really has good quality for the money! Definitely would recommend!
5,Enjoy my evening since I got this projector. It’s really nice to use the projector especially when you want to take photos with the background. Recommend!
5,Small light and very portable. Brightness is good and image quality is also good. Worth it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Good value for money easy to use.The picture quality is quite good even I open the light. It’s a great choice for my bedroom cinema.
5,the projector is easy to set up. Compare to other product in this price range I would say this one provide best quality. It also work perfectly with my iphone.
5,picture quality is totally acceptable compare with this price and I have get rid of TV since I got this projector very easy for operating can either connected with wire or air play.
5,very bright and great for watching and even presenting as long as it's in big font
3,Nice but to many things just to connect to wifi and not very bright
5,This thing is amazing. Anyone can watch on a white screen. I tried a brown screen and the picture is still great. Definitely worth the price. My pictures do not do any justice the picture quality is great.
5,Easy to use pretty much can hook anything up to it (computer iPad iPhone etc).  Used it for outdoor movie night.  Great quality projection.
5,This is the best gift for my girlfriend's birthday! Beautiful shape nice quality and amazing picture quality. I can't wait to watch movie and TV shows with her! Love it!
5,It's so easy to use and set up! Great picture. Great sound. I'm thrilled that movie nights have been taken up a few notches with this little powerhouse.
5,This product is great for my Halloween projection and picture is very clear
5,Nice price . Good quality. It is very easy to use. My daughter said we had a movie theater now.  It is good to display in room.
5,I really like this product it is more than I expected. Well packaged. Surpringly it can use with the light. Easy to control and monitor. Worth it
5,Bought this mini projector for my daughter last week and she was thrilled to have it. Pretty decent image for the price and it works on HDMI.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Simple and easy to navigate. Really pleased with the colour and quality of the image. Pretty light and I can carry it around. Defo worth the money.
5,This projector provides excellent picture quality and the sound is so great. My kids are so enjoy to watch it. It is so easy to setup. Overall a great buy! Would definitely recommend!
5,This has been fun to use in the backyard!  I am glad I bought it.
1,Estaba claro que este producto no es recomendado para hacer presentaciones y si para reproduccion de contenido multimedia pero tanto la calidad de producto como su imagen deja mucho que desear al tener un brillo muy bajo se hace muy dificil de apreciar las imagenes si la sala donde se esta proyectando no es 100% oscura tambien al no tener soportes moviles para graduar la altura se convierte en un problema trae un tripode que no puede con el propio peso del equipo asi que no funciona. En resumen es un equipo que puedes utilizarlo como TV de noche cuando no hay ningun tipo de luz y tienes un resultado mediano y por el precio para ese uso recomendaria un tv.
5,The design is very cute. I used it to connect phone via WiFi to watch movie in my bedroom and it works great !
5,Good quality. Convenient.  Wireless connection is easy.
5,The picture quality is great and it’s quieter than the last $100 range projector I bought and much smaller. You get a good bang for your buck with this one!
5,This projector is great for movie nights at home!!  We also use it while camping.  Well with the money.
5,Had a wonderful time with friends and family on our outdoor movie night.
5,This projector is amazing for the price! Super easy to setup comes with everything you need and the picture is so clear. Definitely recommend!
5,Nice and modern look. Portable with high quality.  There's a small controller in the package which makes it more convenient to use.
2,Wanted to have a movie night with family in the back yard. The first one they sent would not stay connect to smart view on my phone so it was cut short. Then I returned it and got a new one and the projectors not even lighting up or projecting anything guess that what you get for paying 65 dollars for a projector.
5,very good designeasy to set upwith the couponsaved dozens of dollar.Had a wonderful family movie night by using it.
2,Connects quickly but only stays connected to you tube. Hulu netflix and Disney loose connections immediately after it begins to stream.
5,We bought this projector to watch movies outside and it works great. It was quick and easy to set up. Great value for the price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I tried this in my bedroom and so far I really like it.  A very economic projector!
5,Super good product! Multiple connection method and high resolution! Can’t wait to use it to have a movie night!!!
2,got this item and was disappointed right away. the tripod that comes with the projector broke right away. the brightness is not that great even in a complete dark room. the build quality isnt there and the user interface looks cheaply created. please look somewhere else or spend a little bit more and save yourself some hassle.
1,I would give this zero stars if that was possible. This doesn't connect to ANYTHING. In the video the wifi automatically appears on the screen in the example well MINE DOESN"T SHOW ANYTHING. It says it is 'plug and play'...not this piece of junk. I've tried 5 computers 3 phones every different port and wire and it didn't connect to anything. I had this in the box for a while until its intended purpose. Now I have figure out some other way to project which was integral in my business plan and THIS MISTAKE of a purchase has caused me loss of time and money. WHY DO THEY BOTHER SELLING THIS and who writes the bs rave reviews of this dust collector now in the trash? DISGUSTED
5,it was good. i can watch netflix from bed really easy now. good quality as well
5,Excellent projector!
5,This projector is not very big I like it very much it meets my requirements and it is easy to carry
5,wanna an easy-use projector to mirror my phone. this product is perfectly doing the job.
5,Bought it for my husband’s birthday. He loved it! The quality and sound are both excellent.
5,This projector delivers excellent performance at a great price level. I would highly recommend it.
1,Used one time and didn’t work any more.
2,Have tried to use all my streaming apps from my phone and none work with this projector. Very disappointed
2,Sound all the way up is so low you can barely hear it.
2,The picture quality is great. Although I dont get any sounds with my amazon fire stick. I tried switching to my apple tv. That worked only for hulu and YouTube. Netflix amazon prime disney + apple movie i get no sound at all. I tried all the trouble shooting suggestions on amazon. Nothing seems to work.
5,I used it for the entertainment room! highly recommend! exactly like the description! looks cute!
5,Great quality for this price! Image is really clear we use it on a 120" screen.
1,Has to be totally dark. Not user friendly at all. I sent it back
5,The media could not be loaded.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me tocó usar una aplicación extra Tobi para poder ver y escuchar películas desde navegadorSu control es excelente y fácil de usarLo ideal es usar en la noche o habitación oscura
2,I couldn't give it 1 star because the picture quality is good.  But unless you are sitting far from it or have loud speakers the fan will drive you nuts.
1,I bought this a year ago I got it to play once and not a whole movie either. It didn’t stay connected and I decided to try it again a year later but nothing I’ve tried all the connections  usb-t usb HD and WiFi is so confusing it didn’t stay connected for long I haven’t got to use it really waste of money.
2,In comparison to the other two projectors I have (used for my business) the volume on this projector is absolutely awful. Disappointed
5,OK
5,
5,five start projector
2,It was very difficult to connect this with my iPhone 11 Pro Max I try different ways but it wasn’t possible
1,Update: failing after about 600 hours of use. Burn type splotch in the midst of the screen. Used in a cool environment for it's entire service life so farGood 1080p picture. However there were several dead pixels the moment i turn it on. And one large cluster as well. Hopefully it doesn't progress into something worse. Kinda crappy for something thats new
1,Super cheap build from the start. You can get the top or bottom of screen to focus but not the full picture. Settings are crap.The fan pulls dust so it builds up on the lenses within a month. And then the projector stopped working with the remote. It just spazes out and the light flashes a bunch.
1,It’s wild I opened the box and immediately noticed that the space where you connect the plug to it was already ripped out of the projector so it was showing wires. I tried placing it back into place and plugging it in and the projector never turned on. Also the tripod was broken as well. It’s as if someone was playing a trick on me.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s very great .
1,The projector itself is uneven and wobbly. It caused the image to be significantly slanted regardless of what we tried to do to even it out. The image was also super wide at the top and slimmed down awkwardly at the bottom. It also got very hot to the touch very quickly. Returning it. Not worth the money.
1,Mala decisión. Me salió mal la imagen no define bien en el contorno. Solo al centro.Verdaderamente decepcionante.Lo compré mientras estaba de viaje en New York para traerlo a mi país El Salvador. Ahora devolver me sale más caro que el costo del mismo artículo
1,After we left could not get this thing to work. Not on the beautiful 20x20 blow up screen that I had bought. Not with a laptop not with a phone. Nothing. The projector would not play.
1,It is impossible to set up. The directions in the booklet is wrong. It will not let me stay connected to WiFi to stream bc you have to connect your phone to the projector ‘wifi’ to connect it. Terrible.
1,The product works for 5 mins and then a black shadow appears in the lens. Submitted a request for exchange or money back and still no response
1,Getting the projector to work with both Apple and Android products has proven to be much much more difficult than explained in the product literature and the quality of the setup screens is very poor.
1,I was really excited about this product but after using it for a couple days the picture quality is TERRIBLE every 5 seconds it turns blotchy and goes into squares I’m really disappointed with this product
1,The front cover didn’t open so we could not project and the power cable was loose so we cannot power it
1,Doesn’t work with streaming service no Hulu no Netflix no Amazon prime
1,The set up for screen mirroring is a hair pulling eye gouging process that I quite literally do not have the patience for. Not worth the aggravation.
1,I am not satisfied with this product I think it’s better but I was not satisfied with this projector
1,Poor image quality. Returned it
1,Ios and android screen mirroring is flawed.  Lumens might be 1500 at best.  Cheap price  cheap projector.
1,La descripción indica muchos lumenes y una excelente resolución pero no se ve así
1,Like the projector but it has a spot on the bulb that can’t be removed
1,Spent many hours trying to figure out how to sync phone and projector. Directions weren’t very clear.
1,This thing does not play sound from the FIRESTICK or any apps on my phone! Useless!
1,Hooked it up. Picture quality is great sound lasted 10 minutes. Garbage
1,Don't buy this productUSB isn't not working properly and no feedback at all
1,Worked one night. The next night the power wouldn’t turn on. Returned
1,Doesn't work with my Samsung phone or DVD player.
1,Sound will not working
5,I have been using VIMGO projector for over a year. It’s been working perfectly all the time. Picture quality is the best. My family really enjoy using it so I decide to purchase another one for my brother’s. Definitely recommend this product for anyone who’s looking for a projector!
1,Not compatible with certain devices or speaker
1,the wifi doesn’t work all the time
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works great no problems
1,Picture is blurred and no clear imaging not meant to game on
1,I bought this because of the price and after reading the reviews I thought it would be a good buy.  Unfortunately it does not work and I can't return it don't buy it invest in something better.
3,The price was great but it could not perform as described hence we returned the item. The wifi connection or screen cast connection would not stay connected which defeated the reason for my purchase. I did not want to have multiple peripherals added to the projector just to watch a movie outside. This item does not connect via Bluetooth and the wifi connection system is "iffy" at best. The constant in and out/on and off of the screen picture and volume was frustrating. The need to hard wire via HDMI was not what we wanted nor did we want to purchase a dongle to get reception for bluetooth/wifi use.
1,Apparently these projectors are hit and miss. While others report nothing but great things. Some have problems. Unfortunately mine has problems.The projector powers on and displays an image. I'm able to focus and Keystone without issues. I select a source and start a movie. Everything is fine for about ten minutes. Then the video quits displaying but the sound continues to play. After about ten minutes or so. The video returns. Another ten minutes later. The video shuts back off.I have tried factory resetting the unit. I have made sure that any and all timers were off. The unit is not abnormally hot nor in a hot environment.There is no support which internet search engine can find. There is a support email in the manual. I have emailed the company. Hopefully someone/somewhere can solve my issue.
1,Beware this device does not work with Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime or any other streaming app. I tried connecting every way - HDMI wifi USB. Nothing worked.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Everyone impressed recommend for a big blank wall.
5,I enjoyed this projector a lot! It connects to my iPhone very easily and projecting quality is superb. I would like to recommend it to all my friends.
5,Awesome picture quality and better sound than other projectors in this price range. Easy to setup!
5,Fantastic product! Now watching movie in my master room is not a problem any more. The design is cute and fits my staging so much!It’s easy to setup and picture quality is far above my expectation!Strongly recommended!
5,We enjoyed the mini projector.  I loved how I was able to do screen mirroring to watch YouTube from my phone though my mini projector and the view was amazing.  I especially loved the sound coming from the projector I didn't need any extra sound protection.
5,This is probably the best projector that you could get with the price range. I am not comparing this with the ones that are $3000 but at a $200 price point it does everything perfectly that I need it to do.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This was bought by my husband. He came back and used it for half an hour to debug it. I put it on the wall of the bedroom. I think it is very clear but it is better to use an external speaker the effect will be better.
5,Great product with amazing quality
5,Great projector for home or outdoor use. Easy to carry out. I use it for my window challenge and it’s works great. I can also use it connect with my youtube to air play. Overall good.
5,Great strong light from this projector. Very impressed especially for the price.
3,I was so excited to get this product after seeing all the great reviews. Figured we would enjoy backyard swimming movie nights. It claims to be iPhone compatible but it isn’t. I tried my phone my husband’s and our iPad and non of the streaming apps would work on the projector. Only YouTube and my own phone videos.  Not very convenient as I thought it would have been it seems to only work with my fire stick. Not exactly how I planned on using it
5,Picture quality of 1080 from this project is crisp after adjusting and having it focused on the wall. There are multiple levels when it comes to adjusting the brightness I LOVE IT for my living room wall. Comes with multiple features and 2 hdmi and usb plug for direct use. Just have to use the remote and change to source when wanting to pair with computer or tablets and even laptops.Great Projector overall!
5,This is really a great projector! Really recommend it. It is easy to use. I set it up by myself. It has remote control. The picture quality is good. I don’t have a TV but I like watching movies. So with this projector I can have my home theater.
5,Very easy to set up. Great for both outdoor and indoor. Great picture quality as well.
5,vimgo 5g wifi projector is an excellent 1080p projector  。Setup is very easy and nice Wifi connections 。Image quality is also very good like mini home theater 。my little girl like watching movies in bedroom with me。Great buy！
5,Projector quality is nice for the price point. Projector also comes with all the parts shown in my review photo. The setup is relatively simple and usage is intuitive. Would recommend.
5,works great and easy to use.
5,Picture color size
5,It’s a good projector didnot expect that we would be able to watch for 3 hours. Good sound too
5,I had low expectations when I rolled the dice on this. This projector looks and feels low grade. The instructions are poor. However once I got it all set up  I love it!. It is simple nice picture inside or outside. The projector is well worth it.  The 100” folded screen that came with the projector is very lame.
5,This is the second projector I have ever used and I was surprised to see such a good quality at such a good price！
5,Nice quality. I was a little concerned before purchase I’ve seen a lot of projectors that cannot show HD images.This one is different. Details are still visible even at daytime. Although I only use it at night to watch a movie or so.How to really like the fact that allow you to adjust projection angle. Because I put my projector in the low shelf and put some small items underneath it to make it facing the upper part of the wall. By adjusting the projection angle the image on the wall show in the rectangle instead of a trapezoid.
5,I didn't expect this small projector has such HD quality.  A recent family NFL game party proves that the projector has incredible performance. Small lightweight powerful. 100% thumb-up product.
5,I bought this projector for the 1080p resolution. It was easy to set up took me about 7 minutes. I was impressed with the overall performance. The image was perfectly clear and bright  the price was really affordable after applying the coupon. It’s been working so well and I can project onto my ceiling so I can watch movies in bed! Love it sooo much!!!
5,Just received this for a few day. My kid couldn’t wait to see everything up inside the house. I am so happy to purchase this item. This is a great movie projector at a fantastic price. The picture is fantastic and easy to use and set up. The speaker is great. All functions work perfectly. This item is awesome. I am planing to get this projector for my friend as a gift.
4,This is a nice projector for general purpose. You can move it wherever you want and easy adjust the projector
5,Super portable device with very easy instructions. Easily operate with HDMI. Accessories are very complete and effective. Good product and will recommend.
3,I was hoping for a miracle but the picture focus isn’t good past the middle of screen even at very short range. Would work fine for kids’ entertainment but fuzzy areas drive me crazy.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I'm very surprised with the brightness and thr small size of this projector. Why doesn't deserve a 5 stars : The tripod is flimsy and suffers from a poorly design that can't hold it firm. Fan is noisy. Sound is terrible..Recommend adding speakers. My video was Bluetooth speakers enhanced.
5,Great projector at this price. Now we can enjoy movie in bedroom.
5,Great projector! It can both connect wireless through wifi provided by the machine or through cable. Now I no longer need to watch movie from my cellphone or laptop. Just when playing Youtube I found that connecting through cable may not work well with downloaded videos but connecting through wifi can avoid the issue. Super light and very convenient to carry around. The picture quality is good just the sound is not that loud or maybe I haven't found a way to amplify the sound. I plugged in a set of portable speakers and it works out very well!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Was Looking for projector for outing with my friends and i found this. I was not expecting much but this surprised me. The picture is hd and quality of a sound is pretty impressive  . I loved it.
5,The projector is awesome. It has a good design and is easy to set up. I bought it for watching movies and playing games at home with friends. The resolution is high. I am very satisfied with this projector. It's a good value for the price.
5,Projection is very clear very easy to operate and install networking is very fast support purchase oh super high cost performance
5,Picture quality its Worth the money!!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 First off let’s just start by saying that with the price you’re paying you shouldn’t be expecting a 4K projector that plays in a brightly lit room. With that said this is an excellent projector. First off it is very easy to set up and use. I didn’t even have to look at the manual. The other thing is that the picture is very sharp and focused. There is no blurry edges which is excellent for when you’re projecting your computer. The image is very bright at night as well as with dimly lit lights. It also comes with built in speakers which do the job but don’t expect theatre quality sound. There’s also phone screening which is an nice little feature.  As far as things I think they can improve on I think the first would be the stand it comes with. It is not very sturdy and if you tilt the projector a little bit then it may start to drift. If you’re laying it flat then there’s no issue. The tripod is universal which means I can set it up with a camera tripod as well. Otherwise this is an excellent projector and I even uploaded a video of the projector.update. after a month of use projector gets hot to the touch and there's a burning smell. working on returning this
5,The projector works really well and the audio/video quality is amazing. The stand lets us use the projector anywhere. It is very portable as well.
5,I bought this projector to play games on switch and watch workout videos on YouTube. So far it has been a great substitution for the older projector. It works well projecting on white walls without a screen. The sound quality is good that I don’t necessarily need to use another speaker.I use it mostly at night time so it fit my needs. Blackout curtain is probably needed during the day time for better quality. The airplay works for my phone but the delay would highly depend on the internet quality.Size wise it’s a little bulky but works well with my camera tripod.
5,We bought this projector for our dorm and it turned out great! We could connect our phones and devices and play our favorite reality shows to watch together. The set up is easy and required little time. Definitely would recommend this to all my friends.
5,An awesome projector for the value its does the job as it says easy to connect and compatible size so that u can carry it anywhere u want and the customer service is so great they are so helpful any concerns u address it they will fix it for you i highly  recommend this product
5,Really great projector! Super quiet fast set up and the picture quality is AMAZING! Set up is quick and easy and the connection types are strong and reliable over Bluetooth and wifi. Kids watched a movie outside last night and we all marveled at the picture qaulity.Looking forward to a summer with friends and family and outdoor movies
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I can give this product 9 of 10. It's very easy to set it up. I bought it for the party time. I had a great experience using it at my son’s 1st birthday party. Everyone can enjoy video and music at the same time after connected with my phone. Excellent picture quality and sound quality. The only part I don’t like is the projector holder.  I feel the holder is not strong enough for the machine but it's ok it has another screw to hold it up.

It might be my internet connection speed but on wifi and 4g lte screen mirroring mode the picture and sound jumped around and drove me crazy and on my actual device it did not do that. So I ended up having to connect it directly to my ps3 with the hdmi cable which was a really easy plug and play and that worked perfectly with the sound and picture. The remote is dreadful and takes like 6 clicks to get the button to register. You can use the device buttons with better success. Set up was easy enough in all the modes. I tried to hook up my sound bar to the device using the cables but It didnt work. I am pretty sure i did it right so im not sure why. There is a headphone jack connected but you have to plug in. It's not compatible with bluetooth headsets. You could get a long cable splitter though for headphones and two people could watch in the backyard without disturbing the neighbors. The built in speakers are pretty good for the price of this device. I put up two photos of a Harry Potter movie playing. One photo is of the projection visual in daylight on my wall (the lighter one). As expected it is hard to see in broad daylight. The darker clearer image and the video is taken midday but with some blinds drawn shut.Overall I think this will work and i will keep it. I am having a harry potter themed housewarming party for a few vaccinated friends and my plan is to project this in the backyard on the fence and with it hooked up to the ps3 (or any dvd player) it should work great for that purpose.
5,Every projector buying guide says you need to spend a ton for a decent picture. But we trusted the reviews and are very happy with this unit. At first it didn’t connect to our MacBook Pro but after we restarted the laptop all was well.  Note you need a usb-c to hdmi adapter for use with the MacBook Pro. Impressed so far!
4,The picture quality is excellent. I bought a projection screen. Easy to use. I used it with a Amazon Fire Stick and it worked flawlessly once I got the hang of it. I’ll try it with the iPhone next. Also with the screen mirroring feature. I will update if needed. My only complain: sound. The internal speaker is decent. I get it. But I used the headset cable to connect my portable Blue Tooth speaker and the sound was still too low. I can’t get it to go high enough. I’m trying with different setups speakers etc. I will update. GREAT PICTURE-POOR SOUND (output).  But for the price: all is forgiven!!
5,I’ve been using this projector for a while and it’s quality actually exceeds my expectation.The image quality is good and I even don’t need to connect to a speaker while I’m watching movies because the sound quality is good enough. The project is not too big easy to fit in my table and easy to store.
5,It is starting to cool off the leaves are changing and I wanted to let my grandkids have that amazing experience of watching some spooky old black  and white movie like "Frankenstein" or some funny Halloween movie like say "Hocus Pocus" in that fun old fashioned outdoor drive in theater atmosphere. So I set my mind to buying an audio/video projector that I could attach to my laptop and which I could use to project movies outside on the side of my home. However I did not want to spend a lot of money on the project. So with little faith in the quality of such an inexpensive device I  took a bit of a gamble by buying a VIMGO 5G WiFi Projector . I looked at the price and I figured that for $60 this projector must be a ripoff; you know the old saying "If it sounds to good to be true it must be." Well I am happy to report that that is not always true. as surprisingly  this projector FAR EXCEEDS all of my expectations and delivers quality that one might expect from units costing 5 times what I paid for this VIMGO 5G WiFi Projector! The picture quality is crisp and clear with absolutely zero background EM noise. Picture size and focus adjustments are easily made via the included remote control and the easy to use controls on top of the unit.  The only negatives that I can say about this great unit is that the remote control does not come with the 2 required AAA batteries and that this projector come with a small about 6 inch tall removable tripod that does not lock in place and which is all but useless. Do not plan on using the supplied tripod for anything except for taking up space in the overcrowded box.  Except for these two tiny issue I find this projector to be a spectacular deal that is more than worth every penny.  Semper Fi- Gunny S.
5,I really like this projector the picture is very clear it feels like watching a movie at home it is equipped with lighting it is very convenient and it is very simple to operate I also sent a tripod can adjust the screen and has it.  From now on my baby doesn’t like iPad
4,It works pretty decent
4,Me agrado todo
5,One of the best projectors that is very compatible with Apple products! Although it doesn’t have auto focus the picture is perfect. WiFi is amazing!
5,Once I received this projector I can’t wait to test it out. Easy to install and adjust. The image quality showed vividly on the wall. Yes I didn’t use professional projector screen but it worked amazingly! The pictures was truly clear. Additionally I have tried to play it in many ways like wirelessly cabel connect USB they all worked out perfectly. I would recommend cabel connection more than others connection stayed on more stable. The last thing I wanna make a little complaint about the built in speaker. It was loud and clear enough to play in the small place like bedroom. However if you  wanna a family movie outdoor an external speaker is definitely needed. I would recommend this projector for its pictures quality and worthy price.
5,Pretty great! This projector is easy to set up and easy for use! At the very begining I was a little bit worry about the cable connection because I dont have a long enough hdmi cable to coonect this projector in living with my computer in bedroom. But this is not a problem to this projector at all! Once I connected it to my router I can easily found in as a wireless projector on my desktop and I can use it to mirror the screen of my desktop! I also tested with my phone airplay and you can see a infinite camera there Pretty cool!
3,device being hooooooooot
5,I bought it a month ago. I put it on our side table in the living room perfect position. It is light small and with high resolution. I have taken it travel with me several times. I am happy with its quality and white shiny color. Very easy to setup. I will try it outside when the weather becomes cooler and see how it works for outdoor family movie night.
4,You have to have the lights off and/or it needs to be night when trying to use this.  Also the tripod broke before I could turn the projector on.  It was very flimsy and cheap. For the price this picture quality is incredible but you just need to take the environment into account if you want to be able to see what you’re projecting.
5,Very good
5,Just moved to a new apartment. After using this projector for watching movies shows and playing video games I think it is worth the money.Pros:1. Brightness and adjustability. The projector is very bright and all details of pictures can be seen clearly. The size of the image is adjustable. I put it on the kitchen bar table and the image can go to 80’’.2. Compatibility. It works well with my iPhone PS5 and Switch. Also I can connect it to my PC with the HDMI cable to see my favorite movies.3. Price. Though there are better projectors that have excellent picture quality and sound effect this one is affordable and meets all my daily demands. And compared with a TV it is a much cheaper option.4. Portability. As I will live here only for a while I can bring it with me after I move out.Con:Appearance. This projector does not look very fancy as it is a little thick.
4,I bought this projector for a family member whom I appreciate very much.The picture quality is quite good also the brightness and operationability.After turning it on the first time I was very impressed with the quality of the picture for the price. My fa.ily are quite happy with this product and promise to purchase another one in the near future.Highly recommended
5,The cost performance is great. The quality of this projector really deserves the price. I'm satisfied with it. More importantly the after-sale service really helps me. I found there was a stain inside the shot but I was afraid of damaging it if I maintained it by myself. The heartwarming staff comforted me and told me how to clean the stain in detail which resolved my problem perfectly. I like both the service and the service. Your work is helpful.
5,This item is awesome.  Works great and priced just right.  No need for the overpriced brand name  this one is perfect and works just as good， We have been so happy with this choice.  The picture is awesome!  We plugged in a Bose sound unit to go with this to add an extra kick to the presentation and it made our movie room complete.  We use a pull down screen about 25 feet away and the quality of the picture is surprisingly fantastic.  The darker the room the better but even in the middle of the day with blinds pulled slightly it is still very crisp to view. So I am high recommend this projector!
5,Good brightness acceptable details very low price.
5,I ordered the projector and a screen I hooked it up at my hunting camp for watching sports. After about 3 weeks the speaker stopped working (though you can hook up a external speaker via AUX adapter) but I wanted the speaker to work. So I requested from the seller a exchange  on a Friday evening and I had a new on delivered that Sunday. Awesome customer service! They also give me a shipping label to return the discrepant projector.
5,Easy to setup and used for 4 months. Love it. Pic quality is good and consider its price it is a steal.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The projected works great so far. The image quality is good and very clear and the built in sound system is decent too. It has a variety of adjustable options for the projection. It’s way to set up and supports 5G.
5,I don’t have a TV home and haven’t gone to a movie theater for a looooong time! Usually I use my iPad to watch the movie the small screen makes my eyes tired. That’s why I choose to buy a projector home. I can’t wait to opening it when I receive which makes me so surprised! This projector is easy to use and small to save room. Besides the image is clear and bright and that’s what I want. It’s really the perfect one to my home every night. I can see the movie with my husband after my baby sleeping at night. Also I usually open it for my boy to play the cartoons which makes him so happy. An awesome and recommendable thing!!
1,Bought this to use at our kids birthday parties. It was a fail all around. We could not get it to work never did get it to work. Super frustrating!

I spent a lot of time browsing through projectors before deciding to purchase this one. I am not disappointed! We will probably re-order another to put in our kids playroom.
5,This has great picture quality even on a bid screen. Gaming is great as well!
5,My room is small so I decided to buy this projector instead of tv and price is cheaper. Fan moto is not loud. It displays clear picture. Speaker is loud enough for me but not much bass. There are more inputs like usb USB a sd card hdmi headphone speaker and VGA connection. I mainly use usb to connect with my phone or iPad. And hdmi to connect computer n tv box.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the sound/ picture quality this thing provides. My girlfriend and I LOVEEE stand-up comedy and now we can just laugh our asses off on Sunday night at the comfort of our couch :)))
5,Great quality used it mainly for my switch. It was a bit confusing to connect to the phone initially but once you set it up it works really smoothly.
5,Works beautifully great picture everything was just wonderful about it goodbye
4,Good product for the price. It is portable and of high quality. It has a built-in speaker which is quite convenient for watching videos.
4,It is very easy to setup. I connect it to my iPad and the whole connecting process takes around 5-10 minutes. Very convenient and great for travel. However the noise from the fan is a little bit loud to some people
