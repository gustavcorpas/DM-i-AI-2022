4,I am very happy with this. Because it fits in my cup holder I don't have to worry about it blocking any part of my window nor do I have to worry about it blocking the vent. I found it to be wide enough to hold my phone comfortably. Because my phone has a pocket on it that is filled with cards my phone tends to be thick and pretty heavy. It's hard finding something that can accommodate the thickness and weight of the phone. I was excited that this worked out so great. My only complaint is that the part that holds the phone will come off the neck if I am not careful. I can't seem to find a way to make it stay together permanently. But to me that's a minor issue. I have no regrets getting this and I do recommend it.
4,This is the second one I've bought. The first one lasted about a year and then I replaced it with this same one. I will buy one again next year. So take it for what it's worth.
4,I’m enjoying this product a lot. However it did come with sticky adhesive all over the back. I had to clean it off with good off.
4,This product works great but was too low due to the console being so much lower than the seats in my Chrysler Pacifica to be usable for me. My husband has a Kia Sorento and says it works great!
5,This is our third one purchased (we are still using the first two and needed another one). We like that the phone holder is adjustable and also the part that sits in the cup holder making a tight fit. Your phone can be plugged in while in this holder and you can move the neck around for the best angle for viewing.
5,Does exactly what I needed it to although I was disappointed when I tried it in a different car but the cup holder was too wide for it work right. Still great for the work vehicle.
5,By accident I mentioned the WeatherTech to my wife for Christmas which I didn’t know she had bought.  After reading a lot of reviews I put this one in the Amazon cart for her to think about.  She forgot about the first one and so I ended up getting both for Christmas...allowing for a direct comparison.Cup Holder Fit winner: TopGo.  It fits any size cup holder from a little 8oz soda can up to my extra-wide front seat cup holders on my F150 and my wife’s Acura MDX.  The TopGo comes with extenders if you have an extra-wide space to fill.  Turn the knob and the arms push out and they stay locked in place.  With the WeatherTech you have to choose the “cup size” and you might not get exactly the right fit.  I could not find an exact fit for all the cup holders in my F150.  It wouldn’t fit my wife’s MDX at all...kept popping out.Adjustability winner: TopGo: Just twist and bend the goose neck to the angle you want.  The phone release button on the back quickly releases the phone so you’re not fiddling with it.  The WeatherTech is easy to adjust with two knobs for angle and phone width...but you have to adjust the knobs whereas the TopGo you just pop in the phone and squeeze it closed.Visibility winner: TopGo.  The gooseneck is about 6-8” above the cup holder putting the phone up closer to where you can see it without looking down.  On my F150 the phone is just slightly higher than the top of my shifter.  It doesn’t wobble around like I thought it would in normal road driving.  I did like that the WeatherTech wasn’t near the gear shifter and it is adjustable enough that you can get a good view angle (e.g. when using Maps).Build quality: Tie.  Both are well made and sturdy.  I’m not worried about either one breaking or coming loose.  They both feel well-built.  Both had easy-access to the charge port on my phone and the phone’s control buttons and screens are not obstructed on either holder.Overall ease of use: TopGo.  It’s just effortless to move around the cabin and I don’t have to store the little WeatherTech cups somewhere in case I want to move the WeatherTech to a different cup holder later.  For example I had the TopGo in the front cup holder for work.  But when riding with my wife we needed to use both cup holders and it just took a few twists of the knob to move it to the smaller cup holder behind the arm rest.  Took maybe 20 seconds.  With the WeatherTech I would have had to dig through the arm rest storage to find the right cup and reassemble and drop it in...and there was no cup that exactly fit the cup holders in the back.I was mainly disappointed that the weather tech didn’t work at all in the MDX or in my son’s Subaru Outback.  The cup holders in both are a bit smaller and have those foam cushions.  This caused the Weather Tech to pop out whereas the TopGo I could get a nice secure solid fit.So there you go.
5,I had first purchased this holder for myself. It is such a wonderful tool to help me safely navigate on the roads. I decided to purchase as a gift for my husband but mistakenly purchased another model. He did not like it and it was returned. Since then he and our young-adult children all have this model in their vehicles as well. At first every one of them balked at using it. Just not “their thing”. Since then (incl a long drive to FL for my husband) they all gave the holder a chance and love it! I feel better knowing that my kids have this tool to help them navigate more safely. It adjusts to fit very securely in all of our cup holders. The longer goose neck makes it so much easier to see the screen. I had one issue where I somehow lost the top piece that snaps on to the gooseneck (the actual phone holder). Laura the company CEO reached out immediately (after I contacted them to try and get a replacement piece) and quickly sent me an entirely new unit. Awesome product and customer service!
4,Not worth the moneyI can’t get it to stand straight up in the cupholder is the first problem a major problem though is that I don’t like looking down and taking my eyes off the road to look at my phone. I know you shouldn’t do that but everyone’s going to class down at their phone so I want something that’s going to be up on my dash so I can keep my eyes on the road. I ordered some thing
5,The car mount was easy to install.  It holds my phone with the case securely in place.  I recommend.
5,Easy to use device holder adjusts to various sized cup holders.  I use mine to hold my golf gps in golf cart cup holders. Never have given thought to those cup holders differing in size but they do and this adjusts easily. Secure grip on my gps as cart paths are not always smooth on some courses I play. I have confidence and peace of mind that my gps will not be bounced down the cart path...I would recommend this to anyone who would benefit from have their device secured.
5,Hold phone in car. Bought second one last week!
5,really good product
5,My husband uses this in his truck and he likes how sturdy it is.  Be sure to pick the one that features the charger cord opening on the bottom of the holder.  Otherwise you have to string the charger cord around to get it to stay it.
5,I know what you’re thinking: they’re are so many phone holders and I have no idea which one to get. When did shopping get so hard? Well stop looking! I got this for my mom awhile back and got my dad the exact same one for the next occasion (they’re both in their 50s so if they can use it so can you). And if I’m being honest neither of them are particularly patient with complicated gadgets that take more effort to use than it’s worth. NOT the case here! It’s kind of like a flower pot at the bottom if that helps you imagine. It doesn’t LOOK like a flower pot don’t get me wrong but it has the same heft of one. Sits right in your cup holder. Does it move around? No! The base has these three pegs that you can push out of the sides so it makes it wider (picture included). Both of my parents put them down pretty short but they extend higher (though I didn’t mess with them because they WILL notice if it’s even slightly out of place) and you can see how they’re turned in different ways. I picked this because of the “goose neck” and let me tell you - it helps you get it just the way you want it (without flopping around). The clasps on the sides can be moved in or out to fit your phone. I know sounds difficult. It’s not! It might take you a few seconds to secure but once it’s in there it’s in there! Don’t worry about your phone sliding out mid-trip but or the whole thing falling over. It’s very sturdy and stable but somehow still adjustable. What my mom thinks is possibly the greatest thing ever is that the clasps don’t cover your whole phone you can charge it at the same time!It took us a few minutes with the directions to figure out the whole thing mostly the pegs (though maybe that says more about us than the product....) but once you get it - you get it! A few patient minutes result in a great product and let’s be honest. If you read this whole review you’re probably a pretty patient person.Would buy and have bought again!Honestly didn’t know someone could be so excited about a phone holder but my mom especially loves something she can use every day - and she does.I hope you get as much use and joy out if this thing as my parents do.
5,Super easy set up and off and running fast.
5,Su comodidad
5,Very easy to assemble and install. Clear instructions. No adhesive or suction required.
5,I had an expensive RAM suction cup mounted phone holder but it kept falling off the window especially in the summer when the window is hot. This was dangerous because when the phone and holder dropped on the floor the charging cord pulled out of it and dropped onto the base of the steering wheel and got trapped there. I couldn't safely retrieve it while driving. If I turned the steering wheel it then got wrapped up in the base. One time I almost couldn't get it out of the base. I have to charge my phone while driving as it's old and the only way to route the cord to the phone was above the steering wheel to the side window where I had to put the phone to avoid interfering with my car's Eyesight system on the windshield. I'm explaining all this to show that I was rather desperate for a better safer solution. The dash and air vent mount products didn't seem like they would work well in my car. Then I found this solution that goes in the cup holder. While I don't like giving up a cup holder I need to safely mount my phone in the car to use the navigation on it. This screwed in very securely to the cup holder and was easy to screw. The only difficulty with installation was I couldn't get the phone holder piece to securely snap onto the gooseneck. It kept sliding off and I couldn't figure out how to make it "click". My husband finally got that figured out. Once it was securely snapped on the holder works great. When the phone is mounted it does wobble some since it's on a gooseneck but that doesn't interfere with usage.  And being in a cupholder at the center of the car puts my phone close to the charging port so I don't have to route the cable very far. I also really like how easy it is to put the phone in and out of the holder much easier than my RAM mount and more secure. The RAM mount had an X-configuration of arms with rubber tips and the rubber tips kept working their way off the arms causing the phone to pop out of it even when I glued the tips. My only concern is whether this product will last since it feels rather cheap. But it's not terribly expensive so I can always replace it if it breaks. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure to measure your cupholder so you know it will fit properly.
5,Product is as advertised.
5,This is very sturdy and fit my Chevy Silverado cup holder. I have Blue Tooth but needed a holder for my smart phone for navigation hands free. Best money I ever spent. I highly recommend this phone holder.
5,Not much to say other than it works perfectly as expected
4,I like this particular phone holder because it is secured in my cup holder & I like the fact that my phone comfortably "sits" in the holder so easily and it has never let me down like some have. I highly recommend it because of the price too! I WASgoing to buy the Weathertech one but decided the price difference was so much that I felt that I should at least try this one and I'm glad that I did! It's a "keeper".
4,It come in handy in my car and easy to use and great to put you phone on when you are driving and talking never have the phone in your hand while driving.
5,The item puts together easily enough and you don't need the instructions.The phone holder part is big and wide enough to accommodate most phones including cases.  But if you have a pop socket or something like that then it might have a big enough gap that it will be held at an angle.The expandable base adjusts to fit any size cupholder but if you have one of those open joint double cupholders then you have to place it in a way that it holds on the closed ends only.The neck is very sturdy and holds my heavy iPhone just fine.  If your car is smaller though it might be too long.There is no suction used so I didn't rate it.  The reason for the title is because if your cupholders are close to your elbow then this might get in the way but if you have cupholders right under the radio upfront then this works perfectly.
5,This is the 3rd phone stand I have tried with my IPhone pro and finally I am satisfied. It’s a heavy phone so the adhesive stands don’t work for long.
5,Fits perfectly in the cup holder and holds the phone securely.
3,Not a bad product. For me the neck wasn't long enough to allow my phone to be out of the way. If you have a RAV4 or other car with similar console this is not for you.
5,This phone holder that fits into the cup holder is in finely adjustable for phone and for cup holder.  This does the job for half of the price of the big name phone holder.
4,Good quality
5,55 Chevy Convertibles did not have cup holders. I made my own console with stainless steel cup holders from Amazon. My new phone holder fits perfectly in the cup holder. I’ll be ordering more as I’ve been asked to make more for friends.
5,The product was an excellent purchase when you consider the price and ease of installation. This is my 3rd TOP-GO. Have recommended them to several friends.
5,Very easy to install.
4,Had someone else install it and it works fine now. Hard for an old person to install properly but it got done and all is good.
3,I thought this was a decent purchase. It worked quite well in my 2018 Camry Hybrid until recently when the phone would not hold in position and started spinning at every turn of the car. Two years ain't bad for a $20 item so I bought another one.
4,Easy to put into place. Easy to access from passenger side too. Only 2 negatives for me is losing a cup holder and I have long nails so it's a bit difficult to reach bottom row of buttons due to braces that hold the phone. Other than that it's still the one I would purchase.
3,This probably works well with most cars however it sorta kinda worked somewhat with my car but I found a better alternative.  By that time it was too late to return it.  No biggie.  I'll find someone who can use it.
5,So far this has been the best phone holder I have bought. Fits right in my cup holder and the phone is right there accessible. Especially if you are doing ride share or deliveries. The other brands that go on your windshield with the heat your phone gets super hot fast. Not with this one.
5,REVISED REVIEW:I thought my product was defective since it kept coming detached from the mount. I simply was not applying the required force (I've been known to break plastic connectors from excess pressure which to me feels like 'normal' pressure) to connect the pieces. Customer service was very attentive and patient as we worked to ID what I may have done wrong. Problem solved and now I am extremely pleased with the overall quality of the product AND the seller.
5,I thought when I first put this into my car that it would wobble on bumpy roads because it is tall. It didn’t at all. Also because of the 3 adjustable fittings I was able to put it into a square tray in the console instead of taking up one of my cup holders. Bonus!
4,Great phone holder. very sturdy. Easy to turn bottom to expand into cup holder size.  I wish the release button was on the side instead of in the back but not a big deal.
5,As described
4,I just wish that the 'neck' was longer....for more height of the phone to have it raised up a little higher for the phone.  But I love it.  It does what I need it to do.
4,Fits securely in cup holder. Easy to position and place phone in even with large case. Only negative is button to open holders  the function is not quick to release fully.
5,Works perfectly.
4,I bought it in December 2020 and prefer it to any vent or window attachment for a cell phone.  It's fairly sturdy as long as you get the pads lined up in the cup holder.  I went out to the car yesterday and found it broken.  It looks like it just wore out (maybe from the different weather elements) and it snapped at the base.  It's plastic so take it for what it's worth I got15 months of use out of it.
4,Excellent phone holder easy to install and remove! I would recommend this product
5,Does a great job and a real bargain for the price!  So happy I went with this - I suspect the ones that are 3X more expensive are not one bit better than this one.
5,I was VERY hesitant when I went browsing on the web for a car phone holder to stick into my drinks cup holder by the driving shift.After hours of hunting and studying all the details I picked this excellent Top-go product.It came in a cute little compact box with a fantastic simple instructions sheet with clear photos for putting it together. It was written in proper English which is rare these days.I had zero problem assembling it and it held my iPhone 7 WITH MY LEATHER HOLDER ON IT!!  In other words it is flexible enough to not have to REMOVE your iphone cover!!It opens and tightens easily and the gooseneck bends beautifully and remains taut at any angle you need!!A brilliant product. It is a steal at the price they offered on Amazon. Buy two or three as gifts!! This company is tops!!
5,Great product
4,Very easy to install great suction.I wish the neck part was a little bit longer but it is fine.
5,Fits well in my car and at a perfect height
4,It works but I wish the neck was a little more flexible.  For the price I'd probably buy another one.
5,2nd time purchasing one. Gave my 1st one to my son. It’s a nice phone holder that fits in a cup holder. Easy to install and maneuver. Would buy again.
5,FINALLY! a good secure way to hold my huge iPhone while driving. I mostly just use my phone to play music while I'm driving I don't talk or text while driving but in our state it is against the law to hold your phone at all if you're driving. The police won't care if you were just trying to play the next song.But I realize lots of people talk and drive so the smart thing to do is to use a mount like this one and use a speakerphone. Using headphones is a bad idea because you can't hear anything else like your car making bad noises people honking police or fire trucks etc.This mount works really fast with just a few twists on the base and the spring arm is really stable. My phone doesn't bounce all over the place like crazy when I'm driving down the road.
5,I was skeptical.  I have a Nissan Sentra and the cup holders are probably 3 inches or so wide . I adjusted the goose- neck first so as not to put stress on the rest of it while adjusting. It positions easily.  I placed the base in the cup holder and tightened it and it's very secure. Just tightened it  little by  little for the best fit and less chance of damage. I didn't have to torque down on it.  It snugged right up. They also provide three pads to add to the expanding base I think to make it tighter if necessary.  Mine was tight I saved them but didn't use them.  Next I placed the phone  holder onto the end of the goose neck. It's a little tricky and took more than a few seconds  to attach it right. I don't drive over bumpy roads so on regular freeways and parking lots  it is very sturdy and doesn't wobble or fall.  I've got a MOTO  phone that's 3 1/4"  wide and 6 " tall.  It easily fit snugly the padded  ratcheted jaws open and close  smoothly horizontally and vertically.  The  bottom piece extends if necessary.  I pulled it all the way down to fit my phone. The jaws hold firmly.  The only time it failed was when I accidentally slapped it reaching for the gear shift. It knocked the holder off but the phone stayed in the jaws which was good.  I snapped it back on and readjusted  the neck  so it wasn’t in the way and it’s done exactly what I wanted it to do.  I admit I am price conscious and looked at all the phone cup holder types.  This looked the most reliable less expensive and in theory not much if any difference.  I am very happy.
4,Fits perfect in my truck cup holder great. Sturdy and well made. Does the job.
5,Went on a trip and needed to have my phone in view for GPS and this did the trick perfectly! Happy customer.  Didn't slip or move at all held my phone in place without any issues. Would recommend to anyone that needed one. Vehicle: 2014 Equinox
5,Once installed in the cup holder of the car it is easy to adjust to where it is most comfortable to view.
5,Great to hold my phone. The weight of my phone sometimes causes it to detach from the base but it’s easy to snap it back on.
5,Easy to use and install
3,I like the way it holds the phone.  It seems to be pretty secure in mounting to the cupholder. The gooseneck is too short and not very flexible.  Would not buy another one.
5,I have only had it a week. Seems fine I needed something for my jeep that wouldn't hit the shifter. You can move this to fit your needs
5,Good product no issues. Holds phone well. I would buy again.
3,Only lasted 5 months before the bracket broke off.
5,With all of the regulations I needed to be hands free when I changed vehicles. Our ranch truck didn’t have the cigarette lighter to plug the standInto so I tried this one.It fits perfectly into the cup holder and stays secure for hands free operation of the cell phone. Works especially good at a level where it’s handy for maps and directions.
5,It’s a great sturdy product and less expensive than the others that don’t work
5,Installed in my truck and my golf cart
3,Functions really well when working but broke after a year. The top part which screws into the base got stripped somehow and was impossible to re-assemble.
4,Worked ok on clean surfaces
5,So far I really like this holder. I've tried several highly recommended vent holders for my Iphone Pro Max and none of them worked. The slightest bump in the road and he phone would drop down.  The view this holder offers is not as convenient as vent holders because you have to look to the right and down but I am getting used to it. If you have a large phone in a heavy duty case this is the holder to get.
3,I really wanted to like this as while I’m in the car my phone always falls down or gets dropped.... so this was my answer!!! So when I received it I ran to install this in my car!!! I was so excited ... I could see my phone for the directions of where I needed to go or answer my phone... you see I have a car that doesn’t have a navigation system and my phone doesn’t want to connect to my car as well as when I am speaking to someone I haves time limit... you see if I’m connected to my car system after 15 minutes it won’t let me hear the other person.... so I have to recall them. I needed help!!!! This was going to be incredible.... However the more I used it the more frustrated I became. The part that holds my phone would come off!!! Then I would have extra to carry.... the phone holder wouldn’t stay connected and the grips to hold in the cup holder started to not work..... so now the reason to get this was failing and I’m out of the money I spent to have my phone be an asset and not looking for it on the floor WITH the phone holder attached when I happen to touch it and it knocks on the floor car. I’m going to try one more thing.... super glue the phone holder to the place where it connects.My take on this is save your money or try another one... it’s a PART TIME phone holder!!
5,Makes it easy to see directions keeps phone safely in place. Fits like a glove.
5,Great product.  Even with my very large case it still fits and holds great!
3,Mounting cell phone in suv
5,Cell phone auto cup holder
3,The top piece falls off every time you retrieve your phone.
5,I have a Samsung 9 Plus with a thick Otterbox case.  I searched everwhere to find a car cup phone holder that would have deep enough clasps to hold my phone with the case. The other attribute I wanted was a tall gooseneck that would allow me to position the phone as high as possible to be able to more easily glance at google maps when driving.  This fit the bill perfectly!  It fits the cup holder securely with a simple twist the gooseneck is flexible but sturdy and the adjustable clasps are the right size to secure my XL phone.  In a sea of junky products it's great to find something that seems to be designed with real situations in mind not just a product that sounds good but "almost" works.  Sincere thanks for solving my problem at a reasonable price!!I will share a tip if someone runs into the same situation I had... when I tried to slide the phone holder into the gooseneck I could not get it to go no matter how hard I pushed. I was ready to return it thinking I just purchased another piece of low quality junk from the internet when I thought of one thing to try before I gave up.  I put the tiniest bit of hand cream on each of the four plastic hooks and tried again.  They slid into the notches with ease!  Very secure!Update:  Well I"ve only had it for about a month and the top part fell out of the gooseneck when I tried to slide my phone out.  I realized two of the plastic prongs / hooks have snapped off!  So in the end it's just another piece of junk from the internet!  Very disappointed!
3,Thought this would be as good as the US model.  Not so.  Doesn't work for me.
5,Sturdy product clever design and excellent product price point.It fits perfectly in the cup holder - tight and no wobble.
5,Just as described. Easy to install and sturdy. Great for ride share driving.
5,This works great holds tightly very sturdy
5,Friend of mine from work had the weathertec h brand and said he paid $50. I think I paid a$18 for this. Works pretty good. Fits my shallow cup holders in my old Ford pretty good. Expands and grips good. Wobbles a little bit but I think that’s mostly to do with it being an old truck and not as smooth as some of the newer ones.
5,I have tried all kinds of phone holders  in my car: the vent kind the magnet kind and the suction kind…They were never stable for very long and ended up being just a waste of money. I decided to try a cup holder version because it was really my last option. When I finally decided on one I hated to even hope it would work…That was 2 months ago and it is just as sturdy as the day I got it. I do a lot of driving and feel so much safer having a truly hands free experience. My favorite thing about this product is the release button on the back. One press and your phone is free to go. It was worth every penny!
5,came quickly works as advertised big enough for the iPhone 13
5,Good sturdy construction. Works as advertised.
3,Great product just needs to be made with stronger material.
3,Dislike the bending areas not super adjustable piece that phone sits in pops off base at slightest touch
5,I had previously bought a straight neck Topgo cup holder phone holder for my car.  My wife when she would drive my car used it and ask if we could order one for her car.  She decided to try the gooseneck for her car.  I had no problem installing it securely in her car and she is now a very happy camper.  I liked it myself so much that I just ordered this same model for my car.
5,I have three these in all cars.  Work great.  Fit almost any cup holder from truck.  Jeep.  Suv.  Easy install.  Hold up beating is why I like them.  Good choice and look good to.
4,I bought this Topgo cupholder style cell phone holder for my husband after trying a different one that wouldn't hold his cell phone.  My husband has a Samsung  J7V (sm-J737V). The phone has a Casemate case on it with a kickstand that sticks out a little so it makes the overall phone kind of thick.  I have posted pictures of the Topgo holder as well as side by side photos of the Vabsce holder that we tried first.  The Topgo has plenty of room to hold the phone without it slipping out.  On the Vabsce the feet that stick out are not long enough to support the cell phone with the case on.  The only thing that I have to be aware of is the power button and the volume buttons on the sides where the side supports press against the phone.  Adjusting the length of the foot holder fixed that problem so the phone buttons are not pressed while in the holder.  (Sorry if the pictures are not turned properly they will not rotate the way they should when I uploaded them into this review)
4,This is sturdy and works great. However the top part where your phone goes does not safely click on the stick/base so any little bump sends it flying off. Not sure if we got a defective one. Might have to glue it because it’s really annoying.
5,This is one of the best phone holders I have purchased. Easy to set up.
4,Work pretty good. Easy to install.
5,Easy to install easy to adjust fits perfectly. Couldn't ask for anything better. At this price it is a steal.
5,Handy
5,It works without all the hype of brand name phone holders and the high prices associated with them. It’s not atomic blast proof but used under normal conditions you will be happy
2,I was anticipating a much more sturdy product. The lower connection point (as seen in the photos attached to this review) is very weak and unstable for my phone which is Galaxy Note S22. It also has the standard Otter box case installed. Once my phone was placed on the phone holder it leaned over about 45 degrees and would not sit up straight. It flops from side to side as I drive.Pros:- Price- Shipping time- Packaging- Adaptability of the base to fit numerous Cup holders- Adaptability of Phone holder to accommodate multiple sized phonesCons:- Construction- Lower Connection Joint- Unstable (Doesn't sit still)- Does not support larger / heavier cell phones- Release device for Phone Holder is located on the rear and requires (2) hands to operateRecommend: NO
5,Like
4,Honestly my only complaint is that I wish it had about an inch more height to play with.Stays put even when on bumpy roads. Even fits my giant iPhone 13 Pro Max but just barely with hits OtterBox on it.
5,The perfect fit for my car’s cup holder and will enjoy using it when driving
5,I use this on my 2014 Tacoma placed in one of the forward rubber cup holders.* Easy set up* Tight fit in the cup holder* Easy adjustment to the position I want for seeing and using my Pixel 6 Pro.* A little bit of phone shake on roads that aren't smooth but that's what you get with the goose neck design. The minor shake does not prevent use of the phone's navigation display (or in fact any of the phone's functions.) The goose neck is the key to this phone holder's ability to adapt to where you want your phone to be positioned.
4,Doesn’t fit as well as I thought it would. Thought top part would be more flexible.
5,I owned three of the Topgo phone holders that are apparently previous models. We use them in our cars and in our Kayaks. Recently one broke so I ordered two more because they had lasted well over the years. To my surprise the part that had broken had been improved and the overall strength of the "snake" is much better now. I also like the height adjustment of the improved models much more. Good work TOPGO!
5,The phone holder is strong and adjustable.
5,Sturdy and way to install
5,Holds my S21 Ultra with otter box case. Needed one that could hold a large phone and case
5,Works well. But don’t over tighten it as it’s hard to get out.
3,Had a hard time fitting in cup holder. I had to use two of the tabs and leave one off so not quite snug or sturdy. It would not fit in cup holder any other way.
5,So far so good.  It serves its purpose and works well.
5,There’s nothing I don’t like about this product. I give it a 10 all around . Thru my weather tech in trash.
5,I have tried 2 other types of phone holders.  One clipped on the vent; but slipped off the first time I used it.  It also blocked the air flow and caused the phone to get cold or hot according to the A/C or heat being on.  The other type was a custom design for my car model and clipped onto the dashboard.  The cheap plastic snapped first time I used it.This cup holder design is by far the best one.  It isn't going to slip off block anything or break.  I like it!
4,The phone holder fits easily into cup holders. I tried it in several vehicles and had no issue at all - very simple to install and remove.  This model also easily holds a phone in a protective case (I have a very thick case for my iPhone 7 with a pop socket too). My phone fits snug and secure. I also tried an iPhone 11 with no case and an I phone SE (which is considerably smaller in dimension that the 7 or 11) with no case and they both fit securely as well.The issue is the part that holds the phone doesn't connect securely to the gooseneck.  It 'clicks' in but if you bump it with your hand or something (for me - it's the water bottle from the adjacent cup holder) it will fall off. I am considering gluing it in place to resolve the issue - but it seems like that connection should be much more secure
5,Love the versatility would definitely get another one.
4,Very nice and strong. It does wobble although it's not a big issue.
4,works great
5,Works just as intended. Easy in. Easy out.
5,👍
2,The attachment that holds the phone falls off the extension arm because it is not fixed to it. It attaches to it but the way it attaches is not a firm hold. Its a problem while driving if you barely touch it wrong the holder that holds the phone along with the phone since its sitting in the holder falls off. Poorly designed.
4,I love this cup holder.  The gooseneck is awesome.  You can angle the phone whichever way works best for you.  You’re not locked into one position.  My husband actually preferred your new model with a more anchored neck.  The reason I downgraded this to a 4 star review is with the security measure.  I thought the bottom button was for a release as well (it is on the new one I ordered for my husband) & when I inserted my iPhone X into it unbeknownst to me it “hit the right buttons” & automatically dialed 911 twice!  After I apologized profusely to those individuals who do not need anymore prank calls than they already receive  I had to deactivate that service on my phone until I figured out what was going on.  Once I realized that the bottom button dropped the level of where the phone sits in the cradle I fixed that issue.
3,The item is ok  but for me personally it’s in the way . It works fine for the purpose it’s made for .
5,I bought this for my husband who drives a large van and needed to be able to access his phone as closely as possible.  I looked at the Weathertech which looked really nice but has a nice price tag as well so I went with this as the next best thing.  The reviews said it was hard to put together?  I didn't see how hard it was it was pretty self explanatory and I didn't need a tool to put it together it just snapped in...I mean you had to put some pressure into it but unless you have the strength of a toddler you should be okay. Holds his iphone really well and has enough space for the charger cord.  It stays in place and doesn't rock which is a bonus  so I would recommend this to anyone.
3,I tried it in my 2016 Mack truck. It was too tall. My phone was in the way of the brake valves. And it came loose more than once. Make sure you measure your cup holder. Otherwise it’s a well built item.
5,Some of the more fancy phone holders have nice slots to slide your phone into but they forget a big thing: Most phones have a case or ring to hold them on the back added by the owner. This holder accommodates any phone with any case that I've ever seen anyway. Very adjustable to phone size with a quick release that works well on the back. If adjusted right you can just slide the phone out the top without using the quick release. I use it to get the phone out of my pocket and away from my body while driving. It is put in a better place to quickly view who is calling or texting you. I never read or write texts while driving but this device allows me to know who is trying to contact me. So I can either call them hands free or pull over to text them back.
5,Does everything the more expensive brand does and is easy to install and use. Highly recommend.
5,Very sturdy.
5,Super easy to install and sits very snug in the cup holder.  The flexible wand holds its position but depending on your layout may take a couple car trips to adjust it the way you like.
4,I have a 2006 Honda CRV. The cup holders are very small so this phone holder fit perfectly without having to add the extra width pieces. I have 2 issues. The first is that the phone is close to my right arm and I have accidentally hit it several times already. The other problem is the part that holds the phone (I have a Samsung S 10) and connects to the arm is easily knocked off. I don't know if there is a way to secure it better. It's annoying that it comes off with the slightest bump.Update: My friend clicked the phone holder part into the neck securely. It stays put when I remove the phone now.
5,I tried several phone holders and this one is the only one that worked for me. First I can't have dash mount because I don't have a flat dashboard or anything facing that's flat or any room 🤷‍♀️ I tried those vent clips which would be awesome if they'd fit but my vents are too deep. This holder is great because I can SEE what's on my screen and it's not in the way. Easy to maneuver the arm yet stiff enough to stay in place and hold it's form.  I was concerned about phone popping out but it stays put on bumpy roads👍 yes I lost a cup holder but so worth it not having to hold my phone or sit it on my leg while driving using maps and having it fall to the floor. I am so happy with the quality- doesn't feel cheap like some holders.
5,I really like this cup phone holder. I wanted to give it a 4.5 because it was not as easy to attach the back with the arrows. In fact it was darn hard. I had to put my weight on it to click it together. I was afraid I was going to break it but I didn't. I saw a video and the video just softly click it in place it don't work like that. I like everything else about it. I love how the base adjust to fit my cup holder. I have a big Smart  phone and it fit perfect. I also like that the phone in the holder could be adjusted by using the flexible gooseneck  at eye level. It is also easy to remove with the button in the back. I was so impressed with this phone cup holder I told my son and he bought one. He had the same problem putting the back together so I guided him and it made it easier. I use this holder every time I drive because it is fun to use. Iam going to buy my sister and niece one for Christmas. Please make the click part easy to put together so that I could feel good about my 5 stars.
2,A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. Rating the different part of this device holder....Expanding cup base - 5 stars. Works very well Expands to fit cup holes and holds firmly.Goose-neck arm - 5 stars. Rigid enough to hold my heavy Samsung phone and case in place. It will bounce a little while driving on rough roads but that's to be expected.Phone-Grip - 0 stars. This is the part that's pathetic and resulting in an overall low rating. The geared jaws don't work well. They don't expand when the release button is pressed and they may or may not grip well when closed on the phone. The release button is located awkwardly on the back making single-hand operation impossible. The clamping jaws are barley wide enough to grip My Samsung Note 4 + case. The jaws have frozen so I now have to wedge the phone in and out. The attachment to the goose-neck is poor. If you drive over a pothole the goose-neck will launch the phone and grip portion. The phone-grip portion has also come off just by being bumped.I drive with two phones (personal and work). My other phone is in a holder made by a different manufacture and is mounted to the dash. So I have two entirely different phone holders that live side-by-side in the same vehicle. I've never had problems with the other device. It works like a charm and is very easy to single-handedly snap the phone in or out.  This one requires two-handed operation for inserting and removing the phone and the phone grip portion is routinely separating from the rest of the holder. While I'm very satisfied with the cup-holder base and goose-neck the hone grip portion is unacceptable. Until that part gets improved I would not recommend this.
5,Primary use is holding phone while playing golf; much easier & better than trying to fit phone into a cup holder — where it really doesn’t fit.
5,My wife has a giant Samsung phone that I miss dearly and uses this phone holder when we go out on the golf course. Apparently being able to know how far it is from the ball to the flag is very important. Anyway this holder can hold my itty bitty useless Iphone all the way up to her Supersized Galaxy S10+ and has never dropped either one. The standard base fits both the golf cart and the car cup holders without any issue at all. We have never had to use the included expanders. It is vital though if there is a cutout in the cup holder that you do not try to put one of the little nubs in the hole. Apparently it requires something to push against in order to hold it up Who knew? I did but lets not go there.Seriously a great phone holder and exactly what she wanted and needed. The flexible arm holds the phone perfectly and we have had zero issues.
5,Easy to install and use
5,When I got my new car and realized there are limited spots for a cell phone holder I was worried. I have a personal one (huge and heavy Moto Power) and a work one (light and trim Iphone 11) and need to have somewhere to keep them where I can see them.I bought a bunch of different ones and none of them worked out. They either wouldn't fit felt cheap or just plain didn't work at all.This one did the trick! It fits perfectly. It is super secure and snug and even handles the weight of my Moto power without flinching. You can move it around to get just the right angle and the clamps and release system seem far superior to the others I tried. BOTH my phones stay snug and secure in this thing even upside down!And the beauty is that when you don't need it you pull it out and toss in the trunk! No spots on your window no tape on your dash and no crazy magnets grabbing your stuff or ruining your case.I love this thing!
5,I bought this as a replacement for one I had that broke. This phone holder is more sturdy & fits tighter in my cup holder! I am very satisfied with the holder and how quickly it was shipped. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Have been wanting a way to hold my phone in the truck this is perfect for us. Easy to install extras for different size cup holders very sturdy and very flexible to position how you need it.
5,Extremely pleased with this product at first look and after setup which was very easy.  If this holds up for a while I’ll definitely buy again for the other car…and future cars!
4,Some nice features but the slighted bump from below knocks it apart. Happens if you reach for something next to it.  It is impossible to put back together with the front facing you.  You have to dismantle the whole thing and put it together with the support out of the cup holder.
5,Nice product for the money. Wish the Bendy thing was a little longer. Works great for me though
5,Easy install  and sturdy
5,Works
5,very  good
4,It was a gift to a friend. Works great.
4,For my vehicle this works best; however I wish it didn’t take up a cup holder.
4,The phone holder was easy to install no issues at all.  It is very adjustable for fitting different size cup holders.  What I like the most about it is that it has a tall neck on it so the phone sits high enough you don’t have to keep looking further down to see it when using a map app.  The neck is also adjustable so you can push it away from the shift control near the cup holder which is important so you don’t accidentally hit the release for the phone and dislodge the phone.  It also can easily be charged while in use.  Not the prettiest but appears to be functional and I’m glad I purchased it.
5,I needed this for an upcoming long distance road trip for which my cell phone will provide navigation and entertainment.  My previous cup holder phone mount was about 3 times the cost of this one and you needed to keep all of the [stackable] cups to “adjust” for various cup holder sizes.  The height was also fixed unless you bought an extension arm separately.  The adjustment capabilities of this holder are convenient and easy to use much more practical.  I’ve been using it already and am glad I made this purchase.The image provided shows the phone mount at its tallest height while secured in a couch cup holder….I forgot to take a picture of it in the car.  :)
5,Easy to install . And feels very sturdy.
5,Well worth the price for this product. Phone fits nicely into the holder and adjust easily
5,As of now  I like the sturdiness of the phone holder and the cradle features.
5,Used in my Prius. Works great except I always hit it. I wanted a holder closer to my mouth since listeners could not hear me. I hit it once a day. Possibly not used to it. I feel like i may break it due to accidentally hitting it one day. But otherwise strong & adjustable with tiny "filler" blocks to help secure into car holder.
5,It’s works great
5,Great solution to holding phone while driving.  Enables easy hands-free viewing of maps can rotate phone easily.  Phone slips in quickly locks in place and removes quickly.  Great product.
3,I have a Toyota van and this item doesn't fit snug in the cup holder.
2,... if you like things not well thought when it was being made and if you like things that break in 3 days from trying to postion it were it won't in the way.....
5,Because it is a gooseneck arm there is some vibration transmitted to it driving on the road but not having any issue because of it. It does work well and adjustable for the phone.  I do recommend if you're trying to avoid attaching any metal plate to the vehicle or use the vents. It obviously takes up one of your cup holders though.
5,Useful Gadgets - At the Right Price. Pending to see how long they last
5,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do: stay in place. I tried the WeatherTech "cup" product and it was not stable and was ill fitting.This fits very securely the arm (gooseneck) is very stiff and stays exactly as positioned. 5+ stars for now.Put in a BMW x3 (second gen) and could not be better.
4,i tried to use this in my semi but it was too firm. too much vibration to see the screen.  it's not gonna let your phone go and it did fit well into the cup-holder. .....however did not keep it installed in truck. I'm sure it will work well in a car. i gave the sturdiness a 4 star because i think with a lot of vibration it will crack somewhere.
2,not what i expected the "neck" (extension) is way to short than it appears (make sure to read the description for length of neck  before purchasing)  ...
5,This phone holder sits at a perfect height and because of the design of the cup holder it sits in any cup holder even my large cup holder.
5,Works well in our 2019 GMC Acadia Denali.  Very versatile in ability to situate in numerous positions.  If I try to think of a weakness it would be that inserting a phone is not easy without using two hands.
5,This is a great product that I ordered for my husband for Christmas. The company sent me two because I had not received the item and they promptly sent another. They are a great company and the product helps so much in my husbands mobile business.
2,Broke after a few months reached out to company for replacement and have not received a response. Guess I’ll go with Weathertech next time…
2,Purchased this for my husband who is a truck driver. Didn’t want to have anything to obstruct his view so we got one for the cup holder. It seemed to work at first but then the cushions that open up on the side seemed to start sticking. There are three total and they are all supposed to open and close and you twist the base. Two out of the three would come all the way out while the third one seemed to be stuck. Needless to say we found something else because this was not very reliable.
2,Broke in less than 6 months. Easy to install and adjust to your needs. Allows you to use a cup holder for the phone mount. Wish it did not give up on me this soon
5,I love this cup holder phone holder. It's what I needed. It fit my cup holder and I can turn my phone landscape way when I need it. It's very sturdy.
5,I like the fact it is easily adjustable.  Found if you move it around to much it looses it's sturdiness.
5,The Topco car cup holder phone mount is my third attempt at trying to keep my phone safely in the car and be able to see it.  My first brand clipped onto an air vent blocked the air conditioning and was impossible to see with the sun glare. My second one was Weather Tech (more than twice the price of the Topco) which was impossible to get to fit securely in my cup holder after wasting way to much of my time and that of my neighbor.  FINALLY...the Topcois perfect!  It fits securely adjusts easily to any angle you need and this 80 year old grandma "installed" it in the car in under 5 minutes!  An additional bonus:  it was delivered (according to my requested instructions) one day after I ordered it.  Get it for all of the drivers in your family!!!!
3,This holds the phone fairly well.  It seems to be somewhat unsteady in the cup.  It needs to be adjusted constantly in the cup to make sure it holds.
4,Works just like I expected
5,I needed a temporary phone holder for GPS while out of town for a few weeks in a borrowed car. I put this together in less than 30 seconds and in 5 minutes I was good to go!  I liked how I can have my phone close enough to touch it and how the holder can be used in multiple vehicles.  I am going to take this home and use it in place of the one that is stuck on my dash.
5,This cup phone holder is the best. It doesn’t wobble or tip over when driving. It stays exactly how I place it. The goose neck can be adjusted in any direction and the holder can be rotated 360 degrees to view upright or in landscape mode. It’s the best!
2,I really like it but it breaks with a heavier phone.
5,no
5,No suction on this device  phone cup holder
5,I've tried every type: dash mounted vent attached and windshield suction but none was as sturdy as this cup mounted phone holder. The gooseneck and cradle are also excellent  in quality and flexibility.  Unfortunately the adjustable pin mechanism  that holds the bottom of the phone became weak in about 10 months and my heavyGalaxy 21 ultra with case slipped down interfering with the side buttons. I contacted the companies Customer service and within 48 hours a new holder was sent out. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product again.
5,Sturdy and fits my cup holder
5,Bought it for my drive down to Florida. Worked amazing. Very happy with it
4,This phone holder is for my Samsung Galaxy S-7 Edge.  While the phone holder is very well made the most important factor to consider is the type of cup-holder configuration on your car or truck.  My car a 2008 Buick Lacrosse CXL sedan has the "moveable" separator device on the car's cup-holder configuration.  Basically the "moveable" separator has been designed by Buick to retract forward or rearward which would then allow for a larger cup or thermos.  A good Buick design but the "moveable" separator cannot be disassembled from the car.  The result:  Using the new Upgraded Car Cup Holder Mount properly requires a placement of a sturdy glass or cup within one of the car's console cup spots.  I know sounds confusing.  Still the new piece works great!
5,Easy to install and makes it easy to view your phone hands free.
4,I have an old 1997 Mazda pickup truck.  the cup holder is below and very close to the dashboard.  I didn't even try to install this with the expanders because I realized that I  would not be able to see the phone.  The picture shows it has a reach of 8" which is probably fine with center console cup holders but not for mine.  I would have needed probably 14"  to 16" for this to work for me.
5,Greatest I’ve seen yet
2,You will be frustrated and end up gluing the holder piece to the mount or using velcro on it because it comes off very easily.
5,No thanks
4,It’s good product however it’s movable neck it’s smaller. But it’s holds pretty good in cup holder and it’s hold steady and it’s place.
4,I use this phone stand sitting in my cup holder and it's sturdy and does the job needed!  I can't imagine needing a different one as mine sits in 'just' the right spot!  Honestly though my vehicle handles any incoming calls through the sound system and I do have a navigation system integrated as well but I will use Google Maps from my phone on occasion which is the main reason for owing this device!
5,Only had a few days but it perfect for my truck. Holds my phone perfect..doesn't wiggle lose..easy to put in n take out of holder. For me it's the right height but for taller people the longer neck one may be better. But really like mine. Bought several for gifts.
4,Although this works exactly like I need it to I wish the base was weighted because even though it expands to fit the slightest tap will cause it to topple. Easy enough to fix but I feel like a weighted base would improve the number of times I have to stand it back up.
5,Love this Phone Holder. It was easy to install and fit my 2014 Civic LX Cup Holders without the included Shims.I am using this Holder with a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 with a Ring Stand that makes it a little thick for this model to hold but it still works. This Company does offer models that would fit my thick Case and Ringstand better but that is my fault for not researching the other models offered.Only negative I have is the obvious one. You do lose a Cup Holder to the Phone Stand which may irritate your Passengers wanting a place to place their Beverage.
5,Great solution for my 2003 Corvette that I just purchased recently that has a cup holder that is only about 2.2  inches deep (not kidding) and there is absolutely no place else to put my phone safely while in the car other than some type of holder that mounts on the window or dash which I will not do. This does the job well and works into a space that other wise is completely useless. The only problem that I have now is due to the hinged cover on my cup holder (why Chevrolet put a cover on it is beyond me) squeaking because of the pressure holding the phone holder into the cup holder. Obviously this is in no way the fault of the phone holding device and I just haven't gotten around to seeing if I can remove the cover yet. The  phone holding device seems very well made and I am extremely happy with the product.
5,This Phone Mount Gooseneck Cup-Holder is a very useful addition to the car. I have an older car that I have to place the GPS on the top of the dashboard. There are time when I place the GPS on the dashboard to have it slide off the dashboard while driving. I have had the device for over  6 months with no problems. With this Phone Mount Gooseneck design I can adjust the view of my phone screen to quickly view the GPS running on my phone and not worry about it sliding off the dashboard. This is a nice adjustable sturdy Phone Mount Gooseneck Cup-Holder device.
5,Please excuse the little mess in the background but I bought this car cup holder for the bf because he was needing a holder for his phone. He used to have one of those you stick to the front window but that tacky melted and eventually it came off. He didn't want one of those again and so I first got him the vent mount but he didn't want that for his truck so he put that in his other car. He mentioned a cup holder and so I found this one for him. So far so good no complaints from him so it works as described and holds very firmly in the cup holder.
5,This Phone Holder fits perfectly in my truck and is great quality for the price. It holds the phone firmly with one button release. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Perfect for Sadan 4 door. I bought 2.  one for the 2018 Lexus ES350 and the other one for 2020 Toyota Camry.  They are all good.  Ilike them
3,Love the cup holder mount. It stays securely in the cup holder even in a cup that I needed to be placed in a retractable cup holder in my car. The good neck is great to adjust the phone to the right configuration. The phone mount is just a tad small for my phone that has a case and 3 credit card wallet stuck to the back. I wish the phone mount can have more depth. Still it does hold the phone securely. Width and height has great adjustability. The only thing that makes this a 3 star and this is a MAJOR problem is that the phone mount falls off the goose neck at the slightest provocation. It does not snap on! I touch it it falls off.  I make a sharp turn the phone and the mount goes flying off the goose neck to then other side of the car! This would be a 5 star if the mount can be locked onto the goose neck.
5,Bought this for my wife so she can drive hands free. Product fit in cup holder perfect (2006 Odyssey) and has great adjustability for optimum viewing. Like it a lot.
5,This was super easy to install gives me the freedom to have a phone holder in multiple vehicles without having to permanently stick or fasten something to the car.  I knew this going in but I have spoke with people who are disappointed because it takes up the space of a cup holder.  I know it’s kind of a duh since it is for a cup holder but if you don’t need the holder this is a fantastic product.  Most likely will buy a second so I don’t need to switch from vehicle to vehicle.
5,Wish I would have purchased this first.Push of a button..EASY RELEASE.Others say it.....but don't deliver! (That was my 1st purchase).Can't love this enough!
5,I bought this for me. I had bought one at Walmart and it was junk. This one is sturdy and easy to install.
4,This is a great holder. But if I could improve anything to it I would give it a longer neck so my phone is at a better view.
5,So much easier accessing my IPhone with this product. The gooseneck maneuverability is everything I need.  First such device for me to purchase...glad I did. I ended up buying 3 of them.
5,It was fast getting it. It does what it should. It holds your phone. Easy to use. 👍👍
5,This cup holder for the phone in the car is excellent.  They provided additional spacers to allow for a larger cup holder.  Put it in and it is perfect just what the wife wanted.
3,And once you have resigned yourself to surrendering the almighty cup you will- probably-be pleased with the functionality and design of this mount- the goose neck is quite adjustable and the grip design of the base works well.  Just remember...it goes in your cup holder...even with two cup holder spots in the console in my car one is (rear cup)- obviously lost to the mount and the other (front) is impeded by the mount...and the phone holder portion is a bit too close to the shift lever but this was deemed to be a good alternative to a dash mounted arm which I used previously.October update I was mostly pleased with this product until yesterday when I placed my phone in the holder the bracket disconnected from the gooseneck are- the small clips that attached the arm to the phone holder have broken off and this is now useless.  I just contacted the vendor and hope for a positive result...film at eleven..
2,Cheap. Bent on arrival.
5,I love the cup phone holder.  It fit easily into the cup holder and was easy to install.  However  sliding the phone holder part into the arm portion of the holder was a little more difficult.  I couldn't get it to snap in and realized that one of the brackets on the phone holder back was bent and was preventing the entire thing from snapping into place.  I was able to bend it into its original shape but was worried it would snap off since it was plastic.  Eventually after multiple tries I was able to snap the two pieces together and the entire piece has held up well.  I have only been using it for a week but so far it is working as stated.  The adjustable sides and bottom on the phone holder cover the microphone on my phone ( I listen to audible and Pod casts and have an older car with no blue tooth capability).
3,was disappointed that i received this and it was missing items to make it fit... had to return it instead and never did place a new order... will look for something else..
5,Holds phone securely and is adjustable!
2,Broke already and doesn’t stay in the place you try to sit it
5,The holder is pretty steady considering I have a pretty heavy phone attached to it. Take care and stay safe.Best regards
5,Gotta have this in my armada. It’s perfect height in my cup holder . Sturdy and fits all my phones . Definitely with the money.
5,I purchased this for my husband to replace a previous one he had. He liked this one.
5,Don’t know why I didn’t buy one years ago.Awesome for hands free. Totally adjustable
2,I was really excited for this holder. BUTTTT…It just wasn’t strong enough to to keep the phone sturdy. It would droop right after closing the phone in. The bendable part broke the second day.
4,Overall this is great. It securely fits in my cup holders and I like the bendable neck and the 360° turning ability. However......1 strong star is deducted because when you attach the phone holder to the neck it doesn't hold. It is supposed to CLICK in....and it ....kinda....does.....but it doesn't hold at all. One slight bump or tap and it immediately falls off the neck and my phone disappears into the depths of my car. Pretty annoying! So now I will either have to glue it onto the neck or tape it in some way.
5,Like that I don’t have to fumble around for my phone hands free and convenient.  Nice to have in my truck.
5,Very sturdy and goes in a lot of different positions  flexible and sturdy for your phonefits in the cup holder of my 2007 Honda Odyssey nicely
5,Was impressed with this. I can never get the windshield ones to stay. This one is very stable and you can adjust it easily. Must buy
2,I drive a Honda Odyssey and I found the cup holder to be a bad spot for this. It worked fine but I had to look down too much while navigating. I ended up switching to a model with an air vent clip so it was more eye level.
5,Great quality!
5,Easy to install and use
5,I had one that clipped in my vents. It was always falling out and too far away. This one is sturdy comes out very easy if you need to use the second cup holder in the console for another drink.
5,Works like a charm
5,Cheaper & Better than more expensive cup holders like weather tech.
3,It’s ok. The phone holder part falls out so easy so you have to be careful with how you put the phone in or take it out. But I guess it’s good for the price.
3,It has great suction to fit ur cup holder! The only thing I don’t care for is the top piece it doesn’t stay very sturdy when u connect both pieces! It works….but once u take ur phone off! The top piece comes off to easy!
3,If the phone holder would stay connected to the gooseneck in the provided slots I'd give it 5stars! But it comes off 90% of the time if you bump it. It holds the phone well fits the cup holder great. Just thd falling off is ridiculous. Gonna buy something else after I try and glue it together!
5,I use this on my golf cart works great
2,The phone kept falling out of the holder
5,It’s exactly what they described as.. very goo
3,The device came as described.  Shame on me for not paying attention to the size.  In my Hyundai Elantra it takes up a lot of space leaving it difficult to get drinks out of the adjacent cup holder.  It is tricky to get it installed with the three "legs" in a cup holder with a gap for a cup holder.  With a little patience it can be done.  I didn't return the device but I'm currently not using it hoping to find a use for it in the future.
5,The phone mount fit perfectly in the cup holder of my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and was easily tightened to be secure without the need to use the additional pads. I love that it is easy to adjust the gooseneck to an angle and height that is perfect for me. I use my phone mount with my phone in a vertical position and the side slider clamps hold it securely in place. Additionally it is very easy to remove my phone by simply pressing the button on the back. This phone mount is a quality product and met all my expectations.
5,The product is a good value easy to move from vehicle to vehicle and a great safety feature.
5,Bottom line is that this cellphone cup holder works like a charm. Easy to install maintains its tightness in excellent fashion both in the cup holder and wit the cellphone itself. The release mechanism of the cellphone brackets is easy to use and activated by a simple push of a button on the back of the holder. The location of the center console cup is of importance in terms of the ease of reach by the right hand from the wheel. My cup holders are to the back of the console which makes it a bit awkward although not impossible to manipulate if for instance answering the phone. The further to the front the easier it would be to use for sure. I like gooseneck extension as it makes it quite easy to view.
4,Ordered for a Christmas gift for my father in law. Received and it was missing the piece that holds the actual phone. Sent a message to the company and got a quick response saying they would send a new one. Very easy to work with and they take care of their customers. I would recommend to my other friends and family. Great quality— similar to weathertechs cell phone holder.
4,a little awkward having to look down with it in the cup holder but it holds and says put
4,One disadvantage is that you lose a cup holder when installing this.  Works well easy to install . . .
4,Some car cups locations has opening between them. So this (three extenders) keep moving out
5,It came quickly very easy to assemble and fits right into the cup holder. Just need to tighten it for a snug fit.
5,Installed in my Rv seems to be good quality and works great. At its price vs other brands well worth price
5,I needed a phone holder for my daughter's Honda CRV but none of the cup holder style phone holders worked in her car. I was not convinced on this as suction cup holders I never quite believed in. I planned to use on the windshield although that was not my preference. So when I received it and went to install it I thought I’ll try it on the dash but it won’t work. Surprise! Worked great stuck like glue. Has had for several weeks now and remains a sturdy phone holder solution for her.
4,The cup mount extenders need a rubberized grip. It keeps falling out.
5,This worked well for a two week trip from AZ to MI and back.  I had rented a Jeep Grand Cherokee (2019) for the trip and used it in the forward-most cup holder.  With the added rubber pads it fit just fine.  With the three mounts fully extended and placed to capture the sides it did not move a bit during the entire trip.  One thing I discovered however which garnered a 4-star for sturdiness was that the neck rotated up to about 5 degrees.  Not a problem but not as solid as I had hoped.  Also it did tend to oscillate a bit due to the length of the neck but with my tall coffee container right next to it it rarely noticed it as it was damped out with that in the cupholder adjacent.  Would recommend this porduct.
5,Good phone holder for the price.  Uses cup holder instead of windows.  It is very stable and gets the job done!
5,About a year and a half ago I purchased the earlier model. The upper mount that attaches to the base of the phone holder Brokenot happy with that.As I was searching for another model I noticed a new model had to come out which I decided to try.The phone holder itself opens up much smoother and seems to be sturdierI hope this one lasts longer otherwise I’ll take it to the shooting range and use it for target practiceThanks Jim
5,Perfect for my husband’s work van. He loves it.
5,Perfect!
2,Absolutely terrible. Not sturdy at all. Shakes and wobbles even at max tightness. The holder for the phone is clunky and not smooth  and worst of all - it has a silly proprietary back plate  so can't even swap out the phone holder .Definatly avoid.
5,I love it because my truck has abnormally sized cupholders and all other ones I have tried were either too big or too small. This has little inserts that you can place wherever you need to add them in. It fits perfectly is easy to adjust to the height and angle you need but is still sturdy and strong once you get it where you need it.  Also it doesn't fall down while driving like my boyfriend's does.
5,I ordered this phone holder for my husband. My sister has one and recommended me to buy my husband one. He loves it! I highly recommend this product.
5,We had one for over 2 years just replaced
5,I've tried the suction mount type phone cell phone holders for my vehicle and I was not impressed.  I saw this item on Amazon and I figured why not try it.  At first I thought it would be bulky and block my use of my console but I was wrong!  This item not only holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max securely it does not hinder my use of my center console.  The arm is very flexible and sturdy and keeps in place as you drive.  I highly recommend this product.
5,Initially purchased this phone holder in 12/20 however after a few months the arm snapped when adjusting it… I contacted Topgo direct and within days received a replacement…  The new one appears to be upgraded and stronger… Excellent service from a company who stands behind their products and aims to please their customers !!! Thank you…
5,It fit in the cup holder as described. It is a great place to keep my phone while driving.
3,Easy to use but my cell would  fall off often
5,Sturdy and easy to install. Product is designed with side buttons in mind. Adjustments can be made so that all of your buttons are accessible.
3,I find suction power not good it moves a lot. Was easy to install
4,easy to use
4,That’s exactly what I was looking for. Installation was an absolute breeze and the gooseneck is pretty versatile and bands pretty much any way you want it to. I’ve only had it for a couple of days but it fits in all of my different cupholders. I am skeptical to see how the gooseneck holds up because I tend to bend it quite a bit. Pretty stuck with my purchase.
5,Good quality and height
4,The product is good for about 3 months then it starts wearing out and not opening and closing properly.  Mine finally snapped in 2 pieces and is useless.  I emailed the company a week and a brand new phone car mount was delivered.
5,This took about 30 seconds to 'build' (slipping one part onto another) and about 30 seconds to install in the vehicle's cup holder.  It seems to hold very well the 'gooseneck' is stiff enough to hold its position (for example when you hit a bump) and even with the large lever arm make up from the gooseneck it is still seemed very sturdy.  The gooseneck flexibility really allows you to move the phone toward you or away from you move it out of the way of other dashboard controls etc.  All in all this looks like a great product and at least 1/2 the cost of other highly-advertised products.
2,I was expecting it to be as good as what I got my mom but this product is of way less quality. The part to place your phone on is loose and keeps on turning. Has no way to tighten it.
2,Was off to a good start but this ended up being junk sadly. The top part that holds the phone ended up being unscrewed after 2 months just by rotating the thing LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO. So I glued the piece back on only to have it snap off a couple weeks later. Now if I want to glue it all back together again I can no longer rotate my phone anymore. Was surprised how fragile the top section really is. Will not be buying from this brand again. Get a weathertech phone holder instead.
5,This is just what I was looking for for our golf cart. Fits beautifully and it’s very sturdy. Would highly recommend!
5,Used it once in a rental car. It works but a bit bulky to carry around
5,I love that this is taller than my vent because when I would just put my phone in my cup holder and have my heater or ac on my phone would get too hot or too cold and turn off! And it was the perfect place for me to look when I was driving and using my GPS function because I travel a lot for work. With the cup holder it lifts it above the vent and I am good to go.
2,Worked a good while then stopped staying up and today it just broke from mount.
4,I ordered this because I rely on the GPS Feature of my phone while driving. It securely holds the phone the Gooseneck Feature allows me to adjust it for the drives.  The only thing I like for an improvement is for it to be able to accommodate a phone case I have to remove mine each time not problem but I worry about dropping such a high cost ticket without the protective case.
5,Works great in my 2017 Ford escape.
2,Build quality seems solid but the phone grip does not lock firmly into arm of holder. If you go over any hard bumps your phone will be tossed.
5,Time will tell if the item continues to hold up but initially it performs as expected.
4,Worked good for about a month and then it lost its stability. Phone stays in the holder but falls to the sideways position. Wanted to return or exchange but by then it was too late. I would suggest another brand trust stands by it's product for longer than 30 days.
4,It seems to be sturdy with the exception of the phone cradle. The cradle falls off easily when removing the phone or if you hit it with your hand accidentally. Simple fix: Gorilla glue on the connection of the cradle to the post.
5,Outstanding customer service!! Look no further!!
5,I bought 2 of these one for my husbands 2017 Chevy Silverado truck and one for my 2015 Infiniti Q50. Works great in both vehicles. Does not shake or vibrate at all and is easy to use. I bought the one with the 8” gooseneck. I can adjust it just the way I need. We both have iPhone 12 Pro Max and it fits perfect. Great buy!
5,Works well
4,I was in love with this phone holder for all of 4 hours... until the cradle piece made all of plastic no longer closed to hold my phone in place... now the phone will lay on it if I keep the angle just right and I hope I don't hit a bump or have to turn sharply...******** Company reached out to me and sent me a new item. This one seems better  but the release button still seems very flimsy. I love it but the cradle piece still does not seem to be very sturdy.
4,Fits well inside Cup holder
4,Good product. Great for trips. Two things to note:1. It may get in the way of putting the car in drive.2. Hard to attach charger or headphones for some phone models.This system is fits snuggly in the cup holder and it works great to hold phone when GPS needed.
4,Even though I tighten the locking nut tight it still at times comes out of the cupholder
5,It won't work for my car if I need to dial. My spouse uses it for music while traveling. It easy for that
3,Seems I have gone through a ton of vent mounts and none seem to work. The magnetic version the phone would fall off. The cradle version the arms never held. After reading I thought I would try this version. The idea is fantastic. However this updated version still can use a bit of work. The push button to open the sides feels cheap. Cranking the dial to tighten the holder feels like it will strip. The extenders were a nice touch. The arm is very stiff so drooping shouldn't be a concern.
4,It is not very steady and not very easy to tighten
2,Bracket that hold the phone constantly pops of the main arm.
5,great price and very easy to install
4,The 'improved' unit works fine; I actually had to leverage the additional clips to make the base fit in a wide cup-holder on my Ram pickup - a nice feature. I have an after-market protective case on my Galaxy phone and it fits in with no problem and the feature allowing the charging cable to be engaged to the phone is nice as well.
5,My husband needed a phone holder and we got this one for him. He loves it and it is easy to use. The one problem I have is that he put it in the cup holder next to the passenger seat and I have hit it a couple of times with my purse. No biggie as it is easy to adjust but he complains. Lol.
4,The holder is slightly too tall for holder would have been better to adjust height lower otherwise convenient.
5,Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  He drives a lot and is always using his hands free but had no where to sit his phone.  The holder fit right in his cup holder and tightened down easily.  The flexible hose is firm but easily adjustable to where you want your phone to sit.  My husband adjusted it shorter with no problem.  It sits firm with no bouncing while driving.  The best part is the quick release button on the back.  Easy in and out makes this holder convenient to use and positioned where it works for you!I definitely will buy another one.
4,I liked the simplicity of putting this together. My only concern is that you really have to make sure that you have the item installed in the cupholder tightly otherwise it tips very easily. It's definitely worth the money.
4,This was easy to install and fit into my cup holder nicely.  It is easy to place the phone in the holder as well as release it.  The gooseneck allows for some movement as the car is traveling along but not so much that you are not able to see what is on the phone and interact with it
5,I drive a 2008 Impala and really needed a good sturdy cup holder based phone holder.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Ohio and this worked so well! It's easily adjustable to fit my cup holder snugly and didn't wobble during the ride keeping the phone steady. Love this product!
5,Very easy to install though it does take SOME time so that you have the right measurement. All in all I really wanted a phone mount for my car but I hated the ones that you stick on because due to the heat of the sun (especially during the summer) it bleeds onto your dashboard and makes it even harder to remove not to mention that they have a habit of breaking easily and not easy to move toward you when you're on the road. I like how sturdy this product is. Highly recommend if you're like me and don't want anything glued to your dashboard or your windshield.
4,Easy to use phone holder. Works well
3,Every time I try and release it it falls apart.
5,Good qualityTry to find something like this for MINI Cooper for long time finally I found this one❤️.
5,It was not as sturdy as I expected but ok.
5,Makes having car in phone easier to access and makes safer to do so.  Glad I have it.
4,It looks like it should last fir awhile.
5,Easy to  useGood  holdness
3,Bought this to hold a backup camera receiver rather than a phone about the same size but the nature of the viewer is that it need to be horizontal.  The holder slides on to the bracket but doesn't latch so sometimes falls going over bumps.  Appears that it would be more stable in the vertical position.  Will also use for phone.  Fits fine in cup holder and tightens nicely - that bit is good.  Overall - adequate but not a perfect solution for my needs.
4,This is the best one that I have purchased. Also nice price.  Don't like the ones that plug into air vents.
3,Overall it's a good phone holder.  It fit snugly in my Lexus ES350 cup holder without using the extension pieces and was easy to install.  I like that both the side pieces and the bottom have grip padding as well as the back rest for the phone ..... however I question whether this will hold up in a hot car during the summer.  (I suspect that the glue may melt and turn into a gooey mess.)  The side open / close mechanism is smooth and works well.  I am deducting points because I do not like the placement of the release button which is in the center of the back.  I find it extremely awkward to reach / push.
1,The phone cup holder fits into the cup holder with no issue but the stem does not hold the phone up. It droops down over a bit of time to where you cannot see the phone screen. The phone holder comes off the minute a small bump is hit. It is a terrible phone holder. I am so sorry I'd tried it out to late to be able to return it!!!Worst product ever!!!!!
5,Could have been two inches taller.
5,Got this for my housemate as a gift. He drives a sports car and the vent clips aren't great for that. It was easy to put together and he said it fit in the cup holder well also that didn't move while he was driving. The goose neck was pretty stiff too. Seems like a win to me.
5,This phone cup holder was easy to install.  I like how I can move it in any direction.  The neck of my old holder wore out and would bend all the was down with the weight of the phone in the holder.  This holder has a very strong neck.  That will not happen with this holder.  I would recommend this product and buy it again if I had to.
2,Product telescoping arm too tall for my vehicle configuration- will be returning product
4,I am used to it being on the front window so that I can still see the road as I drive.  The problem was they all fall off. The cup holder is secure but you do have to look down a bit. I am getting used to just quickly glancing.
5,My granddaughter had one and I looked how it wasn't in the way of gear shift or water bottle.  The one I had was cumbersome if I had a drink in the cupholder.
5,Great phone holder. Adjustable to different sizes. Great grip on the phone. Perfect height!
5,There is no suction feature to this product and I did not expect any. All you do is sit in in one of your cup holders and adjust it to the circumference. There are additional caps to put on the expanders for more expansion. Other than that it is not rocket science. The phone holder is adjustable with a little button on the back to move the holder in and out. Another not rocket science.
5,We really like the cup phone holder. It holds my wife’s iPhone 12 and my iPhone 12 Pro Max excellent. It is very sturdy. Gooseneck never moved while traveling. We put the cup phone holder in our square cup holder in our sonata and it never moved. It is an excellent product and I would highly recommend.
5,Love that it turns so I can change my phone from vertical to horizontal view (when we’re on a long road trip and only a quick show will make my kids stop screaming). Literally fits any cup holder. Also has extenders you can pop on if you expand it all the way and the cup holder is still too big. Durable holds phone well. Phone holder part expands to fit different sized phones.  Perfect for hands free driving. Bought 2 and very impressed with both.
3,The first week it was amazing but then the arms that hold the phone in place started not opening with the press of the button on the back. It is still useable but now you have to be careful when you have your phone plugged into the charger because if the arms are not set right then it puts a lot of pressure on the charger plug and I had to replace the phone. It was a cheap phone but still. Also the arms are not quite thick enough to hold a phone with a cover and popits on it. On a side note I do deliver pizzas at night so it was put through a little more the first week then most people would do. At least as far as opening and closing the arms.
4,Decent cell phone holder for the value. Very sturdy and holds strong after 3 months now. It's kind of bulky but you can't beat the durability. Easily adjustable to many different phones. Has never come undone or dropped my phone even in rough driving conditions.
4,DOES NOT STAY WELL IN CUP HOLDER THE GEAR SHIFT HITS IT WHEN WE PUT IN DRIVE. TO ADJUST ANGLE OF THE PHONE YOU NEED TWO HANDS. UNLESS JUST A QUICK TWIST OF THE PHONE FROM VERTICLE TO HORIZONTAL
4,Like this product only draw back wish it was a little more flexible to move up and down if you must adjust for lighting.  The neck could be a little longer so that it’s not so far away. And also a little more durable so that it is not moving as much if your texting while your phone is docked.
3,It will not stay held.. I have taken it out of my car. I had to keep re -twisting it to keep it in position. It is easy to install and is well made except it doesn't stay in position.
3,The phone holder section snaps onto the arm okay but is a bit loose and the rotation is hampered by incremental clicks that won't let you adjust it exactly vertical.  it either leans a bit to the right or the left.  Another brand that I bought has a ball and joint type pivot that can be infinitely adjusted and then tightened down to not move and is very solid and secure.
4,I liked that my phone fit very sturdy and at a good eye level. I disliked the installation I had difficulty with putting together the stand and phone holder plus fitting it snugly in my car's cup holder. After it was fit in it has stayed in place even though the neck wobbles the phone. I think it is the best I can find for the use. It was better to use in my Camry than having a phone holder on the vent.
5,Using this product in my car works great. Hands free
4,When phone is not in it the holder tends to rattles while driving.
3,I was initially very happy with the phone holder.Mine eventually fell apart WITHIN 2 MONTHS. The base is in tact but the frame that holds the phone no longer attaches to the "arm" section. Can you send out a replacement part to me?
5,I have no complaints. Been using for a couple months and have no complaints. It's sturdy and strong enough to hold your phone in the same position you want it in. Even on bumpy roads.
5,Worked excellent
5,Bought the first version of this and my phone just barely sit in it with case. This is what the Dr ordered. Bigger is always better. The side arms and bottom bracket hold my phone great. The arm is stiff enough that it doesn't shake but still able to adjust. The design for the cup holder is genius. Hate giving up a drink holder but sticking a mount to my dash is a no go. Been using for a bit and going strong. The adjustment for the cup holder is pretty universal
5,Llegó muy rápido y era lo que esperaba y es muy fácil instalar y se ve muy bien en mi carro
5,I have a Samsung A51 phone with a heavy duty LoveMi case. It fits perfectly when the holder clips are opened all the way. The base also fits perfect due to the adjustable base in my Nissan Versa. The gooseneck is very solid and firm and stays in place real well.  This is quality. Very happy with this cupholder!
5,It was easy to install. So far it seems to hold my phone pretty well. For some reason I thought the “neck“ would be longer or telescoping. That would’ve been handy so that I  wouldn’t have to take my eyes off the road as much as I do to use this but fortunately I have a cup holder at the dash level so it isn’t too bad.
4,You can pay 37.00 for the one advertised on TV or $17.00 for this one. It does the same thing.  Holds your phone securely in a cup holder.  Seller is great.  My first Topgo didn't fit my iPhone 10X with a Pop Socket and Topgo immediately refunded my purchase price .  Then they created another version that fit the Pop Socket and sent me a note.  That's the kind of service Amazon buyers deserve.
5,This was the first car cup holder that has worked for me. It easily adjusts to the size of the cup holder by tightening or loosening the cleats on the holder. This product does not work on suctioning which fails so many times.  The stem also adjusts so when I’m the passenger and not the driver I can still easily see my phone.
5,Had this installed and in use in less than 5 minutes.  It appears to be able to fit even the largest cup holders.  Easy to twist to adjust to fit whatever cupholder size.  The 3 adapter pieces for even larger cup holders than our Kia has will just have to sit in a drawer just in case but others might need them.
4,This adjust yo the size of the car cup holder.  Sturdy and able to position easily.  Price is better than a named brand and works as well
5,The holder needs to be more flexible in order to make it useable but at a very low visibility point. I will have to order one that is mountable on the dash which I didn’t want.
5,I liked that it will fit any cup holder adjustable
4,Very nice product at a reasonable price holds phone securely and locks nicely in the cup holder.
4,Bought this as a gift for my sister whoLiked it but wished it was even longer to place her phone closer to eye level.  However she still uses and likes it.
4,Surprisingly adjustable.  It fit the large cup holder opening in my Highlander.The good: expandable base and phone cradle good height for phone seems sturdy well made.Drawback; the clamps that hold your device are a little stiff and or awkward to use until you get used to them.  But they do hold your device securely.
5,I ordered this after being referrer to it by a friend. This product is my solution to being able to see my phone hands-free without it falling onto the floor an out of sight. I had a clip that slid into the airvent but it couldn't hold my IPhone 8+ and the case. this stand has been wonderful so far. I had to give up a cup-holder but it certainly is a piece of mind. I should have bought it sooner.
5,The phone holder slides down but does not lock in place I keep knocking it off
5,I too had difficulty attaching the gooseneck plate to the back of the phone holder. The pressure needed to "click" the locking slots is more than bare hands can apply. My tool of choice was an Irwin soft jaw ratcheting bar clamp. While holding the two plates flush I positioned one jaw on the top edge of the phone holder and the other jaw in the lower edge of the gooseneck plate. I gave the clamp a couple of gentle squeezes and the plates "clicked" and were solidly locked together. Once assembled and installed this phone holder performs flawlessly with no wiggle or bounce while traveling - the gooseneck is solid.
4,I have a 2019 Toyota Tacoma. The cupholder has become loose 2 times in the last couple months. I do not use it everyday but have a tendency to hit it when I am parking or turning on the a/c. The times that it has held my phone it is sturdy and holds the phone in a position that I can see it while driving. I would purchase the item again.
5,The cup holder is superb and works perfectly.  I am able to easily see my phone without distraction when it is time to exit the vehicle.
5,these surveys
3,The phone holder is supposed to raise the phone up so you can see it. Only raises about 2 inches. Wold not recommend this product.
4,Sturdiness
5,Great stuff but I wish the neck was longer phone gets in the way of shifter.... 8in isn't  enough  once  you fold the phone down it reduces  the neck length by 4 inches. The when you move it to miss shifter it's even shorter. I have  a mini cooper 2011.
4,Too short for my car
3,Poor quality
5,I love it when it arrive I've put into  my cup holder. When I am not driving I place it into my arm rest compartment and lock it  so no one can break my window and take it.  Let me know my grand total balance that I owe my favorite store. I have mailed you a payment  look out for it :) Thank-you! :)A proud Life time customer service.Ms. Cynthia Garza (was a Story lol)
4,The phone holder does not stay on the neck of the holder the slightest movement knocks it off. Bad design I need to glue it to make it stay.
5,Sorry I only  talk "suction power"  in private.
2,Not very flexible and broke where the stem meets the holder the third time I used it.
4,cup holder came undamaged only problem that i had was one of the side springs came out  tore holder down inserted  spring back in  ok now.
5,The cup holder is great. So easy to install and fits perfectly. Only  negative for me could have been about an inch and a half taller. But no problem I used the extra extensions that came with the cup holder to solve that problem; just placed them in the bottom of holder and "Voila!" my desired height.
5,I use it in my car for work. The suction power is much better than other brands. Very easily to install and very sturdy. Easy to move up or down or adjust to just about any position. Very happy with it.
4,Good height for my truck. Occasionally gets in the way when shifting. Like that I can glance at it only taking eyes from road for a split second.
5,Easy to install.  Simply twist the base to extend the cup holder wedges.  Extra wedges provided in case your cup holder is very large.  I purchased 2 phone holders one for a Volvo and 1 for a Lincoln and they both fit perfectly.
3,The bracket and phone holder do not stick together firmly or steadily. It keeps falling out without a notice. I consider it as a cookie phone cup holder or a piece of trash.
2,I remember reading from a review that the holder isn't sturdy because it's not a fixed arm. I thought to give it a try anyway but I don't like it. The length is also quite short and the bottom doesn't secure well after a few drives
4,If you super glue the phone pad to the moveable arm it works well. If you do not the phone pad falls off of the arm almost every time you touch it.
3,I bought 2 of these one for me and the other for my husband. They are perfect for his Equinox and my Traverse. It holds the phone in place very well. We both have S21 Ultra unfortunately 7 months after we bought it one of them broke
3,Never secured into the cup hole.  Tried everything removed cup holder liner left it in repositioned base according to where the clips would extend to took case off of phone etc.....  Every possible combination I could come up with & still no secure fit.  Finally decided to trash it not even worth my time to return.
5,I purchased mainly for road trips using Google maps. I did entertain the idea to purchase a holder that hangs from the A/C vent. A friend of mine has one like that but after riding a few times with him I didn't like how it blocks air flow. The only drawback is that you're loosing a cupholder  but the door cupholder can be used. I let my wife try it in her car. She liked it so much I didn't get it back and purchased another one.... LOL. The holder is very easy to install sturdy and adjustable for orientation purposes. Completely satisfied with this purchase.
1,This is the second one of these I have bought. I thought with the first one I did something but no! When I rotated the phone to turn it sideways it broke off the holder. Each one that I had did the same thing. I will never purchase these again! Waste of money!
5,I really like this product. It does not move once it is placed.  I've ordered at least 6 vent phone phone holders and they were not sturdy enough and for safety reasons I gave up trying to keep using them. Then I found this. Now my sister has one. I actually ordered this for my husband to use in his truck and now I will have to get these for my daughters. I'm recommending them to all of my family and friends. Thank you for a great product thats great for phones and safe!!
5,Overall the cup holder works well.  It's easy to assemble and is a snug fit.  It performs well and easy to use.  No problems experienced in the few days that I have used it.  The quality appears t be good and durable.
4,It's sturdy and exactly what is described. Only issue is it is a little too big. Overall like the product.
5,I have tried at least 5 phone holders and this one is THE BEST!  Yes you have to give up a drink holder but it's better than giving up an AC vent (I live in TX) or an ugly suction device that doesn't even stick or something that obstructs your view.  I've bought holders from the dealership too and those were awful.
4,don't know about anything other than this item to hold the phone while I use it....gps stuff is cumbersome  unless your cup holder is on your dash
4,The little blocks that you put on the base of the unit .. Seem to fall off easily.. It would be better if the neck was a little more flexible but maybe it is because it is still new and has to brake in... Other wise has held my phone without dislodging from the holder.. So far so good.. Have had this about 2 weeks
5,I have an iPhone 8+ in an Otterbox case AND with a pocket attached. . . This holder is deep enough to securely hold it in place! I’ve tried several other holders but this - this is the best
4,Fit easily Phone went in and out easily and it held it securely Love the flexibility so you can move phone to just right viewing angle.
5,Absolutely love this! Such a great price hold my iPhone max pro without it being to heavy like similar ones I have tried. Love the flexibility of this and the options of angles and very easy to install and move from vehicles because I didn’t order one for each vehicle while on sale! Highly recommended & I never leave reviews!
4,I like the swivel and suction. Stays in place wellI dislike the side phone wings. Sometimes they stick making it hard to adjust to fit the phone
5,Installed and tightened fine in cup holder that was more square than round. Had NO issue inserting gooseneck into phone holder - locked in place with little effort. Holds Iphone SE just fine and both holder and gooseneck adjust with no trouble; holds phone tightly with easy access to charge port on bottom. Can't see any issues so far -seems like very good quality. Don't know why others had any issues...
4,It is very well designed and made. There is only one flaw - the plate connects to the gooseneck very loosely and it tends to jump off when you disengage the phone from the holder. Hence minus one star.
5,works great fits great
5,Fits well in my cupholder. You twist it to get a good fit and can untwist to loosen to remove if you need the space for a drink for the passenger. The neck is easy to adjust to an angle/height you want to use. Does what it is supposed to do!
5,Pleased with this holder. It stays put in my cupholder and does not even fall out when I raise my center console on my 19 F150 to make a full bench seat. It stays put and is in place whenever I lower it back down to use the cupholders and arm rest again. Holds my phone tight in place as well.
5,Quick and easy to put in or take out. Has no issue holding my iphone inside the OtterBox. Quick release button makes it is to pull phone out. Seems pretty sturdy so far.
5,This product works perfectly. I previously bought a Weathertech with an adjustable extension but it neither fit snugly into my vehicles’ cupholders nor did the extension stay in place.This model fits in very snugly and the gooseneck extension stays firmly in place. So buy this not Weathertech’s similar model.
3,It is designed to fit in any cup holder and easy to adjust. Because my phone has buttons on the side the holder can accidentally press on the lowest button. The gooseneck is adjustable but not stiff enough to hold my phone tightly to activate the touch screen.. It feels like it’s in the way of the shifter but that would be true with most cup holder mounts. If you use Bluetooth it’s probably not worth having the phone take up space in a cup holder.
5,Gave as Gifts and Family Member & Friend Loved the Gift!
1,This product takes a lot of time to adjust and get it right and then it’s not very good at that. Would of liked a better made product. Felt it was cheaply made. After trying it out I was past the return window so I ended up throwing it away.
5,It works better than expected. I don't have to look down to my waist or by my gear shift when I have my GPS on. I have a sedan and a cup holder is back behind my waist. What's the extension I can angle with towards the front the phone is up high so I don't have to take my eyes off the road I can just glance it's very nice and safe.
5,This product is exactly the way I need it. It is very sturdy and it keeps my phone right where I can see everything without taking my eye off the road.
3,Fits my iPhone 12 Pro Max well. Easy install in my 2021 GMC Elevation. Only bad thing is it shakes pretty bad when driving…
4,Works well to hold the phone securely. The downside is it takes up a cup holder. The upside is it works and doesn’t do any permanent damage (no screws or adhesives) to the vehicle. I bought mine on sale and it’s totally worth the price. Works much better than any other holder I’ve purchased to date. Would recommend.
5,Was a Christmas gift and worked out well.
5,Great product
5,This is a good product at an excellent price. It stays secure in the cup holder and the adjustable grips for the phone work great. The nav system in my car isn’t working so I needed something to keep my phone secure and visible while using Waze on a recent solo 1000 mile road trip. I only wish the gooseneck was an inch or so longer but really no complaints!
5,Works wey
5,Purchased for my husband who is particularly difficult to buy for. He loves it. I personally got a little tired of his phone sliding off of the middle armrest in his vehicle. He installed within minutes with ease. I am considering getting me one for my car. I should warn that this product does not work well in the closest cupholder to the driver. Had to be installed in the holder for the passenger .Awesome well made product! I hope that it lasts for years.
5,I use this to mount my phone in my kayak in the cup holder. It's amazing. I get so many questions and compliments. It works GREAT. Easy to use. Only thing I wish is a little more study stability with the top of the bend. If the phone is heavy it can lean if the stem is not fully straight. All in all great gadget.
4,Could not ask for a better product hold the chaos in one location as I drive down the interstate
5,Needed my hands free & don't like the window attachments.  I can also take it from car to car.
5,My Scion xB has two different cup sizes and this phone cup holder accommodated both.  I have another car with larger cups and I am sure this will fit it as well.  It's very easy to install - just stick the cup in and twist it until it fits your car.  This fits my Samsung Note 9 with the phone case on with lots of room to spare from side to side.  I can charge my phone while using this as well.  Overall I am very glad I found this phone cup holder!!
4,Very handy Easy to use.
5,I was disappointed at first because the cup didn't fit my work car.  It have to have a cup holder that is Enclosed.  I tried it in another car and it fit like a glove.  The ring have to be tighten often.  No major problem to tighten the ring on the cap.  Good product.  You will be pleased.
4,It's taller than I'd like. Somewhat difficult to adjust but very sturdy. Very nice product.
5,I really like this phone holder.  I initially had one of the holders that attached to the car vent but realized that it wasn't really helpful as it blocked the airflow.  Its very sturdy and the neck is longer than I expected which is a plus.  The first holder I received was faulty but the manufacturer quickly replaced it free of charge and 2 days later.  I'm very pleased with this product and the service.  I have a Galaxy Note 9 and i initially thought the phone would be too large but it fits perfectly.
5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas! He loves it! he can now talk on the phone or see who's calling without touching his phone which is so much more safe and legal.  It adjust to any size cup holder and is very sturdy! great choice.
5,Did what I wanted it to do!
4,Very easy to install but the part that holed the phone is not sturdy enough.  Can’t see it lasting very long
5,I take this on the road with me when I don’t know what type of rental car I’ll wind up with. It fits any size cup holder and stays steady.  The “stalk” is heavy duty and does not wobble.
3,Wish the flexible neck was longer.
5,Have tried a million different types of holders and finally found a winner. Wanted something with no suction and that had a long extension. My husband uses while he is trucking. Works perfectly for him. His phone stays in place even with all of the bouncing the truck does. Will definitely by another one for our personal vehicles.
4,Very adjustable and stable. This is my second one cause the first one the buttons stopped functioning. They are plastic so once you have the size of your phone set don’t mess with them. But it’s a good product and a really good price.
1,Base does not fit in 22 Dodge trucks. I got this to hold my phone. No matter how tight I tighten the base it does not grip. Falls out and is useless. Would not recommend
5,This is by far the best car phone holder I have used. I've now tried 3 others and they weren't very acceptable. This fits in any cupholder is sturdy yet offers flexibility. I'm very satisfied and have stopped seeking alternative phone holders
5,Nothing. Yes
5,Easy to use and adjust
5,I absolutely love this product. It fits my Lexus RX 350 2015 like a glove. I had previously purchased a different model that did not fit in my cup holder it was too large. I am very pleased and satisfied with this product. You won’t be sorry with this purchase.
5,Ordered one for myself a year ago and just ordered another for my daughter.  Works for smaller or larger cup holders and doesn't wabble around.  Love it!
4,I had a hard time connecting the phone holder to the stand... once I figured it out it performs as advertised
5,Impressed with how sturdy the piece is that holds phone in the air.  Keeps my phone up does not fall down. Apple 8 plus fits perfectly.  And this opens and fits tightly in my cup holder in my car  Will buy anither for other vehicle
5,This is not a suction device. It’s a expanding device for your cup holders. It works well and fits any cup holder. You have to glance down if you are following map directions but only for a split second.
4,Just what I needed. Works great.
5,Weathertech TV commercial got me looking for a cell phone cup holder.  Spotted these online forhalf the price of a Weathertech.  Great reviews so took a chance.  Took it for a test ride this morning.It's pretty slick!  Solid on all accounts the cupholder end and the cell holder end.  I've got a stick shifthad to bend the holder all which-way.  It didn't break!
5,Easy to assemble and affordable
5,I don't know what moron put the RATE Features for suction power or security features out there because this product uses neither. Other than that the steel tube shaft holds it's place perfectly and the phone doesn't flop all over. The side click rotation could be a little stiffer but other than that this is a great product.
5,Easy to Install
5,We recently went on a vacation trip.  I bought this so I could use my phone for navigation in our rental car.  It's light weight so doesn't affect my baggage weight significantly.  The cup holder mount worked perfectly in our rental with the cup holders in the center console.  It's tall enough to easily see the phone's map while driving and it held my Samsung S9 securely.  All in all a perfect experience!
5,Easy to install and use.
1,The order came in on time as expected but the product was poorly made the neck was very stiff and it was hard to put into my cupholder.
3,The idea of it is good.  It was hard to secure in our cup holder and after several uses it broke at the base trying to make it tighter.
5,This is exactly what I needed for my 19 Sierra! Well built and fits any size cup holder with just a turn of a knob. Tightens up nice and holds strong. Not too mention I have a thick credit card case with one of those pull out gripper things on the back it fits my phone perfectly! Great product and arrived in two days without prime.. Would absolutely recommend and will buy one for my wifes 16 regal..
5,I like that you can adjust -nd not have to worry about extra “cups for fit. Nice snug fit at base - holder is a little looser than I would like but definitely a very good option to higher priced item. I would recommend it and I plan on buying another one for my wife’s car.
5,Great mechanical solution that will last much longer than other devices I have tried.  The mount holds the phone tightly with a release button in the back.  The steam is flexible but sturdy.  The phone doesn't shake like some cheaper products do.  Lastly the base size is adjustable.  The unit can be tightened to sit firmly in any shape cup holder including partial open sides.  Very happy with performance.  Would highly recommend!
5,Car
3,I can see this phone holder being great in some vehicles but mine is not one. If you have cup holders that have adjustable pieces on the inside this may not be a great product; when I try to tighten the bottom of this holder it turns in the cup holder and is not secure. I have tried and tried and tried to find ways to secure the phone holder but this one simply doesn't work well with my vehicle's cup holders.
5,Works as described.Mine is great my cup holder placement isn’t. It works a described. Make sure you measure from cup holder to where you want the phone to be before you buy. Make sure it isn’t to long or to short.It really is easy to use. I just needed to figure out a good place for my phone. This is a vehicle issue and not a product issue.
5,I opened the box installed it into my truck removed it and installed it into my wife's car. Then I ordered one for my truck and one for my mothers car. If you want to make a friend or family member safe buy this phone holder now and send it directly to them. You would be considered real weird if you did not actually talk on the phone while you drive at some point.
5,I was worried after reading the reviews every one was saying they couldn’t get it put together easily. I had no problems snapped together so easily and was very easy to install in my car. I love it. My phone finally stays in place.
4,Bought as a gift for my husband.  Very sturdy stays in place.  Nice hold.
4,Works great. Gave it 4 stars because had to ship 1st one back because the brackets on back to snap the pieces together for the setup  weren’t cut out right on 1st one. 2nd one worked correct and snapped right away. Installed easy and works fantastic in car.
5,Good product
5,There is no suction it fits inside the cup holder.
3,Fits well into cup holder and is can be tightened into holder.  However because the neck is about 8" long it wobbles a lot while driving.  It's very distracting.  Also the joints are loose so it is easy to turn or twist once installed.  Overall it does the job.
3,Why
4,I like it but also very big the shaft is not flexible enough to move it out of way if you are driving a stick shift.
5,Tightens up nicely in my rubber 2013 Tacoma cupholders.  Is stable and most importantly holds an Otterbox case with my iPhone 10R.  Arm is very sturdy with minimal jiggling.  Would have liked to get one from the US company that makes my floor mats but from reviews theirs doesn't fit this case.  Too bad theirs is overpriced as well for a hunk of plastic.  Am very satisfied with this product.
5,It works oerfrgjh
4,Holder works as advertised however the holder swivel is loosening allowing the phone to turn on its own when in the holder.
5,Used this for my 2020 Toyota Tundra to hold an iPhoneX.  I was considering WeatherTech however I went with this one for the price after reading the reviews.  GLAD I DID!  I like much more than the WT.  Easy install stays secure when phone is attached easy one touch release and one handed closing to secure the phone.
4,Not as flexible as I thought it would be but it does the job.
5,Easy to install and works perfectly at a very reasonable price.  I liked it so much I bought another for a cousin!
5,Perfect
5,Brought this product to assist me with gps use while driving. It’s amazing. It’s easily adjustable arm makes viewing the phone easy for any height. Gripping mechanism firmly grips the phone to keep it in place with release button to the rear. Overall great product.
2,The phone mount which holds the phone fits loose on the gooseneck plate and does not snap in. The only thing holding it in place is gravity. Which is worse in the landscape position. A slight tap at the bottom of the phone will knock the phone/phone mount off the gooseneck plate. Otherwise I like it and plan to supper glue it hoping that it will hold. Which is better than the aggravation of sending  back a $20 item. I may have just gotten a bad one but do not want to take the chance of replacing it.
5,I have had a ton of phone holders for my car and all have been unsuccessful except for this one.  I’ve always had the biggest phone with an otterbox like case.  I have an I Phone XS MAX with a UB PRO case and I just took 6 hour roadtrip which included driving on unpaved terrain.  The phone never moved or came close to falling.  Great product!
4,Very good product so far. Love it but it’s a little clumsy foe a small car
3,At first it was ok until it broke.
5,Like it!
5,Love it!
4,Product works as it is described. Fits great for my needs.
5,It's such a strong sturdy and comfortable positional piece I bought 2 more. 1 for my daughter and mom. Oh yeah and I bought another one for my other truck. Love it
5,This cell phone holder is just what I was looking for!Very well made.The adjustable base fits snug in the cupholder .The swivel phone holder holds my iPhone 11 Pro securely (even with the case)Design allows for power cord to be attached from bottom.The gooseneck adjusts easily for viewing while driving.Highly recommend this product!
4,Hold my phone in the car
5,Very versatile product to use
5,Love this phone holder.  Fits and works well.  This is my 2nd one. Really like the add on extensions you can put on for bigger cup holders.
5,Good
5,First of all it is put together upside down.  It fits great in cup holder but phone comes off holder with base attached because it is upside down.  Today the whole top fell out and came all apart.  Can no longer use.
5,Works as promised.
5,This fits in your cup holder. I’ve tried several others that I had to send back because the base wasn’t adjustable. This holder is and fit perfectly once I adjusted it for my large cup holder.
4,Well made item. Does everything claimed. Holds the phone in the otterbox great. I bought two of these phone holders. Only comment I have is adjustable arm is a little high. Overall I would endorse the unit for purchase.
2,Doesn’t work like suppose to. The holder doesn’t stay on the stand  that holds the phone .
4,It has become a fixture in my SUV
4,Fits great and works great
5,If you are looking for a cupholder cellphone holder this is a good buy.
4,I purchased this cup holder to use in my Honda Accord.  The position of my cup holders made visibility of the phone awkward.  My husband took it to use in his Chevy truck.  He loves it.
5,It's the perfect product for my car. I could not find anything to put anywhere in the car since the window is far and doesn't look good. The dashboard has all kinds of screens and gadgets and the vents are circular. it holds the phone securely and close by.
5,These made good Christmas gifts and I am enjoying mine when I need to use maps on my phone.  It is flexible and easy to adjust for the angle that I need it to be.  I have a large cushioned case/cover on my iphone  xr10 and have no problem inserting or releasing the phone when I need to take it out of the holder.  Easy to do!  Good purchase!
1,I have had this for over a year and it has been junk.  The Volvo cup holders are not one solid round container.  The opening is them results in the expanders in this cup holder phone holder having no third grip.  As a result - they wobble about and are basically junk.  I was very happy to find a replacement that works for me.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D9K56KB?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
3,mounts real solid holds phone real good love that part. it moves when you try to use the touch screen making it difficult to function. you have to use two hands sometimes. im going to stick with it maybe it will become easier over time.
5,Easy to install and fit my BMW 3 series cup holder very well. Easy to adjust phone screen without obscuring much of control panels
5,I am extremely pleased with the quality and the functionality of this phone holder. It was easy to assemble and install in the cup holder for a perfect fit!
5,keeps my wife hands free
4,Once I glued the part that held the phone it works well. That part would come off easily .
5,It was easy to install holds the phone securely. Very pleased!
5,Practico
2,Does not last. I am not hard on my things and it broke in about 2 weeks. dont reccomend
5,Car Cup Holder Phone Mount is my second cup holder that I've brought the first one didn't have the updates that my second one has.  The second one secure my phone much better than the other it doesn't slip and is more sturdy. The first one since I had purchase it has broke the feet on it and the phone holder also broke.  But this one I believe it will last a lot longer.
4,Easy to set up and holds the phone well.  Price was good. The only question at this point is will it hold up over time otherwise everything was as advertised.
4,There's only one thing I would change and that is that it's difficult to bend the neck of this thing to angle the phone's screen differently.  It's very stiff and I find it difficult to adjust.
5,There are so many of these showing up on the market that shopping was a bit confusing. So glad I went with this product because it is great.  I love everything about it. Easy to install phone fits beauteven in the case and with a back knob.  You can manipulate it into whatever position works best with ease.  It's sturdy and works reliably.
4,Takes up a place for a cup which I knew but also can be in the way of  of the gear shift if you want to read you phone.
4,I used it in my cup holder in my truck
5,After researching this type of cell phone holder quite a bit I decided on this one- and it was a good decision.  The product is made well easy to use holds my phone securely- even off road.  The release button on the back is a great feature as well.  I highly recommend this product.
5,I use this product  for traveling.  It is not to bulky.
3,Unfortunately I cannot give this item a good review. The concept is there but it just didn’t work for me. Every time I inadvertently hit the piece that holds the phone it falls off because it doesn’t snap securely to the gooseneck bracket. Annoying especially while driving. Sorry gotta send it back!
5,Admittedly I was skeptical but this item was Amazon's Choice. It is easy to assemble and seems very stable and sturdy. It works great with my Pixel 5 in OtterBox! 5 of 5 stars happy with the purchase.
5,We supplied these for our work trucks to keep our guys hands free and they love them! Very sturdy stays in place fits most phones
4,Easy to put togetherBut phone holder comes off easily when touched
5,A few months ago I purchased the previous model and when I put my phone in it the first time I discovered that the support-prongs at the bottom did not extend outward far enough not securely hold my Samsung Note 8 while the phone was in its Incipio case. TopGo was very appreciative of the feedback upgraded the design and notified me when it became available...the upgraded model is in my car and I love it!!  Great customer service; great product; great company!
5,This product works great. Only thing I wish is that the length of the neck was longer. Maybe having different detachable necks for different lengths might be a great option for this product.
5,Works great I got it on a lightning deal for $12.00 it’s worth the money but I wouldn’t pay more than $12 for it. Works easy and does what I wanted it to do. Very easy to install and set up just follow the directions.
5,I have owned this product 10 minutes and highly recommend it. It took me 3-4 minutes to set up in my car with my phone and now I am texting my review on my phone while in the holder. Fits perfectly. Very sturdy and I'm very pleased. I own a Samsung note 9. In an otter box. Fits perfectly with room to grow. I did not need to use additional materials to help the fit.
3,The mount needed to be put in the cup holder nearest the dash which has a closing top.  When I tighten the mount it starts closing the lid which makes it tough.  It also really interferes with access to the dash and the gooseneck is extremely stiff and hard to bend.  I would get a different one in the future.
5,Love this phone holder. After purchasing a new vehicle and finding that some new cars of different makes do no longer include a Sirrius Xm radio I needed something to hold my phone to listen to music thru the android car app. This holder meets all my expectations plus since it swivels it is large enough to also hold my GPS unit securely.
5,It is WELL worth the money especially when it comes to safety in your vehicle!!! Works very well and STAYS put!!! GREAT product and seller!!! : )
5,Will fit in any size cup holder- flexible enough  to bend and hold. Securely holds my iPhone 12 max pro in any orientation
1,This was supposed to be the answer to my phone mounting problems. During the installation process the piece that supposed to hold the phone snapped off.
4,Easy to fit and adjust.
4,Like the positioning of phoneDislike the connection of phone holder to goose neck- it slips out- ended up gluing it together
5,I had bought one last year for one car and a vent-attaching holder for the other car. The vent attaching holder doesn’t do well with my plus-size phone’s weight. So I bought another Topgo cup holder phone  mount to have one in each car because they do a very good job!
5,2019 rav4 xle phone holder options are VERY limited. I really didn't want to sacrifice one of the cupholders but in truth I'm glad I did. This holder is deep enough to accommodate a case with a pop socket too! There is no bouncing or wiggle and the flexible arm works great to get just the right angle. I'm glad I purchased this.
5,Works well will purchase one for wife
3,I liked it so much I bought two more! Easy to use.  Taller than most others and I like that you can turn if horizontal or vertical.
5,N/A
3,These are a gift and I purchased this model because the product got good reviews but ALSO because the packaging was looked sharp. However I got some shoddy boxes and one is a bit dented. Not happy as they look cheap. Probably not a big deal to all but I am not happy.
1,Arrived broken at the bottom adjustment.  I returned it and ordered  the more expensive model with the solid metal adjusters.  Very pleased with the quality of its "other brother".
5,This is the best vehicle cellphone holder I've used yet. It makes having it safely in one place easy especially when I'm driving the truck.
5,This works as advertised. Takes 5 seconds to snap together. Sturdy in the cupholder even as you twist the gooseneck into different shapes.I suggest that the manufacturer provide an additional pair of snap on sides to hold wallet phone cases.
5,I have this phone holder in my F250 Cup holder.  Works perfect for me.  Installed it one time and it hasn't loosened up.  Does a great job of holding onto cell phone and the push button on back makes it easy to grab phone and go.  I would buy one again if needed.
4,The person I bought for thanked me!
5,Great phone holder. Fits very securely great mechanism for adjusting to phone size and angle. Couldn’t be happier. Had thought about the Weather Tech but saw you needed to use a little device to adjust that I’m sure would be easily lost and then you have to store the other “sleeves” somewhere or lose your ability to move from vehicle to vehicle. This is a cinch to adjust and is secure. Much better price point as well.
5,This one went into a golf cart. It could not be better if it was specifically hand-tailored for the golf cart. At least now I get an opportunity to use one of the larger drink holders for storing a drink in the evenings.
4,Easy to install and sturdy
5,Love the flexible neck
5,This fits nicely into ANY cup holder. It is very much adjustable to meet your line of sight and holds nicely without running slack. There are some minor creeks from vehicle vibrations but it is very minimal and not annoying. Excellent buy!!
5,Great phone holder very sturdy for my plus size phone. I was worried the arm of it wouldn't hold the weight well but I was definitely wrong if I had anything I would want to see different would be the arm to be a little longer I find myself looking too far down while driving
4,Easy to use
5,It is very easy to install and fits quit well in my Ford Escape SE. Didn't need to use the extenders that it comes with. Devices used with their cases Samsung Galaxy A50 and LG Wing both fit nice and secure.
4,Easy install
5,I really like this cup phone holder  you can tighten it to fit any size cup holder it was sturdier than I expected but hoped it would be  I recommend this product. it arrived timely. Thumbs up
5,I could tell as soon as I I opened the box this was going to be the right phone charger for me. It secures tightly in to the cup holder as well as securely holds the phone. Also the neck is adjustable to any position you can come up with and is sturdy as well. Immediately ordered another for my fiancé and one more for my work vehicle.
5,Product was very easy to set up. Didn’t needed the extended pieces for the cup holder. It’s very sturdy. I have an iPhone X with a phone case on and it fits just fine.
5,Works like it should
4,The only problem I had is the holder for the phone kept falling off. It needs some way to lock it on more securely.
2,I liked the ease of install and the ability to move it as needed. The only downfall is after using it for 2 months the base of the gooseneck broke. I bought another thinking maybe it was just me. 1 month of using that one broke at the base of the actual holder. I use mine consistently throughout the day and I think it can't handle the constant in and out.
2,I purchased this product to eliminate my vent clip hands free holder because having my phone there would make it over heat when sun was shining.  Pros: it fits in cup holder. Not light weight.  Base is very sturdy when secured. Cons: phone holder doesn't securely fit on base meaning it doesn't lock in when attached. You cannot have anything on the back of your phone such as a phone holder or your phone will not fit in the holder. So I take mines off. Although I've tighten it all the way  it's still wobble at the phone holder end  not the base. Phone will fall if it's accidentally bumped. The neck is not long enough for me. I would've liked it to stretch up to my vent to get it out the way from bumping.
4,good phone holder.
5,Holds my iPhone 11 nice and tight and fits in my Toyota tundras awkward front cup holder.
5,This fits perfectly in the cup holder for my Mercedes GLA 250. I put it in one of the smaller cup holders but the arm extends far enough so i don’t have to try and turn around to see my phone. I will have to see how sturdy it is while driving on not so good roads but I am very happy with this buy
3,This doesn't really fit the 2020 Honda CRV cup holder all that well--even after installing the included rubber extenders. The shape of the car's cup holder makes it difficult to stay in place. As the picture shows the phone holder eventually slides out of position.
4,Fits well in my console. The only problem is the phone holder comes off quite often.
4,Good functions and idea. Although the phone holder is easily knocked off
4,Easy to install
5,I love the design.  The gooseneck has great flexibility.  It fits in both cup holders in a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Its easy to stick the bottom part into the cupholder. It takes a minute to figure out that you may need to rotate it to ensure that all 3 pressure points meet the cupholder walls and one doesnt point to the space between the two cupholders. 🤦‍♂️However the top part(where the phone is placed) constantly falls off with the phone.  Its not really securely attached.  Gets annoying to fish your phone from passengers foot compartment all the time.  👎
4,Works as advertised. Easy to install. Swivel works well and holds your phone in place. Only negative is removing it from the cup holder. Mine is difficult to remove.
5,It is sturdier than I thought it would be. It was worth losing a cup holder to not have to search for my phone while in the car
5,It works great.  It's sturdy and at the sametime is flexible enough to move it to any direction you'e comfortable with.  Great quality and best value for the money.
5,This is my 3rd try at a holder for my phone but I  hope its the last. It fit nicely in my cup holder with the added sides and the long neck is just perfect for my reach. Hope it works like I expect it too.
5,Product works great for those who travel and need a safe way to talk on phone
5,I drive a lot and use google maps to find where I am going...I tried others but never found one that was what I wanted.. this adjusts in an infinite positions so it is just right..
5,These are for those that have a bigger cup Holder like my 2015 highlander. The upgraded one adds about a extra inch to the holder so if its bigger than normal it will fit. I love them. Way better than the one u have to stick to ur windshield. I like those too but I use my sun guards in the window alot.
5,The phone mount was easy to install in the cup holder and stays in place well. The holder keeps a good grip on the phone and places it at a convenient location for phone viewing and use.
5,Fit just right and convenient to hold my Samsung S10E. What I was looking for at the right price.
4,Great quality work well with my phone
5,I had reservations at first about how it would work because of where my cup holders are in my car. This works great and is easy to see and use. Very happy with the purchase.
5,This works very well with a s9+ in otterbox defender case in a nissan sentra 2014 car.  had to bend it a bit to get the right angle and also....I have fingerprint unlock so I had to make sure it cleared that sensor.  but it will.  not sure with s9 version.
5,This works great in my minivan. Just popped it into one of several cup holders turned the knob and it held steady.
5,Fits well in the car cup. Very sturdy and is as described! I have a sports car and even at max speeds doesn’t budge holds my phone well. Will order another for the SUV!!!
5,Love this phone cup holder for my IPhone 11My car has a rough material dash board so suction holders do not workThis holder is perfect and holds the phone and does not moveCan be adjusted for any phoneHelps me use phone and keeps my eyes on the roadGreat product and reasonably price
1,I found this car phone holder to be so poorly made that it is completely useless. It seems easy enough to set up but then the interlocking parts do not hold together and so the top comes off the neck and falls off - with the phone in it. Over and over... no matter how carefully I assemble the holder and insert the phone.Note that I bought it because friends recommended it and they said they did not have problems. On the other hand I strongly recommend not to take a chance on this poorly designed and poorly made Chinese  product.
5,Product does its job but not sturdy. Hope it last a while .
5,Product is working great! I'm a gig worker and I was sceptical about the holder being intrusive on my limited space. But it's exactly what I needed. There were a few other brands I was looking at for up to three times the price this one is a good choice.
5,Very easy to install and it fit perfectly bmin my Chevy Malibu. Very sturdy. Love the opening it has for the cable it doesn't tangle and stays in place.
3,This might work in other autos but in my Honda the gear shift and the position of the cup holder were too close to safely use.  The cup holder blocked access to the gear shift.  Sorry.
4,I like the fact that its ina cup holder but it doesn't stay secure. Its like every couple of days you have to readjust it to fit in holder
5,I use this phone cup holder when I play golf. It works great. It is sturdy and easy to install and remove after my golf game.
4,Easy to use.  Works fine
5,Bought this to fit into the Treadmill cupholder at my Gym. Needed the extensions that come with it since the cupholder opening was huge. Works great. Holds phone securely and its flexibility makes it easy to watch shows while I am exercising.
5,What a delightful surprise to open the small box assemble the few pieces follow easy to read instructions and install. A miracle these days. I just love it. It is perfect and fits my phone wallet easily. No flimsy parts or screws to mess with. Highly highly recommend for those with large size cases for your phones. Huge applause!!!
5,Finally a phone holder that makes sense. I tried the CD player phone holder. Tried dashboard and windshield ones which both were just in the way. Tried this and the fit was perfect in my car and truck. Easy to remove if you need and not in the way. Glad I found these. I bought one for each car.
4,Had to send the first one back because I couldn't get it to lock together.The second one took some brutal force but I got it.All in all-it's a deal-but be strong.maybe a small hammer would help??
4,Took a little work to get the phone back on to the arm. A little loose at the base therefore shakes while driving. Difficult to read the screen. Without comparing to other models it’s OK
5,Easy to use glad I bought it. I have had it for a couple months and works great for me. Great price compared to others as well
5,It’s perfect for my little suv glad I made the purchase.
4,Not quite as flexible as I was hoping. Maybe it’ll “loosen up” with use.
4,Easy to install firmly attached and adjustable!  Makes reading my phone easier for mapquest for example.
5,Put in your cup holder. Adjust the tension and put your phone in it. Easy install and it stays where you put it.
5,This is the fourth cupholder cellphone mount and the first one that accommodates my cellphone with a case and rear kickstand. The combination is rather thick and none of the others held it firmly without teetering or popping out. I am very satisfied with the way it holds the phone and mounts in the car and adjusts for viewing.
3,The product is good easy to install but the part that holds the phone disconnects from the base too easily.
3,Es muy corta la extension del brazo flexible
3,You are constantly needing to take your eyes away from the road to look downward to the right.  The neck is too short.  This device is only good for holding the phone to listen to videos but not for viewing purposes.
5,Works great - good height to come out of cup holder. Exactly what I needed to keep myself hands-free while driving.
2,I used this for almost a year in my 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  It was easy to install and remove when needed.  The only place to put it in my Jeep Wrangler was the center console. It was in the way there and kept having to move the neck around.  The neck was not quite long enough - I had to keep taking my eyes off the road to check the map.  Finally when I moved it to my wife’s Camry the mount proved to be a bit flimsy and broke off when twisting it into place.  Overall I would not buy again.
5,Very sturdy and easy to use.
4,Easy to install
5,It works wonderfully and I can see why many of my previous wireless specialists customers really love them overall.
5,This was exactly what I needed. Fits perfectly in cup holder. Easy to install and take down when I'm not using it. Holds both my Android 10and iPhone XR no issues.
5,I love my phone holder.  It fits perfectly in my cupholder and is easy to install.  I highly recommend it.
5,I have spent a lot of money trying to find a phone holder that really works - this Topgo cup holder can be described in one word:  AWESOME
5,This thing really does what it says it will.  Fits in any cup holder securely.  It seems to be almost infinity adjustable.  The neck is very flexible which makes sure that your phone is not in the way of any car controls.  I don't really use my navigation any more.  Excellent price point too.  Very happy with my purchase.
1,Was nice for the first day.. became loose after the second day wouldn’t stay fixed even without a phone inserted.. third day the entire head snapped off. Don’t waste your time or money it’s a junk product.pl
5,Was very easy to install on the weekends I take it with me and use it in the golf cart as well
4,Works well for me but maybe just a bit tall but not a problem.  Will probably order one more and it will be the shorter version.  Seems to be very well made.
5,Fits cup holder firmly and holds phone well.  Only one complaint the backing that actually holds the phone attaches to the flexible post (in my opinion) should have a much more secure fit.
4,Doubles as a golf video stand when placed in the top of the bag.
5,Works well and beats all the other ones I had to hold my phone in place. The only disadvantage is I lose a cup holder but worth losing!
5,This seems like it will be a great product!  A little difficult to get the phone mount onto the extension arm but finally did and again seems to be great!  Fits perfectly into my cup holder and was very easy to adjust for the fit!  Very easy also to widen/lengthen the phone mount to adjust to fit different models of phones.
5,I have galaxy s21+ with cover. This holds my phone perfectly. Secure and steady. Just the right height for use in car
5,This is a great holder for your phone. It took a minute for me to figure out how to expand the anchors. I love this and bought one for my husband and my dad.
2,It's a bit too high for me. It gets in the way of the gear shift and just not a good choice for me. Pretty sturdy but you have to make sure it's mounted perfectly.
4,Good product.  Fit the cup in our Ford Explorer.  Liked the extension that came with it unlike the competitor but it lacked some flexibility for positioning.
5,Super easy to install and works great.  Easy to adjust.  Placing and removing the phone from the holder is very easy.  I can not find anything I would change in fact we have now purchased a second unit so each vehicle has one.
2,I had high hope that this item would assist with safer use of a cell phone while in the car.  Not so!  The attachment piece that holds the phone falls off with the slightest adjustment dropping my phone and the attachment to the floor of my car.  I have reinstalled it at least a dozen times in the first day or so trying for it to hold but any movement of the phone to pick up off the stand adjust for viewing etc just caused it to pop off.  I wanted to have less distractions using my phone for directions hands free etc but this falls about at the slightest touch.
5,I was able to assemble it myself but it needed the extensions enclosed to make it wide enough to fit firmly. I drove a rental van without a nav and couldn’t see my phone. I haven’t used it yet but it looks like it will work well.
5,What a great little product.  I've tried others and this one really works.  I also bought one for a friend.  So easy to install. Just put it in your cup holder and turn the adjustment knob until it's tight.
5,Extremely happy with this cup holder.  Read directions first measure your car cup holder. It was easy to put together.  Just twist the base clockwise to fit into your cup holder. My IPhone XS fit perfect in the car cup holder.  Great addition to being organized in my Lexus 600LS.Bought two extras for Christmas gift exchanges.
5,This was one of the best items I have bought in a while. I could absolutely see the phone screen without having to take my full attention off the road
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Great for holding my phone. The arm extenion was a bit stiff but works well for my needs.
5,This definitely exceeded my expectations. It was easy to install easy to figure out how to fit my phone in it and the fit is snug. Excellent product!
2,Not worth purchasing the pads came off that is suppose to keep it in place.  I ended up purchasing rubber woven mats that go under rugs (so they don't slip on floors) worked better.  However locking my phone onto the clip would not stay upright and would fall sideways (not the way I want it to be).  Don't purchase not good I'll take my cup spot back.
5,I use this in my work truck it works great. I use the GPS for my work and it's nice to not have a destraction in the window! Great price great quality! Plan on buying a few more for Co-workers.
5,Fit several phones makes using your phone as a map easy.
5,I was unsure if I would like it or not but it was what I needed and more. Fits perfectly and easy to install. Would definitely recommend!
5,What can I say it works. As someone who drives about 300-500 miles a week this thing has made my life a lot easier. Sturdy build and stays secure in my cup holder. Recommend.
5,Very sturdy and easy to use
5,Holds your phone safely so that you don't have to fumble to retrieve it.  Much safer.
4,It works good for holding the phone where I can see it while driving .
3,Not as easy to use as I thought. It does not secure to the cup holder- always slipping out. It is very cheap looking material. It does hold the phone securely.
3,The neck is not as long as I expected and sometimes this thing doesn’t open on first try. The when it does it doesn’t always open evenly.
5,I wish I had found this many dollars ago....I have spent so much money and time  trying to find the right holder for my heavy phone. This is a very strong big holder!  I am so happy I could just hug and kiss the owner and distributor of this cell phone holder...it is AWESOME!!! THANKS GUYS FOR A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. Kathryn C.
5,Great product and makes it easy to access my phone.  Fits great in the cup holder. We bought 2 of them... one for each vehicle.
5,Ending up buying 3 of them for our vehicles. Husband is very pleased with them and he's picky. Recommended.
5,Nice cup phone holder. I bought 3 for each of our vehicles.  They are working out great
4,This is a great product. Didn't even have to have a WeatherTech.
4,It should have been longer for proper bending to whatever position the user would like
5,This product was easy to put together and install. With the expandable base it fit the cup holder in my Dodge Challenger perfectly. I love the gooseneck which allows me to see my phone easily and adjust it quickly.It definitely meets the need I have for being able to see my phone without mounting it to the dashboard or windshield.
5,Works as advertised
5,yes you have to give up a cup holder but that is better than having the cellphone closer to the windshield. The product is very sturdy and fits my Galaxy S9 just fine and I'm sure it hols many other bigger phones...
5,How often do you see a drive with a cell phone plastered to her ear?  And how often does she almost hit you because she's distracted? Well the TOPGO car cup holder could end all of that! And you don't have to pay an outrageously high price like you would from WeatherTech! Come on Ladies! (and you too men) - get hands free!!!!
5,Picked this up to hold my iPhone SE and it works great. It’s be nice if the neck was just a bit longer but for the price I can’t really find anything to complain about. It does the job.
5,GREAT PHONE HOLDER!!  LOVE it!!!  My husband hates adjusting to vehicles gps so likes using phone instead.
5,easy to install solid very sturdy but for some reason this program won't let me install a photo.  It fit perfect with the adapters
4,Puede mejorar se ve algo frágil
5,Was easy to assemble and install I drive truck and go down some really ruff roads and my phone stayed in place good product
5,N/a
5,Very well made easy to install nice feature is the 4 prong universal fastener which I used to fasten to my back up camera screen.  This avoided using the included phone squeezer (which is also very well made). Slick product no worries here!
1,This thing is AWFUL. You can't tighten it to make it grip the phone more properly. Mine broke after trying to adjust it so it didn't hold the phone face down and I contacted the manufacturer. They responded quickly and said they'd ship a better one. They LIED. On top of that they ignored numerous emails. DO NOT EVER buy this one. Waste of money and the manufacturer is sneaky. I hate writing bad reviews but this company richly deserves one.
3,Didn’t like the quality of the product returned it. Glad the return process was easy they get a 5 for that.
5,Was able to mount either of our phones as well as our GPS.  Was able to adjust it so both the driver and non-driver could view it easily.
4,The phone holder works great fit in without the extensions.Delivery was quick.  If lasts for years its worth it. The last one i owned broke after a couple of years.
5,I purchased this model earlier and gave it to my son so I bought a replacement.  It works well is sturdy.
1,The sturdiness is at 0%.  It’s constantly falls from the stand when I try to remove my phone.  Very dissatisfied with this purchase.
5,I bought it as a replacement to my other one (not from this vendor or company) which broke due to wear and tear of the bendable cable.
5,It fits perfectly in my car cup holder and holds my phone securely.  It is easy to get the phone in and out of the stand.  The gooseneck is secure and stays in any position I put it in.  A simple device that works as it is supposed to
5,Suction powerdoesn't work on that principal Security features? it does stay in place while driving.  Perfect fit I like the extended arm and the fit in the car. A lot cheaper tha the American made weather tech product.
5,Thus is a cupholder for your phone.  Works great...gave a few for gifts to my family.  Everyone loves them.
5,adjust to fit snugly in cup holders as stated well worth it
4,This product works good for the price it's not the best but it does keep my phone from pretty secure.
1,This cell phone holder was wobbly right out of the Box and split in 2 unless than 2 weeks of use. 100% not recommended.
5,I RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUR CAR.  IT HOLDS THE PHONE GREAT!
4,Easy install it does  giggle  a little  but it's in a truck.so far I like it
5,Did a lot of research on various cup holder mounts and finally decided on this one.  Very happy I did.  It is very adjustable and relatively sturdy given adjustable gooseneck.  Well worth the price.  Can't speak to the durability yet as I've only had it a little over a week but very happy so far.
2,I'm sure the item works well but we never got to the point of using it. After setting it in the cup-holder if it is bumped the least little bit the phone goes flying off to the floor. The connection to the phone is not secure at all. We got a different brand and that connection was secure as you could actually hear it click into place. Design flaw needs to be corrected so the phone isn't so easily disconnected.
5,I have tried other phone holders and this beats them all. Very easy to install and even transfer between cars with different size cup holders. The neck is a good height so you read the screen without it blocking your car settings like The heating controls. Can hold phones with thick cases.
5,This works fantastic in my work truck it has a center cup spot that's smaller than the other two and it fits perfectly. It makes using my phone to navigate very easy while not being in the way.
1,does not hold up all after a few months
2,I bought about 10 of these to test with my fleet vehicles and so far not too impressed. One broken after 2 days of use the holder portion which does most of the lifting is attached to the neck by a very thin piece of plastic which is what broke. Does not hold phone steady lots of bouncing while driving.I will update if this damage was caused by driver misuse or this was just a bad unit but after seeing the construction (pictured) I feel like the rest are going to suffer the same fate shortly.I will be trying another holder in the future.
1,Note sure if i just got a lemon one but loved it at first but 3 weeks later the bottom part of the neck broke.
5,Only had this a few days but awesome so far. The ONLY "downside" is that it uses up one of my cup holders but I knew that when I bought it so...
5,I drive a truck and this devise is great.It fits snug and tight into the cup holder.When driving it stays secure in its place.It’s is a great investment.I highly recommend it.
5,Was a gift don’t know how it works for her but she’s kept it and it’s all set up in her car😊
5,This was great value for the money. Easy to install and perfect with the adjustable arm. Excellent Quality.  Easy to switch vehicle's.  I almost bought the weather tech for more than twice the price and Im so glad I bought this one i stead. Shipping was very quick. I would buy from this dealer again.
5,Very sturdy. Use it in my vehicles and golf carts.  No problems and easy to use.
3,Not very durable for a strong person to just tilt one way or the other.  Good for minimal movement.
5,Everything is adjustable - the base the gooseneck and the phone holder. The holder fits firmly in place and the gooseneck is stiff enough to support touching the phone to change settings.  Inserting the phone into the holder and extracting it is very easy. I highly recommend this product.
5,Was easy to install. I read reviews stating that it was impossible to install. Mine snapped together in seconds.I was going to go weather tech but since this was half the price for basically the same thing i gave it a try.Worth every penny.So far so good.
5,The design of the Top-Go holder makes it SO SIMPLE to install and use! The button release for the side-arms is SUPERB!! JOB WELL DONE - Thank you
1,Didn't have for more than 1 month and it broke.
5,Nice product.  Functional and very easy to use.  Received quickly.
3,It fit well in the car it holds the phone securely but when you push the button to release the phone well.......good luck.  Half of the time I've got to force it open to get my phone out.  The other half of the time it is VERY slow getting the side pieces to release the phone.  Going to look for a better quality one.....
5,I washesitant about ordering this. Was looking to but the weather tech brand but it was way expensive...But this one works great. Easy assembly and install. Holds my 8plus just fine. I recommend this holder. And way less the the one I mentioned!
5,Able to situate phone either horizontally or vertically so that car controls are not affected.Assembly was straightforward.
4,It was easy to install but after a couple of weeks it stopped opening up to put my phone in.
1,I had 2 of these and they both broke in two.
5,Cup holder base expands easily and is secure in my vehicle. The portion that actually holds the phone works well and it’s easy to get the phone in and out.  Phone is secure and doesn’t wobble.  Unit works better than I was expecting at this price point compared to others.
5,Bought 1 for me and one as a gift. Like the fact that it can be swiveled sideways. Fits and works great.
5,Works very well for what I need.Fits in cup holder tightens up easy. Phon fits in holder. I have a Galaxy S10+ with a large case and device opens wide enough to hold phone perfectly.
4,The ease of assembly
2,The neck of the unit does not stay in one place. Essentially any bit of movement causes the entire thing to rattle left and right about 10 degrees. Unusable.
5,I have a mini cooper that has mostly curved surfaces to place a phone holder.This is perfect. Fits in the passenger cup holder and is very secure. Love it !!
5,This was so easy to install!  I bought it for my iPhone X and I really like the sturdiness of this holder.  It rotates to a horizontal position which is nice.  The part that holds the phone has a button to push for easy release.  Now I can see my maps with ease.
5,Very easy to install. Just tapping on the release button opens the arms to remove the phone.
5,Wow! Fits like a glove really NO onstall--just twist the bottom and the cup bottom expands to fit. Holds securely  can adjust to any position and it holds. Easy to put phone and retrieve. Great buy fast fast shipping.
5,Rideshare drivers are using their phones constantly but hand holding is impossible.  This is the third cup holder phone mount I have tried and this one works great.  My 2017 Toyota Highlander must have particularly large cup holders but this unit fits securely and is ultimately adjustable for maximum comfort.
5,Takes seconds to install. Stays in place very solidly. The grip and release for the phone cradle is very solid and smooth. Easy to remove from cup holder and move. Great buy. I am so glad i found it.
5,I purchased several of these cup phone holders. I can't compare them to any other cup phone holders but these are pretty good. Everyone I gifted them to liked them and I've not heard anyone say they didn't like the way they fit or worked. Must have been a good choice.
3,Its bulky and in the way. Also the cord for aux cannot be plugged in properly for Samsung phone at the bottom of the phone.
2,If you have a case and a pop socket your phone will not fit. I put my phone in the cradle and closed it and since the sides hit the power button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max the phone thought it was and emergency and almost dialed 911. I’m not going to take the phone out of the case every time I get in the car. I’ll have to look elsewhere for a phone holder.
5,This car cup holder phone mount is ideal for me.  I can see who is calling without having to dig my phone out of my purse or a pocket.  It is sturdy and adjusts to different cup holder sizes.  It is easy to install and to use.  Love this item.
4,Plate that connects base to the phone holder is hard to secure properly. Otherwise it’s easy to install and a good value.
5,get upgraded version  one with FOAM phone holders  the other one has fabric which come off after a week of use
5,Love easy to use
2,I bought this for the cupholder for my 2014 Subaru Forester XT. It didn't stay put very well. And the phone arm had some play where it was attached to the base. So the phone jiggled around far too much. So between it wasn't a firm hold in the cupholder and the jittery stock it was honestly a very poor choice.I bought a different phone holder that is suction type and also magnetic. I like that VERY well.I cannot recommend this for my application and honestly I wouldn't try this again in another application either. Losing the cup holder and with all the different sizes and shapes of cup holders I just don't think it will work out much of the time.Sorry but not recommended.
4,works as advertise.
4,It was a gift for my brother so I'm not sure how it worked out for him
3,The clip keeps falling off on mine. So that gets annoying . Once in holds ok.
5,This fits different cup holder sizes so I can use in both of my cars
5,I wasn't sure this would work at first but it does a good job and I like that I can just sit my phone down in it while I drive short distances without having to totally secure it each time. So far it has stayed put and been easy to grab when I leave the car.
4,The product quality looks good but the installing seemed awkward with the cup adjustment inserts.
3,It is too tall and flimsy on the top action - sort of in the way if any hand motion while driving and phone gets knocked off platform.
5,I really recommend this product came in handy for our vacation
5,This car cup holder is excellent and I like that the upgraded version has an extra layer of rubber to keep my phone from sliding. Also the customer service is excellent.
5,I love this product! It’s so easy to install. Just place in your cup holder and twist!
5,Loved given extra extensions if needed for expand cup holder
5,I gave the iPhone as a gift.My niece loved itIt fit perfect in her new carShe is going to order one for her friend
5,Easy and convenient! Great suction fit in the cup holder
5,Easy to assemble and very study in cup holder.  Goose neck is really great and flexible enough to allow me to put my phone in any position I find most useful to be readily seen.  The holder accommodates an iPhone XS Max with an Otterbox Defender with no problem.  Highly recommended
5,It’s awesome! It was a gift and my friend loved it
5,It was a good price for a good item. Works well installs and adjusts easily.
5,This product is great it works very well it’s very sturdy and it was easy to install . I really liking it! Would recommend!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was great for about 5 weeks. After that it pretty much became a spinning phone carousel. Also forget about reaching the manufacturer for support it is email support and you will not get any response from them.If you like throwing money out the window then this item is for you. Do not buy.
5,Love it. Works great and holds my phone up and in place very well.
4,Seems pretty good so far. It’s a lot cheaper than the alternative that has its own commercial.
3,Liked the product while it lasted. Maybe if placed in one vehicle and not moved much - I moved between car and golf cart for yardage app. Broke at one of the flex points.
3,The package was open. It actually looked like it was used. The envelope sealed with a transparent tape and halfway open. The box was original with “QC Passed” sticker on however one of the dents don’t completely fit in the phone holder slots. Other than that the product looks very professional I guess I was just the one unfortunate enough to get the faulty one? Who knows...
5,It’s very good easy to install and use and it’s from very good quality I am very happy with it
5,Best purchase ever don’t know why I waited so long to get one definitely a must have
5,I like this product a lotEasy to install and works out perfectly
2,The phone holder that clips to the cup stand does not clip in tight and comes off every time I grab my phone! Very annoying!I had to glue it so it would stay in place.
3,I like that its adjustable to fit any cup holder size what I didnt like is the top part where you put your phone keeps falling off it doesnt stay on securly.
5,The holder fits perfectly in GLC300 with just a half twist to lock.  It's sturdy even for iphone 8 plus with case.  The goose neck is also easy to adjust for having a proper screen view.  I like it and would recommend it to my friends.
3,Need a longer neck placement is too close to the shift.
5,this unit has the most flexible base to fit in any cup holder. With flex neck you can position you phone to your liking.it has two buttons on the back one to adjust the height the phone sets and one for easy in and out
5,There no suction to this product but it holds your phone in place real good.
5,I truly enjoy this phone holder.  It is sturdy and the best holder I've ever used!
3,The release buttons don't open the clamps.  Broken in one week.  Have not had time to ask for a replacement.
4,It was difficult to put together.  I do like how it fits in the cup holder and that it is adjustable.
4,Only works for cup holders close to the front of the dash. Not great for Infiniti’s.
5,Fits great in my cup holder. Just what I expected. Good quality overall.
5,Love this product never thought about getting a phone holder for my car till I seen this one it’s sturdy and convenient
5,This phone holder is fabulous in my suv it’s really holds the phone in a great position and I highly recommend it!
5,Bought 3 for stocking stuffers for my husband and two teen boys.  They all love them!!!
5,Excellent holder at a reasonable price.  Fits snugly and is easily adjustable. Well pleased with this item.
3,I really want to give this 5 stars but the release button sticks and is hard to press. I've come to just not fully securing the phone as the button is too hard to get my phone out if I do. Other than that it is great. Easy to put in or take out of the cup holder when needed.
5,I’ve never been able to find a phone holder that fits an Otterbox case but this one does! It is surprisingly well made for the price. Not flimsy or junky. So happy I got this thingy.
5,Works as advertised. Easy to use in auto cup holder. Easily bends in directions you want it to.
5,Keeps my phone hands free and easily accessible.
5,Easy to install a great no hands solution to using my cell phone while sting I am able to glacé down to get directions
4,Took me awhile to figure out how to fit snug but once I did it’s good.
5,Sturdy easy to set up
4,This provides the functionality needed was easy to install is built well. For my car a longer flexible arm would be helpful.
5,Will fit wide range in width of cup holder. Very sturdy.
5,Works well in my cup holder. Just like explained
5,This is a great device and very functional at a great price!
5,I have a 2019 Murano and didnt want to use one of my cup holders but the square opening above the cup holders. Works perfectly! I just used 3 of the 4 add on wedges. Sturdy. Stays in place even when moving the neck and/or phone holder. A great buy!
5,Not a real good option for a Jeep Cherokee. The Jeep cup is very shallow and doesn't  provide enough gripping power.
5,Really nice to have in my vehicle very sturdy very bendable. Great idea
5,Using this in my 06 corvette! Looks and works great!
5,it fits the cup holder it fits the decor of the car it fits with my phone and it fits my line of vision! A+
5,Good product
5,I'm very pleased with this product. It seems like it's one of the better options of the many products I'm it's class. It holds the phone steady and I've driven locally and highway. I'm very pleased!
3,It stands so tall. I wish I had gone with the old model
2,Damaged. Bent
3,I loved this when I got it. Now I’ve had it for about 6-7 weeks and the place where my phone goes spins and doesn’t stay upright and the arm won’t stay up. I’m completely bummed because I needed this to work for my job. The bendable piece broke.
5,Easy and Convenient
1,Broke after one week
3,Has great possibilities but phone holder will not stay attached to gooseneck.  The slightest movement will dislodge phone fromgooseneck.  Just received mine today and am sorely disappointed in this engineering snafu !!!
5,This is a good product but the top part that holds the phone falls off (detaches) too easily. If I glued it to the bottom cup holder it would be awesome.
4,Works pretty well. Not as sturdy as I hoped but for the money I can't complain.
5,I have been searching/trying to get a good reliable secure way to hold my cell phone.  This is THE BEST. It was simple to put together (one snap) and is sturdy and fits perfectly in my car cup holder.  It adjusts to wherever I need it to be too.  Thank you!
5,EL BRAZO DEBERIA SER UN POCO MAS LARGO Y FLEXIBLE PARA QUE FUESE MAS COMODO AUN
1,Does not fit in cup holder and falls over
5,I drive a lot and this cup holder is great. It stays put and can be adjusted for viewing. It’s adjustable to any size cup holder. I recommend this one 100%.
5,Great buy!! I love it and it's all I need in my truck.
4,Fits into the cup holder and easy to take in and out
5,So I don’t have to hold my phone driving
5,Very easy to install.  This product is well-made and very convenient and helps secure the phone while driving
5,This is the best phone holder I’ve had… I love it
5,Fácil de instalar muy  buen material  fuerte y muy servicial
5,I have had just about every brand of these and this is by far the best one.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. I use a wallet case with 4 cards/ID’s in it. I’ve been searching for awhile trying to find a holder that would work with the added depth of my case. This works perfectly!
5,Love this product. The gooseneck makes all the difference and it’s sturdy!
5,This cup holder phone holder is absolutely perfect. Fits nice and snug and is very sturdy.
5,This is the first one of three cup holders I’ve bought which actually fits my very wide Subaru cup holder!  Hurrah!
5,This cup phone holder is great. Fits perfect in my cup holder nice and sturdy. And with the longer flexible neck it’s at a good height in my truck. With the discount coupon it’s a great price compared to the fancier name brand that cost over 3 times as much.
4,All likes
5,Phone is held in a convenient place to view and answer hands free phone calls. I have been looking for something like this and this item really works well for me.would recommend to anybody that needs an item like this.Great item!
5,It is perfect and holds my phone securely on our boat.
5,Fit the cup holder adjusts easily.
5,Easy to use and my phone fits with a pop socket on it!
5,Works and adjusts good. Flexible neck and easy adjustable base. Worth the money.
3,I purchased one of these for each vehicle so I ended up with three.  One became a little finicky after about two weeks of use so I ended up having to manually remove the phone when I pressed the release button. They do hold up well with the iPhone 8 Plus.
5,I must have tried 3-4 other phone cup holders without any satisfaction. This one has remained firmly in place and releases my phone easily when I need to use it. I highly recommend it.
5,Works great! Holds the phone in any direction you need. Fits any cup holder. Easy install. Not going to lie I was very skeptical from photos but this is better than imagined. And at a great price too.
5,Easy instructions to install.  Works great for my car needs.  Highly recommend.
3,The attachment keeps falling off. It doesn’t stay connected ever after it “clicks”
4,I like being able to tighten the phone holder in the cup holder. It also holds my navigation unit
5,Thus is the only cell phone car cup holder I could find that fits the wider RV cup holders AND call phones with thick battery packs.  It works GREAT and I would recommend this to everyone not just RV'ers.  Excellent product.
5,Easy to use. Quality Product. I use this in my 2006 Chev Silverado. Works great.
5,Easy to install. I wish it came in colors. Seems pretty secure even with device on back of phone.
5,Love that it is adjustable to different size cup holders. Held my iPhone XR in an otter box with no issues.
5,Well made can be adjusted too fit tight in low cup holders.
5,I love it the material is strong and it very steady
3,Fits tight/great in cup holder. Phone rotates when I turn a corner or hit a bump...kind of annoying. No way to make it stop rotating. Really wanted to like this.
5,It puts my phone out closer to where I can easily see the screen. Great for GPS use. Works great and holds my phone securely.
5,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. It’s adjustable and the right height that he can safely glance at it for driving directions or easily access podcasts.It was such a great device that I purchased 2 more one for my daughters car and for my car.
5,My first Amazon review.  This is a great holder. Fits my moto Z3 phone.  Will not fit my wife's phone as her phone has a pop-up on the back. If anything was to happen to this holder I would order another.
5,It's a perfect fit for my tundra with the 3rd cup holder being under the dash. The S pattern works wonders on being able to move around for cups being in the other slots.
3,If your gearshift is nearby and you bump the device ; it usually falls apart.
5,I am loving this. I have to work a little to find a good position as my phone has a pop socket and the holder pushed my volume buttons. I was able to make it work though. I bought another one for my fiancee because I love it so much!!!
4,Bought for the teen grandkids for Christmas.  They loved it!
5,This phone holder was much less expensive than others on the market and works great.
5,Adjustable angle and easy to install and use. Stays in place and holds the phone well. Flexible goose neck is nice since every car has cup holders in different spots.
3,Main part that holds the phone on disconnects1 really easy
2,Of the 7 months I owned this it was only in use for 4 of the 7 months. I must admit it performed well and I liked much more than its more popular competitor; however it appears this Florida heat proved too much for it. Do I give it another try or go back to its competitor?
5,Awesome. Stable and far better product than other big name cup phones holders This is our 2nd purchase we now have his & hers. Get it you can’t go wrong.
5,This was the easiest thing to install and it’s the perfect phone holder. I love it.  Couldn’t imagine not having it in my car
5,This product works well in the cup holder of my husbands car.  He uses it for work.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
5,No issues putting it together. Installed in F150 Ford with rubber cup holder insert removed. Fits great no wiggle. So far so good.
1,This thing falls apart if you look at it funny... waste of money.
5,Exactly as advertised. Accommodates large phone with protective case. No problem with installation.
5,I couldn't believe how easy it was to adapt to my vehicle's cup holder 2010 Terrain.  I'm an older female missing that "read the directions!" gene and I found it really simple  to put together and adjust.  Totally pleased with this product.
5,Seems to work really good and it is half the price of the ones from weather tech.
5,It fits perfectly in my cup holder  even without adding the extensions
5,I put the phone holder in the cup holder of my SUV.  It is really  adjusts great with the stem moving all differentways and the part that holds the phone does also.  It adjust very nicely to fit snug in the cup holder.
3,This holder fits my truck cup holder nicely. My biggest complaint is that the button the back to release your phone broke after about 2 uses so now I can't click it down on my phone. I had to force it open and leave it open so that I can use it.
5,I tried the "laser cut--weather..." other guys and they were lacking.  Didn't grip the cup holder securely.  This product  grips the cup holder securely and is easily adjustable to grip your phone.  It is perfect!
5,I like the fact assembly and easy to fit my cup holder. I did not like the holder for the phone because it did not stay put I fixed this by super glueing it and this did the trick.
5,This is a great phone cup holder. Super easy to install. Phone is very secure. Easy to adjust angle.  There are many different models of this particular holder — this one is excellent.  Just buy it. You will like it.
5,Delivered on time. Appears well made. Works great.  There is no suction power (?) It grasps the phone mechanically.  Works well holds the phone securely. I would recommend.
5,My iPhone 11 PRO MAX with a LIFE PROOF CASE fits perfect in this Car Cup holder.
5,This product works as described. I have the larger cup holders and it fits snug with the adjustment. I would recommend
5,Quick delivery. Holds my phone securely while driving.  Easy installation.
3,Currently does the job but I find it to be a bit flimsy and parts come off too easily. If I had a choice I probably wouldn’t get it again.
5,We used these in our new reclining lift chair cup holders. Working great
5,It’s very nice and works well it appears that it will fit any size cup holder and any size phone.  Simple to install and locks very tight in cup holder.  I like it
5,It was very easy to install just turn the dial and it expands into place.  Ane removal is easy too - just spin the dial in reverse.  It works great and I should have bought this long ago
5,easy to install  phone fits perfect  adjustable
5,Excelente producto para conducir con el GPS
5,We are using it in the car so our phone can be hands free. It's very convenient.
2,Barely useful.  Holds well in cup holder and keeps phone ata good height BUT:  It does not accommodate the phone if the phone is in a case it only fits in the clips if out of its case.  The "phone holder" piece comes off the rest of the apparatus much to easily and is a royal pain...  Due to being on a gooseneck the phone vibrates as the car moves especially over roughroad.I would NOT order it again.
5,Very sturdy and work in both of our cars.
4,Works great. Holds my Samsung secure in the holder.
3,The phone holder itself falls off the atm too quickly.  It doesn’t really hold.  Needs to be a tighter mechanism to hold phone in place  Am going to return
3,Base fits great phone holder pops off too easy. Does not lock into place securely enough.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my 73 year old father and he loves it. It was super easy for him to adjust himself  and it fits perfectly in his cup holder. No wiggling or shifting at all.
5,It fills the need I had to secure my phone in our motorhome and to be able to use the google map app for directions to our destination.
5,Truly the best cell phone cup holder mount ! I have purchased several over the years and all have failed after a few usages. Slipping sliding and just awful.This is great! It adjusted within seconds to my trucks cup hole and I will purchase another for my wife's car.
5,Easy to install and had flexible arm. Phone releases easily when ready to dismount.
5,The product was easy to put together and has lived up to expectations.
4,Car to hold cell phone...
4,Works well for me
5,I purchased it for my son.  He said it is great his phone doesn't end up on the floor under the gas pedal.
5,Great cell phone holder. I had a hard time finding one to work in my 2014 Expedition. I love it. It does take up a cupholder but it's easy to remove if you need the space. Very sturdy and affordable.  Highly recommend
5,i "m happy too knowing that he's hands free when using his phone.
5,Easy to install and sits a perfect height
5,Love it. Works perfectly!
4,Works as advertised looks to be able to hold a variety of phones securely.
5,it did the job
5,This cup holder for phones is awesome. It secure tightly in nearly any size cup holder in any type of vehicle. The holder came with extensions for larger cup holders in vehicles. Also easy to secure all types and sizes of phones. Definitely happy with this product.
5,This is one of the best Car Cup Phone Holder I have a iPhone 11 Pro Max with a Otter Box case and it fits perfect. I ordered another one for my husband too.
2,The mount that holds the phone falls off all the time. I followed the instructions and it still falls off. I finally took it out and stached it away. I guess I will keep on using my vent clip. It has worked great all the years that I’ve it which is quite a few.
4,Will buy it again
4,A very basic but well built phone holder. Easy to install.
5,I am impressed with the quality of the item and how fast the shipping turnaround is.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5,Yes That was awesome
3,Its good but not very stable. Extension bends easily with weight of note 9.
5,I searched bought returned a few holders for Samsung note 10 plus.This is perfect for my cup holder.Sturdier than I hoped for.Didn't want dash or windshield holder. Can position to clear dash and console buttons and switches.
4,It needs to be longer
5,Works as advertised. Firmly holds phone in place and makes it easier to use.
3,Does the job and allows me to follow Google maps without having to hold my iPhone.
1,My product was broken when it arrived.
5,Great purchase for the money. Sturdy holder no issues.
4,Somewhat difficult to assemble  Once assembled it worked like a champ.
2,Purchased November 2019 so I've had plenty of time to use this. Easy to install sturdy and perfect for hands free. More importantly It did not hold up as expected. With multiple uses the base plastic where the goose neck fits into the base  cracked after a few months which made the product wobbly and continues to crack more with use. This puts my phone at risk if the gooseneck decides to come out.  the design team should come up with a sturdier solution as this piece of the design gets lots of tork. See pic for a better detail.
5,Unlike other brands this Car Cup Holder can take the weight of a Galaxy Note 10 + and a iPhone Max Pro without falling over. Very satisfied with the product and its easy to install.
5,It vibrates slightly when vehicle is moving; but that is understandable since I have a larger IPhone.  However I am surprisingly pleased with the results.
5,Fits great in cup holder Mazda CX-30.Is secure in cup holder. Gooseneck is hard to adjust at times. I recommend without reservation
4,The arm jiggles while driving.
4,sturdy and fits very well.It can adjust endless ways.
5,Very easy to install.  Very sturdy
5,Suction doesn’t apply to this item.Well made and very useful.
5,This is the best phone holder I’ve owned!
5,Installation is easy the base adjusts to any size cupholder and fits tightly. The most surprising thing for me is how strong the arm is while still being flexible. The clip adjusts easily as well.
5,Easy to install and the flexible 'neck' is firm enough to flex but won't flop as you tap your phone. Worth the money definitely.
5,It was exactly what I needed!
5,This car cup holder fits perfectly in my 2019 Cadillac CTS Sedan  looks very nice and it really holds on to my new $399 7th generation 2019 Ipod Touch!!!
5,Easy to assemble fits tightly in my cup holder
5,Phone sits at a good level with the long extension arm. One of the best phone holders I’ve had and I’ve tried many.

5,The gooseneck feature is a plus.
2,Took up too much space goose neck sticks out too far
3,The phone bracket does not lock in securely. I was constantly knocking it off the stem until I finally glued it in place. Fits in cup easily
5,Awesome exactly what I was after
5,So far I'm an enjoying using it but am concerned that because it's so tall that I knock it over which you could lower it when not using
5,I love the price and it works fine I'm going to have to be careful not to lose the three section deals cuz they'll be useful in the future
5,good price easy to install and hold my phone tight in the cup holder. excellent.

5,So far a great product. Sturdy and easy to install
3,not as good as i thought
4,Much better than the short one. Still not perfect but suits the purpose
4,A little stiff but holds good
2,The grip that keeps the phone holder in place melts off in the heat. So in Vegas summer weather of 112 this thing goes flying all over the place. The part that holds the phone isnt any more secure. Had to put velcro on where the grip failed me and had to line my cup holder with it to work. Now It works great. Next time buy grips that can screw in and not melt off.Will add picture soon.
2,The hight is great for small SUV. The suction us great The problem is that the top part that holds the cell phone when you try to remove the phone the Part that holds your phone comes out from the base with your phone even if you are so careful! it is a pain in the neck!!!!
5,Very nice designed phone holder it only took buying 5 or so before finding this one.

5,Works great and many adjustments
5,Stays in the cup holder well very sturdy! Very good flexibility!
5,Really stays put. Our new Outback interior design puts it a perfect viewing spot but it’s In the way of the shifter. Being an automatic it’s not a huge problem.

5,Easy to install and use.
5,Seems well made.  Easy to install. Less expensive than some similar options.
5,I bought 4 more
3,The phone cradle is great. The gooseneck was not as sturdy as my last phone holder and the phone shakes and vibrates constantly. I returned it and ordered a McCaully brand that I had previously.
5,Well made products I use it everyday
5,It fits well in many sizes of cup holders holds a phone with a heavy case and works as advertised.

5,It was easy to i stall and its very sturdy
5,Perfect puts the screen right where you need it doesn't fall off the dash that's all I was looking for
5,Easy to install
2,I enjoyed this phone holder for the 6 months it worked. Then the mount snapped off earlier this week and that was that. It was too bad because I liked the adjustable nature of it from portrait/landscape mode and the positional changes. It just doesn't have lasting power.
3,Fits in the cub holder and works. I have a mazda cx9 and using this is still awkward
5,Work great. Holds the phone in place.
5,Holds phone and doesn’t move. Very secure. I have in my corvette that has very shallow cup holder. Doesn’t move with aggressive driving. Would recommend
5,I like how it holds my phone in place and with it being adjustable it holds a lot of sizes. Otherwise when I had my phone in the center council  it was always falling down
5,This is not a suckton based phone holder.
1,The phone holder falls off extremely easily and by itself especially with a larger phone. I This renders it useless.  They did take it back easily.  Returned
5,Very easy to use. Very handy. Only complaint is phone will not stay in place in horizontal mode.
1,Item fit well in cupholder and held phone well. Used lightly for short trips 2 times a day. After a few weeks the phone holder became loose and the phone would spin around upside down freely making it difficult to use. A few days later the arm fell out of the base all into my floor ! So it's now in pieces and will not go back together .
5,It’s great stays in place
5,Very easy to use and well made.  Great product.
5,It was easy to put in and it holds my phone really well. The only negative I can find is that the neck is a little wobbly. Other than that it does exactly what I need it to do.
5,The assembly was easy to follow and the parts feel solid good quality. my iPhone fits securely adjusting the fit was simple. The base adjustment at the cup holder will give you a good tight fit.Would recommend very happy.

5,I’m using this in both my vehicles. They’re fantastic and easy to install. I love them.
5,I bought this for my husband and he says it works perfectly in his Ford F-150. Not one negative thing to say
5,It works
4,Sturdy construction
5,Love this item.
3,Works great and easy to install.
5,Excellent for holding my giant phone
5,It works as expected
5,Easy to use.
5,Excellent
5,I like the convenience of this product in my SUV. My bf liked it so much we bought a second one for his Silverado. Works as expected with no issues.
5,Was nicer than I expected. Great firm fit in cup holder. I have no complaints. Easy to position and mechanism works reliably.
5,Was considering a Weathertech cup phone but at over $50 it's just too expensive. This item was simple to assemble use and had all the features I wanted. Sturdy and of good quality
5,Easy to install
5,Easy to use and take in and out.  I have a Jeep Wrangler so cup holders are awkward but this works extremely well and is very flexible!
4,Husband loved it easy to use
5,adjusts to wherever i can see it best and adjusts to my large phone case with ease.
4,Easy to use
3,I thought it would fit totally in the cup holder. No have shims to make it fit.  I wouldn't have bought it had I known
5,I love the convenience of securing my iPhone and being able to see the screen clearly.
5,Easy to setup and install. Very easy to use.
2,I didn't want to spend too much on something like this but I should know better.  This on was super easy to "install" but as I feared in less than 2 months the "holder grips" stripped out and no longer close enough to hold the phone.  I'll order WeatherTech brand to replace this.
5,I have been very impressed with this Product. So happy that I bought three other holders for my husband and my sister-in-law and brother would highly recommend it good for the price
2,The only bad thing I have to say is that the button to release the side clamps doesn’t let them open correctly. I have issues all the time with the clamps becoming uneven and my phone not fitting cause if it. I seems to be a bad design or I got the defective one in the batch.
5,The item was received as described and arrived on time. I have this in an adjustable cup holder and it’s strong enough to hold up my iPhone XS Max.
5,Very ease to install and adjust even while driving
5,I like everything abut it.
5,This is much better than the cellphone holders that stick to the windshield. Only drawback is it occupies one cupholder. Other than that Rock solid!!
5,Love it great quality..... Ordered the phone holder on Friday and was at my door the following Sunday afternoon
3,I like the way it holds my phone and the release button in the back.  However the whole thing is not very stable in the cup holder.
5,Unit was easy to install
5,Husband loves this! Furs snug in the cupholder and the adjustable neck allows it to be close to you.
4,loved it
5,All good!
5,Got one for both car very easy to put in.  Would have giving it a 5 star wife has a pop phone holder on the back doesn't quite work very well.
5,Works great!
5,The goose neck and the base could be adjusted to any vehicles cup holder had attachments for bigger vehicle cup holders so it will fit.
5,The TopGo works well in my car a Toyota Rav4.  It is perfect and everything that I wanted in a phone holder.
5,Bought this for my husband and now he wants one in every vehicle he drives. Adjusts to any cup holder and easy to get in and out.
5,This holder fit perfect in the cupholder of wife's Toyota with the supplied pieces to increase the base diameter. Holds Samsung Galaxy phone great. Very sturdy and adjustable. Works great!
5,Very excellent product. Extremely happy 😃
3,Wont stay mounted.
5,Well designed and sturdy device. Holds phone securely. Securing an releasing the phone is and easy one hand operation. I can't recommend this enough. It's simple but it's great.
2,I was very disappointed in this product. It is flimsy and does not fit tightly in the cup holder. I ended up gluing the two pieces together so that it doesn’t fall apart every time I use it.
5,My husband loves it! He is a semi truck driver and it works perfect! It fits just right in the cup holder easy to put in and take out.
5,Everyone should have one of these.Best present  for anyone on the go.Get ome for all your friends and family...
5,Love the flexibility of this device
5,Super easy to use. I would definitely recommend. Very useful. I would buy more for the whole family
5,Easy set up very sturdy!!
5,Love it. Flexible and snug. Got one for a gift the one for me!
5,I ordered these as gifts during Christmas. This is my second order for the folks that I missed. We all love them
5,Works great in any cup holder! bought for my wife-she loves it.
5,Well made item. Just what I needed to securely hold the phone while driving.
1,Broke after 2 months! I started using it at the end of October 2019 and this morning (Jan 13 2020) it snapped cleanly between the stem and the base. I should have trusted my instinct when I was putting it together and couldn't snap the car holder part into the stem. It should have been so easy a child could do it however after I tried and failed I asked my boyfriend to try and eventually he was able to get it. It never sat correctly in the cup holder but I have a 2014 Prius and the cup holder has a hinged top so I thought maybe that was why it would loosen up and tilt so then I'd have to readjust it. I still think it would have worked better in a normal cup holder but it should have lasted more than 2 months. Very disappointed.
5,Great product gave 4 more as gifts  after one family member told others how good it was
5,Works great so far I would recommend it to anyone who needs to stabilize their phone.
5,Safest way to have my phone available.  I use my maps on my phone to get around. Quality product.
5,Very sturdy.  Strong.  Holds phone well.  I like the adjustable base.  You can really lock it in the cup holder.  Does not fall over!
2,When I installed it in my car originally I LOVED IT! It was exactly what I needed while I was driving. But the back piece that hooks onto the phone that connects to the actual mount just won't stay on. The holes are too small so it falls off constantly. Great concept just wish they had made the back more secure and less annoying.
5,I was happy with my first Top-Go cup holder/phone mount.  The upgraded version is sturdier + the added flexibility that I can put mount into odd shaped compartment & keep 2 cup holders available. Would recommend.
5,Works great and much sturdier than I thought it was going to be. The only down-side is it takes up one of your cup-holders. So I drink alone. Great value great product!
5,Easy to install and holds the phone solidly in place
5,This phone & GPS holder is much more  than expected. Quality & ease of secure mount with the flexibilitygooseneck is great plus. Have used it everyday.
5,It’s perfect works really good I love it going to order more ❤️😊  Kishia Hernandez
5,I’ve tried so many things to hold my phone in my car and nothing has worked. This has been a relieve to finally have something that works!
3,The head or where ph is placed is loose.Comes off easily
5,Was easy to use and fit in nicely. Would buy again!
3,Doesn’t stay in cup holder very well and phone falls out
5,I really liked it. But I have a manual transmission so I needed one with a shorter neck. Was in the way of shifting.
5,I am a salesman and need for phone to be secured and for safety  it fits into cup holder and has the bigger pads for larger cup holder
5,Works perfectly only slight criticism is the extension neck could be a little stiffer
5,It's just an all around good product
5,Works great!!
5,Fits great with iPhone 11 Pro with case
2,The head that holds the phone falls off constantly over every little bump. I finally super glued it to function properly. I wouldn’t recommend it.
5,This is a great phone holder ... love how it fits in my cup holder AND the quality for the price is outstanding!
5,Excellent customer service. Very sturdy and easy to install. I've owned several holders this is the best one I've owned. No need to look any further. 5 Stars on all.
5,The upgraded version is nice and secure. I have no issues with this product.
5,Great product
5,ThanksWorks great
5,Best ever! Very sturdy!
5,Easy to install. Fits my Subaru's cup container using the extra holders. Holds my Galaxy 10+ without difficulty even on bumpy dirt roads.
5,Looks just like the picture. My husband has used and really likes it.
3,Good holder but I get a lot of rattling around when driving.
5,Very flexible and sturdy
3,too many parts and a little bulky
5,So far it’s doing as advertised.
5,I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it.
5,Easy to move - don’t have to worry about suctionEasily adjustable
5,Purchased two holder  one for a Audi and one for a Corvette- 100 percent perfect fit - Great price and quality! Thank You
5,Gave as a gift
5,Excellent holder for all of my needs durable easy to use protects phone no problem using one hand to search and type.
5,good product
5,Easy to install and stays in place. Very satisfied. Works for my Samsung S10 and my GPS.
5,Easy to install
5,Great for our Pontoon boat fits right in the cupholders securely.
5,It works really good. I think it was worth the money.
2,It's handy & convenient.  However  a lite touch can will bump the phone cradle off the holding mechanism.
3,It fits ok into the cup slot but the phone holder device easily falls off the clamp.
2,Overall I was very pleased with this car phone holder however after having it less than one month the release mechanism is failing.  The arms don't move outward much at all anymore so it is a trick to get the phone in and out of the holder.  I thought the price was very fair on this compared to the WeatherTech model but it was definitely a case of you get what you pay for.
5,Love these products they make a commute to an unknown area so much easier
5,I liked everything I have bought many of these types of items this one is the best. I used right away and it worked
2,I liked the design and it fit my cup holder well but it felt cheap and there was glue sticking out of the seams. Just didn't look nice or instill confidence in the quality. Also wish the neck was longer. I'll be trying another brand and sending it back.
5,Easy to use.
5,As advertised had over 3 months now and still working perfectly
5,Easy assembly fits my xup holder with side panels attached holds phone well. Does what 8 need it to do
5,Perfect
5,Sturdy
1,Did not last 6 months. The part that holds the phone spins around and will not tighten. Also if you are not careful about adjusting the height of the phone in the holder the sides hit the buttons and your iphone will call 911. Also the length of the bendable arm is very short.
5,put this in in 30 seconds easy hands free holder in an appropriate position (as opposed to on the dash).
5,It’s just fine...
2,The slides on the side that adjust to the size of your phone are crap. They only worked a few times. After that they stuck before finally just breaking. Every other part of the item was durable enough except one of the most important pieces
5,It is strong and is well made.
5,I use this in my service van while driving and it works great for hands free operation including maps and directions.
5,FIT AND FUNCTION CORRECT AND FUNCTIONAL IN MY 2020 TOYOTA CAMRY.
2,I bought this for my suv that has two big s cup holders between the seats. Unfortunately it only works if the cup holder is a complete circle and these are kind of conjoined... so it always fell over
5,product is great so far.  i have a finger grip on the back of my phone and this holds the phone well.  customer service was great.
5,Quality and Ease of use
5,This I-phone cup "holder" is VERY versatile and can be moved from vehicle to vehicle.  It makes hands free even better.
5,So far so good. Product was as described and seems quite sturdy in the cup holder and holding the phone in place. No complaints.
3,It does not fit my 2007 Lexus. The Lexus has one open side which does not allow the item to fit securely.
5,good
5,Good product worth the money
3,Gooseneck when extended is  in the way for normal movements like adjusting radio temperature etc.
5,Love it!! Very sturdy snug on my cup holder and doesn’t wobble which is a major plus for me
2,What does it take to find a decent car mount these days? This one boasts that a larger phone in a case willl fit. That is not what I've experienced. Just this morning my phone fell out of it. The brackets close unevenly so the power plug-in is off center putting pressure on the USB cable.
5,very secure hold on phone
5,Great Product
5,Great produck
5,Works well for smaller cup holders and has extension pieces for larger cup holders to work equally well.  Great Product
3,One problem with cup holder the right support finger covers the speaker on the iPhone 6s.
5,The adjustable cup insert is perfect for any size and the arm is stiff enough to allow easy positioning.
1,I purchased this item thinking it would be easy to attach my phone and be on my way. Wrong! The back hooks would snap on fine but if I happened to move my hand next to it my phone would land on the floor. I know they say you get what you pay for but I thought the phone would at least stay put and not fall off.I finally had to glue the piece that holds the phone unto the holder and it works fine.
3,I dislike the spacers they have the base whop sided.
5,This is a great way to hold your phone when traveling.  Seems very sturdy hoping it stays that way.
5,My wife enjoys the hands free use of her phone.
1,They break very easily.
5,Everyone should have one of these in there car instead of that suction cup thing that always and I mean always fall down.
5,Worked perfect for my 2019 dodge grand caravan. I Would refer thus item.
5,Gift
5,Very good works good
5,Other reviews said hard to assemble... read instructions went together very easy!
5,I really like it easy to install didn’t fall down a lot like the other one I had purchased.
1,Too big for the two cup holders to work together.
2,Product does not perform as stated or expected. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is I still use it. Holder is not sturdy and moves around alot. The phone grip doesn't stay tight on the phone.
5,Pleasantly surprised of the excellent quality.
5,Fits any cup holder less expensive alternative to the weathertech version
2,I had to return this product as it doesn’t really work if your phone has a pop socket or ring stand. My phone wouldn’t stay in and would fall out of the holder with basically any movement of the car. I can’t imagine this holder would work for any phone that had a thicker case. Very disappointed.
5,Wife loves it
5,I bought this to use for my Samsung S9.  It's very sturdy and fits my Camry perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Good product!
5,Finally a phone holder that works!! Ive tried everything and they always fall down.  This is perfect!
5,Easy to install
5,Way better than a suction cup type. Securely mounts in your cup holder. I like this item.
5,Fits and secure. Great product.
5,This product worked better than I expected extremely happy with it will definitely purchase for my other vehicles
3,Unable to firmly attach the phone to the base plate
3,It kept coming apart
5,Car cup holder is very sturdy and holds the phone securely. Also it's very easy to adjust the view. Would recommend.
2,My problem is that the actual part that holds the phone that slides on to the arm keeps coming off when I take the phone out. It is what it is it's a phone cup holder...
5,The expanding base allows a perfect fit in any circumference cup holder and the flexible shaft is a plus
5,Work great
5,Item arrived very quickly and was easy to install. So far it is working great.Is helpful with the gooseneck.
5,Christmas gift for husband  I  have one that a friend ordered for me in February and I loved mine.
5,Was gifted. They are enjoying this phone mount.
5,This cup holder worked well.  Easy to install easy to use.
5,I have a heavy phone and it’s great!
2,Didn’t like it at all it was a waste of money and I bought 3. The mount that holds phone falls off when ever you put phone in or out.  It will not stay tight in cup holder.
5,Great product. Iam very happy with it: thank you
5,Highly recommend this phone holder. Works great and a fraction of the cost of that "name brand" holder.
5,EXCELENTE MATERIAL Y MUY BUENA CALIDAD
5,Clamps in and holds steady in the forward cup holder.  Did not need to use the clamp "extenders".
5,Easy to install. Great fit. Strong and flexible.
5,This adjustable vehicle cup holder design is very easy to install. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a hands free car cellphone holder.
5,Awesome phone holder. Buy it you won't forget it!!
5,Just bought and installed holder. Works as described at time of installation.
5,Works on two vehicles I use. Very easy to take out and install on different vehicles.
5,Love it. Easy to install and It tightens and holds great. If you don’t need it it comes out easy.
5,Great product. Adjusts to different size cup holders. Sits up high so easier to glance at it while driving.
5,Easy to installWith the spiral shaft you are able to adjust to where you want.
5,Does exactly what it’s supposed to.  It adjusts to cup holder sizes easily and holds the phone very securely.
5,woks great
1,Made of cheap plastic this thing while being a very good idea didn't hold up well at all. Putting the phone in and taking it out stresses the side grip retention gears too much which leads to a quick failure and a very short life span. For the price of this thing I would have expected it to last several hundred cycles but I estimate it only survived a couple dozen before the gear teeth (plastic) stripped. A couple more bucks to use "nylon" gears or even aluminum would have dramatically increased the quality of this holder. I rate this item as poor quality and definitely not worth the price. Yet another good idea poorly executed resulting in another consumer rip off product.
5,This phone holder was simple to install and fits my cup holder perfectly. I am totally pleased.
5,Very sturdy easy to installand easily handles my LG V20 which is protected by an Otterbox.
2,I purchased from TopGo another of their Phone Cup Holders last Aug. That one is AWESOME so I ordered another for 2nd car.  This one is different but I didn't realize that until I used it today.  The arms that release the phone don't always open so I'm sliding my ph out the top other than this it's very sturdy & does the job I like. I will be returning very disappointed...
5,It is a good quality and goes well with my car. I love it!
5,Works great in our golf cart
2,It is what it is I already quit using it 3 days after getting it! Waste of money!The neck is so short on this it barely fit my Samsung Galaxy S10! I could not position my phone because of the shortness of the neck! If my kid hadn't thrown the box into the recycle bin I would have definitely returned it! If you have a big smartphone dont buy this one!!!
5,This product is perfect.  Easy assembly and installation!
5,Love this!
5,BETTER quality than I had even imagined! Perfect for my iPhone and Hyundai Tucson - I highly recommend!
5,Easy to install. I have only had it for one week but so far I love it!
5,My phone.
5,Works great and ordered a second one for my husband.
5,Good item but didn’t fit in a 2016 Mini Countryman. It was too close to the gear shifter
1,I would give this product 5+ But I think I received a broken product. The phone holder doesn’t stay in place at all. I attach the top part and it falls off even after the click sound. Even when I’m not touching it or driving it falls out. I would like a refund or get another sturdy product. My boyfriend has the same product that’s why I decided to order and his mount is nothing like mine. It is sturdy unlike Mine.
5,Easy to install- solves problem of where to place phone so it’s hands free.
5,I have had this for a few days but I absolutely love it. Great quality product ( it’s sturdy) and well worth the money.
2,Have broken 2 at the swivel head trying to adjust phone.  Takes up valuable cup holder
2,Item was everything advertised.  But not practical.  It got in the way of my knee and stick shift.  Who wants to lose their cup holder for a phone.
5,Will move where you need it according to where the sun is shining in from.  Mostly for directions!
5,This product is very secure. The flexible holding rod makes it easy to adjust the view and sight line
5,Does exactly what I need it to do!
5,This is possibly the best phone mount on the market!!!!  Terrific price a snap in install and great quality.
5,This is a quality product that is easy to install and delivers convenience at an affordable price.
1,I just received this product and am very disappointed with it! It was an Amazon Choice product and an “upgraded” version. I went with this product because I need an higher extended model so I could place a cup in the other cup holder. This phone cup holder is not sturdy and jiggles when you are driving making it not safe in my opinion because it takes more attention to view it. Because of this I will be returning it a choosing a model without the “flex” extender.
5,Love this for my IPhone! Very sturdy. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants hands-free in the car.
5,It worked so well in my wife's car I purchased a second one for my daughter. Great value for the price!
5,Fits perfectly extended height is a plus out of way of heater vents and radio
5,Easy to use function of the product allows it to fit tightly into the cup holder.  Great product.
5,It fit our cup holder perfectly and phone stayed in place / even over rough roads!  Love  it!
5,fathers day gift. Perfect and dad loved it!
5,Allows hands free talking in car.
1,Worked well for a while then the part that holds the phone started to be loose and not hold the phone steady. Today my wife came home from the grocery store and the entire holder had fallen off of the part that holds it up.Not happy seems like it should have lasted longer than 4 months.It appears there is a very small diameter piece of plastic that makes the connection between the holder and upright and is part of the swivel function that's failed. Very small size for the intended purpose so I'm going to say it's a design flaw issue.
5,Much better value than the expensive Weather Tech model. And it fits my IPhone with the Otter!
5,Sturdy very easily adjustable phone is extremely tightly secured just living this holder in my car!
2,I really don’t like this cup holder for a cell phone and thought it would be better and easier and fit into my Ford edge couple of her but it does not it was a waste of money
5,Best one I have bought.
5,Item got here quickly and was everything it advertised
5,Purchased for my Father and he loved it! Works and fits great!!
1,Did not fit in my cup holder.
5,Recommend. I bought 4 more as gifts.
2,It’s pretty flimsy.  The phone portion falls off a lot.
2,Easy to install but stopped working after one month.
5,Its great help us stay hands free
5,Easy to install very adjustable  holds phone well.
5,mom enjoys it
5,Absolutely love this item had an issue with it and they replaced it no problem.  Wonderful customer service.
5,Very  pleased with this product . Easy to use and see the screen on my phone!
1,First of all it’s easy to install but what a piece of junk I dropped it by mistake and all the pins broke off that connects to the phone holder. This product isn’t durable at all.
5,I bought it a gift to my son and he likes it very much
5,This phone holder is being used in a golf cart and it works great.
5,I gave it to my son for a CHRISTMAS gift  he said he really liked it
5,Great Item works perfectly
5,Perfect for any size cup holder
5,Fits really well
2,When I tighten into the cup holder it broke!!
5,We love it. It's a great product. It holds the phone well.
5,My car

5,Not so worried about daughter's safety while driving and talking on phone.  Glad I purchased.
2,East to assemble
5,Sturdy secure phone holder.  Safer and easy to read in the car
5,First time I have something to hold good my phoneGood item
5,Works perfectly. No issue with it yet and have been using it for a little over 3 months.
5,Perfect! Have tried other mounts for the phone but this one is on point. Don’t hesitate to buy this.

5,Worked really really well!

5,It works really well
3,I took up more space then I imagined.
5,This unit was at a great price
5,Better than expected.  Very well made . Much better than the others I have tried.
5,Worked well
5,Works great. Holds iPhone 11 max where I can see calls without fumbling for phone.
5,As described! Love it so far
5,Works great
1,When I first put it in my new car it was goos. As the first 30 days of using it.  It started to loosen up. The head know spins at every stop light or stop. When I accelerate or hit the breaks it spins.  I will be tossing this in the trash tonight.  Not very good
5,This was a present for my grandson.  He really likes it and it works great.
5,Works Perfectly!
5,Looks and works great 👍.  Thank you 😊
5,A terrific holder at a reasonable price. Would buy again.
5,Pretty decent item. Pretty sturdy.
5,Sturdy and well-made and good value for the price. Side clamps initially were difficult but once started are doing just great.
5,My husband loves the item  uses it in his truck
3,Little checking wen i driving
5,Very good product and easy to install
5,very stable unlike the ones that plug into the cigarette lighter. installed in about a minute.
3,Difficult to use with a manual transmission 2019 Hyundai Veloster
5,Just what I needed.
5,I just love this phone holder. fits perfect. easy to use and couldn't be happier.
5,Does the job
5,My dad likes it.
5,one of the best I bought
5,Cup holder works great in all my vehicles. Made very well. Worth the price.
5,Product works great! Easy to use with my pixel 2xl and case
1,Do Not Buy this.  The part where phone fits in continually falls off.  There is no fix except to super glue it on and not even sure that will work.  Cheaply made and since I did not open it right away it was too late to return.  I would give it a 0 if I  could.  The base works perfectly and can be made secure in the cup holder but piece holding phone is horrible.  Total waste of money as seeing your phone is the purpose of having it
5,very easy to install and it grips the phone well well designed and made product
5,Bought this for a gift for Christmas for some one and they loved it.
5,Works as advertised
5,Great iPhone holder.  It was east to install. Holds IPhone securely.
5,Loved it!!! Highly Recommended!!
5,Love this item. Was going to order more but price increased before I could place order.
5,Started using as soon as I received it. So far so good! I really like it.
2,The three covers for the adjustment base easily come out place so it’s not as sturdy as I was expecting
1,Doesn’t stay in cup holder
5,The was a great buy and fit perfectly in the cup holder.
3,I wasn’t that satisfied. Awkward to use. Blocked controls on dash.
5,Fit the larger diameter cup holder very well and the customer service from TopGo was five star.
5,Very good holds my phone steady and grips well.
5,This product is invaluable when traveling I'm glad that I discovered it.
3,Not the best but works well
5,Easy
5,This product is so much better than Weathertech. It fits better and adjusts easily.
5,Easy to use.
5,Work good
5,I’ve  purchased 5 of them to hand out to family members.
5,works great...ease and quality...worth the money
5,easy to install
5,Best phone holder yet
2,The cup holder is not stable  to use when driving  which will make so dangerous when on the road  because it may fall and drop on the car floor
2,I easily installed this phone holder but the part that holds the phone often falls off.  Very frustrating.  Also it's placement in the cupholder seems to often get in the way.  Just not right...for me at least.
5,Fits cup holders real good sturdy
5,ok
5,Bought for 4 - one for everyone in my family! We love!
5,I like it because you can adjust it and move it around
5,Sturdy well placed phone mount. The only drawback is that you'll lose a cupholder.
2,I thought it was going to be great but tried to adjust it one day and the part that holds the phone just broke.  The little peg pieces that connect to the base broke right off and after that it was unusable.  Going to purchase the one from Weathertech now.  Hopefully it will be more sturdy.
5,Driving for Uber and this makes it even easier! Worth the money!
5,bought this for my wife she liked it a lot and it works
5,Great product and great service
5,Very fast and accurate description works perfectly
5,This product is just what it said it was.  Good quality and value.
5,Did as expected
1,No me gusto. Lo regrese.
1,After a few months the holder would just spin not stay upright. Then broke off completely. Saw this same review from someone else. May be half the price of others but more expensive in the long run since will have to replace.

5,Works nice
2,Thought it would work well. But the part that hold the phone falls off every time I use it. It clicks in place but doesn't stay!

2,It’s not really friendly for used at a red light with the grips surrounding the screen. The clip that secures the phone is also pretty flimsy.
5,Works perfect!
1,It works to hold phone. But when taking the phone out the back piece that holds it also comes off the holder. Maybe I got a bad one. But back piece that holds phone doesn’t stay on the holder.
5,This item is great. Highly recommend!
5,Works as described   excellent product
2,Cell phone holder stays securely in the cup holder howecer the part that attacws to the phone pops off frequently leaving the attechment stuck to the phone intermittently.

5,Pretty good phone holder.Bang for the buck!!
5,Works well. I would buy another.  Nice gift for holidays.
5,Using it in a 2015 f150
5,Works great and expands to fit holder perfectly.
5,Easy to install and easily adjustable
1,I was excited when I found this phone cup holder on Amazon. However I feel like the actual phone holder piece I received is incorrect.  It will not snap on the arm. I have tried my roommate has tried my father tried; it will not snap on so it's useless. So disappointed.  Delivery was fast boxed very nicely but for an upgraded model it's useless because it cannot be used. I feel ripped off and I cannot recommend it. It's not even a 1 star rating but zero is not an option.
5,Great product and easy to install.
1,Mount was in 2 pieces on day 1 of use. Cheaply made product. Don't waste your time and money on this one. Already passed Amazon return period emailed manufacturers support but no response yet.
5,Holder worked great and was easy to install!
5,Highly recommend!!Incredibly well made!
5,Easy to install no tools needed.
5,Works great !
5,Love it fits nice and tight in cup holder
5,It was a gift and they love it!
1,Does not hold up over time.  I have purchased 2 of these in the past year and the adjustable goose neck has broken both times from just adjusting it.  Not a quality product
5,Great Item and easy to use
5,Easy fit in cup holder sturdy.
5,Good as the higher priced name brands!
1,Everything
5,Product was great with serving my crab leg dinner!
2,Mine broke after having it for two months
1,Today I had cell phone in holder sitting in my vehicle.  I wasn't even touching phone or holder.  Out of no where the holder made a pop noise and fell apart.  The stand part just snapped off from inside the holder part (section that sits in cup holder)  Top piece (phone holder) fit loose as well. It didn’t snap together like description said it would. Very loose.  I would look elsewhere.  Unless you want a holder that lasts only 10 days.  Junk!
5,Used
5,Great price. Easy to install and use.
5,it's no reason to dislike this product
5,Works great! I bought 4 more for Christmas gifts!
2,it hold my iPhone well but the mount itself keeps falling I had to superglue the mount to the stick to keep it from falling
5,Easy install. iPhone securely fits in the holder.
5,Does what it is supposed to do!
5,My wife love's it.
5,Works very well.
2,Cumbersome easily detached not pliable enough.
5,Easy to put together works great with my iPhone 10
1,The holder which snaps on to the gooseneck falls off very easily. I’m trying to McGyver it with some creativity but so far it seems destined for my “it seemed like a good idea at the time” file.
5,Works as promised. Love it
5,Bought it for my fiancé and she loves it
2,The cell phone plate does not stay locked in place. If you want to rotate the plate it drops off. For this reason I will not recommend buying.
5,Love the multiple positions
5,Bought for my husbands work truck. He absolutely loves it.
5,Excellent value. Fits just right!
5,This is everything promised and more.
5,This is one well-made item! Very functional.
5,Love the item
2,Inexpensive and easy to use BUT it broke in less than a year in a vehicle I rarely drive.Disappointing. Would not recommend.
5,It is great...Easy to install
1,This is not what I expected. It fits in my cupholder however the arm does not extend very far and I have to look down when I am driving at it. I am returning it.
5,Assembles easily good height and sturdy.
5,Preformed as described . Well built sturdy
5,Height and flexibility of neck.
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,Held my phone perfectly
2,I thought this holder was the type that used the weight of the phone to squeeze the side clamps. Alas this is like my old holder which failed with the spring action after releasing the phone to leave the vehicle
2,Phone looks crooked in holder
1,The cup does not fit in either of my cup holders and rolls around.  I didn't discover this until it was too late to return (I fell and broke some ribs and wasn't driving when my  phone holder arrived.)  I'm very disappointed in this product.
5,To hold my phone in my car
2,Works great ! For 4 mos !😠I liked it very much.  But if you use it everyday all day.  It won't last.
5,Good quality fast delivery.
5,Completely happy with it. Exactly what I wanted

5,Just what the wife needed
5,Just what we were looking for!
2,Good product worked well for a couple weeks didn’t last through normal wear and tear. Sent back.
2,Unfortunately I didn’t keep this item. It didn’t Work for me at all.I couldn’t keep it from falling over. Etc.
2,Does not fit cup holder well
5,Fit perfectly and it functions well!
5,Nothing to dislike works peefect
5,well designed. sturdy
5,I use the holder to hold my phone
5,Works as advertised. Very well designed. Great value.
5,Simple and easy to use.
5,Works as advertised
5,Good quality and easy to use.
1,I bought this for my Dad for Father's Day and he just informed me today that the actual phone holing part falls of the base if you touch it even slightly. It will not lock in. I viewed the order to see if I could exchange it and realized the return window was only 30 days so we missed it. Real bummer. Total waste of money.
5,Great fits perfect in my car
5,It's stylish and sturdy
5,Item arrived fast and works well.
5,It is very good
1,Worked fine for 8 months  and then phone mount started getting loose and there’s no way to tighten it.It just spins left and right when you put your phone in cradle.Don’t waste your money!
5,Ease of use
5,Very well made. Not a cheaply made product. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
5,This thing is awesome!
5,Exactly what I was looking for
2,it is alright at best - it will eventually either vibrate itself to death or will enough to annoy the crap out of you to the point where you just buy something else
5,Excellent fit!
2,Hard to fit. They claim that it fits all sizes. The top holder for my phone keeps falling off.  Cheap!!
1,I thought this was going to be perfect for my husbands pick up. This was a horrible purchase the holder constantly falls off if you accidentally bump it.
5,Works well
2,I did not like this phone holder at all. The piece which holds the phone doesn't stay on.
1,Broke after one use. Drove to work with this thing holding up my phone. When I got in my car after work I found the whole thing was broken and unusable - with the phone holder flexible part no longer attached to the cup holder part.Definitely hoped to get more than literally one use out of this product. :-/
5,Nicely designed
5,It worked okay
1,It sucked. Don’t buy it. Spend a few extra dollars for a better one. Wont even waste my time returning it. Already tossed it in the trash. One (literally) turn too many and it was broken.
5,I like it as is🤣
1,I could not get the phone holder to slide up as shown in the directions to attach it to the extendable arm. When I contacted the company they sent me to a youtube video. I had already watched it. So since I absolutely hate to go to the bother of returning stuff I took a screw driver and pried up the little prongs of course breaking one off but it seems to work okay without it.
5,Works great
5,Works great!
2,Very unstable the neck wobbles where it meets the base.  I do not recommend this product.
2,Falls apart often
1,The head kept tilting down so I adjusted it up and it snapped off and broke. I have had this since the end of May and it is towards the end of August- and I have worked from home during COVID. My point being it wasn’t used much. I would not buy it again. Highly disappointed.
2,The holder continually falls off the stem.
1,Thought it would be as good as weather tech product....but nooooooo. Phone falls out of the holder is not secure.  Is a real hazard when it falls off during driving. I have tried a 1000 different ways to remedy the solution.  Do not waste your money.
5,High quality product completely satisfied
2,It sucks
5,No dislikes wonderful
5,Works as described
5,very helpful
1,The mount that holds the phone will fall off the stand with a bump in the road. Not a very secure locking device that connects the neck to the phone holder. It has fallen in my floorboard a couple of times which is not safe for driving. Other than that I like the other features and it is easy to use.
5,Like everything about it so far
5,Great
5,Adjusted perfectly
1,Terrible! Do not order. When this box arrived it was missing most of the parts it said it came with and the box included a power cord and a brush to a bissel vacuum which you don’t need for this device? Total scam.
5,Does as advertised. I like it.
5,Worth it
5,Good product
5,Great product
5,Good product
1,The phone hold kept detaching from the Gooseneck.  I pulled off the road several times to re-attach it.  That’s a safety concern.  I had to return it.
5,Great
5,awesomeno moving or shaking
2,Does not fit on my car falling down all the time
1,Buyers beware the piece that connects the phone to the stand is not sturdy at all. Does not click into place and will be knocked of the stand with minimal contact unless you tape or glue it in.
5,Best cell phone holder
2,The top piece will not stay. Keeps falling off maybe if glued together it would stay.
5,Product is as advertised..
1,**THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. IT GETS THE AWARD FOR THE WORST PRODUCT THAT I'VE BOUGHT ON AMAZON. IT DOESN'T WORK. YOU CANNOT TURN IT SIDEWAYS OR ELSE IT FALLS OFF. WHEN USING IT THE REGULAR WAY AND YOU HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD IT FALLS OFF. THIS IS GARBAGE.**
5,Fast Shipping Works Great
5,Very handy.
1,I would like some help with this item as you cannot connect the phone holder to the arm of the cup holder.  I am disappointed in this item as I am leaving on a trip and mainly wanted the ability to use this cup holder that is so highly rated. Please help with what I should do with it!
5,Keeps phone handy
5,Too low position
5,Works great
2,At 3 month is crack an not funciona more
5,Works great
5,Hold phone very securely.
1,Piece of JUNK!!!! Fell apart and went straight in the trash. They say you get what you pay for not the case here because this isn’t worth a penny.
5,Works great
5,Good
1,It was cheaply made
5,Easy to use
5,Serves the purpose
5,Awesome product!
1,This car cell phone holder is so poorly made that there is no locking device on the holder such that it falls off the stand whenever one picks up the phone. I'm really mad at myself for buying it and I would have returned it if I had kept the box.
2,It doesn’t stay steady in the normal size cup holder even with the attachable parts
5,Super adjustable
5,Easy to assemble.
1,Garbage!!!!! I purchased this less than a year ago and I took it out of the cup holder to clean it the other day. Well it just broke in half! Don’t buy this
5,Like the product
2,It was great for about 6 months and then the head snapped off
5,Great  product.
5,Easy to install
1,After two weeks of use the rotation joint completely wore out. Phone spins free. No way to tighten. Would not recommend this product
5,easy to use
2,Broke right after return window....tightening mechanism came apart into 3 pieces and will no longer tighten.. great product if it worked....
5,Great product
1,base does not expand properly to hold cup in place. tighen as much as you can  and oops does not holdnot as good as higher priced models for sure. do not waste your money
5,As expected
2,The car holder mount interferes with my movement - my elbow knocks the phone holder over and reaching for the controls i.e. radio temperature is a nuisance.
1,The idea is good product did not last but a week.  Did not stay in my 2015 Highlander's cup holder had to tighten it up every time I placed the phone in it.  After several attempts to tighten it up it just snapped.  Didn't even bother trying to return it trash!
1,Piece of junk. It would swivel all the time. I would use my phone for GPS and my phone would always turn sideways. Never stay in one place. It finally broke about a week after my warranty. It last just over 90 days.
5,Works well
5,Well make.
2,What a mess! Doesn't do what it's suppose to...hold the phone upright.
5,Ok
2,Does not stay in position in an adjustable drink holder such as in a 2005 Toyota Rav 4
1,Product was not very sturdy.  Will not hold phone upright.  Gooseneck is of poor quality.
1,Not as sturdy as claimed to be. It is a little wiggly I could have lived with that but the worst part was that the part that holds your phone would come un-attached from the base riser. Its going back and searching for a better one.
5,Fit perfectly
5,Nice
1,The mount for the phone does not latch in place and the phone and holder are constantly falling off the stand. very annoying.
1,Although this did hold my phone the whole this was unstable and the cup holder feature just didn't work properly. Was returned.
5,Great
1,I do not like where it sits in my cup holder. It is in my way. I will buy something else.
2,RECOMIENDO EL TIPO DE PRODUCTO. ESTE EN ESPECIFICO NO.
1,It went limp after 6 months.See attached picture. The lower section of the bendable stem lost all its mojo within 7 months of purchase.I bought in 5/2020. It failed by 12/2020.
2,I constantly need to look down at my phone because of the short length of the pole.
1,It’s made really wellIt just was top heavy and toppled overMake sure your cup holder is even like a canMy cup holder in my 2011 Silverado has a tapered insideSo the base would not streach and tighten to the walls and popped out
1,Had to assemble some of the pieces
1,I have a Samsung S20+ and it doesn't support the weight after a couple of weeks. My phone flips upside down when I hit a slight bump.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this item. It broke as I adjusted the neck right after I installed it in the cup holder!  The failure point was a little piece of plastic which I could not repair. Item send back for a refund. 😎
5,Great
1,Phone holder is way too unstable and the gooseneck is way way too stiff.!
1,This is USELESS. The cradle for the actual phone easily disconnects from the extended arm and does so so frequently that I was spending more time searching for my fallen phone creating a much more UNSAFE situation.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
2,Not with the money not very stable
1,Was good but only lasted 4 months and broke already other then that was good
1,When I tightened the cup holder it broke and the top portion came off. Poorly designed with such a weak point.
5,Loved it
1,The piece that holds the phone does not stay on if accidentally hit.
2,Works good in my cupholder not thrilled but it works.
1,I had this for 2 weeks and the place wear the phone goes in snapped right off. Junk! I should have returned it but I got angry and just threw it in the trash.
1,This thing broke 1 week after installing it just by trying to adjust the position of the holder.  Not good quality.
1,The item will not hold the phone in place. It will swing down every time.
1,was not what it was advertised
5,Great
2,Stated would hold phone in a thick case plus pop it or ring holder. Wouldn't...had to return it.
2,Every few hours or less you have to tie more I’m not sure why is going lose
1,Weakest where it needs to be solid!! I was very happy with the product. I purchased it 3 months ago. I was putting my phone into the holder and it snapped! Very disappointed.
1,This is the 3rd one we have bought in 8 months and they have all broke some how!
2,Could have been better
1,Very little room to get a good grip to insert in cupholder.  Keeps falling out of cupholder -- eventually - put in trash.
1,Holding phone weak and tips easy. Suction not very strong. Tried in two different vehicles. Not the best.
1,This item was discounted due to faulty parts and should have never been sold. I would not trust my thousand-dollar phone to sit in this junk.
1,Bulky and ugly.  Sent it back
1,To hold my phone in vehicle. It kept falling off when phone was placed to hold.
1,Adjusted as the directions indicated but this is too small for my Honda Accord cup holder. Returned
1,The phone holder is too flimsy and comes off the holder too easily.Cheaply made. I used it 5 x dumped it
1,It’s absolute garbage. Every time I go to take my phone out of the holder the whole top piece falls off.
1,Made very cheaply. Broke the first time I used it.
1,Cheap and flimsy. The phone holder broke after 2 days.
1,The product isn't sturdy. Do not buy this product.
1,The are no longer holds the phone up I only had it 3 month or so. 😥😥
1,It really didn't work with the subaru outback cup holder..everytime I touched it it came out or off..
1,When 1st purchased product would expand to insert phone  now it barely expands wide enough to insert phone  not satisfied  would not recommend
1,Broke already after just 6 weeks of use. Very disappointing!
1,Broke before I even had an opportunity to turn the car on. Next!
1,Haven’t had it a week and the right side retainer won’t secure phone.  Very cheaply made..  but that’s want you get for $13 dollars.  My advice is don’t buy.
1,Very cheap plastic. Not rigid at all. Phone keeps bouncing around.
1,After two months the arm would not hold up the phone anymore. It would just bend over when the phone is attach.
2,Poor design
1,Tried to connect the part that holds the cell phone to the gooseneck with no luck .  Faulty  design  no doubt.  Piece of junk not worth buying.  Returning  for sure....
1,The cradle that holds the smartphone does not securely attach to the arm. A bump in the road or quick stop will knock it off. The rest of the product is fine.
1,STEAM BROKE AFTER 2 WEEKS
1,As reported by others the holder doesn't connect to the gooseneck.  The tabs fit into the slots but can't be locked into place.  Sending back and following other reviewers to different supplier.
1,I don't like it.  very unsturdy......I am going to throw it away....
1,My mistake in NOT reading the reviews.  Just like those posted my phone holder did not fix the phone securely.  It would fly off the gooseneck easily...going back.
1,Pieces kept falling off. Does not stay in cup holder. Isn’t sturdy enough to hold phone upright.
2,not what i expected  too flimsy
1,However I cannot get the part that holds your phone to stay on the stand.  The slightest bump it falls off.The only thing I can think of is super glue.
1,I threw thus away after 5 min!  The spacers provided did not fit in my cup holders at all .  Total junk don’t waste your money
1,Does not fit a standard cupholder and falls over when hit by a feather. Total waste of money . Threw away the packaging or I'd send it back for a refund.
1,This cup holder broke after 3 days.  The pieces you attach came off and would not stay on.  I literally had to tape them on for them to stay
1,They are a one time use deal illegal in many states should be a disclaimer
1,Holder will not stay on the stand and continuously falls off every time it gets bumped or you try to take your phone out. Totally useless
1,Cheap piece of junk the phone holder piece would not stay on the mount at all. Couldn't return so I threw the whole thing away
1,it's cheaply made after 4 months it will not hold the phone in place
1,Broke within a week very poor quality
1,Phone mount completely broke off
4,Great product I do recommend it!
1,absolute trash. it went limp and while trying to get it to hold up it broke 😖. it’s only been 4 months. DO NOT BUY
1,How did this get 4.5 stars? Installs easily holds phone well but vibrates and juggles like crazy rendering the phone unreadable and this holder worthless. Returned.
1,doesn't work well with an 07 honda. it will definitely get in your way when your trying to use your arm rest or shift into gear
1,It broke after one week.
1,Save your money it does NOT work well at all.
1,Broke in a year and a half. Junk
1,Product not as described

1,Would never buy again.  The top keeps falling off

1,This product stinks. The part that holds the phone does not stay attached to the base. I do not recommend buying this.
1,Keeps falling apart
1,Poor fitting .
1,Had to send the first one back. Got the second one. Same problem. Neck will not fit the phone holder. Do not recommend. Bad product.
1,It did not fit in our cars. I needed to return it.
1,Falls over. hard to adjust.
1,It would not work in my cup holders.
1,This is so poorly made- the phone cradle doesn’t ever stay put on the extension arm- it’s garbage
1,The holder falls off ALLLLLLLLLLLL the time the three space accessories are worthless and do nothing.  This product is a waste of money.
5,Very easy to install and relocate if needed. Quickly can be removed and/or moved.
1,The long flexible holder shakes making it difficult to see maps.
1,Did not fit my cup holder
1,The mount that holds the cell phone does not stay easily unattaches and unsafe while driving.
1,Dangerous. Too close to the shift lever

1,It's not sturdy enough and it shakes all the time.
1,Would prefer in the dash or windows for easy access
1,Did not fit in my cars cup holder.
4,I bought it for my new car. When I went to install I realized I didn’t need it.  I’ll give it away.Delivery was on time as product was as advertised.
1,It came apart and its unusable
4,It is well built and fits cupholder well tightly.It has a flexible gooseneck which is pretty thick and solid but still wiggles a bit when driving. Not an issue if you are just using it for a phone holder.If you are one of these idiots that looks down at your center console while you are driving such as following GPS directions or texting the wiggle will annoy you. And you will annoy someone when you kill them while you are looking down instead of out the windshield . Then the "little wiggle" will be the least of your problems.  There is an updated version by the same company that uses a solid plastic adjustable stem instead of the flexible cable. That would eliminate the wiggle for sure.
1,Not easy to hold in place
1,Was not able to assemble. The pieces did not fit.
1,Junk! Broke after 2 months!!!
1,No good
1,Not practical
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It came without the bracket
1,junk
5,Great quality. Easy to use and assemble.
5,Great phone atand. Made very well. Very sturdy and easy to install. I only wish it was a little bit taller so I didn't have to look down so far when looking at my gps
5,It could be a little taller
4,Easy to install neck bends easily allowing me to adjust to my drinks.
5,Love the product. Works great when driving and using GPS.
4,Update- you have to snap the holder in place and it does snap without breaking tabs.  Once you do that the holder stays on arm.  Raised to a 4 star as I would prefer the arm to be a bit longer so it was more adjustable.  Otherwise it does the job!**Actual phone holder does not stay on the arm.  Any bumping and it falls off.  That happens with and without the phone.  Otherwise it holds the phone well.  Just annoying to always have to pick up the piece and reattach.
1,This product does not stay in place. The top part that holds the cell phone turns 360 degrees and is not safe when driving and using the GPS. I’m not satisfied.
5,It’s very sturdy now if only I could get my CD phone holder back out
5,These are great. I have them in all my cars. Easy to adjust and easy to access your phone! So far so good and they have held up. Couldn’t be happier!
3,I had no problem to install this base it is really easy and straightforward. The phone holder will hold a wide variety of phone sizes. Unfortunately with a heavy phone it tends to vibrate a lot while the car is moving and it certainly would benefit from more sturdiness. For the price paid it is okay and I could not complain too much.
5,Works exactly as described convenient well crafted
3,The swivel attachment to the holder could be a lot sturdier. With my phone locked in place if I try to swivel it to the side it does not hold its horizontal position. I have to try to stabilize it with my charger cord.
5,This  cup hold is the best. Holds my phone and I can see my phone easily. I do not have gps on my car so I depend on my phone a lot. Does not take up a lot of space in my little car.
3,The adjustable wire is extremely stiff and not very tall. It has three extensions to tighten into place but it must be situated in the cup holder just right to hold. It will knock out if bumped.I do like the release for longer phones and for the width.
5,Having tried several different cell phone holders for my car I finally found this! Not only can I secure the holder in the cup I can maneuver the holder itself to a position that allows me to see the phone screen clearly. No more blocking an air vent to clip on a holder or block my view by sitting on the dash. I really do like this holder!
5,Came as promised and as described.  Fits all my cup holders adjustable!  I use in my car as well as my golf cart. Holds phone securely and easy to remove. Would purchase again.
5,The cell fit nicely and the portion that fit in the cup can secured easily. However the cell phone holder would become detached easily and was annoying. So I used some LOCTITE super glue to correct the problem and seems to be fine now.  You won't be able to detach however there does not seem to be a good reason to do so.
3,I love the idea if it being in the cup holder.  I can’t for the life of me figure out why they made the part that holds the phone come off so easily from the rest of it.  That is a big pain!  My phone is always falling off while still attached to the holder.  Find one that’s all one piece
5,Solid phone holder with an extension. I was initially hesitant as extensions non the past were flimsy. Needed something quick and the price and reviews were good. Completely satisfied with this product. Phone is held snugly lots of options to customize and fit my car.
5,Great price & does what I need. Would recommend.
5,Works well for my needs. A nice place to put my phone in the car. It can reset to a larger size after you squeeze it to fit your phone. So I imagine a lot of phone sizes will fit. Fits my iPhone 10 perfectly.
2,Base of gooseneck is weak and will snap. It is only a plastic socket where the goose k mounts.  It also not study as it Shakes the phone.. i got the phone bracket on the 2nd try when you realize it goes through the holes a d slides down to snap in.. no tools required.. I like how it turned the phone  article and horizontal.  Phone holder jaws protects phone and hold nicely.  The base dial locks the base into the cup holder pretty well.  Jest work on that gooseneck or be very delicate when positioning as not to snap from base..
5,I really like this phone holder for my car. Thank you for a great product.
5,Works great after supergluing the top part
5,Happy with it
5,Tried others but I liked this most.
5,Love it
5,It is an excellent product and just what I need to use cellphone navigation in my car. It works great. It was easy to install and easy to adjust to meet my sight line.
5,This car cup holder is easy to install and is a lot more sturdier. The holder just push the button on the back and you install or lock it in
5,What I was looking for. Great product
5,It fit my cup holder perfectly and holds my phone well. Most of the time I don't even have to fully tight in.Recommend.
5,Nice design
3,I have purchased 3 already and they all have the same problem the screw at the bottom gets undone and the whole thing falls apart. Easy to fix but it should not fall apart that easily in the first place.
3,I only paid $8 had I paid more the rating would be lower and I would have returned it. The device stays in the cup holder no problem but the flexible arm isn't nearly stable enough. My phone bounces around like crazy. Can't even type with the phone in the mount because it moves too much. Oh well it was $8...
4,I took a little getting used too however I really like it.  You can use it horizontal or vertical and it swivels.  Very nice
4,I've tried 4 or 5 different bases. Many of the ones with wireless charging stop working within the first month. I decided to go with this one (without wireless charging) and it works satisfactorily. Good quality. Good value for cost.
5,Easy to install and easy to use. Device’s multiple adjustments a real plus.
4,Great product. No problems. Fit my cup holder and is providing the service that I need.
5,Bought this for my husband because he wanted a weather tech one so I wanted him to try it out before I spent money on that expensive one. Well he was so happy with it I no longer have to hear about the weather tech one. He said it is sturdy and he loves it. Great price too.
5,This phone holder is an awesome inexpensive alternative to the weather tec version. It fits in my cup holder perfectly (‘19 Silverado) and is super sturdy. I don’t notice my phone shaking at all. It’s really easy to adjust for cup holder width and phone size. It also leaves the bottom open so you can still charge your phone while in the holder. Highly recommend.
5,I like the height of the bracket compared to other brands. It is securely mounted and not much vibration. Very happy
5,Love this phone holder!  It was easy to put together and install in my SUV.  The phone stays put and never moves.  Very very impressed with this phone holder.
2,Phone falls off the phone mount bc  the mount will not stay connected to the bottom part.  The gooseneck and the suction part works great but the rest is not working for my phone.  Would not recommend. I have had for several weeks and Have tried everything to make this a worthwhile purchase.
5,Yes
1,The phone holder is rendered useless due to a weak attachment to the gooseneck. It causes the phone holder to swivel at a 180 degree vertical (downward) drop. Tightening the holder to the gooseneck did not help.
5,this design was better than those that you clip into your air vents.  Close enough to see and secure in the cup holder.I really like it.
5,Works great with my phone and in my car!! Really easy to install and use.  You can angle it to suit your taste and move it around.  I'm using it in an older Lexus and it fits great.  Good buy!
5,make sure to turn the portion that holds phone to lock it into place.
1,It comes with little pieces and they fall off I bought it for height and it's not even high I have a GMC Terrain and I wanted the phone to sit there I normally have a vent holder but for the winter it works fine but for the summer when you're using air conditioning it doesn't work right is it blocks the cold air
5,This car phone mount was easy to install and is very adjustable.  I love the gooseneck so that I can have a soda in the other cup holder while my phone is in the phone mount charging.
5,Sturdy item easy to use does not wobble holds phone well
5,Fits securely in cup holder and can hold a heavy phone securely despite thick attachment on the back if the phone case (finger ring holder). Easy and quick phone release.
2,I liked the ability to bend the base in any direction using the flexible neck attachment - WARNING IT IS TOO EASILY BROKEN
5,Fits in the cup holder easily.
5,Item is doing the job it was intended to do.
2,The product is very flimzy I dont recommend buying it
5,° Rare and useful° It is difficult to drive a vehicle to narrow
5,Fit my iPhone 8 Plus and works great in my truck with large cup holders....will buy again
1,Wouldn’t hold my phone. I ended up returning it
1,It shakes a lot while driving honestly I’m only keeping it because it was on a discount and I don’t want to deal with returning but definitely wouldn’t buy or recommend it.
5,I absolutely love this cup phone holder! In fact my family also want to get the same one. Highly recommended
2,Broke after one month.
1,This was a Christmas gift and I thought it was great. WRONG!!!! It made it 6 months before falling apart. All 4 of the plastic tabs broke off. Went to place my phone in the holder and the whole thing fell because all the tabs were broken. I feel that it is made from very low quality material. It’s nothing a little Gorilla Glue could not take care of.
1,I missed when ordering this that it is not wireless....I need a one hand control and do not want to mess with plugging the charger into phone and then into the phone mount...I wish you guys had at added a charger universal outlet or something. I love the design but know in the future will not be happy.
1,Do not like at all.  Clip does not stay on the gooseneck even without the phone.  I had 3 people try to make this work and no one had success.  Would not recommend.  Would like to return item.I bought this surprise gift for my wife in her new car.  Very disappointing to both of us.JC
1,The cradle will not stay on the stand
1,It broke in half after 30 days...
1,It broke in the first week.I am embarrassed I bought some for gifts
1,Foam is coming off.
5,The TOPGO car mount cup holder arrived quickly from the seller and included detailed instructions on how to install and use it. It's perfect for hands-free driving in my Toyota Sienna Minivan.  It fits securely in the cup holder and is both easy to install and convenient to use.  The adjustable base makes it so it can fit into most normal sized cup holders and even includes optional silicone pads that can be attached to the base to make it work in ones that are larger.  The part that holds the phone secures it tightly in place so that there is little or no risk of the phone falling out.  I have a case on my iPhone XR and there is still plenty of room if someone had a thicker wider case or even a pop socket.  The goose neck vibrates a little bit while driving on less than smooth roads but for the most part it it sturdy and is versatile in the way it can be adjusted to nearly any position desired.Over the years I have owned umpteen car phone mounts from the windshield and/or dashboard suction styled ones all the way to the ones you secure via the CD player and heater vents and this one is the one I like best (by far).  It's the simplest to use it doesn't leave a sticky mess on your window or dashboard and seems to be the most secure.  I am very happy with this TOPGO car phone mount and I highly recommend it.
5,Got tired of picking up my window/suction cup holders of the floor of my Genesis. This holder fits in my cup holder and holds my phone where I can see it!!
5,Fits well in my Chevy Cruze.  I used the extra expansion to make the holder fit super strong in the cup.The flexible neck allows me to position the phone for the best fit in the car to avoid the other cup holder and the shift lever.  It's a very well designed device.  I like it because it is sturdy and not liable to be bumped out of position.
5,This is perfect. It locks into the cup holder and doesn’t move at all. The bendable neck makes it easy to set it up to your hand height for complete ease of use while driving. Best one I’ve ever used.
5,Great car cell phone holder.  I really like that it has an adjustable gooseneck and swivels around.  This way when you are using maps on your phone you can  have the phone right where you can see it. Once the base is locked in it does not move around
5,This is very clever.  There is no suction - twist the knob in the middle and the supports extend.  Put into cup holder and tighten.  Holds phone solidly through tension and is well made.  Works great!
5,Easy to adjust to cup holder and fits tight. Gooseneck adjustment is solid and unmoving once set. 360 degree rotation is steady in portrait or landscape orientation. Recommended!
5,Able to charge iPhone while in the holder love it !!
5,I love this phone holder fully adjustable I bought one for my other vehicle.
5,Product works perfectly
5,Use it for holding cell phone while driving.
5,It is a great phone stand for the car cup holder and is quite strong. Thh seller is very helpful and I am completely satisfied with their services
1,The slide arms on the left and right do not work anymore so I can barely get my phone in or out. Would not buy again. Will call Amazon to see about a replacement.
4,It serves its purpose in a tractor trailer cup holder!
5,I tried several holders for cell phone that clip on to the AC vents and they all sucked. They'd constantly loosen and then just fall off the vent sometimes with no warning which was often distracting while driving. Go over a bump and boom the holder comes off. This product is not only 100% stable and secure but the flexible neck allows you to position it perfectly in the car.  It was very easy to install it just goes right into the cup holder and a few turns of a knob tightens it right up. And if you have a very large cup holder it comes with "fillers" that allow a tight stable fit. This is a very well designed product and I love it.
5,Bought this phone holder six months ago. It is very sturdy and opens wide enough to hold my LG style-lo with the protective case on. It fits perfect in my 2007 Lincoln town car 2009 Genesis and My 2011 Chrysler town and country. However it does not work good in my 2010 Escape. The cup holders are too far back making it hard to view the screen no matter what position the driver seat is in. I didn't buy it for my escape so I give it 5 stars.
5,Great product
2,Absolutely love this amazing and easy to install and the bottom just gave out I don’t know if the inside broke but it won’t hold my phone up at all
5,Product is great I love it!!! Works great with my iPhone 8 and my Samsung S8. It protects the phone does not scratch it nor does it fall down and still has room to put a charger.  I took a long trip from Memphis to Chicago in the Mercede cargo van. Know it is in my moms Mitsubishi outlander.Did not scratch phone
5,Like most everything except easily comes apart
4,This is a very well made sturdy product. It has a solid feel and it locks well both into my Honda Ridgeline and my wife's Honda Passport. My only complaint is that the neck needs to be about 4-6 inches longer. I find myself having to look too far down to see the screen.
1,Kept falling down instead of staying waste of money
4,Easy to install and a nice design but the actual phone case the phone sits in does not stay connected to the holder backing piece. I glued the holder backing piece to the holder case.  Now the holder case stays in place.  Hope this helps.
5,I have been looking for one of these for a while. I ordered others and they didn't work returned them. I just got the chance to put this in my car and it works great.
5,Fits great .  Keeps phone at good level to follow map app.
1,Cheap Cheap. Won't hold up under bumpy road. Too flimsy.
5,This is a sturdy holder it'll fit almost any cup holder with the way it expands
5,I like to use Wayz instead of my car's nav and this device holds my phone and allows me to drive hear the directions and talk on my phone all hands free and visually available.  The gooseneck is well designed.
5,I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my son.  He picked this item & put this on his list.
5,I’m very happy with the phone holder I can glance at the phone and see who’s calling.it stands sturdy and convenient for me. I bought it as an open box who ever returned it was out of their mind. I love it it’s a great product.
2,I got this as a gift not the brand i wanted. This one fits and works ok but to tall and bulky. Gets in the way when i try to reach for my drink or use control panel.
5,I had purchased another manufacturer's cup holder for iPhones.  It was fine; however it would not hold my iPhone 7 with an Otterbox case securely.  Problem solved with this purchase.  The iPhone and Otterbox case now fit securely in my cupholder!!
5,Excellent car phone holder. I use it everyday and it the phone stays nice and secure in the holder.
3,Loved the color but it was too jiggly with my phone. Also the bendable part separated too easily from base. Returned and bought Togo holder with adjustment on upright piece. It was solid
5,When I travel I need to see cell for my bluetooth calls and more I don't have to worry about losing my phone in the car it's always now in this.  THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE ORDER IN A LONG TIME
5,Easy to use has goose neck for added bisibility
5,Funcionan para carro grande tipo camioneta en auto pequeños queda incómodo con la palanca de cambios
5,Gifted two people with it . They live it! Won’t lose your phone to floor board in car.
5,Easy to adjust to cup holder diameter for song sure installation
5,It I probably the best phone holder. I thought I would not like it but was wrong. Yes you lose a cup holder but takes seconds to remove if need be.
5,Easy to install securely adjusted properly to my phone size (note10) wiggles on bumps hasn't moved out of place or dropped my phone once.
3,This mobile mount is used my car cub holder. After fixed my mobile I can’t able to plug my charging cable. Every time I need to adjust plug it .
1,This thing is garbage. Every time you take the phone out of the vice that piece falls off. It’s straight garbage. Do not buy!
5,This is the perfect phone holder for me and my car.  The phone is up high enough and doesn't block anything I need to reach quickly.  I love it!
5,Great value for the price. Quality product and installs easily unlike the pricey name-brand items that involve extra steps just to fit into your car cup holder.
1,They don't accept refunds on this item so purchase at your own risk
5,I like the quick rotation of the knob to tighten and loosen the holder to transfer to another car quickly. Very stable and can be adjusted quickly and easily .
5,Love how easy these fit in the cup holder!  Sturdy & did the trick of holding the cellphone upright!!!
5,Absolutely fantastic! Love how it is fully adjustable to any cup size and the flexible portion is very adjustable yet once it’s in place it doesn’t move.
5,Holds phone well. Easy to install.Good value for the price.
5,Easy install and sizing adjustment. I like that it’s taller than some mounts I drive a larger SUV and easier to reach. I would definitely recommend.
2,The holder falls off the stand every time I take the phone out it's annoying and I am sure it will break soon I would not recommend it.
5,Extremely easy to install. Very sturdy. The neck does wobble slightly while driving but holds the phone securely and I’m not using the phone while driving so the wobble does not affect me at all. The base is very secure. Took me less than 30 seconds to put it together and install it. Overall I would rate this is a great product.
4,This is a great buy. It's sturdy and easily assembled.
1,The top part of phone holder is to click on to the base but the little prongs or whatever they are called are too small the it top just sits on it. If you hit a bump or something then the phone flies off and the thing falls apart because it doesn't snap into place.
5,Works great
5,Each of our three cars have different sizes of cup holders and the adjustments worked perfectly. The bendable neck makes it possible to put your phone where YOU want it.
4,Chinese made better than American made “cup phone” at 1/3 the price sorry to say.
5,works great  versital
5,Nothing to dislike works as advertised
2,Smaller for my car cup hole
5,My son has this product and highly recommended it I love it😊
5,Quality item. Makes the phone accessible and easy to reach. Great customer service
5,This is exactly what I wanted to safely and securely hold my phone. Much sturdier than I thought it would be.
5,Easy to install in a Toyota Sienna.
5,went together easily per instructions
5,Great product - as described. Timely arrival.
4,Work s.  Does what I expected
5,Works well.
5,Love this!!! I have been looking high and low for a phone holder. This is the perfect fit. Now my phone don’t have to bounce all over the place.
5,Nothing sticks my dash I don't have room for anything to hang from the car vents anything suctioned to my window gets in the way of seeing traffic!  I didn't want to pay a lot of money but really needed something to hold my phone where I could see the map in my car.  This is great.  Really sturdy over bumps grips tightly in cupholder makes best use of space I can't really use otherwise!  So happy I found and purchased this!
5,Good value and holds phone fine.
5,Item as described by seller easy to use and fits snug in cup holder. Prevents phone from sliding around in your car. I highly recommend this cup holder phone mount.
1,The phone holder is easy fall off
5,Worth the money and so convenient.
5,The cup holder in my vehicle is a bit shallow so I tried a few of the phone holders but they were too tall to actually hold the phone sturdy. This item is the perfect height for the cup holder and without using the extensions provided fit the cup holder. The next is sturdy enough and can be bent to your desired angle. The phone holder is great because it has width and length controls for a bigger phone.
5,This is a versatile car mount especially if you change cars frequently. The system that holds the mount in place is very convenient and reliable.
5,You won’t be disappointed
5,Works Great and is very stable in the cup holder...very works well.
5,Allows hands free phone use
5,This product fits well and easy to install.
5,Fits great and stays sturdy
5,Does exactly what I needed it too.
5,One of the best things ive bought
5,This phone holder is easy to use and does the job.  It fits snugly in the cup holder with no problems.It's also easy to release the phone with a push of a button on the back of the holder.
4,none
5,Just what I needed!! Works great!! Would buy again.
5,It’s a really great product it works good.
5,It was a gift they love it
5,Buen producto muy recomendado
5,It’s nice and good for traveling
4,A little but abs hard to adjust but overall great.
5,Product came as advertised fit my truck cup holder easily and does the job. Would recommend.
5,Installation was simple what really sold me on it was the sturdiness and how this product can hold my iPhone 13 pro max so easily and it’s functioning perfectly!
5,Love it
2,Love the way this fits and can be tightened in the cup holder. However the top part that actually holds the phone does not connect to the base securely. It sometimes falls off by accidentally bumping it with your hand.
2,to start with the unit was put in an expedition --  for what ever reason the coffee holders are oversized ---this required the "extensions"  --- put it in  turned to tighten and it pretty much fell apart.  not wanting to return it i took it apart.  the base plus the threaded unit for the extension arms are held by a rod down the center culminating in a small threading ---- holding the whole thing together along with a lock nut -- the nut locking plastic failed --  tried using locktight - nope - replaced with a brass nut and held with glue and melted nylon --- -  it worked but i really do not believe had it worked out of the box it would have held up for any length of time
5,I read a very few reviews on this product that expressed some concerns about attaching the cell phone holder to the goose neck and locking their phone onto the device. I found it to be easy to install and operate.  The adjustable base fits smaller to larger cup holders.  It holds my phone securely and steady in any position that I put it.  It is very sturdy.  In summary it is an excellent low cost reliable device that does exactly what it is advertised to do.
5,I’m like
4,Great sturdy phone holder for my Samsung note 20 ultra. It's very easy to install and  very sturdy. The only reason that I didn't give 5 starsis that the goose neck bracket does not click in place nor does the phone holder stay on the goose neck bracket. I am going to super glue the goose neck bracket to the phone holder so it does not keep coming off.
5,I bought this for my wife’s car. It fit in her cup holder of her Chevy Cruz car. It can be adjusted in so many ways and it fits her iPhone 13 pro.
5,None
5,Para mi trabajo en la calle.
5,I like the look the ease of installation and the function
5,This product is even better than they say it is. It is perfect.  You have The ability to adjust the size so that it fits perfectly into your cupholder. It is so sturdy it doesn’t move after you fit it…I have had every different type of cell phone holder and either they  fall of my windshield or on your dash they make it makes the phone so hot from the sun that it stops working and you have to pull it out of that and hold it in front of the air-conditioning. I live in Florida and finding the right cell phone holder has been a mission my mission is accomplished….
5,This is a great product and works great.
5,Just received and installed. Very sturdy and easy to put together. The flexible arm is very strong and tight which is good for holding its place. My only complaint and it’s not really a big deal it can be bouncy and shaky going done the road…but I fixed that by doubling over the arm because I didn’t need it fully extended….so far I like it.
5,Setup is very easy. Works great in all types of cup holders.
5,StrongEasy to useKeeps phone exactly where you want it
5,This was easy to assemble and fits perfectly in our golf cart.  My husband loves it.  So easy to see the map on his phone for directions to the golf courses.  No holding and fumbling with the phone while driving.
5,I had been thinking about buying one of these holders for some time especially for traveling when you need to see maps on the phone. I settled on the Topgo based on other reviews. I would say this is a very well made product especially for the price. Seems to work great!
1,It’s always falling off. It annoys when it does that every time I use them.
5,Love it!  Perfect for me! My son uses his gift 24/7!!!!! Ordered a second one as Holiday gift!
5,Fits any cup holder. Holds my S20 in Otter Defender case with no problems.
5,I have tried other air-vent-attached phone holders that I ended up tossing. This one holds either of my cell phones securely (one is larger than the other). It's so easy to put the phone in the holder and remove it. When it's not in use the arms that securely hold the phone contract.  Even hitting potholes and speed bumps don't jar the phone lose. And by using the air vent the phone is in a perfect spot for me. I fnd windshield mounted ones annoying because it's kind of in my field of vision. I'm sold on this one.
4,Be more sturdy around the holder part.
5,I like this holder.. it just fits into the regular cup holder and it does not require much
5,Perfect for my need
5,I use this phone  cup  holder for work and personal use! Very sturdy at work because I am in different vehicles and cup holders are different sizes. This phone holder coverts easily in whatever cup size it needs to fit in! Love that flexibility! I recommend!!
5,I’m officially an old person and I installed this quickly and easily. It holds my phone where I can charge it and see it if I need to and it doesn’t go flying if I make a quick stop. Love it!
5,I liked this alot.. very great product..
5,Own three of these.
5,Works as described. Fits snugly in the cup holder. No complaints. Buy it.
5,This product worked great for my needs. I use it in a 2013 dodge ram pick up. I’m able to put my phone in the holder and swivel it between driver and passenger to assist with navigation. It was easy to install and was a great value compared to some of the name brands that sell the exact same thing.
5,Great product
5,Yes
5,Good product. Easy to install place phone in and get phone out. The only thing I don’t like is it’s tall so it kind of gets in the way when I need to grab something from passenger seat due to placement of cup holder. Otherwise wonderful product
5,I owned the American made BIG BUCK alternative and while i always prefer to buy from the USA this product is a solid alternative for those that need to save the $
5,second one...even wife likes it...flexible...right price
5,Easy to install.  I had to use the provided cup expanders and it fit perfectly.  Great phone holder.  Very sturdy and easy to see and use.
5,You can't beat quality for the money. As nice if not nicer then units twice the money.
5,I gifted thus and she Loves it !!!!
5,Holds firmly in place and adaptable to other size cup holders
5,Installation was easy. Nothing was complicated.  The base fits solidly with vertical blocks if needed for larger cup holders.  The actual phone holder expands so that phones that are protected in “cases” can also accommodate the phone and it’s case.I am writing this review after using this Car Phone Holder for my iPhone  several days in different ways:  using maps my phone lets me know who’s calling and I can easily Alexaa question.  All of this can’t happen if my phone isn’t displayed and my view will not be obstructed as one that sits on the front of the dashboard.  Best of all my app provided by my insurance will not say I’m using my phone and my view will not be obstructed by a dashboard phone holder.I would recommend this product!
5,fit cup holder as marketed
5,Works well.
5,It makes life easy no more cell phone falling off my lap or the console
5,I’ve had a number of these kinds of products over the years and this one is by far the best. Sturdy easy to install and use right height. Highly recommend.
5,Es muy fácil de instalar y se ajusta perfectamente al porta vasos.
3,I don’t like it but it was for the position of the phone not for my type of car.
5,Works great!
5,Stays in place. The cup holder adjustments to make it fit are perfect. Perfect height. The holder for the phone is easy to open and close. I love it.
5,I have been looking for a product that would work with my Apple battery charging case finally found this one and it really works well.  It holds my phone with the case on and allows me to hook into my CarPlay and be hands free.  Highly recommend.
5,Gift for husband.  Definitely depends on the location of your cup holder.  My husband loves his.
5,Works great sturdy and the price was excellent
5,My husband drives a handicap transport truck. He had no place to set his. The cup holders was to far. He said this makes things much easier and it's convenient. He said great purchase!
5,This phone holder works great on my Chrysler Town and Country. It is sturdy and holds the phone at the angle I select. It also rotates 360 degrees so I can go from portrait mode to landscape easily.
5,Exceeded my expectations works well
5,This does what other cup phone holders do for less than half the money. Very happy so far.
5,I use this to hold my phone for navigation while on my route. It is sturdy and adjustable to phone size . It works great for my purposes.
5,Seems well built. Fits cupholder well.
5,Love all the different angles 🙂 I have a stick shift and I have options with this product. Super Simple EasyPeasy install & SOLID STABILITY...THANK YOU ..Will DEFINITELY be some Christmas Buying💯
5,I have a Galaxy Z Fold 3 which is a thick phone when folded. The cradle works perfectly for it. There is some wobble because of the gooseneck extension mast but the holder stays secure in the cup holder. Keep in mind that this is probably the heaviest phone on the market. I am particular about how I expect these types of items to perform and this didn't disappoint. Perfect for my needs!
4,I just wish the flexible arm was longer. Then I'd have more room.
5,It's perfect exactly what I wanted.  As long as it holds up (breaking seems to be the top complaint) then this is so worth the cost.
5,Nice
5,Easy to use and very stable and attractive 👌
5,Work great easy to use fits great
1,It broke after 3 months! Maybe got too hot inside of the car.
4,This was exactly what I wanted but my cup holders fold up into the dash and this would not work. Not the products problem this is my cat's problem.  So sad :-(
5,Fits great and allows for easy access and great visibility to my phone and screen!!
5,Fits tight and holds phone steady.
5,Bought for boyfriend’s birthday and he loves it.
5,Facil de usar
5,N/A
5,Easy to install.
5,Perfect fit for my wife SUV Mercedes GLE350
5,It is the most durable and functioning cell phone car holder I have ever purchased. I am glad I purchased it.
5,I like them  they will do what I expect from them ...handle them with care  bend them with two hands  slowly ...they stand high ..placed right in the holder they will not move around ...not a toy for the kids they will break  its mechanical ...if they do break because you broke it ...so be careful.. Thank you
3,stiff
5,Fit my larger cup holder very sterdy
5,Easy to adjust.  I can use it in my car or move it to a golf cart.  Very sturdy.
5,works well. Gave it to my step dad and he really enjoys it.
5,I was looking at the really expensive brand but just couldn’t bring myself to pay over $60  to hold a phone in my car. This works perfectly. Easy to install easy to release the phone from the holder
5,I loved this cup holder mount in my mustang.  I used it for over a year until I decided I was tired of sacrificing 1/2 of my cup holders for this so I eventually went a different route.  Held up well in the southern summer heat as it’s made of a lot of rubber pieces.  I had slight problems with the clamping device after a year but c’mon is that really a problem at all after 1 year 😂 I still have it as a backup.
5,I was worried the neck wasn’t going to be rigid enough to hold my phone in place in my bouncy truck. It holds firm both in the couple and what ever angle I adjust the phone to.
4,This product is great quality.  However there is one small design flaw—the side clamp release button is at the top of the rear.  It should be near the bottom so the phone can be removed easily.  Otherwise great quality.  Hopefully they change the design in a future model.
3,this is a great concept needs some improvement tho. the little "hand" that holds the phone will not stay on the "arm". if you bump it it disconnects and falls off. i'm going to keep it and super glue/velcro/hot glue the "hand" to the "arm" and hopefully that will work. it does fit in the cup holder tho.......  i cannot at this time recommend this item
5,Easy to install adjustable and sturdy !
5,I’ve had a hard time finding phone holders that fit with a pop socket and this one does!! It is moveable and sturdy. The only downside is it wakes away a cup holder.
5,Good item
5,love it and im buying another one for my grandson  5 stars for sure
5,This phone holder does exactly what I want.  It puts my phone where it is accessable yet not in my way or distracting while I'm driving.  After 6 months i had trouble with it so I contacted customer service who quickly responded with a voucher for a replacement.  I'm very happy with the product the price and the customer service.
5,What i like abot it is it hold my phone good in my car
5,Quality cup holder very durable and shipped right away.
5,Fits great works great -- no problems
4,Fits securely in center console cup holder. Overall position is dependent on the layout of the vehicle.For everyday use I prefer a "wallet" style phone case which needs to be removed to secure the phone in a side-clamp holder like this. A top-to-bottom clamp would allow me to leave the wallet case open on the phone without removing.
5,it works
5,fits all the cup holders firmly in my 2008 Tundra.  Got my iphone 6s in there.
5,Great
5,Waa good till yesterday phone holder broke off  so now I have it in 2 pieces.
5,This one works! 1st one was similar but the grips didn’t hold my large sell phone very well and the grips were hard to adjust. Grips work smoothly on this one and the cup part expands fairly and per entry with ratchet.
5,It’s a good stuff
5,At first I was skeptical but once I put it in the car I was sold. It works securely and is a great value for the price.
5,Excellent purchase for the price. Easy to assemble. Simple to use. The best features are the easy to reach side clamp release button (located on the backside near the top) the adjustable sliding cradle that adjusts to the length of your standard size phone and the multi positional extension arm. Item is also very sturdy.
1,first time i used this it came loose and dropped under my brake pedal  useless piece of junk
5,Great phone holder
5,This was a really easy to use product. I just popped it into my car turned the base to adjust the side and it's been very reliable.
5,The holder fits perfectly as it should in the cupholder slot. It’s secure is very firmly. It works very well to hold either the iPhone or a GPS.
5,Perfect height easy adjustment. Keeps phone above gear shift and room for bottle of water in adjacent cup holder.
5,The best cell phone cup holder mount! No shaking or wobbling!! The flexible Adjustable Goose-neck gives you the best angle best position and is easy to adjust to the view you want.
4,I've tried two or three phone holders  for my car this is the best by far.
5,Fit perfectly in cup holder and the flexible arm is great
5,Excellent Product.There is Vibration while Typing in the Holder but this is Hands free.
5,My husband loves this it's perfect what more can I say very sturdy and fits in cupholder and holds his phone which he can view easily
5,It fits just right
5,Very good quality
5,We have an 'older' Odyssey that has a pullout and console cup holder spaces.  This fit any of them.  The pullout has  an expandable feature I was worried would cause the holder to flip but it fits perfectly when I use  the adapter feet.  So far the goose neck has allowed the phone to face the passenger seat also.  I don't know about longevity but it's a great start.
3,I was excited to get this for use in my car. I do a fair amount of driving and use my cell phone regularly for directions. This seemed like a great solution. Unfortunately the unit locked up and it cannot be resized for use in my other vehicle. Not sure how it happened but overall I would have to say that it is just poorly built. I would look elsewhere if I were you!
5,We bought 2 of this we have one on my car Love it! It hold my phone and its not to high or to low and my husband took the other one to his boat and he loved too. Really recommend.
5,The only problem I see is that the holder not secured well to gooseneck. I just placed double adhesive and now works great
5,easy to install. looks great in car. holds phone -- no issues a t all.
5,this fits well in a cup holder and expands in a bigger one. Works great!!
5,Very easy to install in your cupholder. No suction needed. All you to is twist the base and it extends the bottom extensions to fit your holder. Add a buffer included in package so it secures the holder snugly. I really liked that you can push 2 or 3 of the extenders in so that it fits nicely.
5,Works as promised.  Nice snug fit in my cup holder (did not need to use the extenders).  Very sturdy and solved issue of where to put my phone for easy access.
5,The whole family got one for Christmas well not the Mother-in-law. Users love them? Great fit of phone and cup holder adjustment!
5,The quality on this holder is great and it is very versatile.
5,The material and make is sturdy enough. Easy to install and the stem is long enough that the phone is high enough to read the phone. The phone is easy to release with the use of a button at the back of the holder.
5,This cup holder fit both our GPS and iPhone. I assembled it in less than 10 seconds. The bumpers on the sides securely fit in the universal cup holder in our vehicles.
5,so my wife keeps her hands on the steering wheel
5,Works good and it seems sturdy. I have had three different models in this one definitely seems to be the most heavy duty. Don’t get a cheaper one. Just buy this and save yourself the hassle.
5,This product is the best! I use it everyday for work as I deliver items. So easy to set up great quality and the depth is perfect for all cases. It is a total game changer in my day!!
5,Survived a 20 hour journey and fit well in the cup holder of my 2015 Toyota Camry.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Utile
5,Has a sturdy feel and seems durable. Although I have only had it for a week.
5,Bon produit solide et facile à installer.
5,I first came across cup holder - phone holder products on Weathertech website and almost bought their expensive product but this cheaper alternative from TopGo turned out to offer more value for the money. I am impressed with the workmanship.
4,Wasn’t what expected had another one in my truck prior and was amazing and cheaper this one is just to flimsy and not what expected
4,Pretty good value but if your cup holder is slightly bigger use the spacers first. I adjusted the base bigger by turning the ring and now it won’t go smaller or larger. Seems to be stripped but still fits.
4,Bon produit somme toute mais il y a déjà un côté du support qui n’ouvre pus bien après 2 semaines d’utilisation.
5,This is a very well built  very sturdy works great
4,Sturdy designfits multiple sizes of phoneswould highly recommendit fits very securely in the cup holder.
5,Lookfeel solid easy to install
5,Good quality. Fits phone with case on it too
5,Very good thanks
4,Mounts easily in cup holder. Tried in a couple different sizes. The base is solid. The phone moves around as gooseneck is not stable when vehicle in motion
3,Not the Best Buy with an iPhone 12 max with a cover. Too expensive
1,First it came a used item. And it looks very cheap.  Definitely not worth $30+. The mechanism is super simple although the seller presented an impression with some high-end technology. You can definitely get a substitute with much lower price.
1,All I can say is they could’ve done way way better. Instead of the price asking for it 👎🏽
1,Bought 2tim3s but same problem. It breaks after several adjustment. Try the other model. It's cool
5,I would have taken a picture with my phone in it but I didn't have anything else to take a picture with lol!!! Very easy to put together feels well made super sturdy.  I like the release button on the back all around it seems pretty good.
5,I was looking for a cup holder phone mount as sometimes during a drive I need to take calls via the company phone system that the car won't pick up.  The WeatherTech CupFone was the one I was looking at originally but was turned off by the price construction and sturdiness of the unit.  This unit is much simpler and sturdier at less than half the price!  The neck holds the phone without issue.  The quick release button on the back makes it easy to unlock the mount to pull the phone out.  Good quality product!
4,Pros:- Very easy to install- Pretty sturdy- Doesn't fit well in my rectangular-ish cup holders (2005 Toyota Highlander) but would work well for circular cup holders- Good valueCons:- The gooseneck is way too short. I have to look really far down at my phone when I use it which isn't safe while driving. A windshield or dashboard mount will be a lot safer.Does what it's supposed to do but I don't recommend it.
4,This holder is very easy to install and is quite sturdy and holds my cell phone in its case easily. Has met all my needs my only thing is wish was that that the goons neck was a bit longer as in my car the cup holder is lower so when installed I have to look down more then I prefer to see the phone so if I'm driving I just need to be careful but other then that it's great. I had bought the type of cell phone holder that mounts into the dash and found the configuration of my cars dash board a Honda Civic coupe wasn't the best for that type of holder I could use it but the cup holder type is much better for me.
5,Have it mounted in my 4Runner.  On road.  Off road.  No worries.  My iPhone 7 stays firmly in place.  Easy to reach over and release phone one handed when it’s time to go.  It swivels and gives you a landscape or portrait mode depending on your needs.  Perfect.  Five stars.
5,Easy to fit in the car & you can use it with or without the case on your phone. Mine is one of those thick closeable cases that holds credit cards and it has plenty of room without fussing but the phone never budges. So happy with this purchase.
5,I've always had many issues and challenges with car mounts for my Samsung Note which also comes equipped with a relatively rugged case which result in the combo being pretty heavy. Tried the magnet based and air vent clip based mounts with not much success in the past. But this mount that sits solidly in the cup holder is very sturdy and for once I'm feeling very comfortable with the way my smartphone is mounted and accessible by the driver.One thing to note: if you are adamant that you need 2 cup holders between the driver and the front passenger than this solution could be a problem as it would take up one of them. Not a real problem for me.
4,Had this a few months. But now when putting phone in it will not stop up right. No way to tighten up swivel mechanism
5,Great product quality quick shipping and easy installation.  My coffee cup holder isn't exactly in the right location to make this holder perfect but better than any vent holder solution.
5,This is a replacement of another cup holder I had and right off the bat i find this to be a much better design.Easy to install holds the phone nice and snug the release button on the back is easily accessible.
5,This phone holder is perfect for larger phones in a case. I have a Samsung S20+ which I keep in a phone case. This phone holder is able to hold my phone upright without it falling out while driving on all kinds of roads.
1,Material is not flexible
1,I’m car for my phone slip off  and NOT sturdy
5,Perfect for me. I don't like the dashboard or vent clip ones. This one is so sturdy despite the flexible neck. Great value for money. Just as described on Amazon.
1,I wanted to like this I live the concept but the part that holds the phone does not secure to the neck to secure it in place.
5,I use this to replace my vent holder for my phone. It works great however in my F150 it is a little awkward position either too low on the floor or a little too high in the armrest
1,Work well for one month then broke when tightening in cupholder.
1,Worse build quality. Broken after 3 months. Does not worth the money. Does not worth the money due to poor quality
5,A natural position to keep the phone. I’m now truly hands free while driving.  Love it bought another one for our other car.
5,Great price works great too
5,This works great  I use it to hold my snow plow controller in my truck. Love it cause no drilling or making up my console  when the snow is gone I can put it away with my controller and I'm back to original.
5,Brought this as a gift and it works great. Holds the phone firmly in place and the height is perfect.  Going to purchase one for myself. Would recommend. Very durable.
3,Very sturdy and it delivered exactly what it said.  The only problem that I have with it:  the neck is too short.  When I installed it in my car cupholder I had to look under my arm and down.  Not ideal when driving. I've swiveled the head to change positions but it is a compromise.
5,Vraiment satisfait du support facile à installer et robuste  Bonne hauteur et bonne visibilité du téléphone
5,Great product fit 2014 Ford Edge large cup holder perfect without the extra spacers. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 fits with leather case fits holder with no issues. Phone sits at the same height as the gear shift for great view of the phone.
3,This product advertised that it works for all Samsung phones however the bracket is half the width of the phone! It works well for a more narrow phone but the company lied when they said it fits Samsung phones.
5,Item arrived in good undamaged condition and ahead of expected date. Strong base and top that grips the phone firmly without loosening on its own. Adjustable width and height that works smoothly. The holder has a padded back as well as the top and sides to secure your phone and protect it against scratches. Happy with my purchase.
4,the holder for the phone did not seem strong enough or snapped in good enough
5,Love it’s flexibility as to its anchoring to cup holder.  Took 10 seconds to place.  Great buy
5,Happy with my purchase
1,Won’t recommend
5,Works perfectly in my 2020 Mazda3.  So far the mount seems study and barely moves even when we go over bumps in my car.  Will update this review if the quality begins to deteriorate.
5,Très facile à installer et parfait pour mon iPhone 11
5,I have been struggling to find a phone holder that actually fits my phone in its case (iphone 7s) where I don't need to struggle to get it in or get it out. This product fits that bill! It is easy to install has a great range for where the phone can be and overall is exactly what I needed!
3,As advertised just too expensive
5,This thing is perfect! Easy to install works like they claim and makes things simple. I can adjust it as needed. Much easier and safer to take hands-free callas and follow map directions. If you think you need one get it!
3,Je l’utilise dans ma voiture mais comme je dis la tête qui doit tenir le téléphone est très facile à tomber
5,The media could not be loaded.
2,We used this product for the past few months and had no issue. Today however the bottom joint let go and it doesn’t stand upright anymore.
2,Impossible to mount cup holder so that I could move the gear shift stick from Park to reverse to drive and still see the phone screen in the folder without taking my eyes off the road - very dangerous
5,I have tried to six different types of holders for my vehicles and none I found satisfactory. I had a very long drive planned and executed about two months ago from Toronto to Vancouver and found that even though I have updated the GPS on my Mercedes-Benz E350 WAZE was more accurate for navigating and traffic updates. Feel for immediate a hold of for my new Samsung note 10 to the Uber to use it and drive at the same time. This was perfect my only two criticisms of it as follows. Number one I wish they articulating arm was a bit longer for some vehicles and also since I was doing a lot of driving it would have been nice to have the extra cupholder for extra drinks or bottles within arms reach for the long ride. Overall there is not much to criticize especially in view of the price.
5,Very easy to install and priced correctly
5,With this unit you never have to worry about the suction cup giving way or your phone being too heavy.  My Galaxy Note 9 with heavy duty case is no problem for this holder.
5,Works well!
4,When I have time I need to find how I can keep my coat arm from catching on it and pulling it off
5,Je suis camionneur et cest celui que je trouve le mieux pour dans un camion et l'avoir a porter  et tiens tres bien
5,Easy to install and sturdy. Good product  would buy again. Works as described.
1,Le bidule qui tient le cellulaire ne tient pas bien sur la tige! Nous allons probablement juste le coller!
4,Simple Easy to install Does what it was meant to do.
5,One of the best mobile holders . Good value for the money .
5,Works great for my phone
5,Works great and much less expensive than the heavily advertised one.  Also it is anchored securely as you can crank up the tension on the base so it doesn't swing around.
2,Flimsy attacmet parts which cannot hold the phone.
1,Not satisfied. Not what I was looking for.
5,reste a voir dans le temps
5,the fit is perfect and easy to install
5,Very comfortable and easy to install 😌
5,Great price. Fast shipping. Will fit my cell booster behind my phone with case on.
4,Sturdy fits well easy to install. Unfortunately it is not the perfect size for a 2013 Ford Edge but it still works.
4,… et vibre en roulant. Quand à la solidité elle me semble raisonnable.
4,This product worked great was very happy with the length and the strength
5,Great purchase great price & works great.
4,It does exactly what it is supposed to do.
3,don't try andusethis for your GPS as it doesn't fit well
4,Loved the product. Easy to install and use. It did exactly what was advertised.Only criticism is the neck could be a little longer
3,I couldn't get the suction cups to stick to my Pilot dashboard. Tried the CD version but it  leave the phone high enough up.  This gets the phone to a similar level of the radio screen which is nice.However the phone definitely 'vibrates' as driving - the arm is good but not as good as the suction cup.  Stable enough for me.
5,Perfect fit and good design for Toyota Sienna 2021
5,Nice quality
4,Love it
5,Perfect for my husband's truck
4,Sent back ordered wrong product
5,Given as a Christmas gift..
1,It will not fit into any of my cars. Not practical. Keeps falling off.
5,I'm happy with it. The extra pads are handy.
5,Was a little skeptic based on some of these reviews turns out this thing is awesome! Will never get anything else again. Works amazing in my 2016 GMC Sierra crew cab truck!
2,Good product but I found that I didn't like giving up a cup holder for my phone. I prefer it on dashboard.Product is sturdy and good price.
5,Works perfect
5,Received order quickly! Installed in 2 minutes! Looks very good!  Great hold on my new IPhone 12 Pro Max. Let’s see in the following months if the durability is there 👍
3,Conducteur routier j'ai souvent besoin de mon tel portée de main c'est l'idéal produit conforme à la description en revanche au niveau de la stabilité c'est très moyen car quand on roule le téléphone vibre énormément on doit maintenir le support pour utiliser le téléphone....donc 3 étoiles à l'arrêt support stable.... j'espère que mon avis pourra orientez de futur acheteur
5,The holder works well in a golf cart to prove easy access to a cell phone to view golf course yardage.
5,Easy to place in holder. Can be seen in a glance. Simple and easy to remove.
5,Great gadget! Use it in the vehicles and in the golf cart. It’s so easy to adjust to fit any cupholder and the phone stays where you put it - it’s a fabulous design!
5,Strong and very useful product.
2,Very cheaply made product lasted 6hour... base is too weak to hold a phone tightly.The plastic part broke.
5,Great quality exactly what I needed
4,So far so good.
1,Broke on my first trial...
5,This broke 3 days after I received it.
5,Really good product! Ordered a second one  after using the first one.This is the only phone holder that actually stays in place in my rough riding Semi truck.
5,Great. I love it.
5,I HAVE IT IN MY TRUCK IT WORK'S REALLY GOOD
5,I bought it for my husband who is a truck driver he loves it !
5,delivery done as guaranteed  -  beter delivery than Joey Co - who is always late
5,Very sturdy
3,Unit is very tall and gets in the way
5,Did a modification and added my booster to it...worked good!
5,Good 👍
5,Pour la voiture
5,Very good
5,I ordered 4 for my fleet.
5,Put it in the car yesterday...fit well..the adjustable neck is great..so far it is a yes yes
5,Excellent
3,It’s very flimsy
5,Cool piece just not so sturdy the top part
5,Excellent
5,A good quality item  easy to install and sturdy
5,Came on time. Easy installation. Brings my GPS closer to me. Thanks.
5,I work for UPS Canada and use this daily. It’s a amazing phone mount.
5,J en ai acheté 2 parfait également pour poids lourd
5,Fits Perfect.
5,Does what it is supposed to do
5,easily.
5,Parfait
5,works good
3,About all I can say is it's ok. Not quite as flexible as I'd hoped; as a consequence the cradle doesn't quite sit straight (which annoys me). The cup holder aspect is good and sturdy but if you want to either remove it or re-position it it's a nightmare to try and remove. Mine doesn't unscrew/loosen.
4,しっかりと固定できます。アームの長いタイプもあると良いですね。
5,Only have positive feedback product description spot on fits my cup holder perfectly very sturdy I have an iPhone 8 Plus so a little heavier than most phones but this holds it doesn’t even wobble when drivingJust make sure you cup holder isn’t shallowIf a costa cup fit this will too ( other coffees available)
1,Very flimsy only lasted 6 months then fell apart
4,いいと思います。スマホおく台座は確かに外れやすいですが、走行中外れたりはしません。しっかり固定できてますし、台座裏のスマホ離脱ボタンもいい感じです。自分は８０系ハリアーにつけております。センターコンソール部分の運転席側フォルダーにシフトとハンドルに邪魔ならんようちょどよくはまってます。運転席側Aピラー近くの送風口に純正オプションのフォルダーもつけてます。そこにもこの製品まっちします。その場合は、スマホ装着した際スマホ頭がAピラーにぶつからぬような調節です。スマホ取るときは、台座裏着脱ボタンがかなり優秀に仕事してくれます。あらゆる調節時に、この製品のフレキシブルアーム部分を力入れてぐいぐい調節するのですが硬いので結構力が必要なのです。でもこれはこの製品の安定感を得るにはこのくらい硬いのは妥当だと思います。
1,Il collo è appena la metà di quanto indicato.Neck is not even half of the advertised length.
4,NOTE e-Powerのドリンクホルダに取り付けました。車内が兎に角狭い上にスマホを覗ける場所に置けませんでしたが、ほぼ考えていた場所にスマホを置くことが出来ました。また、手や足に当たる事も有りますが、通常走行中はシフトノブに触りませんので慣れると問題ありません。更にスマホをロックする爪の高さが有るので、薄型のワイヤレスチャージャーを載せて、更に上にスマホを置けます。（実はこれがやりたかった）滑り止めの有るチャージャーでしたらロックなしでもスマホは飛んで行きません。他のレビューのも有りますが、多少の揺れは有りますが大きく揺れませんので許容範囲です。フレキシブルバーとホルダの接合部は緩いので、接合時に養生テープを貼りました。
3,全体的な品質には満足しています。ただスマフォホルダに運転中に手が当たってしまうとすぐに外れてしまう。もう少しキッチリ嵌まるような工夫が欲しい。
4,車にゴチャゴチャと色々装着したく無くて考えていた所、この様な製品がある事を知りました。この製品のいい所はシガーソケットから最短で装着できて、ワンタッチでスマホの脱着が出来る所です。ただこの製品自体にUSBソケットが付いてれば充電ケーブルも短くて済むのでそうなれば星五つでも良かったと思います。
4,うまくカップに収まりました。ワイヤー軸部がもっと自在に動けばいいですね。
4,自分の車では、最大に幅を広げても少し接着が弱いような
3,Il prodotto non è male peccato che non sia utilizzabile sulla mia Fiat Tipo da fastidio al cambio
4,アバルト595用に購入しましたが問題無く装着出来ました。カップホルダーが大きい車の為のアタッチメントも付属しています。アバルトはサスが固く振動はかなり有り、iPhone11Pro Maxという重量級のスマホを使ってるのですが振動で外れる事も無く快適に使えてます。ちなみに純正レザーケースに入れて使ってます。問題点を挙げるとすればアンクランプのボタンがトップ裏に有るので少々押し辛いです。しかし総じて満足してますし快適に使えてます。
3,アーム部分ががっちりしていい。もう少し長さがあればなお良かった。
4,現行型アルファードの運転席右前のカップホルダー（つかいづらい場所なのでカップホルダーとしては使用していませんでした）にはめ込んでいます。タイトルどおりぐらつかず固定は良好です。ただし、非常に固定が良好のため、スマホをはずすときは背面のスイッチを押してサイドバーを広げないとスマホが当然外せません。片手では難しいです。それ以外は完璧です
4,セットが簡単に出来た。
3,Pratico  ma purtroppo le coperture in silicone con la pressione tendono a staccarsi e quindi scivola via
5,以前は吸盤でダッシュボードに貼り付けるタイプを使ってましたが夏の暑さで剥がれる事がしばしばあり、こちらはそのような事もなく快適に使えます。アームはフレキシブルで形を変えられます。走行中は振動でブレはあるものの適正範囲と思います。冬気温が低いとスマホを押さえる左右のヤツをゆっくり閉めないとバカになります。なっても手で開けば直りますが（笑）結構重宝してます
5,安価な類似商品もありましたが、説明もわかりやすく安心して購入することが出来、満足しております。ありがとうございました。
3,カップホルダー部分はガッチリ固定でき安定感はいいですが、フレキシブルのアームが太い・硬いで、あまり自由が効きません。アーム自体の安定感はありますが・・・アームが硬すぎて長さは十分でしたが目的のポジションにセットするのが困難でした。最悪なのがマウント部分のツメが最初からゆるゆるで、スマホを触るとマウント事外れて落下しまう事態に。走行中なら危険です。両面テープで補修して使っています。残念！
5,とても使いやすいです
3,多少揺れるが問題なく使える
5,ダッシュボードにスタンドをたてることなくスマートフォン等を使用できる。運転の視線とは違ってくるので、わき見運転に注意が必要。
5,とても良いです。ただ、カップホルダーの底が浅い車に装着する際、携帯電話をセットするアームを伸ばすと重みで若干不安定になります。携帯はiPhone 11を装着しました。ただその状態でもカップホルダーから抜け落ちることはありません。
5,組み立て簡単 使いやすい 最高です。
5,軽トラ用に購入しました。ハンドル右横のカップホルダーに装着しています。首が長いので、ポジションの調整範囲が大きく、ベストな位置に決まりました。装着位置が窓際になりますが、大きな８Plusを装着して悪路を走っても、安定性がいいので安心感があります。脱着も楽です。ごつ過ぎないデザインもいいですね。
5,土台の安定感と、フレキシブルの保持力がしっかりしていて、ホルダー部もきちんと挟んでくれる上に背面ワンプッシュで解除できるので便利。欲を言えばフレキシブルがもう少し長ければ…と言うのはあるが満足。
5,丈夫そう。ガッチリ携帯をホールド。落ちることは無いです
3,まだ本格的に使用していないのでなんとも言えないが丈夫そうでその点は、良いのではないかと思う
5,買って良かったです。
5,カップホルダーがそこまで頑丈ではないので何となく不安感がありますが、マウント自体はガタ付きもなく安定しています。長いアームも走行中に振動が伝わるかな？と思いましたが、かなりしっかりしていて角度を変えるのに一苦労する程です（笑） 良い買い物でした。
5,２０１６年型アウディにぴったりでした！
5,予想以上にしっかりガッチリホルダーで安心です！安い買い物でした！
5,問題無く使用出来ている。
5,とても使い易く最高です。
5,大変使い易く大満足です。
5,日本語のレビューが数件しかなかったので心配でしたが、デザインが良かったのと車でスマホナビが使いたくて購入しました。実際に取り付けナビを使った感想は期待以上でした。カップホルダーにはしっかり取り付きます、走行中はスマホは揺れますがナビ使用には問題ありません。1番良かったのはスマホの取り付け取り外しが簡単です。特に外す時はボタンを押すとスマホを挟んでいるアームが広がるので楽にスマホが取り出せます。耐久性はまだ分かりません。
5,思った以上に造りがしっかりして、使い勝手もいいです。他の商品より値段が高いですが、これを選んで良かったと思っています。
5,どんな形のドリンクホルダーに使えて便利
5,特に問題ありません。
5,chrのカップホルダーは楕円形なんですががた付きもなくしっかり固定できて使いやすくいいスマホホルダーだと思います。
2,iPhoneを付けるとアームがしなってしまい不安定になります。いまいちです
4,It received  3 stars for sturdiness as the cradle the phone sits in has points it stops on when trying to position it to face you -  I would rather it was able to stop at any point vs set positions that feel loose. Otherwise a decent item.. lets see if it last 3 months
5,Sturdy and some flexibility for phone positioning.
5,excellent product has longer side holder arm compared to other similar product which can accommodate cellphone with protective cases installed.
5,So far it is working as it is supposed to.It stays in the cup holder the stem is very solid and it takes pressure to move it in a position that you want to suit your needs.I was actually surprised by the quality of this holder.
5,It sits sturdy in the cup holder. Holds the phone tight. The phone does not shake when driving; the device does not carry the vibrations from driving to the phone so you can see it all the time clearly whats on the display.
3,Works great but it you don't bump it with your elbow. The phone holder pops off the flexible neck very easily
4,nice display-easy to set up
5,Easy to install. Height is just right. My phone doesn’t fall even when I’m on rough road. Easy to put/remove phone from the holder.
5,I regularly drive on very rough roads. No other phone holder I tried would keep my phone secure. This one does. It's too bad that it takes up one of the two spaces for coffee but that's the passenger's problem.
5,Holder fits well in my car and works as intended !!!
3,Worked well for first install .. but after a passenger knocked it out of alignment . i went to re-adjust it .. and tighten it back down .. now the whole neck spins backwards .. loosening the whole unit from the cup holder .. rendering this useless .. i submitted an inquiry through Amazon .. only to find out it's sold by a third party .. so i have to return this to get a refund .. i am in the process of getting it returned and have ordered a 2nd one to replace it .. i will give it a shot .. and see what happens to the new one ..
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT
2,Le 4 juin 2022 J’ai retourné le produit car la tige cause vibration sur le téléphone.J’ai du payé 10.50$ CA pour le retour!Le 7 août 2022 paasencore reçu mon remboursement!
5,Great product love it
5,Perfect fit :)
2,Was not what I thought it was. Did not fit
1,It was working great for 2 months. After 2 months it was no longer able to hold my iPhone. The top gear would swivel and my phone would be upside down
2,👎👎👎
5,Easy to install holds the phone securely
4,I am enjoying this product no issues and  I like it better then the weather tech  phone holder.
1,The base in which the cell sits is so loose without any possibility to tighten it that if you slightly touch the phono for example to touch one of the side buttons  the phono will tilt.
3,My only dislike is the holder portion doesn’t stay on tight. If you knock it it can fall off .
5,Easy to install and useDecent
5,I looked at other phone mounts but the topgo mount was the easiest to install and held the phone the most securely. I like how the side arms just squeeze together to fit your phone. I just wish the release button was on the front but it is still easily accessible. Works great
4,It’s easy to get situated perfectly and easy to remove. Swivel is a bit loose.
5,J’adore ce support car dit parfait pour mes besoins le premier que j’ai acheté (pas sûr de la même compagnie …) à durer peut-être 6 mois!Celui là a durée 3 mois! Très dommage!
1,The phone holder section is said to CLIP onto the arm: it doesn't! Gets knocked off easily
5,I have only had it for a week but so far it seems to be well made. Especially when the Cup Phone holder is 3X the price...
5,Using in a Nissan Titan truck
5,Bonne qualité et prix correct!
5,This works like I expected.  Easy to install  phone stays cradled.
2,After 9 months the holder suddenly popped and broke into pieces.  Not sure why but now I have to buy another one.
5,Très très bon produit. Hyper pratique très stable. 100% Recommandé
4,Easy to install and holds the phone properly
3,The holder is quite good except for the attachment mechanism at the neck to the phone holder plate. One of the small claws was broken and the attachment mechanism appears fragile. Its probably necessary to glue the plate to the neck!!
1,This broke first use when I tried to adjust angle plus it is very bulky
5,Holds cell phone away from heating/air condition vents.
