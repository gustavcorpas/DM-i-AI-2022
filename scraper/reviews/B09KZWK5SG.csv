4,I love having the option of being able to use the different sized cords. Very convenient. Priced nicely and I am well pleased to have that spare (stored in my glove box)just in case I'm out and need a charge and forgot to bring mine with me. Charges fine but don't expect to purchase a super past charger when you buy this.This is not that. This is a solid charger that will get your needs handled at an affordable cost.
5,I am very happy with my purchase!!! It charges super fast üôåüèº
5,Very good
5,It charges my phone so fast!! I love it.
5,I was really pleased with the speed of delivery. When you have the right charger it can make all the difference.
5,This block is very convenient for my iPhone 13 which uses a USB C and all my other devices using the regular USB cables. It frees up another outlet.
5,None
5,Love it
5,This is well constructed and doesn‚Äôt get hot as some have reported. At least mine doesn‚Äôt.I was so pleased I re-ordered another set for my office and studio. Warning NOT ALL DEVICES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH HIGHER CHARGING LEVELS.No I haven‚Äôt had the above issues but people need to know. I bought a set from Facebook market place and although they work. They do get hot and construction is shotty.
5,I love this charger . Charged super quick
4,It charges my I watch and my I phone 13 at once and it‚Äôs great to have a second charger
5,Love the dual ability!
4,One of them gets hot ?
3,Needed a new block to work for multiple devices in a pinch does the job but some nights the phones keep making noises as if they‚Äôre being plugged in so seems to be malfunctioning already
5,Nice
5,Love the fast charging. üòâüòÅ
5,Works great with my iPhone charger
4,Value for money
5,I use this for a iPhone and it charges faster than the plug I had before.
5,Works with USB and USB-c
5,Charges my iPhone from  10% or less to 100% in under an hour.
5,We have 4 of us in the house that use iPhones so having many chargers is essential. These work great and the value is perfect for a busy family that takes them everywhere!
5,They charge very quickly. Super cheap compared to the alternatives that claim to be quick charging.
5,Super fast charging recommend 100%
5,Perfect charger for Apple Watch and Mac laptop! Received quickly before travel
4,This is a great idea for a charging block. Works great and I would have given a five star if it would have had 1 more of the smaller ports. The reason for this is my Apple watch and phone take the same size but my flashlight takes the larger one! I would recommend this product.
5,Works perfect for new phone.  Quick charger.
5,This is a great little plug for charging two different things at once  Apple plug and USB plug
5,To charge my iPhone
4,Could be faster
4,Simple charger that can accommodate two types of USB devices A and C connectors.  I charge my Apple watch iPad and use it as a source of power for USB ring light.
4,Really good
5,Unbeknownst to me apple changed the end of the charging cord so when my daughter opened her new iPhone at Christmas I was stuck without a ‚Äúbutt‚Äù as we call them to plug into the wall because they are no longer standard USB ends.So when I found these I was very excited because they were so versatile!!We now use them for all our charging ends! It works for all our phones her Nintendo switch‚Ä¶ these things are great!!Would definitely recommend!!
5,I am finding that a lot of things come now with needing to plug in with a USB plug.
5,Fast charging speed!
4,Very happy with our purchase. This fits perfectly and charges the phone and air pods. Very happy with and would buy this product again.
5,I bought this so my husband could charge his Apple Watch.  I didn‚Äôt realize the chargers had changed on newer models.  This one works great and was a great price.
5,This charger is exactly what I was looking for and works GREAT! It arrived to my house quickly and has been working wonderfully ever since. I have it plugged in by my bedside and I use it every night to charge both my iPhone and Apple watch. I was in need of a way to charge my Apple watch using a wall outlet which is what inspired this purchase. I definitely recommend.
5,I love that it charges super fast my phone was just about to die and in less then 5 minutes it went to 18% for that price it's worth it. On the plus side I can plug in multiple phones.
5,With the transition from old to new USB formats this plug does the trick!
5,This charger works great. Have had it for a few months and have had no problems at all. I would recommend it to anyone needing a cube to plug their charger in.
5,I like it it works as it should.  Works with my wife‚Äôs Apple Watch series 7.  charged my house cameras with it.  For other brands they are asking a lot more.  $30 each I think!?!?  Crazy.  These will work just fine if not better..
3,I bought these to have a versatile charger for my various Apple products. The usb part does work but the C connection part does not.So useless. Will try to contact seller for refund.  ***revised*** I have received my replacements and the chargers kept beeping like the first set.However when I attempted to charge the iPad Pro through the attached Magic Keyboard they did work without beeping.  Very slow though.I‚Äôll keep the second set as I have returned the first set.
5,I was a bit nervous since I had bad experiences with 3rd party chargers.Rapid delivery no fancy packaging but awesome products charging my stuff (phones ipads watch) fast. You got two chargers for the price and you need it once the family realizes how fast they are. Absolutely no issues so far and I'd buy it again!
5,It worth the money it works like the original and it do the charging fast
5,These are fast chargers! Recommended!!
5,Excellent! Product just as described fast shipping and fast shipping. Comes with two as advertised. I like the fact that it can charge two devices at once with the same lightening as with one. The price is right too. I highly recommend this lightening charge block.
5,I have a iPhone 13 and this charger works perfect. Quick charge for both my iPhone and my son's android at the same time. For a few dollars more you get a second charger the chargers were delivered a couple days before. Highly recommended.
5,Great brought two
5,Me agrada que es delicado y no se ve baratoTengo conectado mis cargadores en el mismo dispositivo y mantiene su potencia de cargaExcelente inversi√≥n precio- calidad
5,This charger is great! It‚Äôs portable and easy to use. I love how I can charge my iPhone 13 and my older iPhone in the same charging block. Will definitely buy more in the future.
5,I have been using this charger for about a week now. It charges my iPhone quickly and efficiently. I will be ordering more as they seem to disappear (right after the grandkids visit ü§£. Always good to have a spare!
5,The charging blocks arrived in a compact box which I liked since it made the garbage easy to throw away. Furthermore they claim that the blocks charge fast and the really do! My phones charges very quickly and I would definitely buy it again!
5,Works as it should and priced fairly
5,Just what I needed. Works great.
5,I needed a fast inexpensive charging head for my iPhone and this was perfect! I like how I can charge more than one item at a time. It's very fast my phone's done charging before I know it!
3,Convenience of 2 usb and micro c but not fast charger
5,This charger block works great. Very nice to have 2 types of connections (not tech fluent but you know what I mean). Yep good deal too.
5,It does what it claims. Charges in 30 minutes.
5,Has both usb and usb c. Works great.
5,Great charger! Charges well and looks nice. I like the shape for power strips.
5,This charger was amazing!  I was down to 22% on my phone and plugged it into the smaller fast charge port and within 15 minutes my phone was at 76%.  I highly recommend!
5,It serves family well - the two of them help charging all kinds of phones tablets watches in our household. And the charging speed is fast too.
5,I love this charger plug! It‚Äôs very versatile and convenient with the 2 separate ports! Glad it came with 2 chargers as well. The versatility helps keeps our iPhones and iPads charged!

5,Works as advertised charges things fast.  Happy with purchase.
5,This charger is an excellent & flexible piece of tech! It gets the job done quickly & is an excellent bang for your buck given it comes with two.
3,I purchased this double pack of charging blocks for my Apple Watch. 1/2 blocks worked.
3,I haven‚Äôt used it yet. Like that it has dual ports to accommodate usb or charger. Deceiving that the cord didn‚Äôt come with and no mention that it did not! Unless I overlooked that somewhere.
5,Used for Apple watch 7

5,I travel a lot and this lets me bring only one charger to charge phone and watch at the same time. Charging time is fast.

5,The charging blocks were exactly what I needed

5,I use it to charge my I phone.  It works great.
5,Came very quickly and charges my devices very fast! Will repurchase if I ever need another! I definitely recommend
5,I liked that it accommodates my new iPhone 13.  Be aware it will safely charge only one device at a time.
5,Fast delivery works great and is exactly what we needed!
5,Needed as my new apple watch did not come with a block. Worked as described.
5,It‚Äôs a great product and I have not had a problem out of it
5,Great charging block especially for the price. I also liked that it came in a pack of two.
5,It‚Äôs supposed to be a fast charger and it charges the exact way as it‚Äôs supposed to!! I would buy again!!

5,I would highly recommend getting this charge!!!
3,I found that the prongs were so stiff and did not fit properly in the outlet and sometimes slipped out.
5,Delivered on time and works perfectly.
5,Works great
1,I got these today and immediately I am greatly disappointed. My devices has been charging all afterneen  and 4 hours later my devices are still not fully charged. These products are no good.
2,USB-C part does not work on either charger. Unfortunately I threw out packaging so make sure both inputs work before you toss the packaging just in case you need to return.
1,Doesn't work with new apple products. USB C just continually chimes like its being plugged in and doesn't charge.
1,Intermittently stops and then starts giving power after just two months of use. Easy way to fry your phone battery overnight. Do not purchase.
1,Smells like burnt fish / electricity. With both charging blocks. Phone was getting very hot . I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product .
1,I purchased this set of charging blocks to accommodate charging my iphone and ipad. I've tested both chargers and neither works. When I plug in with my apple charging cord the lightning bold doesn't show steady charging...it flashes. Leaving my ipad plugged in all night my ipad actually had less battery than when I plugged it in. I will be returning these.
2,Had high hopes for this but won‚Äôt charge phone and iPad at same time tried both in several different outlets and same results. Unfortunately need to return;(
1,With two charging slots I thought I‚Äôd be able to plug in my XR and my iWatch overnight and they‚Äôd be all charged in the AM. However that is not the case. It‚Äôs like it overheats or trips a fuse because it stops working after a few minutes. I was using both original cables from apple and it still stopped. I can use it for one device at a time. Waste of money.
1,I wished I had read the reviews before placing my order. It takes forever to charge though it claims to be fast charging. And pretty sure it‚Äôs not normal but when I unplug and plugged it elsewhere a spark of fire sparked so that scared me into using the block too.
1,Stopped working after 2 months
1,This is definitely not a fast charger. I‚Äôve purchased other fast charger and this one is terrible in comparison. There must be obvious quality issues. Avoid.
1,Bought this to charge new IPAD pro 11 that requires type C charger. The charger I purchased had two slots a type C and USB port(two options) The types C does not work and will not charge IPAD. USB works fine for charging phone.
1,Product works fine‚Ä¶..But please note that it does not provide fully 20w per description. It doesn‚Äôt charge my ipad mini.
1,The product was great at first but stopped working shortly after
1,I bought it as a standby charger and rarely used it.  Quit working in just a couple of months. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,Made a brand new iPhone 12 not turn on after using this plug. The screen is black and won‚Äôt even charge.  as well as my iPhone 11. DO NOT BUY THIS CUBE. IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF AMAZON.
1,This charger got EXTREMELY hot and smelled like it was burning. I only noticed because the phone started flashing because it was connecting and disconnecting from the charger.
1,This item did not charge my iPad. It kept beeping. Return item.
1,Both ports can‚Äôt charge at the same time.
1,I‚Äôm using it for the first time today‚Ä¶it seems to be taking longer than it should to  charge‚Ä¶longer than my other one did
1,USB-C charging port doesn't work. Very disappointed
1,Charger didn‚Äôt work
5,very awesome and I am satisfied with this product! Awesome charging dock with impressive and fasting charge! Don't wait to buy this! and I hope you will be satisfied!
5,Works great. Charges fast
5,Definitely worth getting it especially that it has 2 ports to charge different wires!
5,The items were delivered on time and packaged nicely. I ordered two chargers and so far both have been working great. A great value for the money.  I highly recommend.
5,Feels high quality
5,Charger was exactly as advertised thank you!
5,It‚Äôs a fast charger
5,This charger provides over 3000mA in power to my Google Pixel 6!Great value for the money.
5,Great product. Fast and dependable.
5,Shipped quickly! Works great! Super fast charger!
5,This is a great product for the new Apple chargers.  The new iPhones don‚Äôt come with a charging block so these are perfect with great value.  As we add newer Apple products I will be sure to purchase these again.
5,Keep my oculus fully charged while playing. Has both type of port options. Well made and with it.
5,I use it to recharge both my phone and Ipad.  It is both strong and reliable with excellent power.
5,Exactly as pictured. Works well perfect if you have older and new apple products that have different adaptations.
5,Item is as described and is a quality made charging block! Great buy for 2 blocks and like that they are different colors!
5,I also liked the price good value and I can use with my old cable
5,I also liked the price good value and I can use with my old cable
5,I love how fast this charges our phones. We have a household with different iphone generations and this port makes it so convenient to charge our phones using both regukar USB and USB-C port. This is also for such a great value you get a pretty good charge for your buck
5,My kids always fight over the chargers this allows them both to use at the same time and it‚Äôs super fast!! Highly recommend.
5,Charger has outlet for new iPhones and for regular iPhones and other devices. Very helpful.
5,It‚Äôs very useful with the double ports and is fast charging.
5,It‚Äôs exactly what I needed.  Works good.  Worth the price paid.
5,Love it! It works great. I definitely recommend it. Is very worth the price.
5,The price for these was substantially less than at the store. But I don‚Äôt see any difference in quality. They seem to charge everything just as fast and Effectively. Would definitely buy again
5,Working as described will be buying more
5,Who has a lightening cord port on their computer? We sure don't. This converter makes it easy to charge the apple watch and AirPods since those both have silly special ports. Product works great!
4,I think this product is great.  I was annoyed when I got my new iPhone 13 and realized the charger cord was different then the rest of my family iPhones.  Having this dual port is great!
5,Bought two identical power banks and charged both simultaneously with this block and an iPhone block.  This block charged MUCH faster than similar iPhone block.
5,So far been very satisfied with these chargers. They charge our phones quickly which was exactly what I wanted!
5,It‚Äôs great to be able to charge 2 devices at once‚Ä¶and super fast too.
5,I received the package with 2 well-wrapped chargers in a no-frills cardboard box which I like because I am not paying extra for packaging.  The chargers look like most others except that they have both USB standard and USB-C for the newer phones like my Galaxy S21 Ultra.  And you can charge two devices using both of them at the same time which is a nice touch.  This may affect the speed of charging but I have not tested that.  Having a 20W charger makes all the difference with modern hi-power usage phones which I've noticed might not always last the full day probably mainly due to the huge screen and awesome graphics.Check out the difference using this charger compared to the standard 5v charger:I plugged my phone into the standard charger it read "56% 1 hour 57 minutes until full"Then I plugged it into the new 20v charger it read "56% 52 minutes until full"That is pretty amazing - that is an hour and 5 minutes quicker for a phone a little over half full!
5,The value is second to none. Getting 2 chargers is well worth the purchase.
5,Loved the charger. No issues. Charges quickly.
5,They work perfectly
5,Super fast charging time . Very compact with USB and C charging ports will located .
5,Excellent quality and it far exceeded my expectations. It‚Äôs not only smaller and sleeker but charges faster than my apple brand 30 watt!
5,Now that Apple doesn't supply charger blocks with their products. I couldn't figure out how to charge my new series 7 Apple Watch because it takes a USB-C connection charge block.  This charger is a lot cheaper than having to purchase from Apple. It quickly charged my watch and iPhone.  I am happy now..
5,I got an Apple Watch SE so I needed an extra USB-C wall wart and figured this was ideal because it has the second USB-A (regularly USB) port. That leaves enough plugs by my nightstand for a lamp and other stuff. It was only a few bucks more than a single pack so I got the two pack ... it's about the same price as all the other two port/two packs maybe a little cheaper.I was worried about the reviews that said it wouldn't charge two things at the same time: but it works fine for my USB-C Apple Watch charger and an Anker Qi wireless iPhone charger (regular USB cord into this port leads a micro USB cord to the charger). I haven't tested if it charges the phone or watch as fast as the OEM Apple USB-C wall wart but it was enough to get from 30% to 90% on the watch in about 25 minutes this morning so it's pretty close.Another review said theirs got hot: mine did not get more than warm at most (when charging both the phone and watch). It was not concerning in the end but I figured to check after the others' experience.
5,Bought this for our new Apple Watch to charge. Great versatile charger for all our apple needs.
5,Works as described
5,The chargers work really well. Enough power to charge my iPhone fast. They are versatile having both the USB and USB-C ports so they be used to charge most anything including new iPads and iPhone.
5,Like the dual port feature. Using it to charge my I Phone 13 Pro.
5,Love it!! Excellent product high quality and good price!
5,This 20 W Dual Port USB-C wall charger works great for my daughters iPhone XR and Apple Watch 6. They have different cords so this fixed our issue. Very pleased.
5,This is a great product. We love how reasonably priced it was and charges super fast.
5,Perfect for the new iPhone and other devices in our home.
5,I purchased this item because of the price that you received two chargers instead of one and the reviews that it had. I am not sorry as it was a great price and a great item as well. This unit charges my phone and watch quicker than my old charger. Due to also having two plug types it is so much easier to carry with me instead of two different chargers. I would buy this item again.
5,This charger is perfect for my many varieties of power cords in my house. It Handles charging 2 devices at once.
5,These charge quickly and are used with both my beats flex headsets and any other usb item.
5,Awesome charger for the money.
5,Fast charge good quality
5,I like how I can fit both cords in the block and I don‚Äôt have to look for specific blocks for my chargers.
5,I like this product. Charging power is pretty good. Worth for the price I paid. Happy with the product.
5,Our new phones didn‚Äôt have charging blocks.  We bought these for iPhone 13‚Äôs and a Motorola Edge.  Works perfect and fast charging.  The cable fits secure and is not lose.
5,So easy & convenient!! Charges fast!
5,Love the fact that it also has a usb!
5,Works perfect
5,Great product. Just as described
5,Great charger for the money. No issues with hookup or current to my Apple watch USB-C charging cable. Apple is apparently too stingy to send charging hubs now so this was a godsend. Thanks!
5,Chargers works just like it should. Best part is we got 2 for less than the proce the cellular store wanted for 1. Would buy again
5,Great to have both USB OG and USB C. Fast charges my Google Pixel 5. Couldn't have asked for anything more.
5,Perfect item to help charge the Apple Watch and iPhone at the same time.
5,Perfect chargers gor our S22 Samsungs.
5,great product at a good price!
5,Trying to get up to speed with the faster charger.  This charger will take you there. Came timely haven‚Äôt had any issues yet and I‚Äôd buy again!!!
5,I like that it has the dual USB ports. We can use our new cords that came with our iPhone 13s but still use the lightening cables we had for our old phones as well. Charge time is super fast and it‚Äôs a great price!
5,Charger is very durable and made with good quality material. Charger works well with original charging cord. It gives a fast charge as well.
5,These are the only chargers to use with an iPhone !! They are the very best and fastest ones everüòä
5,Great alternative
5,It‚Äôs quick and works just as well as my daughter‚Äôs IPhone brand.
5,So I bought my wife a new series 7 Apple Watch to replace her aging series 4.  On Christmas morning once opened she determined that Apple does not supply the charging brick just the cord and charging base. And the cord has a USB-C end on the plug in part. So she can‚Äôt charge her new watch because who has a USB-C wall plug in lying around?  Her face looked like a kid that got a new toy for a gift but no batteries and can‚Äôt be played with. I understand Apple is shipping this way with a lot of their products now. So I needed to get a charging plug in pronto. After some research this one popped out to me on Amazon and I got the 2 pack.  I suspect in the not too distant future the family will acquire more Apple stuff and be in the same situation. Be prepared.These work really well. Enough power to charge anything fast. And not to big or blocky.  The new watch charges fast and they are versatile having both the USB and USB-C ports so they be used to charge most anything including new iPads and iPhone.  And the 2 pack was priced well.  We have the extra one for now set aside for travel which will prevent me from crawling under the nightstand to unplug it when we leave home. If you need a versatile set of well made and powerful charging blocks this is the one you want.
5,Unbeknownst to me apple changed the end of the charging cord so when my daughter opened her new iPhone at Christmas I was stuck without a ‚Äúbutt‚Äù as we call them to plug into the wall because they are no longer standard USB ends.So when I found these I was very excited because they were so versatile!!We now use them for all our charging ends! It works for all our phones her Nintendo switch‚Ä¶ these things are great!!Would definitely recommend!!
5,2 wall pieces for only $15. Works great and charges fast.
5,Reasonable price for a dual port charger. Super convenient to have both charging port options available. It doesn‚Äôt seem to charge 2 devices simultaneously but otherwise works great.
5,Great price - Great Value. Charges just the "A" brand but better with both usb and usb-c ports. Two Chargers in One - I can charge my iPhone13Pro and my wife's iPhone X at the same time. Super fast charging capability
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Me encanta
5,I like how they have both typ of connection types.
5,Needed a charger with enough power to charge my iPhone 13 or series 7 watch. I have so many lighting USB A cables and didn‚Äôt want to throw them out because apple went USB C. This is perfect  it charges my devices fast and I have the option to use USB A or C cables
5,Awesome love the fast charging which I would have gotten  longer cord.
5,Great when you have different plugs and they work great and fast charge bought them for my work.
3,The airpod cord comes right out of the box because it doesn‚Äôt fit as it should and I plugged the box in and seen a small spark. Went to Best Buy and purchased an apple one. Devices are too expensive to risk them for $15.
5,This charger accommodates the charging cords from the new iPhone items as well as the older iPhone products. It is very convenient as you don't need multiple charging plugs.
5,Great product at a great price!  Having both charging ports in one device is so handy and convenient.  Multiple devices can use the same plug.  Charges devices quickly and have had zero problems.
5,These chargers (you get two) each provides two connectors (USB-A and USB-C).The size is good and they're narrow enough to take up only one outlet each on my power strip.(Some chargers are too wide or oriented differently so they overlap multiple outlets.)I haven't carefully tested the "fast charge" claim but they do seem to charge at a decent clip.
