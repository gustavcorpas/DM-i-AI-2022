5,I’m very pleased with this iPad case. Not too expensive fits well arrived promptly not like the cases from China that take months to arrive. The Monet print on the cover is beautiful.
5,I love the look of the case and the ease of use it allows. My ipad can be propped open so that it’s  easily readable for a recipe or folded so I can hold the ipad to play a game. This case is sturdy and wipes off easily should something be spilled on it.
5,This cover is maybe my third over the years and no doubt one of the best. I love the grab edge as it stays propped as I want. Others slipped often.  Beside the colors which are beautiful this should last a long time.I would recommend this one.  It’s a keeper.
5,This is the second time I've purchased an i-pad cover of this kind. I really like that the part of the case that "grips" is bult in rather than glued/stuck on. Definite improvement.
5,The case is not easy to hold but is pretty easy to prop up.
5,really pretty looks so good with my black i-pad
4,Really like the print. I just wish it had a pocket for holding a paper or credit card.
5,This is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made! I love it!
5,Very nice
5,Not too heavy
