5,Using this to power two Klipsch AW-650 outdoor speakers and a 12" Velodyne subwoofer outdoors.So far it's been mounted outside in South Florida weather for 3 months and it's been flawless. I have it mounted inside a cheap Home Depot tupperware-style container mounted to my fence so there is no loss of Bluetooth connectivity even when I'm inside the house 50ft away and it is also waterproof so it protects the amp and power supply (see pics). I considered other types of enclosures but they impeded the Bluetooth range too much this works perfectly and subtracted no measurable amount of range from the Bletooth signal.I drilled-out the bottom of the tupperware for the power supply and cables - easy peasy and looks just like a service box for cable or DSL mounted to the fence. No water can get inside since everything runs out of the bottom including all of the speaker wire and power supply cable (the brick stays inside the box).For those who know these Klipsch speakers they're basically the best outdoor speakers you can get and this thing can CRANK them so loud and clear there's no chance your neighbors would allow it without calling the cops lol. I LOVE this little bluetooth amp is is AMAZING! I can't imagine anything for the size and outdoors which would be more value-packed than this. This tiny little thing is driving some SERIOUS equipment without issue whatsoever even when it's 110degrees outside. BUY IT!
5,Music is a huge and daily part of our lives. Because we don’t like to overdrive the living-room system just to also “light up” the kitchen area with sound I’ve kept a small (homebrew) 18+18W amplifier and Minimus 77 speakers on top of our fridge for years. It was linked to the living-room system via a stereo audio isolation transformer and a Bluetooth receiver with an audio switch. Unsightly but it worked well and sounded nice. With a recent remodeling of the kitchen and living-room areas a better-looking solution was required. With a 12x12 soffit running in an “L” shape above all of the kitchen cabinets in-wall speakers were the obvious choice.  We ordered a set of Dayton Audio ME625W in-wall 2-way units and as I will get into later eventually added a Dayton Audio DCS165 subwoofer and quasi-matching grille all via Amazon. The amplifiers mentioned here were also Amazon purchases.My first choice for a new small amp to power this was the Pyle PFA540BT unit with built-in FM radio and Bluetooth features. That unit was bought as an open box from Amazon.  While plenty loud it had a subtle but definite grating midrange distortion once warmed up that I did not notice until it was outside of the return window. My bad these new parts all sat around while we finished the other renovations. We all agreed it was annoying even my kids. Additionally the switch-mode power supply for that amp was so noisy (RF-wise) that the radio receiver only would pull in one station with a local antenna from only a couple of miles away. The rest of the band was utterly swamped out.  (No FCC cert logo visible on the PSU now we know why).My second amp was a FOSI audio unit the BT30D which is much better. No radio but BT and line in. As a plus it’s a 2.1 system with a dedicated drive channel for a passive sub. It’s rated at 50+50+100w.  It’s plenty loud however be aware it ships with a switching power supply that can deliver only about half of that wattage. (24v x 4A = 96W). Ah marketing.With the amp issue sorted I was still disappointed that the in-walls did not have bass that matched the small mini-77’s that we had listened to for 10 years. Given the larger drivers and volume of trapped air behind the in-walls I was a little surprised. Research on the FOSI website was not able to tell me if the FOSI unit has a fixed High Pass Filter on the L-R outputs or not so I was not sure if it was the speakers or the amp limiting the bass. Everything below about 120Hz was absent.The Pyle amp which has no amplified sub output sounded similar in the bass and a third amp I connected in also played with little bass. Conclusion is that it’s the speakers or the install environment most likely the speakers as the two are separated by a lot of insulation preventing any phase cancelling behind the wall.As a result the stout little 6-1/2" sub driver was ordered and installed with a ¾” split-baffle as support in the corner of the soffit for best loading.  Once set up and adjusted we now have a system with some decent extension into the 50-100 Hz range and more than enough volume to fill the kitchen area while providing a nice stereo listening field for most of the room. I wish we had the space for a larger sub driver but with the framing behind the 12x12 soffit an 8” or 10” just wasn’t going to fit.  The 6-1/2” sub is respectable but it’s being driven rather hard to make up for it’s lack of piston area. A second identical unit is being considered to double the cone area and increase the efficiency but at lease for the moment it sounds nice at reasonable levels.On balance the FOSI amp has been very good and well-behaved. It runs a little warm but for its size it’s punching well above its weight and the BT implementation sounds quite good. It must have a decent SBC buffer scheme as we don’t experience any buffer under-run drop-outs over long term listening with any of the apple android or Chromebooks attached. Bluetooth range has also been solid throughout the area. This is probably due to the external no-compromise BT antenna. The amp is small enough not to notice on top of the fridge and looks pretty smart. I’d buy it again. I will be posting this same review on the Sub and In-Wall speakers pages as well because it's kind of a system-level review of all the bits and pieces.
5,This finally came after having to order it a second time from this seller without compensation for sending the wrong and unreturnable item in the first place. However all's well that ends well! I finally received it in good condition and set it up in my home office to link to my iFi Zen Can and iFi High Res Zen DAC. I had no problems streaming music through my iPhone but couldn't get any sound from my linked Samsung TV via the audio out/optical port at first.  I contacted Fosi Audio directly and pleased to report that their patience excellent customer service and exemplary responsiveness greatly assisted in rectifying the problem. The solution was to simply use the 35 mm audio out port on the TV and link it to the audio in on my Zen Dac and voila! Thank you Fosi Audio!
4,Bluetooth seems fine but I've not exercised distance. Sound quality is what I'd expect... I'm not doing anything which requires me to analyze fidelity. Based on my initial experience (first 10 minutes or so) I had considered purchasing a second BT30D right away... but... ran the device for about 15 minutes and the output volume suddenly dropped to about 1/2 and it has never recovered (long-duration power-off etc). Contacted Fosi directly and have had nothing but the run-around for two weeks. I had not intended on reviewing until after the warranty return had been completed but because of the terrible support I felt the need to warn others. I'll happily retract this review if Fosi ever steps up and replaces the amp.Original review = 2 (with text above)New review = 4 (see updates below) Sept 2022Fosi eventually sent me a replacement and it works perfectly with the overall output volume back to the expected levels. Scored a 4 just because it took a large number of emails back-and-forth before the problem was resolved. I would consider purchasing another of these but truly hope my problem was a one-off.
5,Just needed a basic power amp for my mini studio set-up. Using it to power a set of Bose 201 speakers. The amp had no issues at all with the task. I have never used a Class-D amp and was a little concerned but the amp is delivering great sound for my needs. Didn't think I needed the Bluetooth feature but I have used it several times with my Samsung S20 FE phone and the connection and sound has been solid. Perfect for my needs!
4,I discovered mini desktop amps & DACs a short time ago and Fosi seems to be one of the main brands putting out a multitude of permutations of these units. The amp I got is the BT30D which I paired with a Q4 DAC. I'm running my desktop and a cable box through this setup to some spare Polk bookshelfs that I've augmented with a Dayton Audio SUB-1000. It's only been about a week but I am thoroughly impressed at the sound quality I'm getting. I'm rediscovering my CD collection while also making good use of a FLAC collection I've accumulated. The resolution and thump is truly awesome. I had been using an all in one set of Logitech powered desktop speakers and SW for audio prior to this. The difference is kind of like going from a transistor radio to a hifi system. Very pleased indeed. In all the cost came to approximately $300 (not including the Polk bookshelfs which I already owned). The only negative I've come across so far is my PC doesn't recognize the DAC after a reboot. I must power the DAC off and back on for the connection to come back to life but this is a minor annoyance. I hope I can get some good use out of this setup to make it worth the expense.
5,I have 2 bookshelf Polk speakers connected to this AND a Polk Subwoofer..all connected to a Alexa hub. THis produces the most beautiful balanced sound you can imagine AND...with bluetooth you can then switch over to your phone and play specific songs you want etc. Its a perfect tiny tucked away power amp for all these purposes. Its a perfect design for a samll to medium size speaker system
4,It worked fine for me for almost a year without any issue.Some areas I like it do better:- Ability to turn off bluetooth. I don't ever use it and rather that it doesn't broadcast everywhere so anyone can connect to it.- Neutra position for treble / bass. This one may be huge for some. I have no idea what's the neutral position for these; currently there is no way for me to listen to the natural sound characteristics from the speakers.Tip for those who want to disable BT: you can buy a "SMA RF Terminator" and put that on the bluetooth antenna port. It will attenuate the bluetooth signal enough that render it not usable from more than a few meters away so your neighbors can't see it.
5,I really liked the ability to use Bluetooth or RCA input. I connected this to my record player and to my two bookshelf audio speakers and a subwoofer. The fact that you can also connect your phone via the Bluetooth and play music is very convenient. I was looking for an audio amplifier and was thinking of an old school large box but when I found this compact unit it was perfect. I have even brought it to a party to attach to a sound system so everyone could connect via Bluetooth and play there tunes.
4,Bought a second one to swap out for my 2.0 Fosi in my kitchen so can add a sub. Both are a pair of Jamo 803s and 10 inch subs and they sound great. Only better if would be 100watts per main speaker just to get a little more volume instead of the 50watts it has beyond that they are the best especialy for the price. I love them.
4,I purchased both the bt20a model and this one after seeing this was the newer of the 2. After plugging this one in I noticed the volume was lower compared to the bt20a model when playing music and movies at the same levels. I bought this one with the hopes of it being louder since it claims to have a higher wattage output but to my disappointment it fared worse. I decided to keep the bt20a model for now until I find another mini amp that can perform better.
4,Gave to a friend
2,[UPDATE 2]The fade-in issue describe below also ensures that you'll miss notifications while your phone is connected to the BT30D - the audio doesn't resume fast enough to relay the various beeps my phone makes for meeting reminders text messages etc.I hope Fosi is able to release a firmware update for this device.[UPDATE]I hate to do this but I have to remove a star - the fade-in behavior is unbearable when listening to music.I'd been primarily listening to podcasts at first and the problem was tolerable. As I've started using this receiver for music though its incessant and unwanted fading behavior has become unbearable.Imagine queuing up Beethoven's 5th tingling with anticipation... and having the intro gradually fade in. Pick any song that starts with a "bang" and this receiver will ruin it.I cannot recommend the BT30D; I'll probably end up demoting this to the garage and getting a real receiver for my bedroom.P.S. There's also a detectable hissing noise when no audio is playing especially when the treble tone knob is turned up. I heard it at first but it was minor and I don't know whether it's an issue with the receiver or another component (e.g. wires speakers). I only mention this because my son whose hearing is considerably better than mine commented on it immediately when he first listened to this rig. FYI.[ORIGINAL]I had high hopes for this device - and it met some of them - but like so many Bluetooth devices this has quirky behavior that makes it as annoying to use as it is useful.This is one of eight Bluetooth audio receivers that I have around the house including integrated speakers headsets stand-alone receivers and receiver+amp combos. This is the ONLY one of them that does not:1. Automatically connect to my phone (Samsung S22 Ultra) when I power on the amp2. Support Samsung Dual Audio outputFor #1 every time I turn this amp on I have to go to my phone's Bluetooth settings and explicitly connect to it. All of the other devices connect automatically within a few seconds. I do this several times per day and it's particularly cumbersome when the phone is locked my hands are wet my phone is lying on a table in another room etc.For #2 setting a second output device using Samsung Dual Audio causes this BT30D to disconnect from my phone. I'm unable to reconnect it unless I power off the BT30D and power it back on again. At that point it steals the Bluetooth connection when I manually reconnect it (per #1) and I end up in this same cycle. Every other device I have - old or new; Bluetooth 3 4 or 5 - works fine with Dual Audio.There are two other minor annoyances:- The BT30D fades in the audio when I first start playing it. This happens with all players and media sources (e.g. local MP3 streaming music podcasts Netflix). It doesn't happen with any of my other Bluetooth devices so I'm sure it's a BT30D issue.- The screws on the speaker terminals are smooth. I like that the BT30D is physically small but that means there's limited space in back for all of the various ports. The speaker terminals are made from smooth clear plastic so they're hard to turn in general and especially given the tight space. They need some sort of texture for grip.Once connected the BT30D performs well:+ Bluetooth range is good even with walls between the phone and receiver+ Works with my current two-speaker setup and has room to expand with a subwoofer in the future+ Front dial controls are smooth and appear to respond linearly+ Power is sufficient for a pair of freebie bookshelf speakers that came with a receiver purchase 25 years ago. Speakers have 5" + 1" driver on each side; impedance not listed. When looking at the various Fosi models I didn't know how much power I'd need but I'd say that this 100W amp is definitely the minimum for these speakers. It's louder than I need at full volume (~400 sq ft room) but not by much; my gut tells me that the 50W amp would have been too small.I wouldn't recommend the BT30D but neither would I advise against it. If you can live with the mediocre Bluetooth implementation you'll probably be happy with it. If I'd known about the Bluetooth issues up front I never would have chosen this model.
4,It works well! Sound quality and Bluetooth are excellent! My only complaint is whenever you shut off the main power it makes a “popping sound” which sometimes scares me and makes me worry about the speakers getting blown out! So after every usage I would disconnect the speakers from the amp to avoid this. The company replied that the popping sound is normal and someone from YouTube says that it’s normal also. But still it’s a pain hearing that dreadful sound when the amp is turned off!
4,I think the main feature of this unit is it's size.  I keep it under a musical keyboard.  It is about the size of 4 CDs stacked on top of one another very small.  However it has good power delivery.  I use this in a small room so I don't has room for a huge receiver or speakers.  I use the passive feature because I have this hooked up to a small computer sub woofer that already has power.  But it says it will also power a sub.  The tone knobs are good and work pretty well at balancing out and fine tuning your audio after you have done it through what ever your sending the audio out through.  I use it to out put from a PS3 that I use as a DVD player and Netflix unit.  And I also use it with a computer with RCA splitters to add this extra port as it only has one set of RCA audio in ports.  So far though I must say I am quite pleased with it as it delivers good power and audio adjustments and is tiny so it fits my space well.  Also the blue tooth seems to work well which surprised me a bit (I paired it with my phone with no problems).  Really for the size this little unit really delivers quite a bit of value and features.
5,The amp is made of metal (no plastic) and is well made.  The flexibility from the controls is excellent and it is very easy to use.  Do get the banana plugs as there is not much room on the back to insert the speaker wires otherwise.The amazing thing about this amp is that I was able to recreate (in my house) much of the high-end car stereo setup I had from the 1980's where I had Alpine amps and an electronic crossover for my custom built subwoofer box.  I did not expect this.The R/L speaker mains handle the regular audio (4 ohm 2-way speaker) responsibility and the sub-out handles my twin 8" subwoofers that are wired in parallel for a 4 ohm load.  It was so nice to see them do their stuff again after sitting in the garage for 20+ years.  The internal amps from this unit are more than enough to get the walls and floor shaking without having the amps clip or distort.  The best part is the sub output can be configured (fine tuned) just like my old car-system crossover + amp with the frequency and gain (volume) being adjustable separate from the main speakers.  There is a master volume for the whole system once the other controls are set.  Both the plug and the bluetooth inputs work great although I primarily use the bluetooth connection which has amazing range.  Once connected to your tablet or whatever you are using as the audio source the tablet volume control can be used.  The on/off switch on the front of the unit with indicator LEDs is a nice touch.  Highly recommended.
5,This product is excellent. I would suggest that the next upgrade should increase the Wantage from 50 W to 100 or more. This would make it into an incredible system.
5,I am using this amp to drive two Klipsch Reference Cinema speakers and 10" powered sub from my PC. I was pleasantly surprised about the build quality of this little unit. A very solid feel that weighs enough to ensure it remains level on my desktop even with the cables connected. The controls are very solid and smooth. Thumbs up already.Then I powered it on with the connected speakers and was amazed. I was leaning toward a much more expensive Class-A amplifier but this absolutely demonstrated to me that Class-D -- with today's technology -- is just as fine. There is no noticeable noise it has PLENTY of power for these speakers and the tuning controls on the front are easily accessible and effective at doing what they should be doing.What surprised me even more is how little heat this unit displaces. After running at a level enough to put my meter at 97 db for more than an hour this was still cool to the touch. I'm not sure how they're doing it but they're doing it right.I have not yet played with the BT merely because I don't need it at this time and that was not my reason for buying this amp. But I have no reason to expect it won't work well also.I'm very happy with my first Fosi purchase and look forward to testing other kit from them!
4,I got this for a set of DML speakers that I built as the unit had reasonable power and separate bass output. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound and volume I was able to get from the DML speakers. I loved the tracking of the bass output level with the main volume control.  The only issue I have run into is when Bluetooth is connected without sound from my PC driving the amp seems to shut down and cause a thump in the bass. You can see the amp on the wooden table to the right of the Left/Right with Sub DML speakers. DML speakers are odd in that they use exciters (think regular speakers but without the cone) to drive large surfaces. You can see the exciter on the back of the  rigid pink insulation - this is the bass speaker.
5,I am so impressed with this small powerhouse I added a subwoofer and cannot believe how good it sounds. My backyard is a musical paradise.
5,Conectado a unos BOSE 151 SE y un subwoofer POLK PSW10 lo puedo resumir como increíble. Gran sonido y con potencia suficiente para esta configuración. No recomendaría conectarle algo más potente porque simplemente no lo necesita. Para acompañar un asado una reunión de amigos música en una habitación de pequeña a mediana es más que suficiente. Lo único que no me gustó en que la configuración bluetooth no permite conectar 2 amplificadores siempre se desconecta uno de ellos. No he podido configurar 2 ambientes a diferente volumen. Gran compra. Lo recomiendo.
5,I was skeptical about this little fella but honesty it’s been great! I stuck these two Bose speakers on it and an old Sony powered amp and it absolutely rocks. It’s the perfect setup for the gym: the RCA i pits are tied to the TV and when a Bluetooth device connects it simply overrides the RCA inputs so no need to even reach a switch.
5,Using this to power outdoor speakers and a subwoofer on my deck.  Can tie to it with Bluetooth or via AUX input from any source.  Description could be better as far as the hook ups go as directions/description led me to believe I needed banana plugs to connect speakers.  Great sound and power.  I can rock the joint if need to!
5,I bought a pair or BOSE 201 speakers with the intention of hooking them up so I could play my electronic music directly from my iPhone. I saw the FOSI amps and liked the price for the specs. This model connects to the IPhone BT lightning as easy as turning on the FOSI amp my iPhone saw it right away. You do have to complete the connection by choosing Fosi each time but it’s stored so it’s as easy hitting one button in BT settings on my phone.So how is it as an amp? It only has treble and bass adjustments (in addition to volume of course) but since I play through Apple music I have the simple equalizer options there. Choosing “Flat” allows best use of the treble and bass on the amp. I am looking for an inexpensive but good used subwoofer to use with this amp. If needed I’ll update this review.
4,I'm a recording studio owner and electronic engineer. My standards are high and I can easily hear the effect on audio quality of the TPA3116 chips used in this device. For typical listeners this may not matter but don't expect audiophile quality.The Class D (digital) operation does give the device compact size and excellent efficiency important in portable and auto use when battery powered. But an 'old-school" analog amplifier will give better sound quality if you have the space and power budget to spare.
4,I purchased this item after reading the positive Amazon reviews.  I wasn't sure if it would power my big old bookshelf speakers but was willing to take the chance.  Surprisingly this little amplifier does a good job; it's loud enough for the room it's in with some to spare.  Treble and Bass controls work well.  I don't use a sub woofer but there are outputs for one if I decide to add one.  The controls have a good quality feel to them and the unit looks well-make and feels sturdy.  What I would change:  I need to manually re-connect the bluetooth each time I use the unit (not a deal-breaker).  I would purchase a more powerful version for indoor use in the future and deploy this unit to power outdoor or garage speakers.  Yes a good purchase.
4,Overall quality is good but there is a noise in the speakers when nothing playing regardless what volume level is set
5,This amp worked very well in my office so I bought a second one for my bedroom.  It's a steel case with real metal dials.  The Bluetooth just works without issue which surprised me.  There was no pain pairing with my phone and no conflicts between the unit in my office and the unit in my bedroom.  It's a little annoying that the power supply is separate but that's as advertised and standard for this type of product (unfortunately).  I haven't tried it with a subwoofer yet but it works well with both cheap and expensive bookshelf speakers.  I haven't done any serious critical sound quality listening but it seems to play perfectly fine music and spoken audio.  I also haven't taken any power measurements etc. but power hasn't been an issue.  I have been playing background music / audio at half volume which is fine for near(ish) field listening.  These are probably not great at blasting music regardless of any advertised power ratings.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,I was skeptical to what I would get for the buck.So I verified some of the specs. myself with the below bench setup.First CH1 and CH2 frequency response quite flat down to below 40Hz.Then CH3 SUB FREQ set to min(solid bar) and little lines SUB FREQ set to max.The TREBLE and BASS control are good. I my opinion is the TREBLE control boost way over the top.Just to illustrate how much the sine wave changes at THDN 1% which is just about audible.In comparison to the second one at THDN 10% this leads to quite distorted sound and on the scope meter you can see why.Actual power output at 1% THDN. CH1/2 36W/8ohm 73W/4ohm. Ch3 51W/4ohm 69W/4ohm at 2% THDN. My guess for the higher distortion is the additional x-over in the SUB signal path. All measurements taken while only one channel is driven at the time.I did not have a 2ohm load for the SUB CH3 to test the 100W.The Bluetooth range is very good an even through a wall did not stop the stream from playing.For my listening test I used my own designed and built Full range dual 3" 4ohm Top (Faital 3FE25) and one 10in 4ohm Sub (Faital 10RS350).The sound stage is just beautiful clean and detailed. The bass is punchy but still very well controlled deep and precise. Just the way you don't wanna stop listening to your favorite music tracks.For my setup I have chosen a low x-over frequency setting (dial at 9 o'clock position) everything else in 12 o'clock position.All in all an excellent value amplifier for little money. If you are after earthshaking loud sound then you need much more power but make no mistake this little amp in not shy at all and does produce adequate volume.
5,Got this prior to moving out of state worked good for about a month then stopped powering on. Worked with customer service they sent a new power supply within a week and back up and running. Awesome customer support and product!
4,This Fosi amp was perfect for my desktop speakers.  I am running a 2.1 system and the amp had the right mix of inputs and outputs for my purposes.  I was impressed with the low distortion (I am pushing some "large" home theater like speakers with a powered sub) and am even happier about the very low level of background hiss which I got out of the box without any isolation components required.  Very solid Bluetooth connection.  Overall very pleased.
5,With apologies to U2 "I have finally found what I'm looking for"...specifically a small  powerful 2.1 amplifier with good clean sound. The amp also had to be able to drive my passive home built sub and hopefully not cost much over $150.00. Enter the Fosi Audio BT30D. At $89.00 this unit is a bargain and meets all the listed requirements. I have the amp hooked up to my computer via a SoundBlaster Z soundcard (which also serves as my headphone amp) along with a pair of Micca MB42X's and the aforementioned subwoofer. Although this setup sits on my desk (sub on the floor)  the Fosi will fill this medium size room with Loud Clean sound. No hiss or noise at any volume level. The ability to adjust the sub volume AND the sub frequency is a big bonus. I don't use the bluetooth often but when I do it has been flawless. If your audio needs are similar to mine then waste no time and get this baby pronto. I've had the unit about four months now with no problems so if something were to go wrong I think it would have happened by now. If I'm wrong I'll post an update but I really don't think you'll be hearing from me again.
3,Well... It's sounding better over time perhaps somewhat decent for price point and the speakers used are Micca MB42x which are breaking in also. The Micca's DO need time to settle in. Fosi claims very overrated power specs..... Am using a Schitt Magni I already had to pre-amp to the Fosi from the computer it is needed to boost the signal... Fosi pre-amp section is on the weak side. Fosi treble and Bass tone controls seem interactive and generally seem to function as a boost rather than a bass or treble cut. I find that using the tone controls at minimal settings yields a better sound quality otherwise seems like the sound is less clear and bass gets a thicker quality to it affecting clarity . Bass frequency cutoff is also a bit uncertain with no clue as to what frequency you are near. Controls also seem a bit sensitive very small adjustments can be heard and make tuning a challenge. The subwoofer output channel is fair but I am only using a small hacked sub from an old Logitech system about 6" in size bypassing the internal Logitech amp. Does well enough to fill in the bass for music with the current setup. I don't think the Fosi can handle a bigger un-powered sub well unless it was a very high efficiency sub. That sub would cost 2 3 4x more at least than the Fosi.  Really it's a budget setup I have and the Schitt is great really helps things out... they make excellent products. Overall my system is generally decent or better for the investment vs a Logitech or other powered system.
5,Works great love the fact that the crossover freq and sub volume are both separate knobs.  That let me use a set of tower speakers as a makeshift subwoofer while my actual subwoofer was on the way.  As good as that sounded I probably wouldn't have ordered the subwoofer if I'd heard that setup before ordering the subwoofer!I bought this because it supports both passive subwoofers and powered.  This is the only one I found with that feature in the sub-$100 range.Based on the reviews here I was concerned about BT creeping in and taking over as the active input when not wanted but I'm not getting any weird behavior from it.  I don't need BT audio just wired hookups so I didn't even connect the BT antenna.  In that setup it's just like an amp that only has wired inputs.  To be fair none of my devices have ever been hooked to it so there's no temptation to connect to any of them because they remain unknown devices.  I only needed it to be a wired amp and for that it seems to work great so far -- about a month so far.  It runs 24/7 on my computer to drive bookshelf speakers and it stays room temperature.  Would buy again if I needed another similar amp in this price range.
5,Update 11 Months After Purchase: Absolutely great amp - still working fine almost a year since purchased and never had a problem. Small size; decent fidelity audio; low noise; analog inputs and outputs runs cool all day at 90% volume; high-quality volume bass treble and subwoofer (potentiometer) controls; all at a reasonable price. Bluetooth connections to my phone are solid. I can't say enough good things about this amp. However the one thing I wish they'd change is the banana jacks on the back for L & R audio out. Generally bananas are only used for high wattage systems where you do not want current-limiting elements of the design to affect peak output responses. I would have preferred standard RCA connectors since this is not a high-power amp. Fortunately RCA jacks are used for the audio in jacks.  Perfect for powering small speakers: I drive a pair of refurbished JBL Control 1s and a Yamaha subwoofer with it. Really nice for low to medium volume groovin!DESIGNERS: Congratulations this is a very nice design - but in future revisions change the bananas to RCA jacks.
5,Works good so far good price
5,Very pleased with this purchased.  Powers my Infinity InfiniTesimal RS 0.1s just fine.  I am using this to power my computer multimedia sound.  Tested both Bluetooth and wired connections from my computer and phone.  Everything has worked as advertised.  Subwoofer connection both powered and passive works great also.  I can with confidence recommend this amp.
5,No problems so far. Not as loud a full size receiver but more than enough for my usage. Draws about 5 watts which is practically nothing. Not enough resistance on the control knobs which are quite small but the unit is also smaller than I expected. No detents for the bass and treble neutral positions and the curve for these adjustments are different than what I'm used to but fortunately I don't need this adjustment with my speakers. Volume control is not linear at all and very touchy at very low volumes. The power switch appears to be the weak point but it looks like it could be replaced when the time comes. This sounds like a lot of complaints but I'm quite happy with it overall.
5,I was looking for something compact that can deliver enough sound to my outdoor speakers for my pool. I have two outdoor 8” subs in ground with 14/2 direct buried cable and 2 wall mounted 6.5 outdoor speakers. The subs are tied together to the sub channel and the smaller speakers on left and right channels respectively. Theres enough power to make it crystal clear and pleasant. Its not going to power a stadium but it packs enough to get my system sounding great. The bluetooth works great from every part of my pool including the farthest points from the device. Very happy with this purchase and hoping that the durability is as good as the sound.
5,I replaced a 4 year old SMSL Q5 Pro with the BT30D amp. It's attached to my desktop computer and connected to an 8" OSD Audio PS88 powered sub and a pair of Micca MB42X bookshelf speakers. The SMSL was overkill even though I liked all the connection points. I just need something that connects to the mac mini headphone jack and has the best quality. This BT30 does the job admirably. I do like the fact that it can drive a passive or active sub. I like to make my own speakers and this gives me more options to tinker with.I initially had a problem getting a signal to the sub when wired to the mac. Signal was fine over bluetooth. Working with Carlos at tech support we determined my cable was bad. Once that was replaced it works great with both connection methods.I especially like the way it connects to bluetooth sources. No passwords. Just select and play. Anyone can turn on the switch in the office and play what they want from their phone.Sound quality and output power seem superior to the SMSL and the power supply doesn't spark when you plug it in! (SMSL issue) I don't miss the remote control since it's right next to the computer keyboard and my phone is the remote when playing from that source.Great product great price. Good support. I highly recommend you consider the BT30D as a no frills get it done audiophile quality amp.
4,There is a lot to like about this unit. The form factor is small making it versatile for placement  and the power it can put out is impressive for both the unit size and wattage range. However the receiver cannot handle full volume. With the volume all the way up anything that pegs the needle volume-wise causes the receiver to cut out for a few seconds likely as some kind of fail safe. I only knocked off 1 star because I would literally damage my hearing if I listened to the unit at full volume (read over 110 dB on my meter)
5,Hooked the amp up to 2 12" 2 way speakers and one 15" (100 oz. magnet SPL 98DB) speaker for the subwoofer output. Ran signal from ipod using the headphone jack and rca plugs. There was minimal hiss when no signal was present. Turning the volume up too fast caused the volume to cut out out on all speakers. The more the amp was played the less this happened. Switched to bluetooth input from ipod and the signal was clearer and hiss was reduced significantly. Clarity from all speakers was great. Could not believe the sound from the 15" speaker full and low. Could hear the lows (thump) in another room without being able to distinguish the song. Very pleased with output of the amp for the size. As I played it more the ability to turn the amp up and not have it cut it diminished. Being able to to adjust the output of the left and right speakers with the sub out is a great feature for a obtaining a balanced sound no matter what speakers you are using. For its size this amp puts out a lot of sound. The more efficient your speakers are the  easier it will be to get them loud at a lower amp volume. I have not used the passive sub out yet so I cannot give it a rating.For its size and price this amp is a great value. Hope it lasts a long time.
3,This WILL NOT connect to anaudio technica lp60x-BT turntable the turntable will connect to other Bluetooth speakers but will not connect to this amplifier which is a real bummer because that’s the only reason I even bought this particular unit
5,I had been reading about Class D amplifiers supposedly the wave of the future in audio. So I purchased the Fosi Audio BT30D for my home office.  My  older system and basis for comparison includes a Yamaha receiver and a pair of (original) Advent speakers and I am still quite happy with this system.I paired the BT30D with Dayton Audio B652 Bookshelf Speakers ($65a pair) and a Yamaha 8"  Subwoofer ($150) and I am amazed by the quality of sound from this $305 system.  The first thing I noticed was how crisp the sound was.  The total harmonic distortion spec is 0.04% from 20 HZ to 20 kHz +/- 1dB. Compare with the Yamaha R-N303 Stereo Receiver ($300) spec of 0.2% THD from 40 Hz to 20 kHz (actually pretty good).  So using the BT30D I am hearing sharper detail than with my older system.Even without the subwoofer the BT30D and Dayton Audio speakers would be a dynamite and satisfying combination in a college dorm room or small apartment at a total of $155!  The Dayton speakers have enough bass (down to 70 Hz) for most non-classical program material.
5,Its just a quality amp. watch any of the jillions of videos about it. its just plain good. why mess around on bargain brand amps? this is clearly the answer.
2,I connect these to Apple Airport Express and some speakers so that I can have sound in every room. The Airport Expresses are connected to the LAN and my music server controls all the music. I can use Apple Script to change volume or turn the music on or off in each room. Since I have two homes I have to have a lot of these.Having a dozen of these I have only had two fail. One of the units Fosi replaced the board under warranty. I had to install the new board but it was a piece of cake. These units are on 24/7 and many have been on for years.The other unit developed a really annoying click and no matter what I did it didn't go away. I attempted to contact Fosi but was unable to. See below. I am making a video of me using the uint as a door stop and then shooting the bad unit from 300 yards since it is totally worthless now. I want to let Fosi know how much disdain I have for their total lack of customer service. I figure that video might spur them on to do better in that department. (This is not meant as a threat just a gage to show what a bad unit can be used for).One issue I don't like is that Fosi is near impossible to contact. That is a big turn off for me. It was a nightmare to get the board replaced in the unit that failed. Not happy about that. This cost Fosi 2 stars.The other issue I have is the inability to change the name of the Bluetooth. I have two near each other in guest bedrooms and can't change the Bluetooth name. My guests use Bluetooth to play their own music and just have to experiment with the two identical names to figure out which one is controlling their room. This gets Fosi another star taken away.The sound is good. No big issues in that respect.
5,I've only used it a few times so far but it's seems to meet my expectations (I'm sure nobody expects it to equal a Carver amp!).  I don't notice any stray humming hissing or distortion sounds.  The ability to control the subwoofer independently from the satellites is great (I like deep base but not overpowering / booming bass).  The Bluetooth must be manually connected each time by opening the phone's Bluetooth settings and selecting the Fosi.  I.E. It doesn't re-connect automatically to a previously paired device.  I didn't see a way to setup a PIN to prevent stray connections to it but assuming you turn it off when not in use that shouldn't be a problem.  I was concerned that a stray Bluetooth connection request might "steal" an active connection but that doesn't seem to be a problem.  I tried turning it up loud whereupon it cut-out till I turned it down.  I assume it's a protection circuit.  It wasn't terribly loud when it cut-out so keep your expectations reasonable and you'll be happy.  One caveat - the banana sockets are quite close together and since banana plugs can wobble a bit I was concerned they might bump each other and create a short circuit (my banana plugs have exposed metal ... stupid design?!).  I slid a popsicle stick between the red and black plugs so they can't touch.  Just a caveat.
5,I honestly didn't know what to expect. Never heard of the brand before. But I recently found an ancient pair of Pioneer 3-way speakers that my parents bought for me back when I was a teenager in the early 90's. They were stored in a box in pretty good physical condition.I wanted to see if they'd still work but I didn't have an amplifier at home. So I decided to get this little amp a shot. I had my doubts but it worked better than expected.The power may not be ground shaking but it's more than enough for desk use (HUGE speakers for a desk I know... may have to move them later). But it sounds good even without a subwoofer (I'm sure I have one stored in a box will update if I find it).Anyway very pleased with the sound....
4,Packaged nicely works well easy to hook up exactly as described. I have no regrets about my purchase.  Only thing I found off is you need to turn off bluetooth on the device that's paired to disconnect bluetooth and move to the physical input. But because of that it also means you don't need to hit a button to change to bluetooth and can do from across the room on your phone. Haven't noticed any audio issues. I have noticed a slight hiss when volume is turned up high with no input but it is barely noticeable and only if you're paying attention my computer fans drown the noise out and is no way a turn off from buying it.*EDIT* Took away a star for the noticeable sudden volume reduction it does randomly. You turn it up for a good song and suddenly it's quieter and the sub output is way more noticeably reduced along with the "fullness" of it. Still a great buy for the price I think it's overheating or something and protecting itself I think I would buy a higher power one if I could do it again but there's nothing with the options this has in a higher output available. But regardless fantastic build quality and it's still holding up.
5,Garage amp for garage speakers
5,Works great with a pair of Polk Audio speakers on the boat dock. Connects quickly and has a great range.
5,Wow I am amazed at how well this small inexpensive amp works! I have been really dissatisfied with listening to music with my home surround system the Sony STR DH 590. It works fine for tv and movies but the music options are very dull. I ordered this little Fosi amp BTD 30 D and hooked it up to a CD player and it sounds so much better than through the Sony. The subwoofer output is great! Love this new little amp. Now I have the two main front speakers powered with both amps using the Solupeak P2 switch to change between amps. Loving it!
5,I bought this to use on my computer and replace the huge Onkyo 7.1 receiver I was using that took up a ton of space and produced a lot of heat.  I was only using 2 channels and going to a passive sub so I thought I would try this.  I have it connected to a set of Boston Acoustics full tower speakers and wired the sub output to an 8ohm Dual Voicecoil Sub putting a 4ohm load on the Amp.  Amazingly it sounds every bit as good as the larger and higher power Onkyo.  Bass and Treble adjustments work as they should and the volume is linear and easy turn.  Connecting to Bluetooth is easy and sounds as good as a wired connection.  I can't rate this high enough given the price point.The only drawback to this unit is the binding posts on the back are not a standard distance apart so a one piece banana clip does not fit.  A single banana clip fits just fine.  This is hard to complain about as to have a normal banana clip fit they would have to increase the size of the chassis.  Great job Fosi audio.
5,Bought this to run small computer speakers along with a subwoofer I built.  Provides plenty of power for that use and sounds great at high volumes.  No clue how this would work with larger speakers but for my use it is perfect.  My only gripe is it does not auto-reconnect if you move too far away when connected to Bluetooth.  Built well and does not get hot at all (neigher the power supply or amp itself) and the adjustability of the crossover/volume for the sub lets you blend everything together perfectly.
5,Good for its price and position. Using with MICCA MB42X passive speakers as PC speakers
4,Works better than expected
5,I got this to replace my Topping MX3 and oh what a great little amp. I can get my two Polk T15s and 10" sub above 100db with zero issues or I can run them as quite as I'd like without losing clarity at either end. I had worried about interference but even with a CRT running inches from the amp I've had no issues.
5,After about a month of use the Fosi Audio BT30D continues to perform surprisingly well. It tends to remain cool despite being powered on 24/7 as the amp driving a six speaker high powered impedance controlled system plus a powered sub stapled to a MacBook Pro running Bluetooth 4.0. Although the Fosi's 5.0 readily connects to the MacBook it tends to drop the signal 30 seconds or so following the initial handshake. A quick reconnect and the unit remains paired to the laptop with no further issues.Sound quality is far far better than expected. While it's not going to deafen the neighbors this little guy packs a surprising amount of latency-free punch as a compact desktop amp on steroids. The ability to adjust the 300W powered subwoofer volume and crossover point from the amp's faceplate controls is an added convenience.Although we've only been together for a month at this point it's fair to say I'm pleased with the purchase and would do it again.
5,Using the amp to run some small speakers in the bedroom. Most critical part for me as that there was no background hiss and a smooth frequency response with low distortion high power was not a consideration as I only listen at low to medium volumes. This amp exceeded my expectations. Plenty of volume for my application Dead quiet and easily connects to my phone. Very clean sounding without any harshness. Physically solid with a little heft. Knobs don’t have detents which I prefer. More that perfect for my application.
5,Didn’t really think this little amp would work but it is awesome!! I had 2 outdoor Yamaha outdoor speakers when I bought my house. I ordered the RCA jacks to hook up the speakers and turned it on. It powered them perfectly and they are loud! Very impressed!
5,I've bought three of these devices one for my office one for my home audio and one for my son's apartment.  The sound quality is great and full.  Having the adjustments for bass treble and even sub level was well thought out.  One set I use with a Pyle zone switch so I can select living room speakers or patio speakers.  Nice to have the option for audio input as well as Bluetooth.  Very pleased with my purchase.
4,Works great for my poor sounding laptop slight annoying buss from speakers when laptop goes so sleep.Have to manually pair after sleep mode.
5,This amp has a very clean sound and fit my needs to power a couple of sealed enclosure speakers I was given. At 50 watts it doesn't produce the high volume levels one might desire for full-throttle rock albums (in part because of the speakers) but it almost does and is excellent for a system you might use while entertaining. Bluetooth works really well re-connecting while I was about 60 feet away and outside but suffered just a bit at 30 feet if the wrong kind of object (refrigerator) was in the way.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how loud and good this sounds. My old onkyo is louder but I never use it at that volume as I'd like my ears not to ring. This thing is still quite loud. Louder than I need. It has good sound quality. The bass on the main speakers is a little less than what my onkyo is but not much. The subwoofer fills that in though with a little adjustment. On the flip side of the coin it's got more treble. It's very clear  and sounds great on my polk audio speakers and sub.  It has the controls.that I like on my sound equipment. A nice plus is the sub frequency adjustment on this thing means I don't have crawl on the floor to adjust anything on my subwoofer to balance it all out. It works with both powered and passive subs. Seems well built knobs feel nice and it's small. The onkyo I had was just.overkill and too big for my living room. Pretty happy with it. The only con is the power supply died. Not completely it got quieter and quieter. New supply from an old laptop with an 8 Amp rating workes great.
5,This little receiver performs exactly as you'd hope. I use this for my office desktop setup in which I connect two 50W Sony bookshelf speakers and a Monoprice 8" powered 60W subwoofer. Piggy-backing on a (finally) reliable and super quick Bluetooth 5.0 device connection is solid at all usable ranges (I can walk to the other side of my house and maintain connection not that I'd ever need to). EQ knobs are a godsend (not common in other Bluetooth receivers) as well as being able to tweak subwoofer parameters (Volume and Freq cutoff) from on the desk rather than bending over and reaching behind the sub. As always there is a little white noise in the speakers when the system is in use (which is more noticeable in my setup as the speakers are about 3ft away from me) and I'd love to find a way to reduce that. If you have LOTS of noise in your speakers make sure to double check that you are not creating a ground loop between the receiver and subwoofer (plug both into the same power strip) and that speaker wires aren't running alongside powered AC lines. This guy was the perfect solution for my office audio workflow!
5,Was important to play music quite and have good quality sound.  I have 100W 8ohm speakers. Plays better than from my original sony theater amplifier which i hate.
4,I have a good pair of bookshelf speakers and the sound quality for stereo right and left is very good with a flat to somewhat dry response but very clean. The only reason I gave the BT30D less than 5 stars is the bass. First of all the Sub Volume knob is subject to the overall Volume knob not an independent volume circuit as I had expected. I wired up a passive sub-woofer and the output to the woofer is very minimal even when the bass volume is cranked fully. I will try a powered sub-woofer next to see if I can shape the sound using the powered volume knobs. Second there is an audible hiss on the passive Sub channel even when all volume is minimized. Overall however the BT30D is worth the price the cons are the bass which you have to crank. The pros are a clean stereo even at very high volumes.
5,This is a great amp. Survives Phoenix in all elements.
5,Bought this to hook up some outdoor speakers for Bluetooth streaming. Set it up indoors to test it out … sweet! Bluetooth connection is straight forward and comfortably drives a pair of Bose outdoor speakers. Happy with it
3,Good but is not good enough if you have a great patio sound speakers with 100w each one. I have two speaker Polk Atrium 6 plus the subwoofer 130w with max volume and is not enough. This one has only 50w each speaker and 100w the subwoofer total 200w. The equalizer is pretty well but low sound. Aluminum cage and bottoms. Not what I need.
3,Tried this for a few weeks and was just not happy with the sound quality. Upgraded to a Fosi Audio DA2120C and am much happier with it. Well worth the extra money.
5,I bought this amp for these specific features which are a bit difficult to get in combination:  Line in AND Bluetooth input passive AND powered subwoofer outputs adjustable subwoofer frequency and relative volume and importantly MASTER volume control which some other comparable amps lacked meaning you would have to adjust the subwoofer output separately when changing overall volume.  I cobbled together a desktop system from leftover speakers and subwoofer from other systems none of which were special and it sounds fantastic.  Some notes:  Despite its power rating it is not as loud as an old Lepai amp with one quarter the power given the same input.  But... CLEAN sounding.  I am quite happy with this amp so far and find I am listening to music more than I was.
2,I can't help but wonder if mine is defective given the general praise in the reviews. I have several stereo amps and this one only competes with my cheapo $15 Kinter I bought years ago for a cheap low-standards project. There is no low-end when running in 2.0. It's as if they assume everyone will be running a subwoofer so they implemented a non-defeatable (to my knowledge) high pass for the L and R channels. I've tried playing with the subwoofer dials to no effect. The overall gain is also unimpressive for such an allegedly-powerful device.I run the same speakers (Dayton B652-Air) in my garage with a cheaper Lepai amp and it sounds significantly more full and rich and even a bit louder. It is all the more curious because that's powering small speakers in a fairly big garage whereas I'm using the Fosi in my master bedroom with the speakers located in corners (which should help the low end). As it stands the low end struggles to match the 2.0 Vizio soundbar I have been using in my bedroom that barely cost more than this amp alone. It's an impressive soundbar to be fair but these speakers are capable of so much more than this and I only need walk 30ft to prove it.Really the only good I can say about this device is that the build quality is great and the idea (built in sub amp) is appealing. The rest is a complete disappointment. If you know you'll be running a subwoofer then I guess you may be happy--but just out of principle I don't like that this requires you to do so to sound as good as competing amps.Not recommended. You can find better for the same money or less.
5,Hooked up 2 monitors and a 10" JBL car sub to it. Sounds great. Just what I needed
5,Used to power 5 speak setup - 4 Polk bookshelf speakers and a powered Polk SW.  Amazing sound easy setup and solves problem of how to power room speakers unobtrusively  - without a huge receiver or amp sitting  around. Highly reccomnd
3,Sound quality is just fine. Setup is super simple.A couple issues with my unit right out of the box:Bluetooth: Not sure why but the bluetooth will randomly disconnect. It's not frequent but it's happened about 3 times in the week since I bought it.Speaker Power: Again no idea what the issue is but my speakers will lose power randomly. This is almost always right after starting up the unit. When this happens the sub continues to get audio input from the amp but the speakers will go silent intermittently. It usually clears up after a restart of the amp.Other than those two issues the unit will run flawlessly for hours a time and really improves the ambiance of my office. I also like that it's TINY. I probably wouldn't buy it again because it seems like quality control may be lacking at the Fosi HQ but so far it's not enough of a hassle that I feel I need to return it.
5,HS. Take your stand receiver and put it in your palm.  I still have my bad boy home theater receiver but if you want something with a sub outlet control this is bad ass.
5,For connecting speakers at my patio
5,Excelente relación precio/calidadLo compré para instalar en mi espacio de home office y resultó perfecto.Conectado a parlantes Polk gama media y a un subwoofer el sonido es más que satisfactorio y superó mis expectativas.La entrada RCA y por Bluetooth funcionan sin problemas. Muy fácil de instalar y manejar.Completamente recomendable.
5,Well made compact unit that is able to directly drive a sub. Very happy with product.
5,I got this unit in early April to put on my deck outside with an old set of speakers versus buying new wireless portable bluetooth units. I'm running a set of 30 yr old 2nd hand Acoustic Research AR102s and a 20+ year old Centrios 8" passive sub. I am pushing Pandora from my iPhone 12 or other source via BT. I am amazed at what the combo is doing - great full spacious clear sound at any volume for any genre I've put to it. Can't believe my good fortune for getting such a great rig for so little $$; years ago sound like this would have been only from very high (RMS) power big $$ sets - and now I'm enjoying outside on my deck from  24VDC power supplied unit... wow.
5,I was a little skeptical about this amp and was willing to try it because if I didn’t like it I could return it. I do NOT want to return it. I have it hooked up to my Klipsch 650 all weather speakers and it is plenty loud for the porch and makes the speakers sing!!! Next step will be to hook up a sub but according to the manual it is not necessary to have the sub connected if you don’t have one. Connection to Bluetooth is pretty simple and pretty reliable from my iPad. I have the amp inside the house and my tablet outside with me about 25 feet away. The box itself feels smooth and sturdy and the knobs turn smoothly. Nothing about it feels cheap. I’m in love!!
5,I needed a small unit to replace a failing unit in our kitchen. Thought I’d give this a try given the positive reviews and the price was certainly right. I couldn’t be happier. This little amp has all the power I need to drive two speakers and a powered sub. The sound is remarkable for such a small unit and the connections/controls are simple and elegant. Connected it to an echo dot and the family is happy as can be with the connectivity and voice control. Highly recommended.
5,I had recently upgraded my PC/multimedia sound system. Although I am not new to BT or AV tech I have never used an external receiver for an entertainment system. I needed something to power a pair of 50 watt speakers and also have a sub out. I found this little jobber. After a quick read I decided to pull the trigger. Currently running wired. It's a nice little unit. Separate volume for subwoofer and subwoofer freq controls are nice. Bass and treble are what you expect but if you are like me you are probably using a digital EQ. Thing rocks on 50 watt speakers @ half volume. Feels like there's still plenty of headroom. I was surprised that something so small and inexpensive would sound so darn good. Give it a spin.
5,Excellent sounding amp with an appropriate pair of bookshelf speakers. A powered sub really helps the sound although there is an internal amp channel for a small sub. I’ve had the best results with a larger 10-12” powered sub. Bluetooth connectivity has been flawless! I really am impressed with this amp and no longer even bother with a receiver.The caveat is that the first unit I bought and fell in love with has in my opinion a much stronger output. It’s really loud and punchy! The other 2 units are still good but just don’t hit like the first. I’ve done AB and C side-by-side comparisons to confirm this. I’m not sure if Fosi detuned the output a bit but it’s noticeable. Just my observation.... hope the review helps!
5,Better than I expected.I have a separate sub woofer and this amp accommodates it. By the way it has separate outputs for a powered or a passive sub woofer - a nice feature. Aside from that it has separate volume and frequency knobs for the subwoofer. Another nice feature.This amp sounds so fine I couldn't be any happier.The sounds coming out of my computer are far more than I ever expected and this Fosi Audio amp is a large reason why.  Very nice to listen to. Part of the reason is that the amp came buneled with the Fosi Tube-P1 pre-amp. Get this if they still offer it. Together this pair is dynamite!I consider this an "audiophile" level amp it is that good.Highly recommended.
4,Sound is good and the subwoofer part of the amp works well. I can adjust the subwoofer sound to match the music. I do not have to go to the subwoofer to adjust. Powered subwoofers is adjusted at the subwoofer. I like the sound.
5,Nothing
5,The Fosi Audio BT30D receiver doesn't disappoint. It was a good buy. Construction is solid. It's sound is clear and strong.  If you have book shelf speakers just laying around use this receiver to connect you wont be disappointed. The Bluetooth connectivity is an added bonus.
5,I picked up the 2.1 version of this receiver for my in ceiling speakers in my basement. They speakers are two 100watt speakers with 1 50 - 300 watt sub. I was a bit worried that this wouldn't pack enough punch for my application; but boy was i wrong.Pros -Smaller than you would thinkThis thing has some weight to it and feels nice.The knobs and switches have a great resistance to themAudio is clear with no crackling or white noiseBluetooth set up requires no password and is very easy to set up(small) Cons:If you have regular speaker wire its going to be extremely annoying to wire these up given the size of the unit.toggling between bluetooth and line-in requires you to toggle a switch in the back of the unit. Theres no smart switching based on audio received.No remote (but really who uses these things!?). You'll need to make some time to find your max volume and then adjust your media device accordingly.Over all i'm very happy with my choice and wouldn't hesitate to pick one of these up again!
5,Exactly what I was expecting.The sound quality is good the ability to hook up passive speakers + a passive subwoofer and retain good sound quality and volume speak to the quality. Much more practical than a big receiver if you're using this for studio monitors for your computer or a stereo setup or something. Worth the money!
5,I have 2 satellite speakers & a sub-woofer for my PC. This gives me strong & clean sound. I'm a bass player so I like to be able to turn up the bass. It looks good too. Just the right amount of what I want. There may be more expensive units that do more. For under $100 this is great. I haven't used the Bluetooth connection yet.
5,Bought this amp to power a sonotube 10" sub-woofer for my home stereo.  Very happy with the performance.
5,Very good sound
5,For the money and what was trying to accomplish (garage stereo) for when doing whatever in garage it’s absolutely perfect. Hooked up to a car subwoofer(removed from old car) and two bookshelf speakers. To adjust frequency of sub from bookshelf for under 100 bucks perfect IMO. Sounds pretty good too. Recommended. Only thing I’d add to it is get banana clips for speaker wires to make a cleaner install. Other than that…absolutely no complaints.
5,Works really well for the price.  Amp has very good s/n ratio and has a nice frequency response.I only use it for small office and don't turn it up past about 1 to 2 watts.I have a powered sub connected to it. The sub frequency control on the amp works well.
4,Repurposed wired outdoor speakers to provide blue tooth audio at pool. Simple to setup and use. Great value.
5,Perfect for a medium sized home gym.  Using two Polk Audio bookshelf speakers and an Energy 8" powered sub.  Decent power and really strong bluetooth connection.  I just use my phone as the source.
5,Just hooked this up to two existing outside speakers - and - its loud and has pretty good sound - all controls work properly - love it !
5,This works well; i haven't used it extensively but the few times I have it works great with clean dynamic sound output from Sony "bookshelf" speakers.
4,High build quality. Very reliable. After one month of use never had problem with bluetooth conectivity or sound quality. Love the fact it has both stereo and subwoofer passive outputs. Wish it had more power for stereo channels (use it for outdoor).
4,Very nice.The first setup had 2 Yamaha 3-way bookshelf type speakers and a passive 8” Panasonic subwoofer. No dice. Couldn’t push all that speaker. Swapped out the subwoofer for a 10” active Yamaha subwoofer and yeah. NoiceHooks up every time through Apple devices though Spotify. Best way.Optical cable from TV works but you need to adjust the volume manually via the knobs. Not great.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Pretty good controls definitely beats my home theatre amp I used to have
5,Unit works well and connects without difficulty to Bluetooth devices. The unit seems marginal on power output and I suspect it may be overrated. The sub output and levels works as expected.
2,Had to return because the RCA inputs were dead.Might have tried again to get one that was in working order BUT there is no BlueTooth pairing mode.  If the amp is on and not already connected to YOUR bluetooth device (phone/tablet) it's wide open for ANYONE to pair.  We're too close to our neighbors who have mischievous teenage kids for that to be acceptable.  This is the ONLY bluetooth speaker/amp/adapter/etc I have ever tried to use that didn't require entering some kind of pairing mode to connect and memory for at least a few previously paired devices.Also worth noting that I had it connected to a couple of 8-ohm bookshelf speakers and RCA sub out to a powered sub.  With the sub turned on couldn't ever to get things adjusted (crossover bass level gain on sub etc.) so that I could still hear the bass without the bass overpowering everything.  With the sub turned off the amp doesn't have enough power to drive ANY low end on the passive speakers.  Volume had to be at about 80% to get to a normal listening volume.  Not sure why it has to be too-much vs. nothing....so on to something else.
3,I like the small package and bluetooth connectivity but it really doesnt matter if you dont enjoy the sound.  Bass is under powered even with bass turned up to max.
5,I bought the model that powers not only speakers but a sub as well. After two years of use I have absolutely no complaints. Connects to bluetooth flawlessly every time and sounds excellent. Powers an 8" Audioengine sub and two Elac UB52's wonderfully. Highly recommended.
5,Updating the review again because tech support is ok but the amplifiers rock nothing to complain.This is an update to the 5 star review I down graded it to 3 because the support is not all that great I asked Fosi 1 question and it took a day to get back asking for more information on that questions. Support not so great.Connected it to Jamo S803 speakers and it rocks! Waiting on my Jamo S808 subwoofer and I am sure this will be a killer combination. I play music from my PS3 using rca connectors and Bluetooth and both are amazing. Using Amazon basics 16 gauge audio cables and monoprice banana plugs.
5,This thing connects to Bluetooth immediately and sounds awesome I use it to power 4 Meyer mid highs and 2 surface mounted 8 inch speakers as subs.The amp runs well even during high heat of the summer I have it mounted in a gazebo tent and it's exposed to moisture and heat all day...so far no issues.Great deal and the sub levels and frequency crossover are super helpful to tune.
4,Sounds really clear and has plenty of power to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers. One thing to note is that there is very noticeable background noise by default. I highly recommend turning the treble down to 33% to mitigate this issue. The system is perfect otherwise. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.Update: I purchased an 8A power supply from the Fosi website. Night and day in terms of sound quality improvement.
5,My JVC mini-rack that cost nearly $1000 in 1993 finally gave up the ghost so I needed a replacement.  I am powering 2 JVC satellite speakers 2 Realistic home stereo 3-speaker cabinets and 2 12" Bazooka subwoofers with this unit.  I am running 2 speakers on each channel and I did not bridge the subs.  The sound is crisp and the controls are adequate to balance the sound.  Cranked to 11 I am not breaking windows or vibrating plates out of the cupboards but it's more than enough for home entertainment.  The Bluetooth receiver has a long range and the volume is just as good as plugging in directly.
4,Compact and fit my need love it.
4,Good mini amp but not for the beginner.  Having full subwoofer controls make it more suitable for the more experienced audio enthusiast.  Well built sounds good and can't beat the price.  If your looking to get into better sound  the BT30D is a good first step.
3,This amp was way underpowered. It struggled to power my Klipsch indoor/outdoor speakers. I purchased a 2 channel Onkyo receiver instead.
5,Small. great sound ample power  and nicely priced.  There are very few 2.1 Amps on the Market and this is a prime Choice.  I used it to replace a broken Proreck Party 10 Speaker (Not supported or backed with a warranty) and it sounds fantastic.  It is small so can easily be mounted in the back of the speaker and the Blue tooth connection is very reliable.
5,I just got this hooked up 30 minutes ago but I was so impressed I had to come write a review. Good quality sound powerful feels really well built. Was easy to set up allows for either banana clips or regular strip the wire and tighten it down. I bought this to go between my basement gym and then for out on my patio. I'll update if there is anything new but at $85 this is a great value and simple solution to your audio needs.
5,This little amp is just amazing! I hooked it up to my old Bose 201s and I was blown away by the purity and punch of the sound. I also added a DAC converter for my TV plus a passive subwoofer from an old A/V system.  I can now enjoy movie theater sound even without a center speaker and rear surrounds.  The Fosi mini amp is an excellent investment if you want great sound at a budget price.
5,This was a great value amp. The bluetooth connection works very easily with my phone connects automatically once it has been paired for the first time. My only complaint is that there is a little static in the speakers when using bluetooth with my Pioneer SP-B522 speakers. I'm not sure if this is my phone's fault or the amp's. I haven't tried using the RCA input yet but I plan to connect this to a TV for better audio.Overall build quality seems awesome. Very sturdy feeling case and knobs.
4,It is good for me to control bass and treble but Bluetooth connection is bad. I used just 10bucks amp Damgoo that looks very lame but bluetooth connection was awsome.Subwoofer works well with this amp.
5,For under $100 can't be beat. Excellent sound quality.
4,It clips at high volume .. the overall not a bad deal was they offered one with little more power .. Bluetooth range pretty fair
5,Ignore the negative reviews! This thing sounds crystal clear on my 2 8ohm 100w bookshelf speakers delivers beautiful bass to a powered sub and offers great control of the mids and bass! Very satisfied for the money!
5,Used with my desktop PC Boston Acoustics speakers and a Polk subwoofer for quality audio.  This featherweight unit is well-made and punches well above its class. The separate subwoofer channel is excellent.  Power into 8ohms isn't deafening but more than loud enough for near-field listening.
5,WOW!  I’m not a review writer but this little guy deserves some respect.  Bought it for my office at home.  Had some klipsch bookcase wired speakers not being used anymore so I bought this little fossi amp to sit on my desk hooked up a klipsch subwoofer and sweet!  Thanks Fosi and now for the fun!  Here comes A great big world!
5,Love this is made listening to music around the pool better. Would be nice if it came with the connectors to hook to speaker wires but great product
5,Needed a 2nd system in our office for computer audio and Bluetooth devices separate from the home theater already in place. Connected 2 ceiling mounted Orb Audio speakers and a Polk Audio powered sub-woofer (using RCA connections). Once the bass balance is dialed in between the Fosi Amp and the sub-woofer amp and both the treble and bass levels are dialed in for the complete system of speakers the sound is excellent. The Bluetooth signal is great. The only change I would make would be to relocate the Bluetooth/Aux switch from the rear of the amp to the front for easier access when switching  between Aux and Bluetooth devices but this is not enough to reduce the overall rating.
5,Amazing little amp. I'm driving a pair of infinity reference 8 ohm bookshelf speakers and a 12 inch infinity passive sub off this amp in a 600 ft2 basement. At 8 ohms load the amp is plenty loud for a dance party
4,The volume is large but the sound quality is ordinary and the sound field is narrow.
5,Very nice quality and does the job..I'm guessing it's around 20-25 watts rms per channel from 50 watts max but that's enough to push most speakers..I'm pushing a pair of klipsch b2 bookshelves and they sound great..the sub out for a powered sub is perfect for my little 2.1 setup..Very Impressed 👍🏽
4,I hooked the unit up Friday and have only listened to it for a couple of days.  Pros: the sound is clean.  The unit is small and doesn't take up much space. It's simple to use and the knobs provide feed back when turning.  Cons: The BT switch is on the back. There is no 3.5 mm jack input so an adapter from 3.5 to RCA is going to have to be purchased.Other than those minor inconveniences I am pleased so far.
5,Very solid little amp.  Connected to Bluetooth quickly and was very stable. Worked well for me.
5,great product and fast shippin
5,I put this is our rv. It made a huge difference in the sound quality. It handles 4 rockford speakers and a 6in sub very well.
5,I like the sub out. I added a 10" Klipsch sub to it & the small bookshelf speakers I have hooked to it. The Bluetooth works great. Very few of those pesky dropouts I have experienced with other amps in the past
5,This is the second one I bought. I used the first one to power a vintage speaker box that had two massive speakers and a bass. I have a similar set up for my shop and bought this to power it. They both work great. They are not expensive and have a small foot print. The unit doesn't get hot when put under load unlike the old RCA receiver I had that took up half the shop.
5,Using this in a workshop paired with a set of Polk bookshelf speakers. For the money the sound quality was very good and provided plenty of volume. One note: Getting the speaker wires attached correctly took a little adjusting since I kept getting a short and cutting out at higher volume. I think this was a problem with the banana plug. The Bluetooth connectivity has been flawless so far with a decent range.
5,Thought I could use RCA cable to integrate into existing stereo receiver but that was my fault.  Plugged in some sub-par Panosonic speakers and sub-woffer but still sounds great!
5,Used it to add stereo to my workbench is amazing!
3,Thin music does well on this but as soon as you play anything thick and heavy with mids and lows it distorts a lot on the top end
5,Muy buen producto cumplió mis expectativas
5,I bought this for my Bose bookshelf speakers and the sound is awesome also you need to get stereo.RCA L/R  phono to speaker banana plugs wich they dont mention it but after that u good to go .
5,Nifty little amplifier. Using it on my Echo Dot to drive a pair of Infinity speakers and a Polk Audio subwoofer. No problem pushing them to louder volumes than I need.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to set up a pair of speakers and subwoofer.
5,Product provides very good sound over Bluetooth. Just wondering why Amazon is selling it for $89 while it's on the Fosi website for $75.BT30D Bluetooth 5.0 2.1 Channel Power Amplifier with Bass and Treble Control20 reviewsSave $14.40Price:Sale price$75.59Regular price$89.99
5,This is my first Class D switching amplifier.Works great in my application.
5,I liked the way they designed and the performances.
5,Bought this to plug into my old Alexa dot version 2 to improve the sound from the dot in our bedroom. Build quality looks great. Easy to make all the connections. I had two old Bose speakers and an Aiwa powered sub woofer. Great sound and volume. Very happy.
5,Excellent design feature packed amp for a small space.
5,received this and hooked up to some old speakers for my patio.  Amazing sound quality.  You won't be disappointed. Not arena rock band powerful but for a typical patio....just right.
2,I really wanted to like this -- so many other people have had good experiences -- but I must've gotten a lemon.  First the left and right channels both have a loud hiss in the treble band.  I've verified that it's not coming from my audio source but it's the amplifier itself.  Second the amp-driven subwoofer output (the banana jacks for passive sub not the line-level RCA out for a powered sub) can only drive ~3.6 milliwatts to my 4 ohm subwoofer not 100 watts.  I tried contacting Fosi but didn't get a response.The upshot is that the L/R channels drive plenty of power the build quality feels solid and the internal crossover does its job.  I didn't get around to trying the Bluetooth capability.
5,Purchased more than a month ago Nicely designed knobs are smooth 2useGood SoundI use it with Jamo S803 speakersfor apple TV  inputting y rca cables the othe end goes to a different ampNo issues sounds good!I turn it on/off via blynk wifi yet tested smooth bluetooth Signal
5,me impresiono la calidad del sonido
3,Great little device with one problem - the amplifier makes a loud popping sound when disconnected from power outlet or re-connected back. Hurts my ears and can damage the speakers. Otherwise great sound quality and connectivity options.
5,I recently purchased an expensive Denon receiver and prefer this unit. Only thing that I would like is if it had more power.
5,Great sound quality and very happy with the ability to adjust subwoofer frequency and levels.
5,I purchased Fosi Audio BT30A stereo audio amplifier recently. I was very apprehensive as to what I would receive from a quality and sound point of view. So far so good but the quality of the amp is good and it appears very well made. I coupled the amp to my Boston Acoustics A26 speakers and I am extremely happy with the sound quality. Clear and crisp. Fantastic sound from a very small and inexpensive amplifier. Good sound quality through the AUX and Bluetooth connections. Very happy with my purchase!
5,Surprisingly great little yet power amplifier (combo of preamp and power amp). I used it for a 2.1 HIFi system. Running strong and sounding great!
5,I use this little amplifier with my internet radio and it works well. The good feature is the separate sub output for the bass speaker.
5,So far the system is working great. I can move my phone 50 yards from the receiver without losing a signal.
3,This sounds pretty good at medium to high sound levels.  However the amplifier makes an unacceptable amount of noise/hiss at low volume levels.  It is unrelated to the input source (hiss is present with no connection) and it is not a 60hz ground loop hum.
5,Really a nice cheap amp with a wonderful sound with a sub out. Truly a good value for money.
5,This little thing does exactly what it needs to do.  The design is simple and it feels solid. Just what I wanted.
5,Love it love it love it love it love it love it!If you can’t tell I am more than pleased!
5,I really like this product.  I was able to quickly set it up--Bluetooth connects seamlessly.  Now I'm using my vintage wired speakers with my smartphone.  Nice!!
5,Yes
4,You get what you pay for. I just use it for my tv since i have extra speakers Very easy to hook up and the bluetooth works very well.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Both are great units! So far I prefer the BT20A unless you need to connect a subwoofer. Both are built well and work as intended. See the video for a comparison of these two units.
5,Really nice love the subwoofer volume knob
5,wonderfull sound easy to conect
2,It was great for a month. Now the sub channel is completely dead. There’s no volume coming through and nothing changed to cause this. Very frustrating because it was pretty great sounding to that point. I specifically got this one for the sub output so I’m very frustrated.As far as the standard outputs it has great power and is very compact. I really like it. If the sub were working it would be perfect.
3,I have ordered these in the past. There has never been a problem in the past. This time however; The Bluetooth doesn't work at all. I kept the amp because I use Chromecast anyway But for a device that relies on only Bluetooth or a single RCA jack for signal input the Bluetooth really needs to work.
2,This unit is very inexpensive and should not be expected to work or sound like something costing much more.There is no headphone jack ... you must wire the headphone to the speaker outputs.There is a constant background noise when used with headphones that adjusting the volume to zero wont get rid of.The volume must be turned all the way up for it to drive a pair of speakers to a low listening level.
5,Excellent sound quality for the price.
1,I was using a simple set up between another amp - an Amazon dot to amp to speakers.  The sound was good but there was no provision for a subwoofer.  So I ordered this item. It just doesn't work - no sound. Im about to return if there are no suggestions.
2,When they work they work good! But if you have any issues the company won’t help you. And you can forget that 18 month warranty
5,Excellent product!!! Very impressed. Clean and clear sound even at high volume. Would definitely recommend this product.
5,Good sounding amp. Great customer service. Would buy again.
1,Bluetooth connection problem
5,Just refurbished my old Advent Heritage speakers and hooked them up to this amp.  Could not believe the sound quality from this little guy.  I've routed my computer and a DVD player through it directly and BT from my phone.  All sound great.
5,Works great!! Highly recommend.
5,Wow!  This is a great little unit.  It is very small but delivers great sound.  The potentiometers are smooth and the unit's build quality is fantastic. The sound is rich with deep lows and still clear highs.  I would buy without thinking twice.
5,Worked perfect for my needs!
2,Needs more power. I have the Fosi TDA749E mini amps. They are great. I bought this as I wanted one with a built in Bluetooth and tone. The TDAs I can’t turn above a third as they are so powerful. I figured at 50 watts this would be plenty. Nope. No way it’s 50 watts.
5,Had a stereo go bad but the speakers and the passive subwoofer were still good.This isn't as loud as the stereo they came from but it sounds fantastic and it's as loud as I desire.
5,I know sound very well this product is awesome!
5,Great little amp. :]
5,Small & great sound!
1,Turns off when i try to higher it..i have 2 4ohm 6.5 speakers and 1 4 ohm 8 inch sub...it sucks.  Then i returned it and its been almost a month n no refund
2,Not a bad sounding little amp but Bluetooth hiss is LOUD even at zero volume.Read the other negative reviews.
1,I love everything about this amp the inputs the controls the outputs and it sounds great EXCEPT that if there is no sound playing it sends a loud Hisssssss to the speakers that can be heard even when listing to a podcast. Even with NOTHING connected nothing on RCA and nothing connected with Bluetooth the hiss is there I changed to a different pair of speakers and it was still there. I had to turn it off.I got zero response from support.So it is on its way back. :-) Now what do I buy?
5,Sound works well! Easy setup! Love that it has an output for subwoofer too. Works wonders on my deck!
5,Works great.
1,Couldn’t get this thing to work. Junk as far as I’m concerned.
5,Sounds great. Running 3ohm infinity speakers from my car. Hoping it can continue to handle them
2,This little amp has the potential to be one of the best under $100. There was significant audible interference in the bluetooth and it made this amp impossible to listen to. The RCA input seemed to work fine.Also the bass adjustment only adjusts subwoofer frequencies.Work on upgrading the bluetooth and fine-tuning the frequency adjustments and this amp will be a champion.Returned.
2,This unit struggled to power two outdoor 8ohm deck speakers. Will be upgrading to 100Wx2 amp.
5,Sencillo y aceptable para su costo.
1,Worked great until Bluetooth failed and stopped connecting
2,Tiny amp with tiny sound.
4,This is a great amplifier but Fosi Audio has just released for 2022 a highly upgraded version of this amplifier that has twice the wattage out of all three channels (left right subwoofer).  Get the BT30D Pro instead.
1,Love the small size easy control and 2.1 configuration.  I’ve had great success with this brand in the past however this unit was horrible.  Very loud hissing even at low volumes... at any / all gain stages.Very disappointed here.  Could be a one off bad unit but more likely the design is bad.
1,I should have paid attention to the reviews that warned of high failure rates
5,Great sound. Shipped fast packaged well.
1,Stopped workingHey guys this amplifier stopped working after two months. I can connect to the Bluetooth network but no sound comes from my speakers. Please reach out to me. I'm. Happy to change review if I receive some customer service to help with my issue!
5,My wife bought me this for my Birthday present and I am Loving her so much for it. I have owned a lot of 1970's and 80's Integrateds and this one just blows me away for sound and ease of use. I connected it to my laptop that also has Bluetooth and connection was within 10 seconds and no 3.5mm connections. That leaves the laptop virtually free for placing anywhere in my listening area without being strapped down with cords....a big plus. I have left this combo playing through the night streaming online radio more than 5 days a week since receiving and I wake up to it still playing and cool to touch (average 7 hours straight) which is more than I can say about my vintage PioneerSA-940 through Advent Laureates.I am inspired to buy another one for the Living Room as well.
4,Pulled a 15 year old sound bar out of storage and this works well. I got the "gotor 3.5mm Stereo Male to 4 x Banana Plug Speaker Cable Audio Extension Cord (1M)" on Amazon and it worked perfectly. It does cut out if the volume is too high from from my phone but the workaround is to keep phone at half volume and make it louder with the sound bar's volume control.
5,Just wanted something decent for my office bookshelf speakers. What I got was a fantastic amp that shocked me with big performance. It really has plenty of power louder than I need it to be. The Bluetooth is perfect and the surprise output of the subwoofer amp is far better than expected. I ran it hard for 30 minutes it never got warm. No hum whatsoever. Its tiny in size but huge on performance. Perfect just perfect. Bought it elsewhere for $20 less.
2,After 1 year of light use ( i dont use it much) the audio starts to get crackly and cut out once it gets hot (been on for a little while) and the bluetooth connection is getting buggy. I cant recommend this amp. Also it was never very loud at all.
5,First of all this is a quality built product all metal construction except for the Bluetooth antenna. Bluetooth works flawlessly and is easy to connect to. I also love the little mechanical "click" you hear as a physical switch inside turns on the Bluetooth when you connect very old-school. It is so compact and can be placed anywhere without being obtrusive. Great buy!
1,I will start with the good. I received this amp as a gift. I paired this with the Sony SSCS5 speakers and a sub for a small system in a bedroom. Using the analog input the amp and speaker combo produces a fairly rich sounding system. I think it is the right amp for something like the SSCS5 speakers if you want a pretty good sounding cheap setup. I personally would NOT pair this with the higher end Klipsch Elac Wharfedale or SVS speakers. I would prefer a better amp for those.Now for the MAJOR design issue. The Bluetooth sound is acceptable at best but that isn't even the worst part. The worst part is there is no way to turn off/disable Bluetooth. The Bluetooth is always on the moment the power is turned on and it takes priority over all the other inputs. It does not have a manual pairing mode or even a paring PIN/code. This leads to major problems if anyone near you has a Fosi Bluetooth product that shares the same Bluetooth name. You can imagine my surprise when I was awakened in the middle of the night by someone else connecting to my amp and playing the guitar. It was clearly an accident because they kept disconnecting and reconnecting after playing only a couple of notes. I suspect they thought they were connecting to their own Fosi amp and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. This morning I was awakened by someone (most likely the same person) playing music. Once again they would start the song disconnect after about 10 seconds reconnect restart the song...rinse and repeat. The connection is strong and clear so it isn't dropping on its own. My closest neighbor is about 70 feet away and they are in their 60's. I suspect they are confused and keep selecting my amp to connect to instead of their own. For this reason the amp is unusable for me because they keep accidentally hijacking it. I will need to somehow shield the Bluetooth antenna screw post or just get a different product.
3,It's a good portable class D amplifier with decent sound quality for the price. However the bluetooth range is very limited. It's barely 20ft in a hall and mostly doesn't work across walls.
2,At first I liked it for a while but then started noticing a graininess to the sound. Was it my room acoustics the volume level my speakers. Well yesterday I switched the amplifier to my Marantz NR1508 AV receiver and the graininess distortion was gone. So now the Fosi amp goes into the closet until I figure out what to do with it.
5,Driving 3 sets of in-wall speakers and a sub with a Chromecast Audio as a source (thru a speaker selector switch box).  Sounds great with plenty of volume.  Shipping was fast.  Very happy with the device and the company.
5,I'm reasonably particular with my music presentation as demonstrated by some of the higher-end speakers and systems I have.  I had an 20 year old old set of 6" speakers and a passive subwoofer left over from a combo amp/CD/turntable player that died many years ago and thought I'd get this amp to put the speakers to use.  This little amp is amazing.  Really drives the speakers and subwoofer.  The sound has great full range sound especially in the mid-tones where I personally believe all the great musical sounds are located.  The subwoofer controls (volume and crossover frequency) enable you to really tune the subwoofer so it provides the music fill-in without artificial booming.  Treble & bass controls give you additional options to tune the music to your ear.  I connected the amp to my cellphone via a phones cable for my primary test.  I did notice that when connecting via Bluetooth the total volume out was about half that when direct wired connection; but even with that there is a ton of volume.  I believe this is common across most Bluetooth devices. My only suggestion is to be sure to get "banana" plugs for the speaker output connections from the amp.  I wish they would have just used standard RCA plugs.
5,Tired of bluetooth disconnecting so I tried the model 20. Liked is so much that I bought another. Now I bought this model 30 Nd it did not disappoint. Loved the fact that it can do subwoofer and you even have a choice of powered or passive. I connected a Karaoke player. I used to have this portable solar boom box for camp now I dont go camping anymore so I converted it to a portable karaoke withe wireless mike. The kids loved it.
5,Spent a lot of money on various audio receivers Bose Sony Onkyo but this amplifier is the best specially it’s bass: solid and neat soundIt costs less than $90 so I would like to recommend to anyone looking for an audio amplifier
5,I use the amp at my desk for my dual bookshelf speakers and for the application it doesn't disappoint. Bluetooth connectivity is instant and audio quality isn't muddled or messy. I wouldn't recommend using the amp outside as it gets very hot and most likely wears out internal components. When plugged into two passive speakers and a passive sub this little amp powers them all with ease and sounds powerful.
5,I moved into a new house and had outdoor speakers.  I didnt have another speaker channel on my stereo and wasnt sure what I was going to do to make it work.  Instead of doubling up a speaker slot I purchased the BT30D.  Hooked up the speakers plugged it in and turned on the bluetooth.  It synced to my phone and I was streaming music in less than 5 minutes.  Highly recommend this simple device.  I will update this review if problems happens in the future but so far its the perfect solution
5,I needed this to power my speakers for my backyard.  I like to have my sound loud and it does a very good job.  It also drives my 12 inch non-powered sub woofer.  Easily connects to blue tooth of my phone.
5,Glad I kept my bookshelf speakers.
5,If you want sound perfection chase Sonos. This small amplifier pushes tons of base and has lots of treble. The mid range is very limited..hence the price.  Im wired up to 2 Sony towers and a 12" sub.Overall I'm happy with it  This is perfect for poolside sound or a workout room. I would buy another in a heartbeat. I'm using this for a night time low hum of Jazz / Synthwave to put me to sleep. Its a million times better than any alarm clock radio. I'm floored by how loud it is!!
5,I bought this amp for my speaker system in the garage and I specifically needed a separate output for my powered subwoofer.Great sound! Great value!
5,Surprising power for such a small amp. I'm using it to drive 2 bookshelf speakers and a 10 inch JVC sub and the sound is pretty good. Plenty of bass
5,This is for the BT30D model. I'm fairly impressed considering the price of this little amp. It pushes my TSi100's just fine and it's capable of getting uncomfortably loud in a normal sized room. Bluetooth works fine tested the aux connections and those too worked fine. No hum or any odd noises when nothing is playing. Seems to be fairly well built nothing is loose and rattling around. All the knobs and switches feel sturdy. The speaker connections in the back are a bit tiny if you're not using plugs so you'll probably want to use plugs if you're using thicker wire. 14AWG will work without plugs I'm doubtful 12 would and I didn't try.In short it sounds pretty good it's somewhat inexpensive and it's a decent little amp. It's pretty tiny and unobtrusive so if you've not got a bunch of room it's a good option.
5,I have a Mac Powerbook 2 Sony SSCSE Dolby Atmos desktop speakers a Yamaha 8" 100 Watt Powered Subwoofer and a Fosi Audio BT3OD Bluetooth amplifier. I hear great clean attention getting sound finally very satisfied.
5,Arrived right away. Nice small size. Set up in ten minutes with a 10 inch powered sub and two Cambridge shelve speakers and Bluetooth to my iPhone. Sounds great in our family room. I would have paid ten times this much in the 1970s for this sound quality!  Very satisfied.
5,I love this amplifier! The most useful features that it has by far is the ability to control the volume of the subwoofer that is hooked up to it and also the crossover frequency of that subwoofer. It is a well-built unit and connects very easily to my iPhone Bluetooth and sounds amazing.The controls feel silky smooth and dampened and it takes up a very small space it is about 6 inches across and maybe 4 1/2 inches front to back. It sits on four little feet which is kind of nice it keeps it up off the table about a half of an inch for air circulation. It does not get Heart at all. Very good unit especially for the money.
5,Wow Ok.  I was not expecting power and sound quality like this.  I have this BT30D driving a pair of Klipsch RB-51 II's and a 10 inch powered subwoofer.  The speakers and sub are in a near-field location to the right and left of my PC monitors and the sub is underneath my desk.Knowing this is an analog audio amp for my Mac &  PC audio solution I bought the correct 3.5mm to RCA cables for 3 devices -- Macbook Pro PC and Echo -- Also purchased a 4-Way Audio switch so I could share and switch the speakers and sub with my 3 aforementioned devices.Crisp and Clean and No Caffeine...Sound quality is fantastic.  No strange noises or weird audio artifacts.  Sub Volume Frequency Treble Bass and Volumes knobs are sensitive and very effective.Bluetooth is stable and sounds just as good from my phone and tablet.  Right now I'm listening to "Infected Mushroom - Head of NASA" and this setup channel separation and tones in all ranges is far superior to my Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 or Logitech Z623 2.1 speakers.I'm not interested in DAC's for my Mac and PCs they sound crushed and over-processed with my computers..  This is a perfect setup for me audio is full rich and smooth.  I love it.  Nicely done FOSI.**Update**Added a Dragonfly Red DAC between my MacBook Pro and this BT30D.  The audio quality is even better.  I hope this BT30D lasts a very long time.
5,Like the auto blue tooth off and on and switching between from phone to TV did not work once but may have been user error. Tied to old Bose 3 piece speakers and sounds much better than anticipated
4,My opinion has soured on this amp since I wrote my good review here: (see below for update).I wanted a small class D amp for my bedroom. I use the IKEA Eneby 30 speaker for subwoofer duty since it can do 30Hz with decent volume. The combination with the Fosi amplifier is perfect. Extremely good sound with my Dali Spektor 2 standpoint speakers. I've only used Bluetooth input so far and have no complaints with quality of connection or sound quality. The bass and treble controls are wonderful and when using the low level subwoofer output for powered subwoofer duty all three bass knobs have an effect which is great for getting bass just right.The connectors on the back are sturdy with good fit. The power of the unit comes on gently.Update: This recent past weeks I had been picking up on something that is a low level distortion a grittiness in the sound. I think in the previous weeks I thought it just might be due to the room acoustics but I ruled it out by using it in a different larger room and then later switching out the amp for my Marantz NR1508 AV Receiver. That amp switch proved it to me that the distortion I was hearing was really from the Fosi amp. So because I'm really picky about distortion I've put away into the closet the Fosi amp to give away later to someone else who won't be so picky about sound quality.Update 2: I'm giveing it 4 stars as I discovered it sounds good again when turning the treble knob down to the 9-o'clock position instead of the 12-o'clock position. Use a subwoofer with this amp as it will make a huge difference. A good subwoofer "cheat" is to use a IKEA Eneby 30 Bluetooth speaker as a subwoofer (It is cheap) since it can do 30Hz (I even tested this claim). The Eneby 30 has a 1/8" line in jack to make it work via a wire with RCA jack on the other end. The bass is really great and realistic but certainly not door and cabinet rattling which you shouldn't want anyway.All in all the Fosi is a good product.
5,I use it to drive the KLIPSCH RP500Ms in a 2.0 setup for now. Am totally satisfied with its performance.It does allow for a subwoofer which I will try soon.So far... awesome!
5,Got it driving 2 Monolith Encore B6s and a Monoprice Premium Select 8" and it sounds great (subwoofer needs improvement but good). I was really worried for nothing about the current/wattage- it goes PLENTY loud for a pair of computer speakers. You won't be running a concert with this but this plus some like $300ish bookshelves is dramatically better than any prebuilt powered system you're gonna find out there (especially if you're the type to get a proper DAC or audio card for that).I thought I was gonna have to spend like $1k+ getting another "hifi" system for the office but this thing lets you get that down to like $500
4,using this to power 2 speakers and a sub for tv sound. sounds great through the rca connections but not the headphone jack on the tv so not able to use the remote. not a big deal for me and probably not the amps fault. sounds great through rca and bluetooth.
5,This little guy works great. I have this amp plugged into some small outdoor speakers. I have the speaker cord running through the wall into the garage where this amp lives. I have echo dot plugged into the amp so I have the option to play through the Echo or through Bluetooth.I have the amp turned all the way up. I don’t know if this is needed because of the amp or the smaller speakers. But all in all everything sounds great.I do not have a subwoofer attached so I can’t review that feature.
5,Recently my Onkyo 7.2 receiver broke down. I used it for an already in-wall installed two speakers and a subwoofer system. I badly needed to make these speakers work. I mostly listen to music throughout the house using Bluetooth or airplay. I found this replacement to make my system work! Fantastic sound flawless Bluetooth connection thus far easy installation and use. Made me happy!
5,Just set this up and man was it easy! Bluetooth is strong and has a great range too. I was 40+ feet away and no signal drop. Controls are smooth and responsive. This powers my outdoor Klipsch Rock speakers nicely!  Crisp clear solid sound and the bass is a big plus. The added Treble and Bass controls are a nice feature over the models without - worth the extra $$ in my opinion. I would like more power but that is a personal preference for sure.
5,I replaced a large old 5.1 stereo/receiver with this unit for my outdoor patio. I have it powering two Yamaha outdoor speakers ands one Yamaha powered subwoofer. The sound quality is excellent and the power of this is very capable of making a lot of sound in my patio. Happy to get rid of the giant receiver and replace with this. Simple analog knobs on the front work great. I use for both BT connection and cable input from projector. Very happy.
5,After less than stellar performance from a Nobsound amp and being really pleased with a Dayton amp I was cautiously optimistic with this one. It hasn't let me down. Good power little if any noise quality feeling components. I have it powering a pair of 2 ohm Rockford Fosgate 6.25" 2 way speakers and have the sub out going to a Fosi M03 subwoofer amp running an 8" Rockford sub and it sounds great!
5,Great Features for little amp.
5,Simply brilliant. Works 100% perfect for my setup.Powers my Klipsch R-41M's wonderfully & even a Pioneer 10" Car Woofer like it's meant for it.Looks sleek of a strong build & just gracious in appearance.Some say there's a intolerable hiss... I guess in an extremely quiet room there is a hum.. Though for what it is I don't mind it it's a low hum.
5,Update Sept 2022; It's turned on 16 hours a day still going strong still love it!Hooked to Dell desktop: 2 fairly old KLH 8" bookshelf speakers 1 big older Aiwa powered sub sitting on the floor. Holy cow this amp is amazing! Sound quality is frankly outstanding from this little box!  And no heat... none. Don't know how that is possible driving it hard. I like to listen to pipe organ (Gert van Hoef esp.) and this amp pushes it out beautifully. Can't imagine how it would sound with newer speakers.  I give it 6 stars!Delivery was prompt packing excellent.  I'm listening to Dirty Blues right now... ahh!
5,What an incredible amplifier at such a small package! Beyond thrilled!!
4,Great little amp with mostly true crossover. I used my oscilloscope and a frequency sweep generator to measure the speaker outputs. The subwoofer output features a variable-frequency and variable-amplitude low-pass adjustment. The oscilloscope trace into a fixed 8 Ohm load was clean and crisp.The main speakers is fixed high-pass frequency at about 120Hz. So this isn't a "true" symmetrical crossover. You can tweak the subwoofer crossover frequency but the mains are fixed at 120Hz. However it's better than having no high-pass at all like the lousy Fosi Audio DA2120C.
4,Was using Logitech z-2300 13years and could not find its equal for under $ 200.00. Bought this and pulled from storage a pair of JBL now 22years keeping 8" 200 watt Logitech sub. All is well  unit functions as stated in description. Read reviews with 5 stars were vague  I find sub=frequency very useful and improves match with monitors and sub. You can't go wrong for its design and functions when looking at tone controls and flexibility of speaker choice. Blu-tooth not needed but always better to have then want. JBL speakers were Best Buy $ 100.00 2008 and still work great. Sound is much fuller in lower mid and upper bass . The higher the quality of speaker will be heard  BT30 is silent  no hash or hiss . Due to todays pricing structure their is no 5 star anything . I see 5 star as being happy getting a bone . GOOD BOY ! Looked at what I needed and found a solution . Suggest this for audio output anywhere : Computer  Television  whatever has analog rca or a stereo 3.5 output when used with a 3.5 to rca adapter cable . Reading BT30 reviews leaves me guessing some units may have production quality issues were this unit is without any such problems . I do believe in Fossi BT30 and would buy again.
5,This little amp is awesome
5,I have a large outdoor seating area with a projector and 120” pull down screen. When you project with Bluetooth at a distance the mouth is always off to the movie so everyone complains. I found that this has the RCA inputs which make a huge difference and match up the words to the mouth. Now everyone is happy. Buy it you won’t regret it.
5,My son pointed me to this. Less space than I used to have so I got this to replace my receiver.  It works great!! Stream music through Bluetooth or I can use my ipod as well. Has enough power for my Polk speakers to still sound very nice. Even has controls to shape the sound how ypu like it
5,Very satisfied with my purchase. This thing is very well-made and performs very nicely. Very easy to setup. I am using it with a couple of older Onkyo speakers and a Monoprice sub.
5,Apenas desempaque vi este belleza de increíble tecnología cuenta con un excelente bluetooth y la calidad del sonido ni que hablar le puse 2 bookshelf de Polk 5.25 y un subwoofer Sony 8" parecía la sala una discoteca del excelente sonido. El material de los acabados del mini amplificador se ve realmente fino con sus perillas con tonos cromados y acabado en negro. El transformador 120V que trae es adecuado en tamaño y su largo cable permite que esté holgado. Adecuado para ver películas hacer aeróbicos escuchar deportes o conectarse por bluetooth con el celular para oír las canciones u otros complementos. Excelente empaque de envío.
5,This is the fourth fosi amp I've bought. The first one gave me about two years of service and just stopped working one day. I have no idea what happened but for the price two years of constant use wasn't bad. Since then I've purchased three more for use in several sound systems I have in my recording studio and haven't had a bit of trouble with them. I never turn them off and they sound great. Loud too. Not concert loud but adequate for any average space. Love these little amps. Bluetooth works great too.
1,Would not buy again. Says for outside but would need a shelf to put it on and a place to hide the 8 foot of cord you don’t need. For a 12 volt item they sure want to give you a huge power supply.
4,I use this for computer speakers.  Works very nice.  I paired it with KD series Klipsch book shelve speakers and a subwoofer.  The box does get a little worm if left on with the volume cranked up.  I like it and would do it again.
5,I got rid of my Onkyo 7.1 receiver with all of the speakers and wires making my wife happy and ending up buying a sound bar instead. However I lost my ability to play my music to my four speakers on my patio using Bluetooth from my Onkyo receiver.  I purchased this little gem so I could once again play my music via Bluetooth  to my patio. What a pleasently surprise. This box works perfect powering four outdoor speakers which have a 3 seperate speakers each plus I hooked up my 10 inch powered sub to it. This thing rocks. Great sound for what it is and build is sturdy made of metal. Great buy.
5,Bluetooth devices rarely work consistently.  So I was nervous getting this amp because it primarily uses Bluetooth to connect to audio devices.  Got it because it had so many positive reviews.  Its Bluetooth performance is outstanding.I connect to my Dell desktop playing audio and video files on VLC media player.  The amp connects to the PC almost instantaneously on reboot or waking-up from sleep.  A soft beep tells you you're connected.  The secret is to leave the amp on at all times.Sound quality is as good as my previous amp over a USB connection.I occasionally hear low-level noise when not playing music but it's infrequent and low-level so I'm maintaining the 5* rating.Highly recommended!
5,The sound quality is really good I know that depends on the quality of your speakers having provisions for a subbie can't wait to hook that up good value for money
5,Tut was er soll.Ich möchte nur kurz schreiben dass alle die schreiben es sei „zu leise“ entweder was am Kabel am Stecker am Eingangspegel oder an den Ohren haben. Ein AC/DC Konzert vor 50.000 Zuschauern im Stadion kann man hiermit nicht beschallen aber ganz ehrlich wer erwartet das von einer Zigarrenkiste? Ich habe die BOSE 251 angeschlossen die kommen dann auf die Terrasse im Frühjahr. Im Kellerraum mit den 251ern kann ich bei hohem Eingangslevel von einem AirPort Express den Fosi nicht wirklich komplett aufdrehen es ist mir dann zu laut (bin 44 und habe best. nicht mehr die besten Ohren) !!!
5,Fa esattamente quello che deve fare e anche piuttosto bene direi.La qualità è buona e sembra essere robusto.La connettività bluetooth è perfetta e con un buon raggio di azione anche in presenza di muri.Le regolazioni sono precise e intuitive; bisogna solo prendere un po' la mano con il filtro e il volume del subwoofer ma è ben fatto.E' così piccolo che "sparisce" sulla vostra scrivania sotto il monitor o sopra a un PC desktop.Proprio un bell'oggetto.
4,Tengo Apenas Usándolo Escasos 7 Días. Me Gusta Porque Tiene Buena Calidad de Audio Muy Buena Separación De Canales en Estéreo y Ademas Tiene Buena Fidelidad. En Lo Que Respecta A Las Frecuencias Bajas ( Graves ) Para Mi GustoLe Falta Más Respuesta. En Cuanto A Potencia Si Es Un Vil Engaño Pues Honestamente Creo Que Con Trabajo LLegaráa Unos 20 Watts de Potencia. Lo Que Si Es Perfecto Para Trabajar Con Dispositivos ( Celular Grabadora TV o Cualquier PC U Otro Dispositivo Que Cuente Con Un Poco de Volumen Pues Ya Entre Los Dos Se Complementan Muy Bien Dando UnaSalida de Volumen Muy Decente Como Para Una Reunion Con No Muchas Personas.Las he Probado Con Unas Torres Onkyo SFk-201 (150W 6 Ohms) Suenan Muy Agradables Pero Definitivamente Le Hace Falta Un Subwoofer Activo Para Tener Toda La Gama de Frecuencias.Tambien Las Probé Con Unos Altavoces Cerwin Vega Modelo: E-315 ( 150 W 6 Ohms ) Para Teatro en Casa. Obteniendo Una Excelente Calidad de Audio Y Una Potencia Muy Adecuada Pero Cabe Mencionar Que Estos Altavoces Son De Tres Vias y Cuentan Con Un Subwoofer de 15".
5,I love this little amp! I'm replacing an Onkyo 5.1 surround amp that finally died. I was never happy with that amplifier's sound and it had way more functions than I needed for my main floor music listening. The Fosi was super easy to set up and paired with my computer and phone with no problem. I'm using it with a powered base speaker that helps to round out the sound nicely. I found a little Equalizing of the sound on the computer and on the dials of the Fosi got me to a sound I'm now happy with. I find the sound clean and accurate and if the source material is well recorded and produced it's certainly reflected in the playback of the Fosi. It sounds great. For $100 you can't go wrong with this little guy.
5,Currently connected to  pair of Micca MB42x  and an old Sony 6.5 inch passive subwoofer in my living room. With the subwoofer and tone controls the BT30D makes the  Micca speakers sound great. Very good detail imaging and tons of bass. The subwoofer volume and cutoff controls are fantastic to control the bass output from the woofer. The bluetooth connection has been stable and great sounding. This the third and final class D amp I have auditioned and the one I'm keeping.
5,j'était septique a l'achat de ce produit et la wow! c'était pour mon deuxième système pour des enceinte  parading mini moniteur et je suis surpris de la qualité d'écoute j'ai donc décider de le brancher sur mon système principaldes haut parleur de très haut de game (spendor s9 ) la magie as opéré j'ai même regarder mon rega brio avec des questionnements ....
5,All the functions working well  Sound quality isGreat . I tied it with my 100 w POLK tower and SUBNICE 👍👍👍
5,This is an amazing little amp. Bought it as a liferaft when I lost a channel on my Hafler DH 200. It is quite listenable even driving my Maggies. Good bass uncoloured mids ok definition in the highs. A pleasant surprise at the price. Not sure if it really puts out the full wattage claimed. Clipped at extreme volume only.
5,Great little unit! Perfect for book shelf speakers and a low watted subwoofer.  Or it has a line out for a powered sub .  For $100 you cannt go wrong  the quality of sound is top notch for those little intel chips .  I repurposed my crappy flawed 2.1 paradigm unit with book shelf speakers and subwoofer with this unit and it sounds great!
5,Connecting Bluetooth with my old set of speaker and two subwoofers. I felt like a earthquake. Less than $100 dollars and turn my old set of speakers becoming a modern sound system.
5,Hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien con dos bocinas de 8 ohms de 80 watts. Se escucha muy bien.
5,Estoy super contento Bienvenido a mi familia Hifi la verdad me gustan las cosas de calidad aunque cueste un poco mas estoy contenco con el producto.. lo compraria otra vez. y llego super rapido y con -6% de descuento.. todo ventajas.. no comprtes cosas muy baratas compra calidad.
5,This machine is just beautiful !The bass it gives is more than I expect thank you folks !
5,Ottimonulla da direle specifiche tecniche sono esattamente quelle descrittenon c’è nessun problema
5,Estaba buscando un miniamplificador para usarlo en el salón de casa con unos altavoces que también he pedido en Amazon (aún no me ha llegado). Por lo pronto los estoy probando con unos antiguos altavoces Jensen y el resultado es espectacular. Tiene unos agudos muy claros y una buena separación entre medios y bajos. Me falta probar un subwoofer (este dispositivo tiene la peculiaridad de soportar subwoofer activos y pasivos).Muy contento con la compra. Lo recomiendo.
4,Good product in terms of Value for money. I use it for my electronic drum set. I needed to route the low frequency sounds to the sub woofer and it did the job well. Works very good.
3,Le produit a une finition top les potards et le switch on/off ont un très bon feeling même si je regrette que ce ne soit pas des potentiomètres crantés c'est toujours galère de trouver le niveau 0 pour l'EQ du coup quand on veux un son neutre c'est toujours approximatif. Le truc un peu dommage c'est le embrase des câbles enceintes qui sont vraiment rapproché donc un peu relou à câbler mais on fait avec si on veux un petit format.Le bas qui blesse c'est le mixage des sorties L et R. Absence totale de grave alors c'est pas trop grave quand on utilise un sub comme je l'avais prévu de base sauf que si on veux utiliser uniquement ces deux sorties (Le soir ou la nuit par exemple) et bien on se retrouve avec un son hyper fade sans profondeur.La partie sub par contre est super bien amplifié le potard et fréquence répond parfaitement comme il doit le faire top.Maintenant pourquoi j'ai retourné le produit : Souffle constent. Impossible de l'utiliser à faible niveau d'écoute (plus bas que le niveau d'une conversation) pour le soir car y-a constamment du souffle en fond peut importe le niveau de sortie de l'ampli et c'est encore pire quand on touche le niveau des aigus...  Alors moi compte utiliser mon ampli pour un bureau avec des enceintes à moins d'un mètre de distance et parfois de nuit avec un son bas qui plus est avec le sub éteint à ces moments là l'expérience était horrible.Toutefois : Si vous voulez utiliser cet ampli dans un salon avec les enceintes à plus de 3m de distance à niveau de sorties moyen/élevé et avec un subwoofer il fera parfaitement l'affaire.
5,Value for money and has channel and volume for subwoofer
1,so disappointed returned after 2 days signal in line interference couldnt resolve problems....
5,Het produkt voldoet volledig aan mijn verwachtingen .Het werkt zeer goed. Ik heb dit specifiek produkt alleen bij Amazon gevonden
4,昭和の名器コーラルX-Vとウーハーに接続しましたが、デジタルアンプ恐るべし！アナログの最高峰といわれたサンスイAU-D907でも鳴らし切れなかった(鳴らしきっていたと思っていた)詳細な部分を軽く表現してきます。アコギのキメの細かさに驚き、ボーカルの再現性に驚き、ベースの低音に感動しています。Bluetoothの音の構築もよく有線と遜色ありません。不快なホワイノイズもありませんしかし難点が2つ１）Bluetoothに自動接続してくれません。電源をいれる度に『登録済みBluetoothの接続』をしなくてはなりません。２）バス、トレブルの基本位置がわかりません。基準点があると良かったのになと思います。とまあ良いところばかりでもありませんが、音質は群を抜いて聞きやすく表現力豊かなので満足しています。これだけのアンプが8000円で買えるなんて令和最高！
5,Nice sturdy little box with dials feels like an amp should should just tiny. Sounds great with connected echo input or phone over bluetooth certainly no worse than entry level '90s predecessor. Comfortably drives more volume than I need to annoy neighbours from a pair of 8 ohm mission bookshelf type speakers.I now have lots of space and removed nagging feeling I was burning £5 notes using the old one even if it takes about 10 years to pay for itself.Negatives the bluetooth arial dwarfs it and rather ruins the lines could be useful outside.No L/R balance but something I don't use.No way to prioritize line-in over bluetooth and have to tell connected device to disconnect.But for the money cannot complain about minor compromises (£84 deal) so still 5*.Probably would have gone for model down without the sub out but at the deal price this was cheaper at time.
5,Étant le premier à écrire un commentaire sur ce produit je vais être concret.Le packaging: Contrairement à l'ampli BT30a ou avant la boîte du BT30D est très beau visuellement et en plus est plus propre vu qu'il est plus en carton marron comme les modèles précédents.Le contenu: L'intérieur est classique de tout les produits Fosi polystyrène et le produit en lui même. Un contenu plutôt bien rangé.Le produit (en lui-même): Le BT30D est vraiment très joli à regarder sur un meuble il fait parti du décor...La seule chose qui m'a un peu choqué c'est son poids vraiment léger comparé au BT30A par exemple alors qu'il embarque plus de technologies.À vrai dire je pensais même qu'à l'usine ils ont oublié de mettre les composants.Le son produit est très bon avec de bonnes basses et de bons aigus. Il est couplé à une paire d'enceintes Bose 201 v Series.L'appareil chauffe légèrement sans jamais être excessif. Mais sa coque en aluminium me rassure.On aime ou on aime pas mais les boutons sont équipés de petites dents en plastique ma foi pratique pour manipuler L'appareil contrairement au autres modèles de la series BT.Connectique: Niveau Connectique pour alimenter les enceintes passives L'appareil peut prendre 2 enceintes avec des fiches banane (non fourni faut en prévoir) et un caisson de basse actif.L'appareil pourra également prendre en charge un caisson de basse actif ce qui est pas le cas jusqu'ici dans la série BT (câble RCA mâle vers RCA mâle à prévoir)Pour l'audio IN via jack vers RCA le son est très bon (c'est le meilleur périphérique si vous voulez profitez d'un meilleur son)L'ampli en lui même est alimenté en 24v ce qui est amplement suffisant pour sa taille.Le choix du blutooth: Le bluetooth 5.0 gère très bien les musiques en haut définition passe nickel sans distorsion.Les +- Rapport qualité prix excellent- Très bon son (de bonnes basses aigus et médium  satisfaisant- Beau packaging- Vendeur fiable et super service clientLes -- un peu léger- un pied silicone un peu bancalBref cet ampli est une bombe allez-y les yeux fermés
5,Ottimo amplificatore
4,製品は満足していますが、到着した製品が開封済みのものだった。同梱物に欠品があったかはわからないがちょっと気持ちが悪い。
3,Bought this to replace a faulty Douk Audio ST01 and it just did not come close.  Sound  typical of class D reviews was scratchy bass was muddy  lacked detail  sometimes there was not separation and lacked the warmth that the Douk had.  I think the Douk has ruined me  and turned me into an amp nerd who'll start using phrases like soundscape.  So not a terrible little thing but i had to return it
5,Mein Ur-alt Verstärker von Universum hat nach über 20 Jahren den Geist aufgegeben. Jetzt stand ich da und brauchte Ersatz für die Boxen und so blieb ich nach vielem lesen bei Flosi hängen. Den Ausschlag für dieses Modell gab der passive Subwoofer Ausgang. Bestellt und am nächsten Tag geliefertda ich ausversehen cinch anstatt bananenstecker bestellteschloss ich die Kabel direkt anwas problemlos ging. Da das ganze für mein laptop gedacht war und ich nur einen kleinen Raum habedachte ich wird schon einigermaßen werden. Ich schloss es über meinen Kopfhörerausgang an und spielte das erste Lied ab...und war baff. Das ist absolut geiler Sound und der Bass kommt richtig klasse zur Geltung...! Ich habe 4 Satelittenboxen...je zwei pro Kanal a 100 Watt dranden Subwoofer passiv. Für meine Belange kann ich nur sagen...saugeil^^ Ich probierte dann die Bluetooth Variantewas ebenfalls ohne Probleme ging. Es gibt aber einen Unterschied beim Tonder ist deutlich heller und die Bässe nicht ganz so stark...hab mich dann für den Kopfhöreranschluss entschiedenda man die Bässe so schon bei niedriger Lautsärke gut hört. Ich habe jetzt keinen Vergleich mit einem größerem Raumaber wer wie ich eine kleine Ecke hatfährt meiner Meinung nachdamit absolut super!
3,Alright sound quality.Didn't provide the volume I was looking for and the internal dac has a very flat sound
5,Meine Teufel Cinebar11 2.1 hatte leider Probleme mit der Wiedergabe von Sound und Teufel war 2x nicht in der Lage das Problem abzustellen. Also Teufel-Elektronik raus und Fosi rein(wird noch fest integriert) und was soll man sagen der Klang ist besser als davor!
3,価格相応の音質です　情報量は少なく、音に艶がありません　長く聞いていると疲れるので、音質調整の高音側を少し絞って聞いています。電源を入れた時のノイズはありません、全体の質感は良く出来ていると思います　入力がもう１系統あって切り替えられると有難いと思いました　宅配用の段ボールが無く、製品のきれいに印刷された箱に透明のテープで梱包して配送されていますが、箱も製品の一部と思いますので少し残念でした
5,Got this yesterday  paired it up with some new 55w Moukey speakers .I wasn't expecting a lot but so glad I got them as they have passed any expectations from such a tiny unit.Had them going for a few hours yesterday bedding them in and the sound just gets better and better .I haven't added a sub yet and to be honest I doubt I will .Go for it  you will not be disappointed!!
4,Remarkable sound for the cost (after a few hour use to burn in) I hooked this little thing up to my Monitor Audio Silver 200' floorstanders and using  a good source like my Cambridge CXU into the phono's and playing CD's this unit provides a surprisingly wide spacious sound stage and good solid bass rhythms the bass goes deep as well and sounded like it actually had more low end clout than my £1500 hifi amp the sound gives good bite and texture to instruments making strings violins and cello's etc sound very real I was shocked how good it sounded tbh.Of course all is not perfect (lets not forget its and 85 quid mini amp) and where this little digital amp falls down is on refinement to the music it's a little course and hard in the treble quality and lacks the fluid creamy sound of a good hifi amp so it's certainly not a substitute for a good hifi amp but as a bedroom setup or for the computer it's excellent.I then connected it to my THX soundworks computer speakers and 8 inch passive sub and again it proves excellent with more power and punch than I will ever need even with the standard power brick it has lots of usable volume.Bluetooth sounds just OK as you'd expect and the signal is stable BUT the major flaw in this unit is ANYONE ELSE CAN CONNECT AND PLAY MUSIC OVER IT via Bluetooth WITHOUT your permission as it does not have a pair button or ask for a code on your phone this is really stupid and why I have only given 4 stars.
5,Habe das Produkt selber für den Partykeller gekauft. Habe 2 Magnat Boxen angeschlossen die doch gute Lautstärke auf max. Herausbringen.Verbindung per Bluetooth super und stabil.Koppeln ohne Code einfach möglich.Lautstärke und Frequenzeunstellung lässt sich gut regeln und die Drehregler machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Nicht wackelig und gutes haptisches Empfinden.Für kleine Anwendungen wie in meinem Fall voll ausreichend.
3,Im not sure what Im missing but I had an old 50w yamaha amp connected to my speakers and when I replaced the Yamaha amp with this one the sound is very tepid and weak. Eventhough the wattage is the same. Volume max everywhere no overheating pretty much the same set-up 1:1Perhaps someone knows better why that is the case (technically)
4,rcaが優先でBluetoothが下位のためだと思います。　電源offのスイッチ位置・onはrca/BluetoothとなっておりBluetoothがやりたければスマホから接続指定して繋いだら、青ランプがついてBluetoothラインになるという接続するかしないかの切り替え方式ですBluetoothだけ運用で考えていて、自動接続がよかったのに。。あとホワイトノイズが気になります。鳴らせば音はいいのですが静音状態で質の悪いラジオのようです
5,とても素晴らしい！音の再現力に脱帽です。ボーカルのセリフ一つ一つが立体的に際立っています。また、ボーカルに寄り添うようにバックミュージックが一体感を生んでいます。しかもBluetooth接続です。DALIスピーカーも喜んでます！ミニアンプに迷ったら絶対にオススメです。
5,Ich schreibe selten Rezensionen. Aber in seltenen Fällen der übermäßigen Begeisterung fühle ich mich gezwungen eine Bewertung zu schreiben.Was Fosi hier auf dem Markt gebracht hat verdient Respekt.Alles an dem kleinen ist überragend.Im direkten Vergleich mit sehr teuren Geräten stellt man erschreckend fest das der kleine Fosi die gleiche Brillanz und Klangauflösung aufweist. Mit welcher Dynamik er die Lautsprecher befeuert ist unglaublich.Ich habe einen Aktiven Subwoofer am Sub Out angeschlossen.Er lässt sich mit den vorhandenen Reglern so fein einstellen wie es oftmals nichtmal bei den ganz teuren Geräten möglich ist.Die Bluetooth Verbindung ist für den Preis einfach unvorstellbar gut. Es gibt keinerlei Einbrüche oder Störgeräusche auch wenn ich am anderen Ende des Zimmers bin (8-10 Meter)Fosi hat hier etwas bemerkenswertes auf den Markt gebracht was Anerkennung verdient. Jeder der Skeptisch ist kann mir glauben - kauft ihn! Ihr werdet begeistert sein. In meinen Augen wäre auch ein deutlich höherer Preis angemessen und ich würde ihn für diese Leistung gerne bezahlen.Vielen Dank Fosi!
4,楽しんでいます。バナナ端子は初めてでしたが、何かメリットがあるのでしょうか？、図太い配線が使えるぐらいでしょうか。分岐しやすいのかな？残念ながら左右バランスがあると、もっと色んなことに使えそうです。とても満足しています。
4,Estaría bien poder balancear el derecho y el izquierdo. Por lo demás como he dicho robusto y sencillo. Los materiales perfectos y el sonido que es lo que importa probado con altavoces y sobwofer infinity genial.
5,5 Sterne für diesen Verstärker.Angeschlossen: 2x Canton Boxen von 1990; 1x Plattenspieler von 1980 oder im Wechsel Technics Tape Deck/ CD-Player von 1990 und 1995 und per Bluetooth ein MacBook Air M1 2021 .Ein kostengünstiger leistungsstarker kleiner/ platzsparender Receiver zu einem super Preis ( 9990€ inkl. Rabatt bei meinem Kauf ) für den "normalen" Gebrauch alter Geräte oder für Audio Einsteiger perfekt.Ich bin sehr begeistert.
5,La scatola aveva il sigillo aperto e questo mi ha innervosito parecchio ma al suo interno era tutto in ordine. Il bluethoot si è dimostrato ottimo e non mi ha dato nessun problema le connessioni sono molto vicine tra loro ma sono ben accessibili. Non ho nessun fruscio a differenza di quanto ho letto in alcune recensioni e il suono è strabiliante. La potenza è inferiore di quella dichiarata ma per una TV è ottima. Quando ho collegato il subwoofer sono rimasto a bocca aperta bassi incredibili ben equilibrati e senza tremolii o risonanze varie. Il suono è pulito!!  Unico difetto se vogliamo proprio cercarlo i piedini di gomma sono attaccati con lo sputo e si staccano a guardarli. Per ora sono ampiamente soddisfatto....
3,Compatto ben costruito BT ben funzionante. Qualità audio sufficiente ma l ho trovato meno potente di quanto mi aspettassi considerata la scheda tecnica. Ero indeciso se restituirlo. Alla fine l ho tenuto ma non sono molto convinto.
5,この値段でこの性能！音質もよく最高です。ブルートゥースも使えスマホの音楽も再生出来ます。古いレコードを聴くためにレコードプレーヤーとスピーカーをそろえてオーディオを満喫しています。
5,Ich muss hier mal ein klares Lob loswerden:Ich war auf der Suche nach einem passiven 2.1 System da ich meinen alten Auto-Subwoofer nicht verschenken wollte.Die hier angebotenen Geräte liegen beim Thema Leistung immer recht nah zusammen. Da ich von Fosi schon das ein oder andere Gerät besitze habe ich mich letztendlich für diesen Verstärker entschieden.Betrieben werden 2 Lautsprecher Eigenbau mit je ca 300W. Der Sub von Blaupunkt hat ca 700W.Der Verstärker ist dementsprechend sicher etwas zu schwach auf der Brust.ABER... das Teil macht einen mega job!!Kurz an den Reglern eingestellt per Bluetooth mit dem Handy verbunden und los geht's.Klar wir reden hier nicht von high-end aber was dieses Gerät für um die 100 Euro bietet ist TOP!!Keine Verbindungsabbrüche wird nicht heiß sehr guter Klang was will man mehr?!+ natürlich toller Amazon Versand.5 Sterne!
3,メインのボリュームを回すとしゃりしゃりノイズが入るようになりました。ただし入力信号なしの時や高音域がないときにはノイズが乗らないことがわかりました。ボリュームの劣化ではなく、高音域を処理する回路がノイズに弱いようです。本アンプの入力前にボリュームを追加して本アンプのボリュームに触らないようにすることでノイズに悩まされることがなくなりました。（追加したボリューム：Nobsound　3.5ｍｍアクティブボリュームコントローラー）
4,なかなか使えます。ノイズなくクリアな音質です
4,Funciona adecuadamente quizá quede un poco débil en cuanto al volumen aportado ante todo con altavoces medianos-grandes.  Con pequeños supongo irá mejor en capacidad de volumen.
3,PCのモニター用として使用し始めて3日目。音楽を視聴するのにも十分なレベル。これまでNobsoundのNS-14Gを使用していましたが1年過ぎから不調（時間がたつと歪みが増えだしてやがてDOWN）し、１年４か月でオシャカ。で、買い替えたもの。一つ不安があるのは”保証書”が同封されていないこと。User’ｓ　GuideにはWarranty　Informationに　18-monthの記述はあるのだが販売日等の証明がないのが不安である。
5,Fantastic for the money!
5,Forget about your big bulky amplifier you know the one that takes up a lot of space i too had one but now i've got this Fosi amp smaller that a bluray disc box but it has 100w per channel so how many 200watt amps have you seen that is smaller than a bluray box? of course your thinking yeah but it might sound horrible.....i too thought that until i tried it out this amp for it's size is exceptional the sound is clear and you get an input for a passive subwoofer also it has bluetooth i used a Sony amp for my music but now i use this Fosi okay it's not remote control but's not a problem for me when i first saw this i laughed because of it's size but now Fosi has the last laugh.
5,Molt bona qualitat de so per un amplificador tan petit. Bon control del subwoofer. Recomanable per la bona relació qualitat preu.
5,Ich habe den Verstärker gekauft um Lautsprecher an einem Flachbildschirm TV zu betreiben. Die Originalen Lautsprecher an den Fernsehern sind ja leider das Hinterletzte aber technisch ist das wohl nicht besser zu machen. Allerdings - auch wenn man die Lautsprecher selbst baut unter 800 bis 900 Euro bekommt man auch hier nichts ordentliches.Aber:Jetzt ist das Genuschel verschwunden und auch Musiksendungen machen wieder richtig Spaß. Der Verstärker tut was er soll und es ist erstaunlich was aus der kleinen Kiste alles herauskommt.Detlef
5,Everything is very good except for a barely audible static noise. Its so silent you have to put your ear 10cm away from the speaker to even hear it. Then why even mention it? Well the problem is this static noise becomes quite loud once you turn the treble knob up. Nonetheless I gave 5 stars because I don't turn the treble up anyways. Note that this does not happen when you increase the overall volume or the bass. All in all I am satisfied with my purchase just thought I might mention this because for someone else the treble could be more important than for me. Have a good one!
5,RCAにはTVを繋ぎ、Bluetoothはスマホとペアリング、スピーカはBOSE101MMの構成です。アンプの電源はずっとオンのままで、TVを観る時はプアな内蔵スピーカに代わる外部スピーカとして使いつつ、音楽を聴きたい時はスマホのBluetoothを接続して好きな曲を聴いています。通常はTVと接続していて赤ランプが点いていますが、スマホのBluetoothをオンにすると直ぐにBluetoothに繋がり、青ランプに変わります。Bluetoothをオフにすると自動的に元の赤ランプに戻るので、いちいち手動で切り替える必要はありません。BOSE101MMが吐き出す音にも大満足です。イージーリスニング用途であれば十二分な音質で、これまで使っていたNobsound NS-01G Proと比べると、音に立体感が増したような感じがします。
3,Sicuramente piccolo amplificatore dall'ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo ma in questo modello anche io ho notato quel fastidiosissimo fruscio rumore bianco o non so cosa sia di cui ho già letto in altre recensioni. Al momento posseggo sia la versione 2.1 senza controlli per il subwoofer ( il BT30A) che è perfetta in questo senso e anche alzando il volume al massimo non si sente completanente ancun fastidio sia questa versione ( il BT30d) con i controlli per il sub dove anche a volume zero il fruscio di fondo è sempre costanetemente presente. Per farlo sparire bisogna spegnere del tutto oppure escludere il controllo dei treble. Non è colpa dei cavi né dei diffusori troppo sensibili (i miei hanno 86 dB) né dell'alimentazione.Le cose sono 2: o si tratta di un difetto di progettazione oppure è sempre lo stesso singol prodotto difettoso che gira tra gli acquirenti che poi lo rimandano indietro così come farò io. Ho deciso di tenere la versione senza i controlli per il subwoofer che oltretutto a differenza del BT30d ha il selezionatore per per scegliere se attivare l'ingresso Bluetooth o l'ingresso RCA. Per quanto riguarda il suono immagino che tra i 2 amplificatori non cambi nulla visto che montano gli stessi componenti. Purtroppo non ho avuto modo di testarlo come si deve perchè l'ho rimesso subito nella sua scatota in attesa di rimandarlo indietro e ho rimontato il BT30A che per quello che costa è davvero un piccolo gioiellino.
5,Nutze es seit etwas weniger als ein Jahr. Es funktioniert sehr gut sowohl via Bluetooth als auch natürlich angeschlossen. Ich kann es nur empfehlen.
4,余っていたパッシブサブウーファーを使いたいために購入8cmウーファーの2WAYであるKENWOODのLS-NA7の低音不足を見事に補ってくれますトーンコントロールの高音は上げると細目にシャリシャリと、これぞドンシャリという音です低音はトーンコントロールありサブウーファーのボリュームあり、FRQあり低音好きならいい製品ですなによりパッシブウーファーが使えるのが高ポイントですBluetoothもAACですんなり繋がり、こだわらなければ十分良い音です筐体の小ささもポイント高いですしバナナプラグも使えるし価格も手ごろで自分では良い買い物をしたと思います、あとは長持ちしてくれればですが。もう一つデジタル入力があればもう少し高くても星５つでした。中華アンプもなかなかやると思い、日本メーカーが苦戦する（した）のも納得です
2,Also zuerst muss man mal sagen dass die Idee wirklich super ist. Ein winziger Verstärker mit Anschlussmöglichkeit für ein Paar Lautsprecher und einen aktiven Subwoofer und das zum kleinen Preis - das ist echt gut.Problem: das war es auch schon.Na klar man darf keine Wunder erwarten...Das Teil kommt relativ edel verpackt an und mutet erstmal teurer an als es ist.Anschlüsse sind solide ausgeführt die Drehregler fühlen sich gut an. Da fällt der billige Kippschalter zum Ein- und Ausschalten schon fast aus dem Rahmen.Ich habe zwei kleine Teufel-Satelliten-Lautsprecher und den dazugehörigen aktiven Subwoofer daran angeschlossen damit meine Tochter ihre Hörspiele über das Handy abspielen kann und einen besseren Sound als nur aus dem Handy dabei hat. Klappt auch.Jetzt zu den Problemen:Die Höhen muss ich - um einen sauberen Klang zu haben - relativ weit hoch drehen. An sich kein Problem aber dadurch produziert der Verstärker ein sehr deutliches Grundrauschen was in leisen passagen besonders nervt. Das ist auch da solange gar kein Signal anliegt. Einfach immer wenn das Gerät eingeschaltet ist. Was dazu führt dass ich die Höhen wieder raus gedreht habe. Jetzt ist kein Rauschen da oder nur sehr wenig aber dafür halt der Klang nicht so gut wie er sein könnte. Irgendwie blöd.Das nächste Problem ist die Bluetooth-Verbindung. Das Gerät wird zwar problemlos erkannt Kopplung geht auch aber jedesmal wenn man das Gerät ausschaltet und danach wieder ein muss man es neu koppeln. Es merkt sich nicht mit welchem Gerät es gekoppelt ist und baut die Verbindung nicht automatisch nach Einschalten der Stromversorgung wieder auf. Das finde ich nicht nur nervig sondern auch unverständlich weil es sicher einfach anders zu machen wäre seitens der Programmierung.Ich habe trotzdem beschlossen das Gerät zu behalten mangels Alternative in der Größe.Seit kurzem habe ich allerdings noch ein Problem. Das Gerät gibt sporadisch die Quelle nur noch ganz leise und stark verzerrt wieder. Schaltet man es dann aus und wieder ein geht es erstmal wieder. So als ob ein Wackelkontakt irgendwo wäre auf einer Platine oder so. Dem Hersteller habe ich geschrieben mal sehen was er dazu sagt wie das Problem gelöst werden kann.
5,Le son est superbe des basses puissantes et des aigues bien nettes. C'est juste parfait ! je l'utilise dans une petite pièce de 20m2.
4,少し角のとれた穏やかな音質です。hi-fiを求めると不満が出るかもしれませんが、小型スピーカーでブルーツース重視なら何の不満もないと思います。残念なのは、スイッチに指で触れると、スピーカーからバリバリと音が出ることです。ボリュームの端子類を触った感触はとても良かっただけに、すこし残念な気がしました。
5,Ottimo prodotto pensavo peggio ed invece si comporta bene  anche con un sub woofer da 500w riesce a gestire abbastanza bene …Consigliato
5,Perfect little amp. Stylist and functional. Ideal for my needs. I have it hooked up to a pair of old Pioneer (100w) speakers plus a Polk subwoofer. The units MAX Power Output: 50W x 2+100W.The Bluetooth is fine and the connection was quick. It does from time to time drop out even when my mp3 player is only 2-3 metres away but in the main its stable. I have notice though that using my other MP3 player which is an iPod touch then I get no drop out. Its very loud when I want it to be I control volume via the mp3 player.Good sound for me but I’m not audio master. It packs a punch for such a small amp it handles my speakers and sub well.I would definitely recommend this unit to my family friends and colleagues.
5,Superbe ampli marche très bien pas de parasite l'alimentation a été visionnée améliorer un peu léger ça se comprend les plaques sans aluminium la puissance raisonnable jusqu'à 30 mètres carrés avec des bons enceinte bien sûr c'est un ampli très robuste je recommande !
3,L'amplificatore lavora bene ed è ben costruito materialmente. Non ha quei fastidiosi avvisatori acustici che ti avvertono quando lo accendi o quando si accoppia con dispositivi tramite bluetooth. Ha però purtroppo un'unica grande pecca: presenta un perdurante e fastidioso (almeno per me) fruscio collegato alla manopola dei treble. Già da 1/4  comincia a sentirsi ed aumenta mano mano si alzano i treble. Per me che utilizzo i treble a 3/4 l'ampli è praticamente inutilizzabile in quanto la sera quando spengo la tv per dormire mi ritrovo questo fruscio decisamente fastidioso. E non risolve abbassare la manopola del volume perchè il problema è collegato esclusivamente ai treble e si presenta anche con volume a zero. Ho provato anche a cambiare alimentatore con uno meno potente (19V) ma nulla...stesso risultato. Ho contattato l'assistenza Fosi che mi ha risposto dicendomi che il rumore bianco è normale in questo modello in quanto il guadagno è maggiore rispetto ad altri e mi hanno suggerito di abbassare i treble o applicare altoparlanti meno sensibili. Ho dovuto necessariamente fare il reso peccato perchè per il resto era perfetto.
4,ディスクトップPCで、真空管プリアンプと連結で使ってます。個人的にプリ使う方の為にTREBLEやBASSの調整なしのタイプも有れば？2.1CHのアンプはサブウーファーが簡単に調整出来て良い製品だと思います。
5,BIC Venturi DV62si とサブウーファー出力に単独ではも一つのトールスピーカーをパラレルに接続　ナイスです。
4,Ottimo prodottopiccolo ma potente e dal suono onestocollegato a 2 diffusori con woofer da 13 cm e tweeterpiù subwoofer da 25 cmsmuove un bel po' di ariacon un suono inaspettatoneutro e piuttosto dettagliato.non ho riscontrato quel fruscio di fondo accusato da altri utentineppure a volume alto.consigliato a chi vuol assemblare un primo impianto hifio da usare con un PC o TVsi toglierà delle soddisfazioni.
5,Nonavrei mai pensato una qualità così ottimo amplificatore.
4,Nel complesso non mi sembra male. I materiali  al tatto  restituiscono una  buona  sensazione.  Il suono  è  brillante  e pulito.Il volume mi lascia qualche  dubbio però  per quello che  serve a me va benissimo.
5,Great little amp. I paired it with Klipsch R 41m's and it can shake the room when pushed no distortions that I can hear pretty amazing. It does have some static noise coming out if you crank up the dial with highs but its only audible when you dont play anything; when music is on you cant hear it. I cant say anything about the sub output since I dont have a sub. The bluetooth connection works great. Great value for money no regrets whatsoever.
5,Bien embalado. Conexión bluetooth a la primera. Fácil de instalar. Sin ruidos. Buenas conexiones. Buena calidad y acabado. Volvería a comprarlo. 👍
5,Buon compromesso tra qualità e prezzo suono pulito con buon controllo dei toni bello da vedere anche se piccolo ed essenziale.
5,Amplificatore davvero ben fatto e molto musicale. Sto pilotando due Magnat Studio ed ho collegato all'uscita sub preamplificata un subwoofer attivo Yamaha. Tutto perfetto il bluetooth si connette immediatamente e non ci sono fruscii ne disturbi a qualsiasi volume. Molto bello anche a vedersi.
5,Consegna in tempi rapidissimi complimenti!Il prodotto è bello alla vista ed al tatto ed ispira qualità (a parte i morsetti ..)Suona davvero bene considerando le dimensioni veramente ridotte ma per esaltarne le caratteristiche   occorrono delle casse di qualità .. In verità  ha dei limiti soprattutto a regimi medio alti per cui bisogna lavorare con le frequenze  toni casse e sub .Per mio gusto personale pecca un po’ negli alti mentre nei bassi non ci sono problemi .UNA COSA IMPORTANTE; NIENTE FRUSCIO DI ALCUN TIPO  perfetto !
5,Wurde ohne Fernbedienung geliefert.
4,最近にしては珍しく期待以上のチャイナ製ですかね。重低音はも少し欲しいかも。
5,Nothing to dislike . The unit is small & very easy to connect blue tooth . Money well spent (Scotsman) sound quality 👍
5,Ho abbinato questo amplificatore ai diffusori Edifier P12 e ad un subwoofer per car audio.E` adatto ad essere utilizzato per impianti modesti sufficienti a riprodurre musica in una piccola stanza per una postazione da gaming o per il televisore. E` talmente piccolo da stare nel palmo di una mano e nonostante questo grazie all'utilizzo dello stadio amplificatore TPA3116D2 in classe D offre una qualita` eccellente. Non lo voglio comparare con sistemi dedicati all'alta fedelta` ma per me e` eccellente siccome offre un ascolto piacevole e in rapporto al prezzo non ho dubbi: lo comprerei di nuovo.
5,Das Teil ist kaum größer als 'ne Schachtel Zigarretten und hat eine gute Leistung.Direkt nach dem Einschalten ist es bereit für das Pairing was bei uns sowohl mit I-Phone als auch mit Android sauber funktioniert hat.Der Schalter arbeitet mechanisch so daß man zum Einschalten eine Master/Slave Schaltung nutzen kann.Auch der Chinch-Ausgang für einen Sub-Woofer funktioniert ohne Probleme. Ich habe einen aktiven 2-Kanal Woofer von Magnat dran der jetzt allerdings nur auf einem Kanal angesteuert wird was akustisch aber keine Auswirkung hat. Die Übergangsfrequenz und auch die Lautstärke des Woofers lassen sich am Verstärker sauber anpassen.Kann ich empfehlen!
5,Compact unit nice and solid. Bluetooth connection reliable no glitches. With the subwoofer attached there's plenty of volume for a house.
5,fosiの安価なものが比較的良かったので買い替え。Bluetooth接続もスムーズでウーファー繋いでさらに高音質になった。amazonでオススメされたYAMAHAの安価なスピーカーとウーファー繋いで使ってます。以前は国産のトールボーイや単品コンポなども使ってましたが、この金額でこのレベルなら大満足。
3,本体（BT30D)自体は、外観・性能ともに価格以上に満足できる品質を持っています。残念ながら付属の電源アダプターのACインレット部と電源コードコネクターの嵌合がキツすぎてスムーズに差し込めません。無理やり差し込むと今度は抜けなくなる始末です。ACインレット・コードコネクター部分共に、抜き差し強度は国際基準で定められており、基準に適合した部品通しであればこのような不具合が生じないよう定められています。安全性に直結する部分なので、付属品といえども国際基準に適合した一定の品質を保持した部品に変更してほしい。
5,Audiophile j’ai apprécié la possibilité d’écouter des fichiers des sources numériques ainsi que de mon iPhone via Bluetooth !
4,I've moved from nobsound as this amp has so much better bluetooth
5,Sorprende su tamaño y su potencia. Los controles funcionan con suavidad y la separación de frecuencias para el subwoofer es perfecta.
5,The amplifier reached me very quickly.It was easy to connect the wires of my 20+ years old passive speakers and my music centre (bad sound) with RCA cables to this amplifier. The system worked immediately. I am not an expert of music or sound but it seems that my music centre has never made better sound. I am very satisfied. Have not tested subwoofer yet.Bluetooth works fine without  problems. I can sit at least 5 meters away with a smartphone or laptop and play music files or Youtube.Villu
5,☆５の理由は価格を考慮して。（昭和時代の高額のアンプは何だったのだろう）Bluetooth接続は即時、ノンストレスです。2.1サブウーハーの音量、周波数（ローパス？）がそれぞれ好みに調整が可能、ジャンルや昼夜に合わせられてとても優秀です。耐久性は分かりませんが、価格からすれば十分すぎる製品と思います。
5,Endlich. Fosi hat’s als einziger verstanden. Nix Plastik nix kompliziert nix teuer aber guter Klang gute Leistung. Endlich finden meine alten guten passiven Boxen wieder Verwendung. Sogar meinen guten aber kaputten aktiver Sub kann ich mit diesem Verstärker fahren… und wie! .. mehr wie Zimmerlautstärke! Extrem kleine Bauform für diese Leistung. Schön und wertig gemacht. Blauzahn funkt auch super. Fernbedienung braucht man nicht.Einziges Verbesserungspotential: Ein Auto-Power Off wäre super!
4,I had a spare pair of speakers I wanted to add to my TV to comensate for the poor built in sound. I chose this item because it was reasonably priced and powerful enough to meet my requirments. Banana fittings were also a positive comapred to similar items.I am very pleased with what I bought. It is a nice small but powerful unit which has improved my audio visual appreciation considerably.I have not tried the bluetooth but would recommend this produce as a good priced amp.
4,コスパに、コンパクトなかなかの音質。リモコン使用に、なればもっといいかな？
5,Received in good time - Just wired it up to my PC and passive sub woofer -  Base and treble work great and sub woofer works perfectly.Best sound I've ever experienced from my desktop.
5,Ottimo amplificatore dal suono monitor ma abbastanza caldo.Abbinato a due satelliti autocostruito Pirless Vifa passo alto a 200 hz 12 db ed un sub pile uso car si sente divinamente per quello che costa. Si collega velocissimo al bluetooth e volendo trovare un difetto manca la scala del taglio in frequenza per il sub. Trasformatore 24 volt perfetto non fruscia. Silenzio a volume sostenuto nelle pause Bass e Treble a zero. Consigliato.Grazie tante
5,Lovely little device. Quality build and easy to install. Worked as expected. Definitely recommend this.
4,テレビ音声をイヤホンジャックから入力して、INFINITYの小型ブックシェルフスピーカーとDENONサブウーファーにつないで聴いています。テレビ付属のスピーカーとは段違いのいい音でテレビを楽しんでいました。価格とサイズからは予想以上のパフォーマンスで良い買い物だと思いました。ところが、一ヶ月ほどしてボリュームを変えているときに、バリバリ、という音とともにスイッチが切れ応答しなくなりました。早速メーカーに問い合わせたところ、再度連結しなおすよう言われたので、その通りしたが変化なしだったので、新品と交換していただきたいと伝えた。すると、新品交換するという連絡があったが、１０日以上も音沙汰がない。何度か連結し直しているうちにスイッチが入って音を聞くことができたが、不安定な状態が続いている。その後、交換商品が届きました。メールのやり取りでは、こちらにも言葉足らずの部分があったかも知れないので評価を改めました。今は問題なく動作しています。
5,Lo usato per fare un Karaoke
2,Ne ho posseduto diversi di questi "Classe D" negli ultimi 10 anni ma questo è uno dei peggiori. Non sto a valutare la qualità audio discreta tutto sommato ma anche inferiore a chip più anziani nè la reale potenza modesta e cmq molto al di sotto del dichiarato ma non posso accettare la quantità di fruscio udibile in sottofondo. Ok è anche dichiarato nella descrizione ma ci si aspetta che sia fastidiosa almeno oltrepassando i 2/3 dell'apposito  comando e non già a 1/3!  Altro discorso negativo per l'uscita del sub amplificato regolabile da due appositi comandi che va in conflitto con il crossover e il controllo volume presente già sul sub; forse funzionale per un subwoofer passivo ma per un attivo molto problematico. Ultimo neo i connettori per le casse tolte le banane per evitare si toccassero è stato arduo usare i fili spellati visto che i fori sono quasi sovrapposti e difficili da raggiungere. Difficilmente mi appello al reso ma questa volta è stato inevitabile.
4,SUBウーハーを繋がないときの音は···。SUBウーハーを繋げば30Hz迄出ます。
4,C'est génial pour sa taille ça prend pas beaucoup de place très discret.
5,Alles bestens
5,risponde a pieno alle mie aspettative.consegnato subito imballo perfetto semplice nell'utilizzo.collegato ad un subwoofer passivo e ad un paio di casse Indiana Line la resa è ottima con una buona spazialità.se devo trovare una mancanza avrei gradito anche la possibilità di bilanciamento tra i canali che invece non è presente. nessuno è perfetto.un ottimo acquisto con poca spesa. lo consiglio.
5,Easy to set up and great sound
5,Not bad quality but volume control is not pecise.
5,Using this to drive JBL ceiling speakers.  4 full range and one subwoofer.  Amplifier has plenty of power for domestic usage. Drives the JBLs really well level control and subwoofer frequency built into amp makes it perfect for a simple solution.  Bluetooth has been reliable happily connects to LG TV. Very clear sound.  Delighted with the purchase.
5,ステレオアンプが壊れたので、購入しました。安いのに良い音、眠っていたサブウーハーも復活し、上々です。元のコンポの音より良いのではと思ってしまいます。
5,Parfait pour mon utilisationMarche parfaitement le son est étonnant surtout quand on voit le prix.Je l’utilise en retour surround avec mon Tv LG.Fonctionne à merveille avec satellite Cambridge et un caisson de grave maison.
5,Sonorisation d'un garage. Pas de problèmes apparents. Fonctionne très bien. Réglage bien pratique pour le caisson de basses. Le Bluetooth passe bien au travers d'un mur de parpaings. (Par contre je crois savoir que le Bluetooth ne passe pas très bien si il y a des armatures métalliques dans les cloisons)
1,商品のパッケージに直接送り状を張り付けての出荷。しかも、パッケージ蓋のシールが剝がれていて、蓋がパカパカの状態で届きました。付属品が足りないかもしれないが、この状態じゃ分からない。商品は悪くないんだから、もったいない。サイズがでかい商品だったらわかるけど、何ケチってんだって感じ。
4,Tape deck to Macbook amplified input.
3,Ich habe in der letzten Zeit etliche Class D Verstärker getestet. Der Fosi gehört in die Schublade sieht geil aus und hat aber leider absolut nicht die Leistungsangaben welche versprochen werden. Ich schätze 2x10 Watt plus 20 Watt für den Subwoofer. Ähnliche Class D Verstärker machen deutlich mehr Lautstärke am gleichen Setup/Lautsprecher.Was ich konkret vermisse ist eine Hochpassegelung für die SATs und eine Phaseneinstellung im Trennungsbereich.Am Schreibtisch mit kleinen Regalboxen plus kleiner Sub oder zur Hintergrundbeschallung ist er durchaus geeignet mehr aber auch nicht.
2,Overall the sound quality was not what I expected. Volume was weak and the bass was almost non existent. I intended to use it to improve the sound quality of my TV as well as sending music from my phone via bluetooth. I am running the sound to some DAYTON AUDIO exciters purchased from AMAZON also. In order to improve the overall sound it looks like I will have to add a subwoofer.
5,molto piccolo si nasconde facilmente funziona bene poca spinta
5,Premetto che non sono un esperto di hifi. Per il prezzo pagato fa quello che promette. L'ho collegato a due casse Magnat 202 e sono soddisfatto dell'impianto spesa totale 230€. Il fruscio che molti lamentano è fastidioso solo se si alzano molto i treble ma sinceramente non vedo l'esigenza di settarlo in quel modo. Per me è ok.
4,Victor　K2コンボで聴いています!　此のコンボは主にCD .ラジオ波のみしか使え無いため、いつも同じCD.を聴いていたのでブルートゥスで聴きたいと思い購入しました。結果　接続も簡単で音域も良く大変満足しています。音域は主に個人差があり切りがないですね?　次は、真空管アンプのブルートゥスを購入して、聴き比べたいと思います。
5,IL prodotto è arrivato nei tempi previsti ero un pò indeciso all'acquisto per la qualità dell'ascolto! quando lho provato con sistema 2.1 non ho avuto più dubbi se dovrei acquistarne un'altro lo farei ad occhi chiusi.Rumore di fondo inesistente a come diceva qualcuno il prodotto e validissimo.
5,狭いホームオフィス（四畳半）で使うには必要十分です。　Bluetoothも確実に接続できて音飛びもありません。スピーカーは JBL  Control 1に ヤマハ NS-SW050を接続。気をつけないと低音の迫力が近所迷惑になりそうです。PCモニター下の狭い場所に設置して簡単に音量調整ができて便利です。
5,スマホやウォークマンからBluetoothで飛ばして聴いていますが、とにかく接続が早くて快適です。音質に関しては、この値段にしてはこれで十分です。単体だと低音は少し物足りない気もしますが、音質のツマミで多少の増減は可能ですし、サブウーファーを追加すれば強過ぎるくらいに補えます。耐久性はまだ分かりませんが、今のところ不満はありません。
5,Il prodotto giusto per amplificare due diffusori da incasso Macron e un subwoofer Hertz per avere un audio più performante nella mia suite
4,bluetooth接続は、上手く接続できる機器と、上手く接続できない機器が有ることは確かなようです。コンピューターを２台使っていますがbluetoothドングルの古い物は、接続までは出来ても、音のドライバーがインストールされません。少し前に購入したELEGIANTのアンプは何の問題も有りませんでした。音はELEGIANTよりも良い音です。
5,Ho acquistato questo amplificatore  per diffondere la musica dal mio IPhone nel mio studio e devo dire che il prodotto è fantastico!...ovviamente molto dipende dalla qualità delle casse io ho utilizzato un sistema Bose con Subwoofer e satelliti e mi trovo benissimo la potenza è ottima e la connettività pure. Lo consiglio senz'altro.
5,j'avais déjà un modèle plus petit pour mon bureau. J'ai pris celui ci pour remplacer un ancien ampli qui n'avait pas de bluetooth.Très bon rapport qualité-prix
5,This little thing brought my vintage speakers back to life. Good build quality.
5,Ho acquistato questo mini amplificatore per un mio progetto e si è rivelato come da titolo fantastico. Sopra ogni aspettativa suono pulito e nitido non potevo chiedere di meglio. Ideale per il tempo libero e per ogni sorta di impiego. Prodotto valido lo consiglio a tutti gli amanti della musica.
3,Appena ricevuto  lo collego e rimango stupito della qualità e la potenza  purtroppo dopo un mese di utilizzo ho iniziato ad avere problemi con il volume che è sempre calato nei giorni seguenti  praticamente ad alto volume il mio google home si sente di più... peccato perché pareva fantastico.
3,随分前から使ってたONKYOのアクティブスピーカが壊れた... 構成はスピーカ+サブウーファ(アクティブタイプ)ONKYOの後継品はないようなので、アクティブタイプのサブウーファに対応しているものを探していたらこれしかなかったので、YAMAHAの9000円のフロントスピーカーとともに購入。購入、接続、音でない(サブウーファ) ...SUBVOLをMAX、SUB FREQを適当に色々、サブウーファ側のVOLをMAX(!!)にしてもフロント切らないと聞こえないくらい.... しょうがないのでこいつは2.0アンプにしてプリアンプ代わりにUSB接続の安物サウンドカード(?)を購入し、そこからサブウーファを出して対処。2.0アンプとしてはスピーカーもかわっちゃったので比べにくいですが結構まともに音出てると思います(値段で考えたら)全然関係ないけどなにも見ないで買った9000円のYAMAHAスピーカが思ったよりもデカくて困ったお前使い方間違ってるよ、ってご意見ありましたらお願いいたします。。。。
4,同社の下位グレードの商品ももっていますが、この商品は、とても良いです。低音もしっかり出て満足ですが、最大出力、片側80wは欲しいですね。他社の1、5マン超えの商品も購入しましたが、こちらのが、全然おすすめです。サブウーファーをつかうのであれば！
3,Ich habe den Amp gerade erhalten: Er ist sehr ordentlich gefertigt und klingt gut. Aber er hat zu wenig Power und schaltet bei größeren Lautstärken ab. Das könnte am beiliegenden Netzteil liegen das nur 4.5 A liefert. Fairerweise muß ich sagen ich habe ihn an großen Boxen mit passiven Subwoofern getestet. Vorgesehen ist er aber für Schreibtischboxen die noch nicht fertig sind.
5,Absolutely amazing little amp. I have paired this amp to a Bose Acoustimass 3 series IV system and connected it to a tv and the sound is phenomenal. Fills the room with either music or action frilling  sound from a movie. I would recommend this amp to anyone as it has not failed me yet.
5,DAPやタブレットをBluetoothで接続し、音楽やradikoを楽しんでいます。自分で楽しむ分には十分な音質で、購入して良かったと思います。あとは耐久性がどれくらいあるかですね。
4,Für PC Lautsprecher
5,Fabulous little power house sounds fantastic but I did have to make a lead for the sub .
5,また〜色んな!!もの!商品!〜お買い物しますありがとうございした。
5,Easy to set up and use a good price and no wires between music source and amp.
5,20年前からずっとAV環境としてアンプ（SSS-1EX）+スピーカー(214)+ウーファー(SBC-1)の構成でした、アンプの故障と、最近は旧来のCDDVDVHSラジオコンテンツは、TVに刺したHDDやamazon fire tv stickに置き変わっているため、アンプのみ買換えを検討していました。そこで見つけたのが本アンプです。パッシブ型のウーファーも接続可能な点が決め手でした。唯一20年前アンプの1/10以下の価格が逆に心配でした。結果は大正解SBC-1のコードはステレオフォンプラグ→バナナプラグに要改造でしたが、クロスオーバーの調整とボリュームの調整ができ、音質も音量も逆にＵＰしました。デジタルが原因なのか？スピーカーのホワイトノイズも従来より断然よくなりました。これが２０年前のアンプの1/10の価格で購入できる時代の変化に驚きです。使わなくなった、DVDプレイヤー、SSB-1EXは処分しました。上手くいったので、ガレージ用に、昔のbose101+AM-033＋本アンプの構成にすればbluetoothが大活躍しそうな気がします。
5,Ho restituito il bt30a per questo bt30d perché avevo la necessità di regolare il subwoofer passivo che prima andava un po’ a coprire io suono delle casse .... ora ho il suono perfetto su misura per me !!
1,Après une première commande où le câble a fait sauter le disjoncteur…. J’ai réitéré et cette fois-ci c’est la connexion Bluetooth qui ne fonctionnait pas… du coup j’ai abandonné et vommandé le fabuleux DOUK AUDIO qui est une pure merveille pour vous qui cherchez comme moi un fabuleux DAC…
5,Senza nessuna distorsione e un ottima qualità suono
3,私としては初めてのBluetoothオーディオです。2011年Kindle Fire HDや、AQUOSsense3で使用。接続に不満はありません。ウーハーを駆動出来ます。ウーハー用のボリウムや、cut off周波数を調整しながら、お好みに合わせた、十分な低音を楽しむ事が出来ます。音質は全体に良好で自然なもの、手持ちのrepy2024A+と比較するなら、丸い音と感じます。(ﾚﾊﾟｲはより瑞々しい音)ひとつ問題と感じるのは、盛大なホワイトノイズ。(Bluetooth/LINE入力に関わり無く)｢サー｣と言う音が、かなりハッキリ聞こえます。これは、ボリュームを最少に絞っても小さくはなりません。本体の設計の問題なのか？ 電源の問題なのか？ 分かりません。価格、音質のバランスから考えて、作業中や、食事のBGM用として使用するならば、最適と言えるかも知れません。TVに繋いでも良好です。
5,スピーカーを少し贅沢にして聴いています。Bluetoothも簡単に繋げて便利に使っています。肩張らずに楽しく聴いています。コストパフォーマンスは最高ですね。
3,LA POTENZA IN WATT NON CORRISPONDE A QUELLA DESCRITTA DAI PRODUTTORI TROPPO BASSA
5,Exceeded expectation.
5,20年前に20万位したアンプが4年前に壊れたままずっと放置されたレコードを聴きたくて、とりあえず購入しましたが、昔聴いてた時と全然情報量が多い気がします。良い意味で遥かに期待を裏切られました。
5,Klein und mit top Leistung
5,tres bien
5,Toller Verstärker knackige Bässe exzellente Höhen. Für die Größe und dem Preis Leistungsverhältnis absolut zu empfehlen. War sehr überrascht.
3,評価が高いのとサブウーハー端子付きで購入サブウーハーはオンキョウのパッシブ前はパワーアンプlepyの2024A＋に無理矢理付けてました低音は出ますがボアンボアン響いてボーカルがかすんでました、その点このfosiaudioは適度に低音が出てとっとも聞きやすいしかもパッシブ用アンプ内蔵用と両方できる最近はパッシブ用サブウーハー端子付きは少ないようです、エージングは必要です最初なんじゃこれーと思いましたが５時間ほど鳴らしていたらだんだんクリアになっていきました、誰か言ってましたがlepyより音は優しいですがいい音します、最初DACのFX-audio５Qに接続してましたが何とも薄ぺらい音それならと間にノブサウンドP1をかましたら厚みが出ました、JBL4312MⅡをいい音で鳴らしてくれてます、大満足です
5,Guter Klang und hochwertige Verarbeitung. Ausreichend Anschlüsse kompakte Abmessungen. Leistung reicht für kleine Räume oder den Schreibtisch.
1,SUB OUT→パッシブスピーカー出力の音が出ない→どうやったら音が出るのか。SUB OUT端子→パワードサブウーハーの接続方法がわからない→一本のケーブルなのか？当方のウーハーの端子は＋－がある。R OUT L OUT は音が出る。
5,The title says it all !
2,Sans aucune source branchée / enceintes Klipsch R41M on entend un souffle volume à zéro. Si on augmente le treble sur le Fosi le souffle est encore plus fort.Les enceintes ne produisent aucun souffle quand je les branche sur un ampli "normal". J'ai aussi branché des Focal sur le Fosi : souffle identique.Ce bruit est assez pénible à la longue pendant des périodes de silence suffisamment pour retourner le produit.
5,Bonne amplitude dans tous les registres
5,Sehr gutes Gerät. Ich bin zufrieden
5,満足。Bluetoothは試してないからわかりません。
2,以前買ったELEGIANTの　ボリュームスイッチが付いただけの中華アンプの方が　音質が良かったです。値段が倍以上したのにがっかりです。　ただし低音は良く出ています。
5,Compatto. Qualità del suono in rapporto al costo.
5,Ottima qualità audio installazione facile solidità del materiale di buona fattura. Non scalda assolutamente
5,ottimo suono buon case e buoni controlli del taglio subwoofer
5,A lovely little amp. Used to replace part of old hi-fi. Only had it working for a few minutes but sounds great with existing speakers.
1,Took it out of book connected up very crackly kept cutting out I'm run audio equipment for a living this was just so poor I disconnected immediately and posted back for refund got it no problems but very poor product I'd avoid
1,届いた物は、返品されたものなのか新品ではなかった。しかも商品の箱をガムテープでとめて、直接送り状が貼られている状態。本体のゴム足は剥がれてズレてしまってて、全てが残念。問い合わせ先にメールしても、自動翻訳の様な中途半端な日本語の返信。返品するのも面倒で仕方なく使用。製品の音質については解像度もバランスも悪く、価格以下といって良い。ホワイトノイズも許容範囲では無いです。遊べる2.1chと思い購入してみましたが、この価格帯なら他をオススメします。
1,Was amazing for the first month but then developed loud crackling in the right output and fluctuating volume. Unusable now and awaiting options from seller.
1,FosiのはBT10Aがいい感じだったので期待してこちらも買ったのですが、ノイズが酷くてだめでした。ACアダプター変えたりしてみたのですが改善せず。スピーカーによっては多少マシになるので接続するスピーカーによるかもしれません。
5,Brilliant little amp for the money... 👍😃
1,Was fine for a month but then developed a fault causing bad static noise from speakers when not in use.
1,Der Verstärker hat mit meinen Boxen leider ein verhältnismäßig lautes Rauschen. Sobald man die Höhen aufdreht wird dies so schlimm dass man ihn leider nicht verwenden kann.Das Gerät geht zurück.
1,『サー』というノイズが常に入る音量に関係なく、サブウーハー低温領域に高温領域の音が少し混ざるしかもガサガサした高音！ハイビジョンオーディオどこが？この会社はAMラジオ並みの音をハイビジョンオーディオっていうのかな！もはや詐欺レベル(ー_ー)!!
1,PROVATO CON CASSE INDIANA FUNZIONAMENTO ANOMALO E PESSIMO E POI SILENZIO ASSOLUTO. MENO DI UN GIOCATTOLO. PERICOLOSO PER L'IMPIANTO.
1,Attached speakers but there was no audio  no sound coming out  even though it had connected to my. Device via Bluetooth.
5,Excelente opción para audio casero con gran fidelidad de audio lo utilizo con unas bocinas de 6 ohms de impedancia buena conectividad Bluetooth con diferentes dispositivos es genial poder controlar los graves a mi gusto.
5,Best value for the money!
3,I have only used it for streaming music from my phonenoticed the sound fading in and out at times might not be the amp that's causing itoverall not a bad  little Amp for the price.
2,Do check all the positive reviews but I was frustrated out of the box with Bluetooth connectivity. Immediate return.
5,Bought this for my PC. Hooked up with two bookshelf speakers and a Polk 10 inch sub. Bluetooth to the fosi from my laptop sounds great. Right amount of sound adjustments with the front dials. I frecking love this thing! Been showing it to all my friends.
5,Amazing output power for its size.  Excellent tonal clarity and so easy to make adjustments for personal preferences with the frontal controls.
5,Have currently connected to 50W Sony Bass Reflex 3Way Speakers volumn is good control knobs quality good is as advertised. Bluetooth connection superior immediate from paired tablet phone and computer. Wish there was a balance contol between speakers.
5,Para una habitación pequeña o mediana es un gran equipo con muy buena definición!!!
5,Even the bluetooth works flawlessly with the tv
5,Even the bluetooth works flawlessly with the tv
3,Seems a nice package but volume is low and absolutely cannot drive a passive sub not even a basic speaker attached to passive sub out. Ordered an active sub to see if it's worth keeping this amp.
5,Fácil de instalar buena adquisición sin duda.
5,Liked separate controls.
1,Just stopped working after a month. Wouldn't turn on any more. It worked okay before that but would constantly feed noise to the speakers when not playing anything. Spend a bit more money and buy something of quality. You get what you pay for.
4,Es bueno y si tiene buena fidelidad.  Si es recomendable.
5,Easy to use and install hooked up a pair of Klipsch r-51m speakers much better than my previous audio engine hd6 speakers. So much clearer and more detail barely move the volume knob and already a great listening volume great combo for desktop audio will source a sub in the near future would definitely recommend this amp!!
5,The unit itself feels to be good quality. All of the knobs are nice to use etc. Bluetooth seems to work well in close proximity but haven't tried through walls or anything. Sound quality is okay and drives my wharfdale bookshelf speakers reasonably well.Good:- Price- Build quality/feel- Does what it says on the tinNot so good:- Sound quality (as you might expect at this price)Good value little package!
4,J'utilise sur un kit de sono semi-mobile selon les saisons les voyages et les activités sur le patio.J'ai eu des problèmes de coupures de signal Bluetooth. Si il y des interferences autour du smartphone.  (mouvements) . C'est essayer une antenne plus grande : Ce fût pire. Je dois placer l'ampli dans un espace dégagé.
4,Excelente sonido salida para subwoofer muy práctica buena fidelidad a alto volumen.
5,Práctico excelente para lo que lo necesito. Provee de buen poder y fidelidad a las bocinas conforme al precio.
1,I bought this unit because I have a pair of slightly older passive speakers. I wanted to use them for my desktop setup. So I wait over a month for this product (it was very late) open it hook it up and........ disappointment.Build Quality:The volume controls are so floaty I found myself turning knobs with the slightest touch. The power switch is so flimsy I feel like I'm going to break it every time I flip it on. The rubber feet on the bottom aren't even properly placed. Nothing fit in the slots properly - either so tight I couldn't get the connectors in or so loose I couldn't get them to STAY in.Sound Quality:The sound quality is horrible. No clarity in the mids and a horrible constant hissing that's ALWAYS audible even when nothing is connected. Turn the volume up and be prepared for some crackling in the highs.All in all a do-not-buy for me. It's not worth even the extremely low price. $50 would be asking too much in my opinion.
2,Klen låter inte speciellt bra har du lättdrivna högtalare och vill ha lite garageljud så kan den vara OK.
5,Bad ass little unit.  Haven't tried the bluetooth capabilities.
4,Impressive for the size but definitely not a replacement for a good stereo. I've only tried bluetooth (connects very well and stable) ... I haven't experienced the "hissing" some have reported. Gets a little harsh on top end at higher volumes and I do need to have the volume cranked up to drive 87 db speakers in a smaller outdoor space. Output on sub is impressive. Overall I would recommend if your expectations are reasonable for such a small device.
5,Read instructions carefully when setting up. We linked this with 2 desktop speakers and a turntable. First time listening to vinyl for about 30 years.
5,I was looking for something to replace my amp for Djing. I was so surprised by how good this little amp is. It works exactly what I needed something for Left and Right speakers as well as an active sub input. It also comes with BlueTooth.
5,Ready to use right out of the box. Amazing sound for what it is
5,Good quality materials nice weight to it and the plugs are high quality.Was surprised at how small it is!Works perfectly for what we needed.
5,I was looking for a unit that allowed to plug the subwoofer. Very pleased with the product so far (2 months).
5,good sound  quality  no number on dials specialy for bass frequency .
5,What I really liked about this is the sheer speed and simplicity of the bluetooth connection. Go to your smart phone’s setting and connect to bluetooth to ‘Fosi Audio’. That’s it! No searching and installing of an app setting up an account & password and providing an email address name postcode etc so that they can spam you later. Bose Sonos etc I hope you guys are paying attention.Once connected which is very fast the small led turns blue. The sound quality is amazing and I honestly cannot fault it. I’ve got mine connected to a pair of Monitor Audio Silver 5 and M&K active sub-woofer. Sounds as good as my other amps from well-established hi-fi brands (I.e. NAD Rotel and Arcam) but FA has the advantage of bluetooth whereas the other do not.Highly recommended.
5,Works as it says and better. Very pleased with this purchase. Have it out side in a sealed container for my deck speakers.
5,Most Bluetooth devices have issues connecting this one worked right away with my Andriod phone and Windows computer.  I've only used it for an hour but it hasn't dropped the connection.  I bought it for my phone to connect with my vanbuild but I may get another to get rid of my bulky Yamaha home theatre system.  Yes it's only 2.1 but to get rid of the massive receiver I'm going to try it and if it works I'll order a second one for home.  Be nice to see this in 4.1 one day.
5,Quick & timely delivery.
5,Great Class D Amplifier. Super value for the money. Driving a pair of Klipsch Rp-600m and playing it like  a dream. Highly recommended.
5,Using it with my TV / turntable and Klipsch speakers. Works perfectly. Having the Bluetooth for my phone is a bonus.
5,Good little amp.  Sounds good with quality bookshelf speakers.
4,I needed a small amp that had an RCA line input subwoofer line out jack and built in bluetooth receiver. The separate controls for bass treble subwoofer level and variable crossover were a bonus. Honestly I wasn't expecting much based on the low price but it almost equals the performance of my Tangent BLT Ampster for about 1/3 the price. The build quality is not on par with the Tangent but it will only get limited use on weekends so it should last a long time. Removed 1 star because no remote control.
4,Great value for money good sound.I am using it with Klipsch R speakers and it is sounding awesome.I can also play with Bluetooth without issue but BlueTooth can interfere with USB/OPT/COAX input. In that if USB/OPT/COAX is being used as input it will turn off in the middle of playing and start playing BT if you connect to this unit using USB!Another point to note regarding BT is that anyone can connect to the BT if within range and start playing music! This is an issue though.

5,I connected the Fosi Audio BT30 to my Elac BS123 speakers (rated for 50-70watts) and it sounds fantastic. Even at 20% volume it is already loud. At first I had my doubts about this product. but so far i've got zero complaints. I've personally not listened to the bluetooth functionality since I only use the RCA output but connecting to bluetooth was very easy and fast. All in all a very good buy. Definitely a recommended product for a small powerfull amp.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Wow perfect fit to power a paire of 6.5 inch speaker cabinet and 1 8inch subwoofer. Price is very good alsoGive louds sound in small room. Wouldn't expect so make a party with this but very pleased with sound and power
4,J'ai dû retourner cet article une première fois car on. entendait un HISS constant indépendamment du volume. Aussi l'ampli était particulièrement chaud. Heureusement qu'Amazon offre un service de retour et de remboursement des articles qui est efficace mais c'est quand même une perte de temps. Je n'ai pas diagnostiqué la source du problème. Il y a un problème de contrôle de la qualité même si l'étiquette QC était apposée.La deuxième fois que j'ai acheté ce produit le niveau de hiss était raisonnable. J'ai comparé avec un ampli TEAC et c'était équivalent. J'aime bien le son de cet appareil. Je n'ai pas fait de test en profondeur par contre. J'ai branché des Hauts-parleurs très quelconque 2x DAYTON en stéréo et un vieil HP qui traînait dans la cave qui m'a servi de SUBWOOFER ici et ça a renforcé les basses de manière importante. J'ai aussi branché un troisième Haut-Parleur hors phase en arrière : le positif du canal gauche et le négatif du canal de droite ce qui ajoute un peu d'espace à l'ensemble le tout avec des HP de qualité tout juste OK et le résultat était impressionnant. Donc je suis satisfait. Le tout est installé dans ma salle de bain car j'aime bien commencer ma journée en musique.Le Bluetooth fonctionne très bien avec mon iPhone 8 plus.Cependant la source utilisée pourrait être problématique. J'ai fait joué Sgt Pepper's des Beatles depuis Amazon Music version gratuite avec un abonnement prime et c'était carrément infecte. Je suppose que la compression du son est exagérée. Cependant des enregistrements qui venaient de ma collection iTunes étaient toujours très corrects. Je n'ai pas poussé plus loin l'investigation par ailleurs. Je vous suggère d'essayer diverses sources lorsque vous tester cet appareil.En conclusion je mets 4 étoiles parce que j'ai dû retourner un premier achat.Dans l'ensemble je sus quand même satisfait
5,Lo recomiendo yo lo conecte a unas Monoprice MP-65RT 6.5in and Ribbon Tweeter y me da un excelente sonido fuerte y claro.
1,Stopped working after 3 months no help from seller or Amazon
5,seems to work well. I have 4 speakers running from it and it is fine even at higher volumes
3,I felt the build quality was a little lacking. The volume control was quite flimsy and didn’t seem to operate well.
5,I bought this amp to power some small satellite speakers - which were originally power by the subwoofer they came with - and I got an immediate upgrade in sound.  (The speakers are for my computer desktop setup).The unit feels solid as do the front controls and inputs on the back.As another reviewer commented straight out of the box mine didn't work.  To my relief when I powered everything down and left it for a while then powered it back up everything worked. And has continued to do so.
1,I returned this unit and purchased a Fossi BT20A which I am very satisfied with.This is why. The amp lacked bass in the two main channels and the sub out did not have enough power to drive my sub. With the BT20A powering two JBL bookshelf speakers I am happy with the amount of bass without having a sub.
1,TL;DR Version - Bluetooth was defective. Manufacturer was not responsive. Returned to Amazon (Thank goodness for Amazon's product service).Long Version:Bluetooth was defective (would randomly disconnect when you moved more than a couple feet away). Have never had any other issues with any other bluetooth. Reached out to Fosi Audio for support and had to send multiple follow-up emails before I got a response. And then when I did get a response they had a bunch of hoops to jump through.... here was their requested troubleshooting steps:1.Did you try the RCA  line input? and does the RCA line input have this issue?2.Please make sure there are no other interference sources around the power amplifier such as FM / AM radio WiFi router etc.3.Please make sure the antenna attached well with the amplifier and use other Bluetooth audio source to have a try.4.Did you exchange the audio source to have a try? also please move the amplifier to your another room to have a try.5.Could you give me a video to show the issue and your connection clearly? If the video is too big you could try via youtube or other ways thanks.
1,Honestly I was expecting something a bit more powerful it does the job but don't expect bass.
5,I connected the FOSI BT30D Amp to an electronic keyboard (KORG XE20 mounted in a Kohler "Baby Grand" piano case) to improve the sound output.  The Amp is powering 2 100 watt 8 ohm Panasonic speakers and a passive sub woofer.  The sound is fantastic much better than the speakers in the keyboard volume is more than enough and I now have bass treble and sub woofer controls that allow me to set the sound to my liking.  Because I purchased it specifically to enhance the sound coming from my keyboard I did not hook it up to bluetooth so I can not comment on this feature.
5,These little bluetooth compatible stereo is awesome! I have it with PBS 8" bookshelf speakers and a custom built slot port 8" jlw83v3 8" subwoofer paired with fossi audios 200 watt subwoofer amp powering a 12" pioneer in a slot ported box. That combination hammers. I can hear it from across the street. I love these little amps!!!!
5,The sound and build quality of this little box is amazing! Easy to use with either line in or Bluetooth I used a Milwaukee battery adaptor to power it and works flawlessly and now it's Portable!!
5,It is a great little amplifier that delivers surprising quality sound for the price.
1,Well the Bluetooth paired without issue however the audio quality was truly awful. It is unlistenable so it's being returned immediately. I purchased a much cheaper amp last week that barely functioned (that went back) so then I spent 4x more for this amplifier only to still be without a functional amplifier.This was really disappointing once again!Rather than building my own I thought it would be quicker and easier to quickly buy one - Nope!
5,I Bought this to replace a Sony 5.1 amp that I was running in my gym and was skeptical at first but once I got it hooked up and dialed everything in it was truly a surprise. The sound is great and does exactly as it is supposed to. The Bluetooth works and connects easily the connection quality at a distance seems to be pretty good my phone was about 20ft till I started having problems.
5,I did already own a wired Fosi amp (of lower power) but wow ! This one really blew me away :-) Sound is rich and crystal clear. The subwoofer channel delivers thumping lows. Bluetooth works flawlessly. And the amp stays cool even on heavy loads.
5,Amplificateur bien construit et très petit.Permet de brancher 2 enceintes 50w et 1 caisson de basse de 100w. Pour le moment rien à dire!Le bluetooth marche correctement. Il manquerait une télécommande pour allumer et éteindre à distance ainsi qu'un permutateur pour changer entre entrée aux et bluetooth

4,Adequate
5,Excelente sonido práctico fácil de instalar la salida para el Subwoofer excelente
5,Does everything it needs to. Be aware there is a delay when using Bluetooth. Make sure you hardwire it if you want your picture synced with the audio while gaming. Wouldn't make a difference for music though.
5,Great for the garage or shop.  Even to BT to outdoor speakers
5,For its size and price this cannot be beaten. I have it paired wit a Fozi preamp Wharfedale bookshelf speakers Yamaha subwoofer - and I could not be happier.It was only as a short term replacement after my Harmon Kardon amp went in for repairs but I won't be going back. The space it saves on the shelf alone makes it worth it.
5,The device is super awesome 👌. I upgraded from the older model I bought less than a year ago which had no BT or SubW connection options but great quality still. This newest model is excellent and the sound quality is superior. It took me 5 minutes to set it up. The addition of subwoofer connection made a huge difference to the output quality.  I love the little devil and I give it the thumb 👍.
3,Long story short. Mediocre.It’s terrible but it’s also not that great.It provides basic connections/options. Having two speakers and subwoofer hooked up it plays strong but at a cost.If you attempt to crank up volume past a certain point it releases terrible heavy static. The voltage it produces also causes the sub to cut out and distort the sound it’s producing forcing you to play at lower volume.Customer service is alright. My unit arrived partly damaged. I say this because some of the ports on the back were loose.I understand products can arrive damaged but the solution provided was to have myself service the unit something that I am not to keen on doing so.For the price that you play your better off spending a little more to get yourself a unit with more voltage that is unless your ok with playing at a lower volume or you just simply like the static sound.
5,Installed this in my shop to stream music from my phone to a pair of 3 way in-wall speakers. Lots of power decent sound and very compact - so much so that I recessed it a wall so only the controls protrude. Bluetooth is very stable and connects instantly. Hard to beat at this price
5,It works great.
5,Easy to set up and works great! Love being able to listen to music from my phone to my home system!
5,I am using this ampin  my mini homemade music server.The brains is a Raspberry Pi 4 with DAC running Volumio.  The system is powered by the FOSI 2.1 amplifier.The Moukey 3 way 5" speakers are supplemented with a single 8 ohm 6 inch sub-woofer ( ~ 1cu ft enclosure).It took me a while to build the sub so I used the Moukey speakers on their own for a few weeks.They performed admirably for their size and cost point.  They comfortably fill a living room (14 x 25') with excellent sound quality and modest volume.I am especially happy with the speaker's performance given the small mini amplifier used.As expected - the sub contributes quite a bit to the bottom end but I find myself attenuating the sub more than adding as the FOSI allows me to control the crossover point and sub volume.The entire setup is an award winner in my view.  Bluetooth input provision is a nice touch.For the sake of completeness and reference ...  My 'main' stereo in the media room is Bi-Amped with vintage Halfer and Crown amps pushing 1000 + watts RMS to Energy and ALTEC spkrs / sub.
5,Easy to set up and use. Straight forward setup
5,Very easy setup sounds great (depending on speakers obviously).Blue Tooth connected without issue.
5,I bought another little amp half a year ago and I thought it was very good.... until I ordered this one. The bass is much more than that one and the treble sounds cleaner and crispier. Connecting my Samsung phone Bluetooth is a breeze. I feel the power may not be true 200W (all channels together) but it is more than I need. The package and the user's manual are a bit too simple but it is OK - all Chinese native branded products are similar. If the casing comes with brushing metal style it will be even better. Overall  happy with this product.
5,Motsvarade mina förväntningar med råge. Använder den som förstärkare till mitt keyboard/ synt samt för att streama spotify från Pc till mina högtalare (via bluetooth). Imponerande prestanda i ett smidigt format!
1,Bueno considerando lo que cuesta
4,Wish it would come with better instructions. Did not sinc with my phone but did with other phone.
