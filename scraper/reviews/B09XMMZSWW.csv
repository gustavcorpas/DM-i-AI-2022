5,We now have enough plug/ports to charge everything in one spot.The nightlight is handy for seeing where thing plug in in the dark corner. I also appreciate that the light can be turned off manually. It's set for light sensing but that's not always useful.I dont know why they asked about wifi signal as it doesn't seem to be a smart plug nor a booster.I suppose it would also be helpful for travel but ours is screwed into the outlet so not the easiest to remove.
5,It fits perfect I had two outlets now I have more. Very easy to put on also just plug it in. It also has the USB c adapter for my phone charger.
5,Now we can plug everything in where it's convenient instead of running extension cords.  Even plug in the iphone charger at the same place where you're plugging in your lap top charger and 6 other things!  Love this thing!
4,I got this for my office and didn't even realize it has a nightlight on it! Great little hub for power cords and charging phones. It has a USB-C input for iPhone cords. I liked it so much I got another for the kitchen. Great value!
5,This is a must have household item!!!! My family uses this all at once (5person household) and it has not let us down yet! The night light has actually come in handy more then I thought!
5,Like the look of it. Love the motion light and can also be used as a nightlight.
5,The product was as described and works very well. It removed the need for the power strip and cable. It also allowed be to get rid of the bulky charging blocks
5,Handy.
4,We used this in our camper to add more charging stations and outlets. We have a bunkhouse and when you are cooking for a crowd it is nice to have extra outlets.Also grandchildren love the night light for the nighttime. Also always need to be able to charge phones ipods and tablets. Great product!
4,This is a great idea! I would have given it 5-stars but the design prohibits its use with GFCI-type outlets. I had been using the kitchen counter as my charging area but now I have to use an outlet in my office. I am planning on buying another one for down in my workshop. With the growing popularity of the USB-C type connection I imagine the company will come out with more than one port for this type.
