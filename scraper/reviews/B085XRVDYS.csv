5,Brought it in May 2022 the buckle broke on the first pair after 3 months use. I replaced it with the 2nd pair and the paint one the buckle started to fade away in early September  see picture.  May be I have better luck on the last pair.
4,Just tried them on for the first time they’re good for the price. As others mentioned and shown in photos above they don’t fit perfectly on the watch itself and the rubber seems a bit stiff so when you put it on there’s a bit of a gap. Not as smooth and streamlined as the fitbit brand bands but those are ridiculously expensive anyway. The colors are nice though. Full disclosure I intend to buy a different brand of tracker watch when my Fitbit inevitably dies so I was willing to buy these cheap just to last me until then. If you love your Fitbit I would just buy bands from their website.
4,Probably wouldn't expect to see a 4 star review with the picture of a broken worn out band but that's 10 months worth of wear and tear. The OEM band that came with the Fitbit only lasted 5 months.Since I still have two bands left it's a pretty good value for the price. Loses one star for a little discomfort where my wrist meets my hand which is a recent development and not sure if it's due to the paint peeling off the metal on the latch. Also not a fan of everything being so cheap and disposable these days but that's kind of on me for not looking around for a sturdier more expensive band.
4,great price and great fit. the silicone band is fine but theres a little paint coming off the buckle after a month of wear.
5,Very happy with the value of these and perfect fit for my Fitbit Charge 4 . Like that I can change to a different color to match my attire.
5,Best thing about these bands is that they dry fast great for swimming. Would recommend for active people. If it gets dirty it washes very easily leaves no smell.Eventually the will break over time so buy plenty as spare.  I go through about 1 band a year.
4,Color didn’t match the Fitbit but it is OK.
4,They fit my Fitbit and are pretty comfortable. I’ve had them for less than a year and rotated a couple of them but I have seen some fading around the edges and the paint on the adjustment loop is pretty much all gone.
5,Arrived in no time. Easy to replace. Allowed me the opportunity to continue using my Fitbit without having to purchase a new device.
5,Nice bands.  I only wish they offered  thee packs of the same color.
5,The bands are comfortable and fit well.  I like the colors because they go with anything.
4,Funny they're replacement bands for the fitbit.  Wish they wouldn't break down as fast as they do but they do work.  I need to check the site and see what other materials they offer as bands. Something more flexible may last longer but then again no idea.The silicone bands do work for me about a year then the metal clasp part breaks through the silicone.
4,They look legit like they're from fitbit. The issue is one side keeps popping off and I've almost lost my fitbit a couple of times.
4,Did receive 3 Silicone Bands for Fitbit 3 Charge. The bands did come in size I ordered and fit my wrist well. Last week I woke up one morning and Fitbit was falling off my wrist. Apparently there are small pieces of plastic inside either side of the hole of the band were the Fitbit and Band connect. If you lose just one piece of plastic on either side the hole becomes too big and has nothing to help it lock the Fitbit into the band.It appears there is a flaws in the design of the bands no matter if they come with your Fitbit Charge 3 or 4 or if you order replacements later. The flaws are where the Silicon band connects to another material like the metal/plastic buckle and the tiny plastic parts that help the band connect with the Fitbit. The Silicon needs to be thicker around the buckle so it doesn't break so easily with wear. The plastic pieces need to be screwed into the band or a better adhesive needs to be used to keep them in place.In summary I did get the 3 Silicon Bands as described and I did get the size and colors I ordered. Durability of the bands could greatly increase with just two design changes. This may have been a reason why Fitbit did change design and style of bands in later Fitbit Versions.
5,Does exactly what it needs to do and at a great price.
5,Needed a quick replacement when my band broke. These were a perfect replacement
4,My dislike is that it easily comes unattached from the device sometimes unexpectedly and falls off the wrist.
4,My Fitbit
5,I am extremely happy with this purchase.  The original band broke on my Fitbit and I needed to replace it.  These bands are much stronger than the band that originally came with my Fitbit and I can change up the bands for a different look.  Great purchase! Thank you!
5,I gave these to my mom for her birthday and she really loves the colors. The product looks just like in the pictures.
5,Previous band broke. Three pack is great till I get an Apple Watch. The colors are good and fit comfortably.
5,The materials used in the fitbit bands will likely break within 2 years and need replacing; I wear mine 24/7 to monitor my sleep and only take it off when charging or showering.  One thing to take note of is the different sizes; for a man's wrist you'll likely want the larger size even though the smaller one should work but be a tighter fit.  A good price point and with 3 pairs this purchase should last a long time.
5,Nice colors they fit well. Easy to replace bands.
5,I bought these after breaking the factory band.  These are comfortable and durable and I cannot tell the difference between these and the OEM ones.  Be sure to only get the large version if you have really big wrists as the small ones work better even for most men. The original OEM band is a small.
5,Used for a fitbit watch
4,Great but  a little larger than I thought
5,This 3 pack of bands was just what I needed and the colors were perfect.
5,It fit the watch and works fine
5,I absolutely LOVE the silicone leopard print watchband. It is adorable!Very fast shipping too!!
5,Replacement wristband arrived when expected and was easy to install on the FitBit without tools or knowledge.
5,Nothing
5,My original band broke.  Bought these and they are a perfect fit.  Easily interchangeable.
5,It was easy to replace.
4,The only thing to have made this a 5 star review would have been to have the bands offered in size MEDIUM.  I'll just cut them off.
5,My previous band kept catching on my clothes so this was so much better for me. I do know however that this band will stretch but that’s why you get 3 in the packet so it should last a long time before having to get a new one.
5,My original Fitbit band had cracked through. I ordered this 3-Set of bands. They arrived on time and in good order. They snapped snapped easily right into place on my Fitbit and work very well.
5,Came quickly and easy to instale
5,Wish these bands wouldn’t just disconnect after awhile
4,A little thinner than the original band. But for the money it's worth it.
5,Good value for the price
5,I old bands were easy to remove and the new bands were easy to put on. If you have a question about size - measure. I could have used the small size. The large works but the small would have been better.
4,Good quality fits as advertised!
4,My original Fitbit band started cracking and broke through completely within 6 months of purchasing my fitbit.  Replaced with this 3 pack for lower cost than one Fitbit band and have been more satisfied with this than the original band.  Most annoying is the gap where the band attaches to the clock face.  When my arm brushes against anything roughly it causes the band to come off so I have to reattach it frequently.  This became an issue only after several months of wearing it though.  Am still on my first of the three bands and the plastic is holding up well with no cracking so I can deal with the inconvenience of reattaching the band a few times a week when it gets pulled out.  Otherwise looks just like the name brand.  The paint has become worn off the clasp but that is the only other cosmetic complaint.
5,My mom broke her OG band when we were on vacation so we ordered these. The price was right. They were easy to replace so we were able to make sure she got her steps in!
5,A third of the price at Fitbit. Same quality and you get three bands. Wish I had investigated this sooner!
5,These are pretty much exactly the same as the factory watch bands.  They feel like they are made out of the same material and everything.
5,The blue and black colors were almost indistinguishable but gray was fine
5,Perfect match to Fitbit original great price.
4,These replace your existing band with ease.
4,Received these bands right away and they are fine.  They fit my fitbit charge 4 well.  The colors are as pictured.  They are not quite as sturdy as the original band from fit bit company but they seem as though they will work ok and are much less expensive.
5,Replace original band. The quality seems good and it looks as good as the original.
3,I would like to recommend that the seller double check the size being sent.  None of the bags it comes in states small or large. Therefore when it is picked up at Amazon it is what it is.  I was not going to drive to return to the returning station for the second time.  I am using it as it is after I reordered for SMALL.Other than that ease of use ease of putting it onto my Fitbit Charge 4 comfort is fine.  The fit could be better if I got the right size second time around (not large but small).  But it is what it is.  We are asked to make a choice and I still did not get it but needed a watch for my job ASAP as my Versa 2 was acting up during my temporary days in between.Happy Walking and Workouts!!
4,As expected colors were nice great for the price.
4,Originally ordered the small size. My wrist measures just over 7” which is the top end for the small sized bands. I didn’t want a lot of excess flopping around. But the small was too small! Barely enough band to fit under the loop. Returned. Ordered the large. Good to go. No problems with install. Seem to be as durable as the original bands. But I’ve only worn them for a couple weeks.
5,Very easy to use.
5,It was what I expected
5,Great for small wrists they fit a Fitbit charge 4 and love the colors!
5,Now I can be Fit again. :)
4,Nice had to return because they do not fit.
5,Very easy to use and a great over all product
5,Much cheaper than the Fitbit brand and just as functional with the same colors
5,My original band was too small and broke after two years. I searched for a replacement.  I found it on Amazon and thus far the band replacement fits perfectly. I am happy.
4,Comes in packaging where the wristbands are shipped flat. When you attach it to your Fitbit and put it on you stress the joints of that new band. The first wrist band frequently came off during sleep and once during an activity.  The second band I put in a small round jar to pre-bend It overnight but I can still see the joints are stressed. I would suggest to the seller that the bands are shipped rounded to make it easier to put on your wrist.  I think when you buy your Fitbit the bands that come with the charge 4 are bent as if they are wrapped around a wrist. These should be shipped to the same. I would suggest that if you buy these the first thing you do is put them in some thing round to prebend them to make it easier for attaching to your Fitbit and not popping off under pressure.On second thought the second one now has come off on its own while wearing a jacket and fell out of my sleeve. I would NOT buy these again.
5,These bands are great. Fit perfect and look like the original.
5,Feels same as originalGood quality
5,Can't think of anything negative about these inexpensive and comfortable.
5,Great buy at a very reasonable price. Highly recommend!
5,The length is long that's why. I like it just doesn't come out easily
5,Exactly what I want
4,Really easy to replace and cute.
5,Love that the pack was a three pack and the pric was great
5,Liked
4,These are nice. Im not sure if they're a perfect fit for the charge 4 I often have to push the bands into the watch but its never fallen off. Also just a heads up these are mens bands so they're bigger than womens and you have to tighten all the way otherwise they're fine.
4,Great color options perfect replacement for the original band.
5,Exactly as described. Just like the original band and very easy to attach
4,After about a month the band on one side would snap off when I take off the watch to charge.
4,These feel like the original band and so far have held up well.
5,It connects to my Charge 4 easily and allows for swapping bands for various activities
5,Works just like the original band that came with the Fitbit! I love it!
3,I ordered 3 Large bands but when I went to use the black one after the return period I discovered I had received a small black one which was the color I bought it for. The other two colors were large which was fine but I felt like I got duped into buying this product.
5,I love my fit bit bands! I love the design of them and they are so comfortable.
3,I wore the white band for all of 5 days. By the end of the 5th day I had stains that would not come off at all. So that was a waste. The black and gray are fine as of right now.
5,I like the colors and fact that 2 of them have sparkle to them.  I feel like I have a nice piece of jewelry on when I wear mine.
5,I like the comfortability doesn’t fell rubbery.
4,They all fit fine. Only thing is that I got the like burgundy color charge 4 n since I haven't found a band that color on here that matches it just bothers my OCD to have it on these. Other than that it's fine though
5,Me gusta se ajusta a mi y es muy comodo ademas te ensena lo que necesitas saber para tu salud.
5,Good value - now have 2 extra bands.  Be sure to thoroughly clean your fitbit device before installing new band.
5,These are easy to attach and comfortable. Great price.
5,it's for my FitBit; glad to get my step recordings back
5,Good value
3,I really liked one of the bands I received until it fell off because the clip on function failed. I put it back together several times but it kept falling off.
5,Love these bands. Super easy to use and very reasonable. Look just like the picture and like the original band.
5,I have only had the new band for a few days but I am very pleased. It was easy to change out and it has felt just like the original.
5,Fits. Just what I expected.
3,The sizing seems larger than the original bands.  It has me wondering if I was sent the wrong size but there is no size listed on the packaging.
4,these are quality but not made by fitbit.  so i guess thats why they do not stay snapped to the watchit keeps falling off my wrist  i have loosened it but then the watch wont work cause it cant make contact with my skin to get read outs on heart and blood pressurethey are also not as true to the original fitbit color maroon/purple that originally came with the watchmaybe after i wear it for awhile it will loosen up and stop falling off my wrist  but we will see
5,I wanted to replace my original band which was splitting.
4,My wrist size was border line between regular and large. I would go with the regular so it doesn't wrap around your wrist as much
5,Received the item quickly. They look and feel like the original. My wife and I both had broken bands within a week. My only complaint is that you need to get three different colors not just three of the same color.
4,Products came much earlier than expected!🤗
4,Price good.  Disconnects sometimes
5,What I deemed as a dilemma when my Fitbit band broke ended up being a quick fix…..Amazon Prime to the rescue!I ordered these replacement bands and it’s a breeze to switch them for a color change to match your outfits. So glad I didn’t have to take it to a jeweler or spend a lot to get this back in use. Lastly love all of the color options great buy that didn’t disappoint.
5,just like the original. So easy to remove my wife did it
5,It fits on well yet it can break apart pretty easy.
5,Great for the value
5,I’ve used the replacement band for about three weeks now and have had no issues with the band coming loose from my Fitbit. There IS a little gap between the ban and my Fitbit that other people have also noted on theirs but even after tugging on it and working out with it it seems perfectly secure.It is slightly tighter/smaller than the Fitbit’s band but overall this isn’t an issue for me as I have very small wrists.Be sure to wash the bands before using as it will likely cause a rash. I tried it on before washing to check the fit in case I felt I needed to return it and ended up with a mild rash on my wrist three days later. The rash was gone by the next day and has not been an issue since.
5,All three colors work for me and they are comfortable and easy to switch out.
4,Exactly what I needed and fits fine. But the colors aren't the same as the picture show. They're duller so don't expect the bright color as advertised
4,Appears to be exactly what I wanted and quality thus far has been very good. Best element was the great price.
5,Used with charge 4.  As advertised.  Satisfied.
5,These wrist bands are reasonably priced support my Fitbit well and come in good colors.  You can change the bands easily when you want a different color. They seem to last well and they do the job.
5,Wanted sleep app and works great! Also for steps and vitals!
4,Got this for my wife and she loved the three different colors. She says it’s comfortable. Shipping was fast. The only concern is when she was sleeping it came apart. She tracks her sleep. She is worried that it may come off at work when she is not aware but we shall see.
5,The wrist bands arrived ahead of schedule and in pristine condition. They are comfortable and they look good. I am happy with the high value and moderate price.
5,The bands arrived quickly and fit perfectly on my FitBit.  Great seller!!
4,Should last longer than the original.  Feels more rigid
3,The glitter bands are really cute. Within about 6 weeks two of the bands have broken and the third is on its way to doing the same. On the inner edge of the band (the side w/ the buckle) where it connects to the watch face there are two tiny clear rubber pieces that the "teeth" of the face lock onto. However on each of my bands one of those pieces has worn away. When that occurs the watch falls off and it's time for a replacement because it will no longer "lock". Fortunately each time I felt the watch falling off my wrist.But for this awesome price of three bands in a pack there's not much to complain about.
5,After about a year of use the band on all of my Fitbit's (Charge 2 3 and now 4) have split where the 'latch' goes through the hole. It's not a problem just takes a few seconds to remove the band and replace it. But what to replace it with? Buy one from Fitbit for $30 or get an 'after market' band? (in this case a three pack for about ten bucks!)I think these are indistinguishable from the original band. The Fitbit itself never lasts more than two years so I doubt if I'll need the other two bands that came in the set.I'd almost be willing to wager that these are made in the same factory using the exact same production line as the parts they supply to Fitbit.
5,These are great!  Looks just like the one from Fitbit.  No issues from water or sweat and really like being able to change colors.  Getting the old one off was a struggle but these are easier to remove and replace.
4,The colors and price are great but not sure how long they’ll last.  They’re very stiff.
4,Like the fit and comforting. Need more time in determining durability.
5,Straps fit perfectly
5,These are exactly what my husband needed after breaking two old bands
4,As advertised quick delivery no nonsense packaging.
4,It's nice that you are provided dark blue and black bands. The bands are not as soft as the original Fitbit bands so they don't bend around your wrist as easily. The original Fitbit band (2 years old) broke without warning. I could have lost it and not been aware.But these are great for the price.
4,Thought I ordered small size but mistakenly ordered large. Had to cut them down a little but they were as described and work fine. Would but again.
4,I bought these straps for my fitbit charge 3. I couldn’t find a store or a website that sells the original fitbit strap anymore so i wanted to give these a try. They came in a good condition. They did attach to my fitbit just fine but not as steardy as the original strap. I have been usuing them for over 2 months now and they held on just fine.
3,It fits on just fine and the material is similar to the original band but the paint on the clasp is already wearing off after 8 days of typical use.  I haven't had that happen before with any name or off brand bands.
5,Purchased for my boyfriend. The original band that came with his Fitbit finally broke apart. He wears it all the time and has had for over 2 years. Ordered this product that came with 3 bands with nice selection of colors. Now he has 3 to choose from. Hopeful it will last just as long as the original. Great value!
5,Good replacement bands for the tracker
5,Comfortable and easy to wear
4,Previous band I had didn't seem as well manufactured as these. The only drawback is that I would rather had all one color in the 3 pack. I can deal with other colors if the band color I'm wearing ever wears out.
5,Shipped quickly and as expected.  Thank you.
5,For my wife her band broke had her back up in no time. Different colors means she can customize to her liking
4,Happy so far. Like the variety of colors.
5,good bands delivered on time.
3,Original band failed after one month of normal wear.  These replacements look identical to the original but need some time with them to determine longevity.
5,The original band broke fo I ordered these. Arrived quickly and fit perfectly
5,Love having different colors to match what I’m wearing. Easy to change and just as durable as the Fitbit bands
5,I just had a band break two days ago and ordered this product that night. It came quickly and was a great price for three bands. They have a variety of colors as well. The quality is great and they are extremely compatible with my Fitbit Charge 4. Super happy so far!
5,It seems to work fine.
3,Cheap bands that fit alright but were a little loose in the connector area.The metal finish also wore off within a week or so. It should NEVER wear off or it should not be there in the first place.Other than that served its purpose until fitbit bricked itself due to a well-known software issue.Buyer beware.
5,It looks good it was very easy to change and the price was right.
5,Perfect fit  easy to replace .
5,The Fitbit wrist bands arrived very promptly.  The bands are easily changed the colors are neutral.
3,These are pretty bands but they detach very easily. Anytime I reach into a tight space or accidentally brush the band against a surface one side detaches.
3,My Fitbit band after 6 months broke in the middle. I think the design had a flaw. I ordered these replacement bands in small because the large band had a lot of excess band after putting on the device.  I used the smaller one for approximately 3 months and the attachment to device broke.  I have had to get a different fitbit since mine was out of warranty.
5,Very similar to original bands and nice to be able to change up the look at a cheap price point
5,Black band looks and feels like the one that came on my the Fitbit Charge 4. Expect same durability.  Nice to have choice of colors and backup in-case this band also splits.
5,great band
5,Watch band
4,Very much like the actual band they are replacing. They do run small.
5,I had to  replace the band on my Fitbit Charge 4. I was happy to find this replacement pack on Amazon. I like the colors offered in the pack.
4,My sister loves them.
4,The band fits well.
4,I wanted to try these bands out for at least a month before writing a review to see how durable they are (I'm pretty active workout 4-5x and bike 2-3x a week) and how the rubber material feels on my wrist and I'm happy to say that so far they've held up just fine. To put things in perspective the original band started to tear after about 9 months.Design: the maker of these generic bands did a good job emulating the original mesh pattern and at a glance there aren't many obvious differences. But if you put them side by side you'll quickly notice that the OG plastic clasp has a matte gun metal gray finish which looks more premium than the generic clasp which has a glossy plastic finish. The band ring on the generic band is noticeably more rectangular and taller than that of the OG which has a sleeker profile that contours more closely around the band.Fit and function: the generic bands are slightly shorter in length but has a few more holes which could offer a little more fit flexibility although it hasn't made a difference for me. When attached to the Fitbit the generic bands aren't as air-tight as the OG and have a little bit of a wiggle and I have noticed a greater accumulation of dirt trapped inside the joints.Overall these bands are a solid alternative and a good bargain if the minor details don't bother you.
4,Great price. I hope they last
4,These worked pretty well a couple perfectly but there was one band that kept popping off and not holding. Another worked just fine.
5,They fit well. Come in great colors. Priced right.
3,I was happy with the price.  Fits my wrist but is difficult to put on and remove.  Stiff.Looks ok tho!
4,I purchased the product because Fitbit would not send me a replacement for my broken band. Seems to leave a small gap between the band and the actual device. I like how I was able to get 3 colors for the price point.
5,I got this replacement band for my charge 4. It fits me perfectly (small band) and looks just like my original band that came with my charge 4.
5,Love the colors and love the fit.
4,Colors are great.  Fits my Fitbit.  Have had a couple of times it released the strap on one side.  Not sure if it is my Fitbit or the strap.  Otherwise I am very happy.
5,These bands fit my fitbit properly and also are large enough to fit my wrist.  The 3 pack should last me for a long time.
5,These are a real bargain!  They seem almost identical to the original band on my FitBit.  They are very comfortable.  The price was right and the delivery was super fast.  I would recommend these.
4,I purchased the 3-pk (Blk Nvy & Gry) on June 10 2021. They feel the same as the original band strip Fitbit provided with my Charge 4. At first the sizing felt off but at the time I realized it was weeks from the time my original band broke to receiving these. The comfort is the same as the Fitbit band. If you get hot and/or sweat the bands will hold a little moisture.I mostly wear the black band and noticed the clasp have started chipping. This does not bother me but it’s worth mentioning. I don’t recall my original Fitbit band doing that. The band stays connected and doesn’t detach from the tracker.I use my Fitbit for standard fitness tracking walking and at-home workouts. The band will slip slightly from the sweat which it did the same with the original Fitbit band. Otherwise there’s no issues.
5,Just as advertised. Easy to replace.
5,Esta banda de silicona calzó perfecta en lo Fitbit 3! Era lo que necesitaba y esperaba recibir. Muy económica y de muy buena calidad.
5,Good replacement band
5,I wad hoping these would exactly work for my Charge 4 and it did. Economical  for the priceeasy to attach after I look at a tutorial on YouTube! Lol.  Garmin suggest you sleep in to monitor your sleep habitsbut to me sleeping in these watches helps yo break bands
3,The tab on the buckle bent when I snagged the band on something.  That never happened on the original band.  Also the connection from the band to the Fitbit is much looser than the original.
5,Same as the band that came with my fitbit only diff that I can see is the Fitbit logo is missing. Obviously not an official Fitbit band.
5,I like the different color options so I don't always have to just use the black.  They were shipped right away and in my hands in a couple of days.
5,I've bought these before. They are more durable than the original FitBit band.
3,My dislike: The replacement bands are very loose fitting and practically falls off my wrist with any rigorous movements
3,I liked that the items was reasonably priced and it fits similar to the original band but the color is rubbing off of the clasp and the band is starting to fade after a couple of months.
5,I ordered the silver gold and rose gold set. They look just like the picture. They seem well made. They are a little larger than I thought but they work for me. I can fasten them on the last hole and they are just a little loose.
5,I liked the color options and the price was good.
4,The fitbit bands were okay for the low price compared to official fitbit bands cost. One of the small bands that hold the band did come off right away. I tried gluing but did not work. I just used one from one of the other bands. They were colors I wanted. I had ordered large set first which are bit big. Small fits me fine.
5,Very satisfied with the delivery the service and the product.
3,There is a gap between the watch band and the main fitbit clock face. I was afraid it would fall apart mid wear... they do stay attached but are not snug against the main fitbit clock piece.. 2 mm gap... gets dusty and dirty in there quicker.
4,Just a bit tight compared to my original Fitbit 4 band.
5,It is exactly what I ordered and was delivered quickly
3,One use and already broken
5,Seems durable so far. Good for for charge 3 fitbits. Fits well on me I’m a 6 ft 180 lb man
5,Easy to assemble. I
5,I love them!!!! You receive 3 bands for very affordable price wanted to switch out the bands for summer these have a bit of a sparkle to them can match summer outwits better than black!Easy to switch out perfect!
5,Need extra watch bands for my Fitbit. These exceeded my expectations! Well definitely order again and would definitely recommend.
3,One band broke within the first few hours of use . Buckle came off and unable to fix. Other 2 bands are working well and are comfy.
5,Liked that it looked just like the original wristband that broke. Looks and feels nice
5,Good quality. Great price. Just what I wanted.
3,I’ll keep it short and sweet. They fit the device… but not well. The tolerances in these aren’t tight enough so there’s a visible gap between the screen and the band unlike the OEM bands. This slop in the fit results na a band that will pop loose unexpectedly under normal everyday use. I have t lost the device yet but with these bands it’s a genuine concern.Also the bands are harder and stiffer and have molding edges that make them subtly less comfortable than the OEM band. They may last longer because of this if they don’t cause the device to get lost but the buckle also shows wear scratches more than the OEM band.So while the price of these  is great on the face of it it they’re obviously a lower-quality product and could be significantly more expensive when one ends up having to buy a new device because the old one was lost due to shoddy tolerance.
4,These seem well made but they seem just a hair off somehow.
5,Like having 3 bands to change.
5,Small is a tad smaller than we expected.  Wished that we had ordered the Large band but the quality is nice.
5,Great price perfect fit and shipped early!
5,I bought this 3 pack of replacement bands over a year ago. The original band that came with the Fitbit was broken & not holding up well after 3 months. I wear it on my ankle because I cannot wear jewelry of any kind at work. I am still wearing the first of the 3 bands that bought here. No wear marks. Hasn’t broken. Still perfect condition!  Looks like new!  By far the best purchase I’ve made on Amazon!  😊
5,I’m very glad I ordered this replacement band for my Fitbit. It’s very comfortable sturdy and durable.
4,You can't argue with the price and they appear almost identical to the OEM bands. However they are a bit stiffer and don't feel quite as nice. That said I'm using them without any issues thus far.
4,The pink watch band will not stay on. I was disappointed they were not fit bit brand. My charge 2 had non fit bit bands that popped off. I tried to buy the brand this time.
5,These are great replacement wristbands for Charge 4 Fitbit. Nice colors and easily replace original wristband.
5,Item is easy to transfer to existing watch.Looks very durable.Would recommend this item.
5,These bands are a perfect fit for my FitBit.  I can't believe how durable and inexpensive they are.  And there are so many colors it's hard to choose.
5,Fully met my expectations.
4,Great product the only issue I had is the connection it fell off once.
4,Theses look and feel like the regulate Fitbit bands.  However after a month or so if wearing them one side likes to pop off the Fitbit.  Annoying but for the price of 3 compared to one from Fitbit I’ll deal with with it.
3,The replacement bands left me underwhelmed.Not really constructe3d to last long.
5,The watchbands were exactly what I needed. Fast service.
4,But the sm/med size is a bit short. Not too short - just shorter than my original band. Otherwise sturdy and nice having 3 at such a low price
5,Great price and good quality
4,Band as good as original but dont understand why 3?Fitbit design to change bands is too difficult to frequently change bands. Update. After only a few months paint comes off buckle which probably could be expected but metal underneath is GREEN color on a black band.
5,Replacement bands as advertised
5,Original strap broke while I was lifting weights found these and they fit like a glove.  No problems so far.
4,RIP Meatloaf.The bands are a little teensy bit stiffer than the fitbit brand. And out of the three bands the navy blue strap did not fit well to the fitbit. It could come off with slight pressure. The other 2 bands were fine. I only needed one band so I guess it works out. Sizing was perfect. Price was right.
5,Easy to swap out has stayed on with no issues. Easy to clean.
5,This is my 2nd pack of these. I'm a swimmer and in the water 3 times a week. Fits my fitbit charge 4 well
5,Easily replaced my Charge 4 broken band no problems
5,perfect fit
5,Great product Great value
3,Quick delivery but not the greatest quality. One band(blue) kept coming off af5er 3 weeks.
3,The band is not strong or durable. I’ve almost lost my Fitbit a few times from working out or when pressure is put on it and it wears easily.
5,Original band on fitbit broke (age and use).  Ordered replacement.  Perfect fit and 3 colors to swap out.
5,The bands are exactly as described
5,The package of wrist bands for my Charge4 arrived in less than 48 hours.  They appear the same as the original band that came with my watch.  I hope to get at least two years of service as that is what i had with the original.  Good job
5,Fits great
4,Fits great. A little thicker than original. With this set of three I likely won’t need to buy more for this watch.  I think I got my money’s worth with these
5,Like the colors and the comfort.
5,Replacement band fit perfectly. I had to watch YouTube video to change bands because there were no directions.
5,Great replacement bands for Fitbit. Original snapped after 2 years of pretty hard use I wear Fitbit daily and to gym regularly. So far these are just as good as the band that came with the Fitbit. A bit stiff out of the package but losses up after a few days. Have been wearing about 2 weeks now and am pleased with the bands. Highly recommend as replacement bands.
5,I purchased the cloth band I have had it a week and I am loving it.  I am hoping that it will hold up without strings breaking.  It is comfortable and soft and I am not sweating underneath it. As of now I would give it a 10.
4,The bands are nice but a bit bigger than I expected for my wrist. I was able to use the strap from my original piece in order for it to fit more securely. All in all I like them and the different colors.
5,We only just received these but they fit well were easy to put on and the price was right.
5,Fit and finish as expected. Very reasonable price
4,I have a Fitbit Charger 3 and this replacement wrist band fit the device very well.  Slightly different color though.
5,Bands are comfortable and easily installed. The paint on the band's metal loop quickly rubbed off.
4,Three colors of bands nice for variety.  Fair quality less durable than the original band.  Not expensive and was delivered quickly.
4,I like that extra bands are available and come in nice colors.  It fits my wrist really well.  My issue is with how the band fits on the Fitbit itself.  There's a small  gap.  Although it's never come undone you can see that it doesn't fit absolutely snugly on the appliance.  But so far so good.
5,I needed a new band for my fitbit. I looked at ordering a new band through fitbit but it was a ridiculous price considering their provided band only lasted a year before tearing. These will eventually tear too but I got 3 of them for half the price of 1. Definitely the same quality and will last me for a long while.
4,Needed to replace original cracked wristband.  Replacements were easy to install and of exactly the colors I could use.  The only problem was that the size is Large which fits at the smallest setting leaving a long leftover under the bail.
5,Solid and affordable replacement for the fit bit band I broke
5,Came fast. Works as advertised.
5,I love that I could purchase a package Iof three bands for my 2 yr. old Fitbit. I could have purchased a size smaller though the large instead of extra large.
4,Flexible
5,This was a great purchase for the money unfortunately I had to return it for the bigger size. I would recommend to make sure wrist size is correct.
3,Stiffer than OEM Fitbit bands. Large is a bit smaller too.
5,The colors are vibrant and the fit is comfortable
5,They are a bit stiff but I am sure that it's because they are knew and that makes them a bit uncomfortable to the wrist I hope that goes away as it gets used to it. Quality seems good but not like the originals even tho that wasn't expected. I love them so far the colours are pretty good as well. I am happy with them.
3,Paint comes of of the buckle quickly. Fits like the original.
5,It wears and tears fast with me...a set of 3- pack was affordable and quick delivery.  Likedctge color options too.
5,Easy to change out.  Item came as described.
5,Bands seam pretty good. Good price and shipped fast
5,The bands were so easy to attach to my Fitbit and the bands are the right size for me.  I have anaverage size wrist.
5,My band broke and I needed another to wear the device. These fit perfectly!
5,It was to replace our original FitBit 4 watch bands that broke about 1-1/2 years of everyday hard use!
5,These are the bands for your Fitbit you have been looking for fit better and seems to be working better with these replacement bands
5,Works as well as the bands that came with my FitBit.
3,No instructions were given for how to measure for this watch band.  It is actually too large for my wrist.  I have it in the very last hole and it still slides on my wrist. Unless you have a large wrist order the smaller size and unless you expect your watch to last forever just order a single band.
2,DISCLAIMER: THESE ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE AS ORIGINAL FITBIT BANDS. I don’t think these are actually the fit bit brand at all just a cheaper knock off (it’s fine because they still work) BUT they are *significantly* larger than the bands that originally came with your Fitbit. None of them fit on my wrist even at the smallest belt setting because I have pretty small wrists so that was annoying because I can’t use any of these and I bought them because my original band broke.Other than that they are fine. Not the best quality but they get the job done :/
5,My original one broke and I was out of town so I ordered these.  Love the colors
5,These bands are just as good a quality if not better than the original band that comes with your Fitbit. I love how easy Fitbit made it to remove bands and attach new ones. This is my second package of colored bands so that I can change my bands with my outfits or just my mood.I like to take my bands off whenever I charge my Fitbit and give them a thorough cleaning as well as the Fitbit too. I think this will prolong the life of all of my items. I keep my unused bands in the original package laying flat so they stay pristine when not in use.I’m so thankful for the opportunity to buy these at a much lower price than what Fitbit sells colored bands for. I just hated the black band Fitbit came with! Not very feminine.I highly recommend buying these if you don’t like your original black band. I waited to post my review until I had worn two of these bands 24/7 for weeks at a time and both look good as the day they arrived. I am not affiliated with this company nor did I receive anything for free. I am just someone who took advantage of a lightening deal and am happy I did!
5,Great replacement for the original Fitbit band. Easy to replace and the colors are great.
3,Its a bit stiff and not very flexible.
4,Delighted to receive this sooner than expected. They easily attached to my Charge 4 Fitbit base. They are a lot longer than my original bands and therefore I have them on the 2nd slot. So if you have a thin wrist these bands will be too big for you.
5,Just what I ordered. Would buy again.
5,My husband is rough on these band wheres it everyday this 3 pack was great choice.
5,This 3-pack of Fit-Bit replacement bands are exactly what I was looking for. My original band lasted close to three years but it finally broke at the adjustment hole I used most often. I purchased a replacement band at a big-box store that did not connect to the base at all. I returned it and found this 3-pack. for the same price as the big-box 1-pack. I love that I can choose to coordinate these three great colors with different outfits.
4,These bands are very good...I do wish that the black one was as sparkly as the other two!  But the other two colors are terrific!
5,Update 07/07/2020: I noticed the clasp on the black straps have started chipping. Doesn’t affect the functionality but just worth noting. My original Fitbit bands didn’t do that. Also the top band is starting to pull away from the tracker. I just push it back together when I think of it so it’s not a big deal to me. I have posted two pictures showing both.Original Review: The package was nice and easy to open. These small size bands are the size of the original Fitbit small bands. They have the same markings and you can see in the third picture that the slate gray color is the exact match of the original slate blue color that came with the rose gold special edition Fitbit charge 3. I have the black one on my Fitbit in the last picture. It’s a perfect fit fits flush and feels secure on there. It looks great with the rose gold Fitbit.Both of my original bands (small and large) broke when my husband tried it on and then the other broke when he used it while on a bicycle ride. The small band I had on my Fitbit for 13 months before it broke and the large band was on for 2 months before it broke. Hopefully these hold up better. I’ll update the quality and durability of these.
5,They are as the description stated. Also very nice
4,As advertised
3,I got this yesterday added the new band went about my business and then spent last night searching the yard for my fitbit. The band did not stay connected for one single day! luckily I was able to find my fitbit by retracing my footsteps and trying to sync. Looking closely you can see a larger gap where they connect my original one did not have that issue.I tried one of the other bands it seems to hold together better. That is the reason I revised this review and added two stars. Maybe I should just add one until I try the third band.
5,Richard Diamond CIA wears a Tag Huer watch with the sensors built in. See what happens when his watch and phone are damaged by  a GRU unit.
5,Exactly the same material and look as the original band. It take one secoond to replace the band so you can fit different band colors to the cloth you wear
4,I’ve worn the band for about 3 weeks and have had no trouble.
3,I wear my Fitbit 24x7 except when charging.  The band is comfortable although not as supple as the original.  And after 2 months of wear it's still attached to my Charge 4 unlike some others I've tried.  There is a visible small gap between the band and the Fitbit so I was unsure about it at first but so far so good.  Finally if necessary there are 3 bands in the package so I still have 2 spares.
5,this is great
3,These bands do not lock in properly.  Only one of the three was somewhat ok.  It locked in but would partially come out.  I will not purchase again as I’m afraid I will lose my Fitbit.
5,Worked as promoted. Did  the trick. Easy to install
5,These bands are perfect for my Fitbit! I love the colors and the option of being able choose which one will go best with my outfit or jewelry. Would definitely repurchase!
5,These are great fit good look nice
2,Initially I was pleased with my purchase. The bands were comfortable and seemed to fit my charge 4. Recently half of the band started detaching at I opportune times. I decided to switch to the second and third bands in the package- one part of the band won’t even stay on. So I had to go back to the previous band and will have to purchase a replacement band elsewhere.
5,Fits as expected
5,A great value if you need a replacement when your original Fitbit bands wear out. They are just as good as the originals.
5,Love the purchase and it was a perfect fit
4,Basically expect each band to last 5 months and then it will break compared to fitbit oem where it may last you a year or more. So up to you how you want to justify the cost of aftermarket vs oem. $8 (3 bands aftermarket) vs. $15 (1 fibit oem).
5,Both the small and large watchbands that came with my Fitbit Charge 3 broke over time -- it seems silicone isn't endlessly durable and I wear my Fitbit always. The first of this pack of 3 that I've bought seems to match the original closely. It attached to the watch easily fits well and is comfortable.
5,Great colors. Good quality
5,You can spend $30 for an official Fitbit band or you can buy three for like $7. I mean what are you going to do bro? Buy this thing.
2,I ordered this pack of 3 about five months ago to replace the original silicone band on my Fitbit Charge 4 which broke after a lot of wear and tear. They don't feel quite as comfortable as the original but they did the job. Unfortunately I discovered not long after I started wearing them that they do not hold up to much resistance whatsoever. With the slightest tug or pull the band will pop off of the Fitbit device. I've tried all three to see if it was just one defective band but all three do the same thing. It's gotten to the point where even bending my wrist too sharply causes the band to detach. If I were a less alert person I would have lost my Fitbit months ago because of this. I recommend putting out the extra money to buy replacements from Fitbit directly instead of taking this risk.
5,As for now the bands work as good as the original and the fact that they come in three flat/mat colors give you some options.  I chose the black/blue/grey and so far the grey is my favorite one.  The installation was easy with the push of a button.  The package arrived on the day that it said it would.  I am hoping that I won't have to change the review.  I am waiting on to see about the durability.  I am severely rough on watches and the first band only lasted 1.5 years.  But with me having three the fit bit itself will most likely wear out first.One other worry that I have is the buckle of this one. The original buckle was made of metal these appear to be plastic. That bothers me a tad but if it holds up then I won't complain.  I'm sure that the change in material allows the items to be sold so cheap.
4,They look good and are comfortable but break after 6-8 months of regular use
3,The connection is loose and leaves a big gap but it’s functional and has not disconnected in the two weeks of daily use since I bought it.
3,Average.
5,These look and feel like the one that came on my Fitbit Charge 3.
5,Replied my first Fitbit band. Received it overnight!
5,Good product! Looks great on my arm.
5,I had my Fitbit 4 band tear off. The bands fit perfectly and were the correct size.
2,Not sure if it is a failure on the Fitbit side or a poor fit on the band side but these stopped latching on to the watch after a few months.  Tried switching to another set of bands but with the same result. I will try to order another brand of band to see if they will work better.  I've almost lost the Fitbit a few times due to this failure.
5,These three different colored replacement bands are perfectly machined to fit my charge three and are easily swappable.I am so very happy with this purchase!Additional note after several months: great purchase. Quality of the material is definitely superior to that provided by fitbit. Durable flexible yet comfortable. I have enjoyed switching out the bands and have been surprised to find that folks notice! I recommend depressing the spring on the fitbit each time if you swap in a new band color  rather than just “clicking it in” since it is plastic-on-plastic and will likely blunt and erode over time. Seems like a smart move if you start to swap a lot!Additional note after five months: I have been wearing the gray one about 80% of the time and there is no cracking delamination or color fading of the plastic with particular attention to the site where the buckle goes since that area gets sharply flexed and pulled every time I take it on and off. One thing I am noticing is that the painted metal buckle ring now has areas where the paint has scraped off exposing the metal underneath which is a gunmetal gray color not very visible particularly since the buckle is usually on the volar side of the wrist.
5,
5,I like the three colors so now I can change anytime!
5,Liked the colors.
5,I like the comfort on my wrist
2,Colors are fine and build quality seems ok but these things pop off the Fitbit with the lightest bump (never had that issue with the band that came with it). Forget any kind of vigorous activity even changing your shirt risks the band popping off the body. If you're just wearing this as a watch and step counter you might be fine but if you're trying to do any exercise where you're moving your arms or might bump it against something (ie. sports) this thing is apt to fall right off.
5,
5,Love colors for these bands
5,My original band broke (first time ever for a fitbit band to break in the 8 years of fitbits for me) and these came quickly and were as described. Would recommend this seller.
5,This replacement product was exactly as the original watch band. Only drawback was that it is only available in 3 pack when I just needed the one black band.
5,Comfortable
5,Easy ordering process fast arrival and the band's are great! They fit perfectly on my Fitbit Charge 3. I am pleased all around!
3,I of the 3 bands did not lock onto the Fitbit tight enough. Fitbit kept falling off with slightest tug to the band.
5,They are very comfortable and seem to hold up well .  through my daily activity.  Nice to know I have spares!
5,Product very durable and as described. Price fantastic. Fast delivery.
3,bands are not durable long tern (they were very inexpensive) ...you get what you pay for in this case.  after about 4-6 months 1 band detaches from fitbit & doesnt lock properly (you get 3) so ive had to change bands all 3 times over the course of a year ...so i just ordered the original fitbit branded band recently
2,I thought this deal was too good to be true and it is. The bands look exactly like the ones that came with my Fitbit charge 4 but the original bands lasted for well over a year before cracking and breaking where the hole was that I used to secure them. These lasted about a week. Then they start popping off on one side or the other of the watch face itself. It must have fallen off at least 6 times today just from being lightly bumped. I got so frustrated I finally just took it off and tossed it in a corner. So disappointing. I love my Fitbit so I guess I’ll try to find some that are better quality
5,These bands were exactly what I was hoping for:  the colors were as pictured (gray black and dark blue) and snapped in place easily.  The quality is good and I expect them to last a long time.
2,Very rarely am I so harsh on a product review but  there's no other way to describe these. This were trash!  Out of the four bands one worked well enough to install on my mother's Fitbit and I'm not sure what she wont lose her Fitbit by using it. I'll have to get an official band from Fitbit cuz this one just isn't up to par.
4,Little large
5,Good replacement for the stock
5,My stock Fitbit band broke. I picked up these. Simple to put on. Solid. Maintains the same wearing experience as the stock bands. I chose the Fitbit because it’s small and nimble on the wrist. It’s not clunky. These bands support that 100 percent.
5,Great product as new!
5,Fitbit was very stiff and broke within the year.  These bands are very flexible and easy to fasten.I love the product so far.  Since they are new I cannot review as to durability.
5,Very comfy and love hem
5,Get me out of this survey
5,Great product
5,Easy to use and looks good!!
5,Exactly what I expected.  Colors true to picture.  Comfortable and easy to switch in and out.  Easy to clean.  I work out everyday and I’m a chef so my bands get a lot of ware but they have stood up very well.  The paint has worn of the plastic part that fastens the band the clasp? some but I’m not bothered by it too much.
4,This bad was not as durable as the original Fitbit brand band the paint on the metal parts fell of pretty quickly.
4,I have only had the bands for a short period.  They were delivered timely were as they appeared on the website and the one I am currently using thus far is comfortable and seems to be quite similar in appearance and comfort to the original Fitbit provided band.  The one negative was that it did not install as easily as the original.  I was able to get it connected to the devise but it took a little work.  This is the reason I did not provide a 5 star rating here.I did not rate durability here because I have simply not had the item long enough.  I can say the original wore out much sooner than I would expect (less than a year) of normal use.  I am hopeful these will last longer.Overall I would purchase this item again.
1,I guess you get what you pay for.I accidentally bought the large size in these bandsa few months back and did my adjustments to make it fit without it being way to long. I had to put it on the last hole possible and it was still to big but I lived with it for awhile . It fell off at the connection and I figured it was because it was moving a lot so I reordered them in the small size and it fits fine but just now I looked down I heard a thud and the watch was on the floor. If it fell on a carpet I wouldn’t of heard it and could’ve been anywheresThis mind you is the second set of these I bought and they both detach from the watch. Very upsetting to say the leastUPDATE:I’m not sure what to do about this problem but it’s very disturbing.I went out today with the intention of getting a 2 mile walk in. Haven’t been able to do to much outside of anything cuz of pollen.I set my watch and off I go. I felt the 1st mile buzz on my wrist. I continued walking and no other buzzes. I looked down and the watch was gone. Not the first it’s fallen off.I retraced my steps and found it a quarter mile back. I was so upset this  happened but also upset my entire walk wasn’t recorded.The band will snap on in place fine but it doesnt stay tight. Knowing this I have to push on both sides to tighten back up.I don’t recommend them at all
5,I bought it and it came quickly.Works perfectly. This is the second set I purchased. Shared my first set with others.
5,They arrived in about 3 days earlier than expected.  They are comfortable and are working just fine.
5,The old band was tearing and I had it scotch taped together.  The new bands arrived just in time.  New one looks exactly like original.Very pleased they arrived so quick.
5,I have three different colors that I can switch off and wear with different outfits.
4,The original band lasted about 2 1/2 years.  The buckle tore away from the strap.  We'll see if these three silicone rubber bands will last a total of 7 1/2 years (probably the watch or I won't).  The band does seem "grippier" on the wrist than the original one -- might irritate some sensitive skins.
3,One of the band prices already broke only about 1-2 months after I put it on. Not great quality I guess
4,Just received these bands but I’m happy with them. Colors match the picture and the bands appear to be a good quality. Bought these to replace the OEM band that tore after getting caught on a fence. They are comparable in look feel and quality.
5,Swift delivery and new band was excellent fit xx easy to swap from original Fitbit band.
4,As advertised---Quick delivery
5,This was a replacement band for the original band.
5,Just what I needed!
5,It appears to be exactly like the original band. I did opt for the large size which works perfectly.
5,Comfortable unsure about durability since I received recently.  It appears to be durable.  The price was good and they're everything I expected.
3,The bands are easy to attach to the Fitbit and look like they will last a long time. Nice colors.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've been wearing the fitbit for a couple of months now and the original band broke so I invested in these 3 bands and so far I've only used one. It's been durable during my showers jogging and everyday use.
5,Little big but product was good will have to make some adjustments
5,Fits good.  A little tight at first but you get used to it.  Also a stiffer material was used bit flexes more over time.  Great replacement for factory band!
5,Bands fit well and look good. Like that there are 3 colors to choose from
5,This is a product worth buying to replace Fitbit straps.
5,Received product as described. The band is slightly shorter than the original Fitbit band but otherwise appears the same. No issues works fine.
4,This replacement band feels comfortable and looks durable. I just wish it would clip on without having any gaps to the device like the original fitbit bands.
3,Had this product for a couple weeks and it doesn’t hold up. I was excited to get them and see how similar they were to the oem bands. All the colors looked great and All seemed to be fine initially until I needed to charge my fit bit.Upon taking the wrist strap off as I’ve done countless times with the original the clasp that locks into the holes on the other side of the band popped off. It didn’t break at all It just seems to be poor design.  The spring loaded  pins that hold the metal clasp in place do not lock in very well and seem to be very weak.Shipping was great and product looks great but does not function at all. I was able to put it back together and it stays on fine during normal wear although it popped off again when I tried to tighten the band. Would not buy again.
5,Product works great not cheaply made. Fits correct band size. I'm a 7 so I got a small and it fits great.
5,Fits my FItbit perfectly!!
4,The product is near perfect to the original bands. The issue I have is that the bands don't connect very tightly onto the watch like the originals do. It leaves a small gap on both ends of the watch however I have continued to shower with my watch as I always have and no damage done. The watch still works perfectly and the bands look great! The gaps bother me a bit so that's the only reason for one less star. Overall great product!
4,Fits comfortably
5,Loved the product old band broke and the new band is a perfect replacement
5,Purchased for the Fitbit Charge 3 did the job.  Easy to put on holding up well.
5,Love these bands!!  The colors are perfect and they are very comfortable!!!
5,I bought this to replace the original band on my Fitbit Charge 4 which had started to tear where the holes are. I am impressed with how well this matches the original band and the quality is VERY comparable to the original's feel and finish type. Very good for the price
4,Easily replace broken band. Much cheaper than buying another Charge 3
2,2 of the 3 bands do not connect to the Fitbit device. The third one was extremely tight to get it attached but at least I could get one to work.  I would NOT recommend this at all for a Fitbit Charge 3.
4,Ordered the wrong size MY fault.  The product other than that was what I expected.
4,Feel great & bigger than the original
2,It's nice to be able to replace the bands but I don't like that every month or two I have to replace the band because they wear out.  I had it break off my wrist in a 12' deep pool and it was a challenge to get the watch off the bottom of the 12' depth pool.  I am disappointed that they don't last any longer than they do.
5,It was a requested gift so assume it’s great because last one he had lasted a long time. It was Only replaced because the 2 side loops where you attach it to the Fitbit wire out.
3,I like that the bands are similar in look to the authentic Fitbit charge bands. There is one issue that does concern me and that is that the upper band the one that snaps into the top of the watch plate doesn’t not securely snap in. There is a decent-size noticeable gap. I tried all three bands with the same effect so there is that thought that it might come off.
5,Liked the speed of delivery and how easy it was to replace bands..
4,Bands are easy to snap on. A little stiff when they’re new. I work outside and they get dirty and sweaty. A simple rinse with soap and water cleans them quickly.
5,Highly recommend.  They arrived in one day too!
5,These bands are exact as the original one but are pretty colors. Snapped right onto my charge 3. They have a coating on them that Makes the silicone more comfortable on my wrist. Great price for 3 of them! Good fit I can make tight or loose on my 6-1/2” wrist
5,Great replacement band
5,It was a gift for a friend
5,My band broke after several years and I was able to get these quickly to make my watch whole again! Perfect with variety of color if I need it at a good price.
5,I think they should have a 3 pack with the same colors
5,Like how quickly it came. Very comfortable.
5,Came rapidly and good for price
5,Received in 1 day and excellent quality
4,The bands came quickly and were well packaged. However they don't fit perfectly. There is a small gap where it should meet the screen and the edges feel weirdly sharp despite being made of silicone. They're fine for the price though.
5,The bands work perfectly and are very well made.
5,There's not much to say other than the one band that I have used for far fits my Fitbit and working so far. It's what I expected.
2,You get what you pay for. Compared to the real FitBit bands these are very low quality and you can feel it. They don't feel comfortable and are less form fitting to my wrist.
4,Just received this today so this is first impression feedback....fit is slightly loose for the Fitbit Charge 4 material less flexible than original.  I hope this stays secure and lasts longer than the original.  I do like the colors but wish the fit does not wobble at connection to the Fitbit.
5,Charge 4 new wrist band fits great
5,These are a little smaller than the one I received originally with my Fitbit but still large enough for my wrist. For the price they are perfect.
4,I like the bands but they are not as long as I expected.  I would purchase from the seller again.
2,These were fine until I returned to work for tax season.  First the grey band started unclipping from my Fitbit up to 4 times EVERY day so I changed to the black one and it did the same thing.Then I did a little test.  I put the unbroken part of my original Fitbit band on the side of the Fitbit that these kept unclipping from & used one of these on the other side.  For over a month ORIGINAL Fitbit side NEVER unclipped.But now the last 1/2 of my original Fitbit band has torn so I’m stuck with these unclipping up to 4 times per day every day. while I work at my desk.  I have also had them unclip in my coat sleeve the same side.There just seems to be a problem with how these connect to the Fitbit compared to Fitbit brand bands.
5,Great price with a nice selection of colors.
5,I had an apple watch for a while but it just wasn't a good fit for me. This watch however is perfect for me and my lifestyle. The battery life lasts for around 7 days and that's with me wearing it near constantly. It's waterproof- I verified this as I went swimming while wearing the watch several times. It's decent with fitness tracking it analyzes your sleep patterns and the app comes with a food diary that works very well. The narrow design also fits my wrist really well- with my old apple watch I used to get tendonitis rather frequently from the bulkiness of itI think my only complaint comes with the durability; I never got a case to protect the screen and so I've gotten a couple minuscule scratches on the screen and on scraping on the casing from where I've hit it against things.
5,Easily replaces originals.
2,I bought these because I saw they had descent reviews. They are water resistant and they look good. They come in beautiful colors. What I did not like at all is how uncomfortable they are. They are stiff no give in the movement. My skin feels sweaty and clammy under the Fitbit band. Returning and would not order again.
5,I like to coordinate colors with my outfit.
5,I got 3 bands for 7 dollars. Fit my fitbit perfectly. I got the large probably should have gotten smaller but still fits.
5,Great value
5,This was very worth the money I sent for them they work great and my daughter loves the colors they come in!!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Updated: the watch fasteners are broken.  Hence the issue i was facing was because of a broken watch.
5,Just what I was looking for. Easy to install
4,Comfortable and affordable.
5,I have been using this replacement band for about three weeks and have no issues. Quality is not exactly on point with original but close.
1,Between taxes and shipping it costs almost $40 to get a replacement strap for my Fitbit Charge 4 from Fitbit. Personally I think that is scandalous especially considering my strap lasted all of 8 months before breaking. So imagine my surprise when I saw that you could get not one not two but three straps for $8 and the reviews aren't that bad.Well I went ahead and bough them last week (July 2022) and it's truly a case of you get what you pay for. First up the quality isn't that bad but you can feel the difference; the strap is more rigid and inflexible and doesn't quite go around the wrist as well. But the two main reasons I gave this a 1 star are:1. The fitbit no longer turns on when you swivel your wrist. Really really annoying but now I have to push the button just to see the time.2. Like previous reviewers have said just 4 days into wearing it the strap has already come out of the socket and I almost lost the fitbit.I've literally just ordered the original fitbit strap even though it pained me to fork out $40 but I would rather do that than lose a $150 fitbit
5,The same original band that came with my Fitbit. In 3 colors. Swap them out for variety. Easy to attach. And great price.
2,I love everything about the bands very affordable too. But I'm having a hard time keeping my band on my wrist as it clicks out of the lock very easily. Today all 3 pieces feel off of my hand while simply taking off my coat.
2,I got these because they were plastic and I wanted to be able to swim with it on. (I had leather ones before.) The problem is the top portion of the band (the side with the buckle) will randomly come off. Not every day but once a week or so. It isn't as snug a fit as the bottom portion or the leather band I had on it before. I have to keep checking that it is still connected. I thought maybe it was just one of them but all three are that way. All are loose on the top connector. Other than that the fit is fine the band is comfortable and the colors are as described.
5,Very easy to change the bands so that makes it fun to change colors for my outfit. Comfortable and holding up well with the daily use. Highly recommend.
2,The colors of the bada are great. My personal experience I hope isolated but the first few hours I wore my watch with new band it feel off somewhere. I didn't realize until I got home and was out a watch. The material is not as comfortable as thr original strap.
3,Paint chipped off after a few months of use.  It was inexpensive so I am not too bothered but it looks low quality. I don't think it will hold up long.  That being said the FITBIT brand fell apart in less than a year and those are much more expensive so this is a better alternative.
5,Arrived on sooner than expected! They fit perfect and were easy to attach!
5,The wrist bands are very easy to replace and look nice.  Same as the original bands (except 3 color choices).Be careful when you order size.  I measured my wrist and it fit within the large size however it also fit the small band size.  I should have ordered the small.NOT the companies fault strictly my mistake.
2,After a couple of weeks the strap repeatedly detached.  This was never a problem with the original strap.
2,Unfortunately this isn't a great fit with a Fit Bit. The bands don't connect properly and keep popping off.
2,They appear to work and do latch to the tracker... mostly.But the slightest pressure or bump will have the band detach from the tracker.If I try to take it off it's 50/50 whether the band detaches from the tracker before I can unlatch the back like you would normally remove a watch.
5,Identical to or better than the original. Seems to be better quality.
5,Good price.
5,Replace my band on Fitbit 3. Fits great & very comfortable.
5,Product arrived quickly and matched photo.  Easy to install.
5,Awesome. Just exactly like original!!!
5,Prompt delivery. Happy with my purchase.
5,Be careful not sturdy if you are rough they may break on you. Overall worked fineb for me.
5,Fit bit watch
5,Needed to replace my OG bands and this is perfect! Very comfy. Good texture. Easy to put on.
5,Very Comfortable! Just like original band.
5,Great deal. Perfect fit.
2,These look almost identical to the original however they do not appear to be as well-made. After two weeks one of the three has already broken where it connects to the Fitbit.
5,Band looks great and easy to replace. Great price
4,Fitbits are meant to be worn tight and all of the time.  I wear mine when I'm exercising mowing the lawn and rock climbing.  Needless to say the band is going to take a beating.  The first one lasted over a year.  I love they come in a multi-pack so I can have a spare.
2,This band continues to come off my Fitbit.  I have purchased different bands over the past six years and this one will not stay on!  Taking off my coat putting down my back pack and other activities pop this band off the Fitbit.  We were out of town for a graduation and when I came home and started the return process the screen says the "return window" has expired so I am stuck with a band that does NOT work.  Don't buy this item since there are lots of other options.
5,Great price for replacement bands.  The bands on the Charge 4 do not last forever and this three pack was just what I needed as my old band was starting to crack around the hole I use.  The color combo was pretty reasonable and all colors I would find reasonable to wear.  These bands are so much easier to replace than on previous models!
5,Inexpensive and they give you three bands. Won’t have to worry about buying any for a while
4,The band is quite a bit longer than the original but seems to work well with the clasp provided so no issues there.  I found that I needed to do a LOT of cleaning to my fitbit base to get the springs on the sides to work properly.  That involved a toothpick and a dry toothbrush.  Once I got the area cleaned the bands popped right and fit nicely.  Given my original band was disintegrating this was a good inexpensive way to be able to continue to wear my fitbit
4,The price was great and the bands fit just fine. They do seem a bit cheaper in quality than the original but considering the fact that authentic Fitbit bands wear out/fall apart within a year I'm glad to have these as substitutes and save some money.
5,great price easy to install great value for the price.
3,These bands sort of serve their purpose. The connection to the actual fitbit is loose. I am waiting for the day that it just falls off. I did not expect them to match the quality of the bands I would get from fitbit but they still leave a fair amount to be desired.
3,Seems like a very good fit but keeps falling off.
5,I was impressed with the quick delivery and the product itself.  Unfortunately when I went to apply the bands to the watch I found that the "connection" on the watch is what broke off so I couldn't attach the new bands. I had to purchase a whole new fitbit.
5,Product arrived as described
4,Good quality and price
5,The bands seem exactly like the band that came with the Fitbit. Like the price and comfort seems the same as the original band.
5,The band works as well as the original band and so far it is holding up well. The best part is that there are still two more in different colors in case this one breaks.
1,The colors of the bands looked nice but while putting my Fitbit on with the new band on a day after getting them I heard a snap noise. Two plastic parts of the Fitbit broke off which were actually from where you attach a band. I am suspecting the new band did this since I never had a problem with the band provided by Fitbit once getting the watch. I usually am pretty careful with anything I buy especially electronics and anything that can be pricey. So not only did the plastic parts come off I cannot wear the Fitbit as an actual watch anymore since the plastic pieces broke off. I had to buy a new Fitbit since I cannot wear my Charge 4 anymore due to the damages. I was not expecting to drop about $100 on a new Fitbit just because I bought $13 Charge 4 bands. I understand you get what you pay for but very upsetting it broke my actual watch and I can only track my steps while keeping my watch in my purse or pocket. I will be returning these.
4,I liked the fact that these replacement bands for my fitbit charge 3 fit so perfectly around my wrist.  The original one that came with the fitbit was so big that it would catch on my sleeves and after a few months it just broke.These are comfortable and so far seem to be durable. I really am very satisfied.
4,One of the bands broke within a couple weeks. Thank goodness I saw it and didn’t lose my watch.Glad there are 3 but it does make me uncomfortable that it might cause me to lose my Fitbit.
4,The exchange of bands is simple and comfortable.
5,Bands are easy to put on and take off seem pretty much identical to the fit bit ones included originally.
2,At first I liked it because it looked and felt like the original band. After wearing it I noticed that it kept coming off when I would flex my wrist during certain workouts. It would also come off if it got snagged while taking off my backpack. And it also comes off while I’m sleeping. I don’t know if all are like this or if I got a defective one but I’m not happy with it. If I knew it was gonna be like this I wouldn’t have bought it. The original one never detached at all. Not even once.
5,Easy to use
4,I like these bands but they don’t fit really tight. There is a gap and it makes me worry that they might come undone. I still use them but I am very careful when I do.
3,My wife has small wrists. To get the Fitbit to register on her wrists the band had to be latched on the third slot from the inside slot.  This puts more tension on the connection at the Fitbit and band fatiguing the connection to the point where the connection will not hold. Is it a poor design by Fitbit or the material used in construction of this band?
5,After my original watch band failed I looked for options as a replacement. These bands fit perfect and very reasonably priced.
5,Order was as pictured
5,Replacement band looks and feels just like the original band that came with the Fitbit
4,Fitbit 4
1,I purchased a Fitbit tracker 3.  I am so upset the band keeps breaking free from the tracker while still fully secured.  The strap keeps breaking free at the tracker and falling off my wrist.  It has not worked properly since I got it but it fell off 3 times today and I am fed up.  I can't return because it is past 30 days however the product is defective and I appear to have no avenue to appeal.  I was sent a poorly refurbished product and I did not realize I had a 30 day window.  My bad.  I honestly don't think you can trust this company's refurbishing work.  I feel taken advantage of.  I expected a fully functional strap.  The tracker is fine but where the strap attaches to the tracker does not work properly.  I have even replaced with a new strap twice and and it is not the strap its the attachment on the watch that is defective.  What do I do?  I write a bad review.  I am as I said very upset and feel taken advantage of.
5,It fits perfectly for my HR4.
4,My band on my Fitbit broke.  These three bands are perfect.
5,Easy to put on and works well.
4,Good bands. The quality feels slightly lower than the Fitbit bands but nonetheless I find them comfortable to wear and easy to put on. I would recommend.
5,Ordered the wrong size by mistake.  Was able to return and ordered correct size.  Very pleased with product.
2,One of the bands won't stay attached to face of fitbit
5,Little stiff at first but works in easily
5,Fit just like my other band. I used on my fitbit charge 4
5,I have bought these bands previously.  They seem to last longer than the FitBit smart watch.  They do accumulate large amounts of dry skin in the joints...
2,I bought a 3pk of these bands on Dec 9th (not even a month ago) and I'm online searching for a new band. Two of the bands I received seem like they are locked into place where you can pull either end straight out with some force and they don't budge but if it meets resistance at a slightly different angle the band comes apart. There are times that I don't realize that my Fitbit has fallen off until I see it on the floor or it's caught in my sleeve. I've even woken up to find it in the blankets. One of them comes off when I try to buckle it. At first I thought it was just one defective band but both of them do that. I don't wear the white one because my long sleeve shirt stained it after a few hours. Anyway I've stopped wearing my Fitbit in fear of loosing it while I'm out of the house and I'm back online looking for a replacement.
5,Nice sturdy replacement band.
5,I kind of go through these bands frequently but only because I cannot sleep with my watch on nor do I shower with it on so I take this off and on about 2x a day. I buy them in packs like this so I can rotate through them and not wear them out so fast. I work in the medical field so I constantly am cleaning it with alcohol wipes so I'm not sure if that breaks it down but I think for the price you get for three its worth it. They come in very cute colors and are easy to change. Easy to clean and thats about it!
5,This band(s) is sturdier than the original. Had to purchase a multi pack to get color I needed only con.
3,I bought a 3 pack.  The first band broke within a month. Cheap!
4,The band itself is pretty good so far. The metal loop for the band started losing its finish within days. I never had this problem with the original band from Fitbit.
5,The bands fit my device perfectly. Then I had my daughter engrave quotes and patterns on them. Kelleyliz designs.
5,Very good price and quality
5,I was worried about quality but they are just like the ones that come on the new product.
4,Good bands just like original that came with the watch. The color is just slightly "duller" than appears in the picture. Good price.
5,Great fit and looks good
5,Product was made well and fit perfectly
2,I purchased these bands in January. I have gone through 2 sets. They do not stay on the Fitbit. I am constantly re attaching the band to the Fitbit. They pop apart with the slightest of  wrist motion and it’s not because I purchased a set that is too small. My Fitbit falls off when I am sleeping so I don’t register the proper sleep number. I do not recommend this product at all. I am very disappointed in it and will look for something else quickly so I don’t lose my Fitbit. Poor quality.
3,It was delivered in a few hours that was amazing.  The material quality and the look/feel of it is great but the fit to the Charge 4 is not very good it is not as tight as the original band.  It leaves a small gap between the band and the watch that did not exist before.
3,The replacement bands keep falling off the fitbit. Not sure if it is the fitbit or the aftermarket bands.
2,I was so happy when these arrived. However they are useless as they do not stay connected to the watch. You will likely lose your watch as these can disconnect easily during wear. Mine fell off so many times that I've given up and chalk it up to a waste of money.
4,Love these  bought while waiting for Fitbit replacement for the original band (buckle end snapped within warranty Fitbit team was responsive it was slower in coming (pandemic) and I didn't want to miss tracking my steps.I gave 4 stars because the black band has a bad habit of suddenly coming loose where it connects to the dongle luckily it's been while sleeping and with long sleeves on that caught it before falling.I love the sparkly options <3 but I haven't used them yet.
4,I bought these awhile ago and misplaced them.  I have now found them and they won't stay on my fotbit charge 3.  Very disappointed.Update... contacted the company and they are sending me a replacement set of bands.  Great customer service.  Hope these do the job.
5,Got what I was looking for. Delivery was fast and product durable.
5,I ordered and they came the next day!  Nice neutral colors.
5,Excellent quality for the money! Would recommend!
3,Not black like original fitbit band disappointing.
5,Great product for the price.
5,I wasn't paying attention and originally ordered the large. I returned those and ordered my correct size small and it fit perfectly on my fitbit-just as well as the original one it came with. And now I have two backup bands too.
5,Gray color has a slight purple hue. Easy to attach to my Fitbit. Comfortable to wear.
5,Arrived on time and fits fine
4,These bands do not work on the Charge 3.  When placed on the Fitbit they come right off.  Work fine on the Charge 4.  They are about an inch shorter then the Fitbit band.
4,I purchased this set of bands to replace my original Fitbit band plus then to have back-ups.. The replacement went seamlessly. The fit is very comfortable. The tip of the band has an over riding ring with a locking nub to hold the loose arm of the band flat. I have only had these a week so not sure about durability but so far very happy with the purchase. I am a female and purchased the gray black and white set.
5,Perfect replacement  band for my fitbit watch
5,I had to replace the original band fairly soon so I got these to replace it. I figured I’d fly through the bands fairly quickly since the original broke so soon after buying my Fitbit but I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how long they last. The first band I used out of the pack is still working a few months after putting it on. It has some wear along the edges and along the metal clasp but it’s still holding strong. Even after it eventually breaks I still have the other two in the pack. The Fitbit itself might not last as long as these bands have!
5,My old Fitbit band fell apart. This is a perfect replacement.  The best part is that it comes in three colors so I can switch out the band when I feel like a changing colors.
5,The band is of good quality. Have no issues with its use.
5,I like these bands because they are easy to switch out and the holes are close together so that you can size the band easily for best fit. They clean well with an alcohol swab. And the price is right. I took one star off for comfort because my wrists are small and the width of the band is a little awkward - I wish it tapered in to be narrower like the leather band I used for my FitBit Charge 2 but this is a small consideration. I like to wear watches and bracelets below my wrist bone so the width makes this a little awkward. But overall I am really happy with this purchase.
4,installed easily
5,I was totally happy with this purchase. I was looking for a wristbands for my charge 3 and they fit perfectly. For only a dollar or two more than other sellers you get three different bands. Great price.
2,The bands do not secure the Fitbit and continue to detach from the band.
5,I can only review it for the one day I used the band because my charge 3 sadly stopped working the next morning (it was already on its way out before the new band). The band is a nice material and very similar to the fitbit brand bands. I didn't have any issues with the band not locking or leaving excessive gaps. The day I wore it I was doing masonry and had mortar and water on my hands and wrists constantly. The band did not scratch or discolor and dried just as well as the name brand. Overall I was really pleased with my purchase.
3,The bands fit ok but be very careful because the pop off easily. Thankfully it popped off while my hand was inside my purse otherwise I would have lost it.
3,Wore the black band a week and a half and the band tore.I'm on the blue one now. We'll see how long this one lasts.
5,The bands are good. I like the color variety. For my wrist they always seem to be just a little bit too big or too small on how they cinch but that’s easy to overlook.
4,So far I've out one band on and it works. I've only worn it 3 times so hard to tell what the durability will be like. The band material isn't quite as soft and the sizing is ever so slightly different but overall seems to work!
5,I enjoy changing my bands to match my mood or clothing.
3,I would order the real fit bit band next time.
4,Nice to keep track of your health
5,These work great for replacement bands
5,Faster service and the product was what I expect
4,Not sure if I didn't attach bands correctly 1st time but it came apart. But since then everything stays where it should but in the back of my mind I am thinking these band won't last. I think they are made that way so we have to always buy new. The band that came with the Charge 3 when I bought it lasted one year.
5,Durability will take time to measure- product appears fine but only been in use for 1 full day.
3,The band does fit the tracker but not quite perfectly. There is a small gap between the band and tracker. I’m not sure of the long term effect of this whether the connection will be weaker or whether dirt or liquids will damage the band end or tracker.
4,Somehow when I ordered ONE set I received and was charged for TWO sets. I can use but was not pleased with that.
5,Great value for 3 bands! Exactly what I needed and was delivered fast.
4,Hopefully these will last. They look great
5,They seem absolutely fine and the prices was right/
2,The bands are comfortable but poor quality they do not lock in well to the fit bit out of the box. They also break easily.
3,It works okay if you aren’t too active. But with medium pressure the band pops off the watch head. It’s come off a few times that I didn’t even realize it and almost lost the entire watch.
5,Great  bands. Just as good as the original.
4,What I look for in a band is mainly color and if it comes clean. I would have given them five stars but it still needs cleaning more than I'd like as I do a lot of gardening. But they do come clean and that is so much better than having to discard them like other off-brand Fitbit bands. A band in white that I highly recommend That seems never need cleaning is:  TSAAGAN Sport Silicone Band
2,Not the fault of the band but a Fitbit design flaw.  This fitbit model doesn't have a band that will securely attach to it so it's just a matter of time until I lose it.  Maybe that's the point!
5,Authentic bands right size great price & fast shipping!!
5,The Product was what I needed and came right on time
5,Band was easy to connect to Charge 4. Feels lightweight and comfortable.
5,Good quality/price ratio. Colors are as shown and they fit perfectly.  I think it will start to peel around the metal part but have not happen yet.
5,I purchased these bands a few months ago as replacements. They feel and act the same as a Fitbit brand strap and the sizing matches. Comfort is four stars because these will cause sweating around the wrist just like the standard Fitbit brand.I’ve taken photos of the packaging I received so others know what to expect and how they are shipped for a package of three.The bands do have the same fit to the Charge 3 where there is a minimal gap between the device and the band. I know the bands look off colored but it’s really just a little dusty from the humidity and high pollen count.I use my Fitbit for standard fitness tracking by walking and going to the gym without any issues. I have not tried these out for swimming.
5,Quality comparable to original. Nice appearance with 3 colors you can change for a different look and having extra bands available ensures you won’t have to go without your Fitbit.
5,Update: 12/28/21So I have worn these for 6months. I wear the gold one the most and in the last week one side keeps detaching. I cleaned the area with a soft tooth brush were it attaches and it just isn’t holding. Do they all do this?These are very solid and made well. I wasn’t expected them to be so ridged. Loved the colors. Easy to install. Hopefully they will continue to wear well for a couple of years at least.
5,Needed this because my original strap broke and now I'm wondering why I didn't buy this months ago. It's a good fit and I love changing the strap to match my outfits.  I've been using them for a few months and haven't experienced any issues. I've ordered more colors.
2,The point of attachment of the band to the Fitbit pebble detached itself and would no longer stay hooked to the pebble. I would have lost my Fitbit if I wasn't at home in bed.
5,I love that it comes with 3 bands in different colors! I wore the purple/maroon one first and it lasted me about 8 months. The securing piece broke first but I was still able to wear it for a bit longer because the clip-in piece was still in good condition. You can see the wear and tear in the 2nd picture. I’m happy with the 8-month run especially because I have the other 2 bands (shown fresh out of the packaging in the first picture)
5,Hope these last longer than the original one!
4,They started wearing out after a few days and color started fading it's comfortable and durable to an extent but doesn't keep color
5,My husband's Fitbit Charger 3 is several generations out of date and finding  replacement wristbands was a find.  The size and colors were what he was looking for. Very happy with our purchase.
5,Fits my Charge 3.
5,Great price and color selection.
4,Was recommended by a friend. The bands are slightly narrower and shorter than the original Fitbit band which I like. Got this set for the rose gold and plum bands. They are a good value even if the paint on the buckle wears away.
2,Disappointing fit color does not match or coordinates with the tracker.Feels unstable to stay in place.
4,Did not like the size of the metal bandit is shorter than need be. Makes it hard to adjust band.
5,The quality of the Fitbit band is like the original band.  It was easy to replace and so far has met my expectations.
5,I ordered the wrong product at first. When I ordered for the correct model the band fit perfectly.
5,Tracking steps & sleep
5,It worked
5,My husband’s band on his Fitbit charge broke and he was very disappointed because he uses it all the time.  The replacement band came with three in a pack and different colors which are great because now he can switch them out whenever he wants.  Great value!
5,Good value. Fast delivery.
3,I used the product as a band for my charge 4 Fitbit device. The tracker became disconnected from band in question several times during normal use.
4,Looks just like the original but the band is shorter than the original short band.  It still works though.
3,These are nice for smaller-sized wrists.  They are not as soft and pliable as 'pure-soft' silicone bands and the additional stiffness makes them feel a bit on the 'plastic-y' side.  But so far tolerable to wear all day.
3,The clip kept coming apart where you snapped the band to the Fitbit. I clipped it back in a few times and should have replaced it with a better band. Now my Fitbit has fallen off somewhere and gone forever. You get what you pay for
5,I purchased this product to replace the broken band on my Fitbit 4 which I needed ASAP. My order was accurate and delivered in a couple of days. The product was durable and surprisingly inexpensive.
4,I really enjoy these bands especially at this price point. I think they are comfortable although they are slightly more rigid than Fitbit’s bands. There is a very very small gap between the Fitbit and the band sometimes but the band is still very strongly attached and it doesn’t seem to be an issue. I’ve worn them in the water kayaking camping hiking etc. and they have held up well. The light pink band does have a little discoloration from getting dirty but that was expected.
2,Purchased the 3 pack. All 3 broke on less than one year. Will not purchase these again.
5,Bought the larger of the two bands because i measured my wrist and it was larger than 6.5 inches the max size for the smaller choice. However I am guessing that the size is not taking into account the inch of length of the watch head as the bands were larger than the broken one. While it works just fine (fits perfectly onto the watch and looks exactly the same as my broken strap) I would have preferred the smaller strap. No complaints though because it still fits and I'm happy that I can continue wearing my watch. (Fitbit charge 3)
5,These Fitbit devices work extremely well except it appears their weakest link is the wrist strap. These are straps where an excellent replacement and instant snap into place. They look to be an exact replacement to the originals.
3,These bands are made of sturdy and relatively soft plastic. Watch out for manufacturing imperfections on the inside of the band which can cause skin irritation.
5,These bands are fantastic - just the Fitbit itself (now my second one) only lasts for 6-9 months.  I have switched now because I couldn't get any help from Fitbit
1,I bought these Fitbit bands and had trouble keeping them on the Fitbit. One side was secure but the other kept coming undone. I tried all three bands to see if the problem was consistent and it was. I wore my Fitbit to work last week and was sitting at my desk when I realized that my Fitbit was not on the wrist anymore. my office mates and I searched the office but we cannot find it. When I try to synch the Fitfit it will only synch when I'm in the office so I know it's there but still we can't find it. I just ordered a new Fitfit because it has been over a week and we still can't find it in the office. I will never use any other bands for it than specific Fitbit brand.
2,One of the Band arrived damaged; instead of  Black+Navy Blue+Slate Grey got Black+Navy Blue+Black and One of the Black Band was Damaged
3,The texture is weird and definitely not Silicone. If you want Silicone go somewhere else. They're super sparkly and pretty but I specifically wanted them because they said it was silicone.
4,Dropping one star because they don't connect to the Charge 3 as snug as the original band. At first I was concerned it wouldn't stay connected but I have worn one of the new bands for a couple weeks without any issues. I like this style the weight of the band and length. Other bands have extra slack and this one doesn't! Overall very happy.
5,These three bands work well and the price is great. Very satisfied.
5,Arrived within a couple days and snapped right into place like original Fitbit bands. It’s nice to have the 3 colors; black grey and blue. Just make sure you order for the correct model Fitbit.
3,The bands are fine enough but they don't actually fit the charge 4 hr well. They kept popping off with just a little bit of pressure.
5,Easy to change out !! I like them a lot .
5,Fits my Fitbit 4 perfectly.
3,I do not recommend this product for a charge 3. For all 3 bands two of them the connection just falls off for the side with the metal hoop/prong thing that you push through the whole of the band on the other side.  One of the 3 bands in the package seems to be a better fit but does not work right. I know it is not my fitbit because when I use the band part (the one full of wholes so you can custom fit the size to your wrist) fits perfectly fine on both sides of the fitbit. Now I believe this is due to me owning a charge 3 and not a 4. At the very least if you are buying this for a charge 3 it may or may not work for you.
5,Fast and excellent replacement but we had to buy 2 additional bands in colors we will never use.
5,Everyday use
5,I enjoy the product.  Reasonable price for a excellent product.
5,Fitbit 4 colorful bands fits perfectly good quality and great price too!!
4,I bought this product for my mother for her Fitbit. My dad was able to assemble and attach these very easily to her Fitbit. She said they were more comfortable than the original one that came with the Fitbit. I would recommend and I would buy again. So far the durability is OK they are still new but seem to be holding up well.
3,Ok for the price. Not as soft and silicony as the original feels cheap and plasticky. The band connections arent flush with the device either. Probably better bands out there
3,Accurate depiction online of product as far as fit and appearance. My only con is after repetitive wear they don’t fit snug where the band connects to the Fitbit. Band gets loose and sometimes comes completely disconnected.
2,Arrived promptly.  Looks great.  The bands won’t stay on the Fitbit!  Everyday the band separates from the Fitbit and falls off my wrist.  Ordered another set and the same thing happened.  Not a fan of these.
4,I’ve only worn the new band for two days but it seems very similar to my previous silicone band that broke. I thought three bands for the price was a good deal. However I do wish the company had a medium size available. I ordered large but there is quite a bit of extra band after buckling it. It’s not a big problem but I think a medium might be just right.
4,I’m glad they came in a 3-pack because I’m already on my second band after just a few months. Colors and descriptions are accurate but the first band got very lose with connecting to the actual Fitbit and would pop off. My watch was always on the same wrist that I help my daughter with and so there was a lot of pressure put on it. Good for the price though I just ended up wearing my watch on my other wrist to avoid the pressure for the time being.
5,Loved these. Very cute
2,I’ve only had these a week and the band is already popping off at the connection to the charge.
5,This is the replacement order. I appreciate how quickly the return and replacement worked. The band would not securely fit into my Fitbit. The blue and black bands seem fine but I am having trouble with the other band. Sometimes the band falls off the Fitbit and my Fitbit falls off my wrist. I have thoroughly cleaned the Fitbit and sometimes that helps but I am still trying to be very careful when I wear it.
5,Quality replacement wristbands..  Love that I could get 3 colors for such a reasonable price and they arrived the next day!  Great service!
3,The bands fit well and look like the originals. However within a month the lighter colored bands started getting discolored absorbing the colors of whatever you wear and could not be cleaned even with soap. I might purchase dark colors but not light bands of this brand in the future.
4,Na
5,Fits me and the device…good price.
4,Good quality the lenght is slightly longer then the original fit bit but fits good can not judge durability i have only worn it for a feew weeks yet
5,This band fits exactly like the original is very comfortable and hopefully is more durable. But now I have 3 just in case.
5,I like the Fitbit watch band not like the original band but they work for me good product. Would recommend
5,These fit our Charge 3 and Charge 4 perfectly. Have used constantly for over a week with no problems!
4,Nice band fits device well.  Small band that holds excess is too loose to work well and always needs adjusting.  Runs small if you have a larger wrist.
3,I have bought imitation Fitbit bands before  but this one does not fit as securely as the original. If I push it up it will disconnect from the Fitbit. It seems pretty good if I wear it tightly on my wrist so it doesn't have an opportunity to shift. But I would not buy again.
5,Pretty sure these are the same bands that came with the watch. The texture thickness colors and buckle are exactly the same as the original band I'm replacing.
5,Good looking product and is comfortable.
5,Love the dark colors
3,Band looks like OEM but does not feel like the original. It is really stiff and not as soft. Works well enough though.
5,You really can beat the quality of these Silicon Bands for the Fitbit Charge 4/ Fitbit Charge 3. The Bands are exceptionally Durable to provide longevity.
5,My experience has been that the expected lifetime of the Fitbit wrist bands is about a year as they eventually crack at the point where you have to flex them to remove the tracker and re-fasten it.  Since this product provides three bands at a very reasonable price I'm expecting several years of use out of them.
5,Fit well and are durable. I like the 3 choices of colors.
5,They don't look/feel quite the same as what fitbit sells but they are decent quality and good value. No problems so far.
5,The new bands shipped fast and was easy for me to swap out.
5,Very happy with product
4,My previous Charge 3 band broke on the metal attachment side. I ordered these bands as replacements and the color matches exactly and has the exact appearance of my original band. I would have given this purchase 5 stars except for the fact that they are advertised as size Large when in fact the bands are size Extra-Large. I was able to use one size of my old band and the buckle side of this band to make it fit my wrist.
5,I bought these because the default band that came with my Fitbit Charge 4 broke. These feel similar and are made of the same sort of rubber but I find them more comfortable and they have proven durable thus far. You also get the color choice.
5,Exact replacement size and shape to the ones that came with the FitBit
5,I needed a replacement quickly For my Fitbit bands which broke unexpectedly. I love the color selection
5,It is a good replacement for the one that broke and is at least as good and maybe better than the original.
4,The bands are nice. What I didn't like was the smell. It took quite awhile for it to  dissipate.  I have a small wrist but the band is large enough will certainly fit a large boned person.
2,My wrist band broke so ordered this- it fits well etc but it will not stay connected.  Every time I put on a jacket it breaks off.
2,The band Disconnects. I woke up and found it disconnected while sleeping..You don't get your sleep info. The quality is not good. I don't recommend.
5,Bands are like the one that came with the fitbit plus you get multiple colors for a great value!
5,These are a perfect for my charge3 fitbit
3,These bands keep popping off Fitbit charger 3.  Not a good fit.
5,The band barely fit my wrist but it does fit. Be sure to measure your wrist and check the size before you order. The strap fit my Charge 3 perfectly and the installation was super easy.
2,Each of the three attractive bands stayed connected to the fitbit for a couple months but each eventually developed the issue others have described where the band disconnects on one side or the other and then the fitbit is in risk of being lost.  I have to reconnect the fitbit at least once a day ow so I will stop using these and buy another brand that is more trustworthy to stay connected to the fitbit.
4,Comfortable
3,The sparkles come off SO EASY. they get all over the place unfortunately as for the non sparkly one the wife seems to enjoy that one plenty decent material its held well so far.
4,The three colors look nice pictured is the glittery rose one. There was an odd smell when opened package that is still on the wristband but unless I stick my nose right up to it I dont smell it so for me its not bothersome. Seems to clasp securely I will update if any issues arise.
2,I’m now on the second band of the 3 pack and it also coming open. No previous band have done this so I will reorder from a different company. The end of the ban keeps separating from the watch.
4,Arrived late bands fit Charge four just fine.
4,3 bands arrived prior to promised date. Adequate but somewhat smaller and lower quality than original Fitbit band.Good value for the price.
5,Seems heavy duty.
5,As advertised . . . work well no complaints.
5,My old bands finally broke so I order these. They fit perfectly.
4,Got these bands for my Fitbit Charge 4.  They seem they are of good quality.  However the bands do not click all the way in with the Fitbit so it looks lose or that they might come off.  The design fit is a bit off and does not adjust properly.  I got the purple light green and light pink color pack and they are not the shades I expected.  Time will tell if these will last.
3,Works fine
5,Have had a couple of weeks.  Easy to attach nice assortment of colors.  Sturdy good value.  Was shipped quickly.
5,I haven’t had these replacement bands for my Fitbit charge 3 very long but they seem to be made  pretty well and fit on my Fitbit nicely.This is not a complaint but I will say that I got the aqua pink and purple bands and in the picture they looked a lot more sparkly or shimmery but they weren’t that’s only thing I’m disappointed in but the product seems good overall.
5,None of them are durable
4,I liked the color choice but did have a problem with the band staying attached to the watch.  It fell off several times.  Most times I quickly found it but was a little concerned about losing it outside the house.  After sort of fiddling with it it now seems to be staying in place.
5,This product is very good. They are definitely made for larger wrists so be aware if you have a small wrist don't buy . The bands are very durable tho !
5,Great replacement
5,My wife said the colors are beautiful and she likes it so I like it too happy that she's happy
5,These wristbands are the same item as the original wristband. Now you'll have 3 colors to choose from.  The Fitbit design is easy to change out but as far as being a rugged design there is reason to have a few on hand. I was surprised at how affordable it was to purchase these in quantity.
4,I like the colors however the bands were a little flimsy in came right all the actual fit bit.
4,My bad I didn't measure my wrist before ordering. I'm a pretty big guy (6'1" and 190lbs) so I assumed I wouldn't want the small band. But the ones I ordered *barely* fit me. I can go to the last notch and it's still not snug the way the original band was. Guess I'm not as big as I thought.But overall they are good quality for the price. I actually re-orded the size down in different colors.
5,Great value. The bands I received will probably outlast the device. I hope they fit the next Fitbit I buy.
4,Seems to be an excellent product so far (three days into wear). The bands fit well on the FitBit and are seemless just like the FitBit brand. They seem to run a tad smaller than the original bands but still fit well on my wrist (size small). I set 4 stars for durability because they are still new. I would definitely recommend these as an affordable alternative to the name-brand ones.
5,Easy change. Good for and feel!
5,These bands came on time and fit perfectly with my Fitbit Charge 3.  They are a little stiff to first buckle but with wearing them they bend a little easier.  Good product will buy again.
5,Delivered fast when my old one broke. Replaced in a couple of minutes
5,It fit perfectly seems to be very durable and this give me  a change of bands to match most of my outfits!
5,I am pleased with my replacement wristbands.  The colors go with all my wardrobe.  It is a comfortable band.
5,New look to your fitbit.
4,The Fit Bit bans fit like the original one. Easy to install. Fast service (1 day delivery).
3,The band is much longer than regular fit bit included band.  Comes off too easily
5,nice
5,I am not gentle on my Fitbit at all.  I am very active and have a lot of manual work to do on a house and vehicles.  I have been wearing one of the three pack for two months straight and no issues.  Thought for sure I'd be through the whole pack by now but I'm not!Minimal signs of wear.  The metal buckle is a little scratched up to be expected.  The buckle appears to be painted.The only way I can tell these are not EOM bands is that the strap loop is a little bit bigger than the Fitbit.
4,Pros:Color options.It functions.It’s easier to detach from the face than the original pieces. Useful for cleaning it.Cons:It’s easily discolored by dye Like the red in my sheets discolored the edges red.Slightly loose fitting where connected to the watch face as in it’s not snug against it. Adds small movement that is basically negligible.
5,I made the error of purchasing a large for my tiny wrist but the seller quickly sent out the right one when I reordered.  I won't be able to comment on durability until I have worn it for a while but it seems fine.
4,Small size is  a little too big.  Had to punch a couple of extra holes.  Otherwise good to go.
5,Like these bands very much. Like the colors.. Read reviews about them breaking. I am still using the first one after 4 months. Just make sure the connections stay clean. One side popped off but I had some dust build up. Wiped clean with a tissue and reconnected it. Still holding. I will buy these again.
4,The bands are decent especially for the price but one of the bands did break at the holes after 8 months.
4,The band feels fine and I like the colors. My biggest complaint is that it is not very durable. Within one week the paint on the metal clasp was already coming off. I hadn’t even done anything strenuous... literally from just walking around the house and doing household tasks
4,The Product work perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Nice bands
5,This product is true to its form it fit the watch as it should
2,These do not click on tight to the charge battery. The band comes off.
5,Product came as expected.  Good quality watch bands.
5,You can't beat the price on these. I have a Charge 3 and was going to purchase from Fitbit. The price for one was $29.95 on sale for $19.95 (plus shipping). Through Amazon 3 bands were $7.64. The band was easy to install and the flexible silicone seems identical to my old band. I'm curious to see how long they last but since I have 3 it may be a non issue.
4,I thought the product was very good for the price
5,Great price for three straps. First I ordered the small/medium but when I received it it was a bit too small. I had to use the second hook which made it harder for the band to stay in place. I then ordered the larger size and it fits great. Definitely durable and the colors are deep and should not fade for a long time. Good buy!
4,The price was right and delivery was fast.
5,Nice set of three
3,This replacement band failed at the connecting end after only 19 days. Hope the 2nd set fares better. Maybe that’s why they come in a 3 pack!
5,I purchased to use on my Fitbit.
2,I bought this product to replace my fitbit band and so far have already had to cycle through two of them as they each broke after about 2 months of use. I do wear my Fitbit daily and the price on these is still cheap but the quality is lacking. The clasp between the band and the Fitbit piece is very weak and both times it has broken it will fall of at that point with moment.
5,Great replacement bands. Fit as expected
3,Se colocan sin problemas pero se safa contantemente uno de los puntos de sujeción.  Tocará pegar el elemento al fitbit
3,Fast shipping! They fit well and are sized as stated. However the place the bands attach to my Fitbit are not smooth. You can feel a lip  if you run your finger from the device itself across the band and corners are slightly sharp until they get worn down a bit. It isnt smooth like the Fitbit band is. This is mildly annoying to me but still not bad for a knock-off and cheaper price than the actual Fitbit band replacement. Would I buy them again? In a pinch yes. The colors are vibrant and as described.
4,From the description I was expecting something a bit less stiff than the original band which I find uncomfortable. I like the softer even slightly stretchy material on Garmin bands much better. Well these are *indistinguishable* from the original. Literally can't tell the difference with my eyes closed. I suppose that's great if you like the original and just want a replacement but for me it was a disappointment. At least I have spares in three colors though so there's that.
5,Replacing the original band which had broken. These work flawlessly. The durability score is of course based only on a short time but there are no signs to the point that durability will be an issue.
3,Wanted purple. Got a purplish red.... it does what it's suppose to just not the color I exoected.
4,Look and fit fine. I bit stiff costing them 1 star
5,Like
5,Have now been wearing one of them for close to a week..  these are almost identical to the Fitbit brand and a price that is wonderful and works the same.  I had my fitbit band break twice in one year and it was replaced but I am now out of warranty..  this pricing is SO WORTH IT..  fitbit bands are way too expensive..
5,They are just like the original one
2,It’s fine but it doesn’t fit a small wrist it leaves gaps and falls eventually
4,What I expected
3,I purchased a set of 3 silicone replacement watch bands for my Fitbit Charge 3 on October 10 2020. The replacement bands fit well attach with ease and stay secured to the watch. The colors were exactly as described but quickly began to show darker shading that turned more grey with time. The discoloration occurred on the band where it was exposed to direct light. If you look at the photos you can see the original pink and mint green color where the watch buckle and keeper shielded the band from light. This is after normal wear and occurred in a matter of a couple weeks. I have not used the purple band yet but am hopeful the darker band will not have the same effect.
5,I'm hard on my FitBit (just about everything I wear).  I've had it for over a year and am on my fourth set of wristbands.  Buying these three was kind of a no-brainer because I expect to replace it often.  These three are a VERY good fit - both to the device and my wrist.  I'll buy these again in a year if they're still available and my FitBit is working :-)
2,Package of 3 should last longer than 3 months however I am on the 3rd band and it's not lasting either. Each band has done the same thing on the same place in 30 days. Where the band attaches to the Fitbit on the outer side of my left wrist it is not staying attached. I LOVE my Charge3 and I want a band which lasts more than a month. So far the grey band has lasted longer than the blue and black bands but even its starting to detach.  Price is great not happy with the performance/satisfaction of it.
5,Item was as described. Package arrived quickly and was inexpensive.
5,I am happy.  Got here early. I like them.
5,Good value and fits comfortably.
4,These bands are comfortable and easy to switch out.  I am rather hard on them so duralbily is only ok for me but others it might be great.  I will say I do need to clean out the joint locations sometimes because it can get pretty dirty.  Overall great quaily for the price.
5,This product is perfect  just like the description fits perfectly and very reasonable love them.
5,Two weeks is a bit too soon to evaluate durability.  I’m not sure what “mobile app” has to do with a watch band.The product fit seamlessly on my Fitbit.  In retrospect I should have ordered the smaller size but that’s my error not a problem with the product.
5,Exactly as stated fits good looks good.  No complaints.
5,I used it to replace the band on my Fitbit. It fit perfectly.
4,Fit good
2,Anytime you move your wrist and it applies any sort of pressure it just pops off. I’ve lost it 3 times and have found it thankfully but I’m returning them because they just don’t work.
4,Bands are constructed of material that tears after approximately a year of use.  I wear it daily during exercise work sleep and remove to shower.  The band tears after a year or so as I take it off.
5,Product as advertised  came quickly great price.
5,Perfect fit for my FitBit.  I tend to break a band a year and this set is perfect to keep me going for the next few!  Love the three colors so I can change if the mood strikes.
5,Nice bands almost like the originals. Flexible and resistant.
4,Good bands - just wish they were a little longer - I'm a pretty large guy.
5,Very comfortable
5,Great deal. Hope it holds up longer than the one I had to replace.
5,De muy buena calidad.
5,I really like the band it fits nicely and I  like the color and the looks it's a simple band not flashy
3,They are always coming unattached from the Fitbit.  They seem durable.
2,Size was not easily specified
5,I love the way it fits.  The band is easy to install on the watch.
5,The items were an exact fit. They look very much like the original straps
5,My original Fitbit Charge 3 band gave out after a year.  I ordered this pack of three replacement bands and received them within a couple days.  They work perfectly.  The color options I ordered were black navy and maroon.  They are all as pictured.  I am overall very happy with this pack of replacement bands.  They were a breeze to change out too.
5,These watch bands are comfortable and we received them within 2 days. Great purchase!!
3,Band keeps falling off of the fitbit
5,The band's arrived on time. They are true to the colors i got the wine black and grey set in large and they are the same size as the original band. They also look very similar to the original band that came with my fit bit charge 3 except the clasp is the same color as the band with these. Seems to be a good quality product. I will know more of how they hold up to daily use after i wear them at my physical job for a few weeks. I was offered a free set to try and use but my opinions and reviews are my own.
4,Great for off brand! The fit on the actual watch is a little off but connections are good. I like the multiple colors and the fit is the same as original band which ended up breaking. Highly recommend!
4,They’re great….I wore the rose gold for a wedding looked beautiful.
5,These bands fit the bit and are a great value.
5,Fits my Fitbit perfectly!
4,this matches the original band perfectly.  It connects nicely to my Dharge 4 and I expect these work as well as the band that came with the Charge 4.
3,I like these bands better than the original band that came with my fitbit charge 4. My issue is with the Glitter bands specifically. Instead of the glitter being part of the silicone band it appears to be just added on top of a regular band with spray adhesive.... which is going to mean the glitter is going to flake leaving a trail of glitter.
2,The bands are very stiff and uncomfortable for me although very pretty and sturdy. Easy to interchange.
3,Great color choices as why I purchased them but the bands are stiff and hard around the edges which irritated my wrist. If they were softer I would not be returning them.
5,great to get three for a low price and received them quickly
5,Bands are comfortable really like the colors
4,a little stiffer than original bands but work just fine
5,Fits perfectly. Very happy with this purchase
5,I love the fit bit bands the colors are exactly the same in the image and fit is perfect.
5,I wear my Fitbit everyday and take it off before showering which can be multiple times a day depending on what I'm doing.  With that amount of activity I wear these out pretty quickly.  I've had these a couple months and still no sign of wear on the one I'm using.  The great thing is that it came in a 3-pack so I expect to be good to go for a long time.
2,After four months all three bands are broken. Each one broke on the buckle side and do not stay connected to the Fitbit.
4,Good value for the money
5,Nice to be able to have color options. Would buy again.
5,Delivered quickly. Fits well. Great replacement
5,The bands work and fit well. Happy customer!
5,My original band had split and this was an easy fix
2,I bought these replacement bands for my Charge 3. They become disconnected from the Fitbit. I bought them six months ago and I just put the third on. Do not want to lose the Fitbit particularly when swimming.
2,Band foesnt stay on main piece all the time. Band is stiffer than original
5,Great product.  Looks nice.
3,Only 1 (one) band fit
1,I bought the 3-pack of these bands but they constantly come apart from my Fitbit.  For example I adjusted my position in my chair and it came off of my tracker.  This is extremely frustrating and I am constantly putting it back together and adjusting it so I can wear it.  I have started the return process because these bands are terrible and I would advise anyone considering these to look elsewhere.
4,I bought the set with Black Blue and Red.  The red and blue are not as pictured.  The red is maroon and the blue is much darker almost black.  Neither are vibrant colors as displayed in the picture.  The bands are good otherwise.
5,Work perfectly for a charge 4.
4,Very good price but it was a little tricky  applying this as a replacement band for my fitbit device.  More comfortable and it doesn't irritate my wrist like the original.  I think the variety of colors allows for coordination with your outfits and ensures that you have a replacement if needed.
5,Time it gives and information
2,This regularly pops off at the Fitbit device.
5,Excellent for the price
5,I love these bands! This is my second time ordering them. My first band lasted a year and a half! I take mine off once a day and usually have to adjust the tightness a couple times daily (I have bad circulation so my wrists/hands swell throughout the day). So for them to last that long is definitely a win for me!! Will order again when I wear these ones out!
5,Work great and good price
5,Fitbit bands arrived quickly and are as expected.
4,Pretty glittery colors. So pretty.
5,Excelente custo-beneficio!
5,Good
1,I loved the concept of swapping out my bands. However these bands are so thick and inflexible they keep falling off my tracker. I wore one on my two week vacation but it kept following off rendering it completely useless. It’s better to spend a little more to buy a quality band or two. I threw mine in the trash.
2,These bands wound be fine if they did not last longer than a few weeks each.
5,I bought this for my Dad. He Loooooves his Fit Bit and is very active and hard on the bands. This replacement set was so well priced I was afraid it would be cheap but they are exactly like the original band. The replacement was very easy he did it himself without searching for his glasses  lol. Just snap the old one off and the new one on. No tools required. He even changed the color to match his golf shirt once already. Love that there are 3.
5,Great fit. Easy to switch out for a different color.  Low price for 3. I searched all over for size and price by far the best price and quality for all 3.
5,Next day shipping.  Good quality
5,Replacement of a broken strap
4,I really like these bands. They are comfortable durable and easy to interchange. They fit larger wrists without being too snug. The only thing I was unhappy with is the color. The purple and pink were mauve and peach. I was really wanting the brighter colors but I do love the mint green at least!
4,I ordered large due to the original strap for my fitbit4   was abit snug but it is too big   length wise but I believe small would fit  my wrist too small
4,Compatible & looks good
5,After wearing one of these for several months I can say they work just as good as the originals. At first I was worried because one came loose but it was because I didn’t snap it into place securely. Be sure to do so! No allergic reactions for me or for the other wearer in the family who tends to get reactions. Good buy!
4,Large size says 7.1 to 8.7 inches but if you're close to the 7.1 get the size down because these are huge ! But they are very nice and effective.
5,Worked great.
3,I'm a rather small woman. This band doesn't have enough holes to make it fit snuggly on my wrist. Good quality though.
5,Highly recommend; quick ship!
4,I made the mistake of ordering the large size. Too big but they'll do.
3,The price was okay and quality of the bands were comparable to others I've purchased in thr past but one band was defective and did not fit the watch.
5,Color choice wears well and easy to install.
3,I liked the colors. Unfortunately the bands are stiff not moldable around my wrist.
4,I had purchased a band for my charge 3 at Walmart that was said to work for Fitbits. It never stayed attached to the watch. So I ordered these from Amazon. It’s just like the original.  And in colors I like. More durable and comfortable.
4,Fits perfectly on my Fitbit charge 4.
5,Fit's great
5,The colors were great for me.  The bands were easily installed.
5,Looks like original band.
5,The first rubber-like FitBit band I had lasted for almost 2 years then simply broke (looked like it had been cut with a dull knife). As these replacements look and feel exactly like the original I expect these will be as durable (I think a 2-year lifespan is quite reasonable). I ordered a pack of three bands from this seller and I would order from them again. Price was very good IMO.
5,Got thre for price of one
2,These do not fix to the watch properly and will disconnect very easily. They are not good if you do anything active with your fitbit.
5,I ordered these replacement bands when my original Fitbit Charge 3 band tore. I wasn’t expecting much because of the low price for three bands. But I was happy to see that the gray one matched my original band in color and texture. I put it on and it fit and looked fine.
3,Received package as scheduled and it did contain the 3 bands. Unfortunately the large size ordered for my husband was not very big. When the bands were replaced they would not fit around his wrist. Interestingly when comparing the size of the bands to the original one side was the same size but the other was significantly shorter. Fortunately for us we were able to replace the side that broke and kept the longer one and it worked when using the black band. Will just throw away the remaining ones.
5,Did the fix
3,It fits okay to the charger. It is comfortable but after three months it broke while I was sleeping
5,Product snapped right into the Fitbit and is indistinguishable from the original.  Fitbit wanted $30 to replace the original (which broke).  These (3) cost me less than $3 apiece.  Pretty good value I think.  Can't rate for durability as the wife has only had it on a couple of days.
4,These are very similar to the originals. Fits both the fitbit and my wrist well. If they aren't durable for some reason I will update review but nothing to complain about.UPDATE: One of the strips has broken in the socket that connects to the fitbit. The plastic molding in this area cracked so it no longer stays on. Thankfully I have 2 more bands.
2,I've had these bands for less than a week but they don't stay attached to the fitbit. There's a gap where one of the bands attaches and if I try to unbuckle the band it frequently pulls the whole band off the device. This was a waste of money.
3,The bands are okay but only two of the bands fit my fit bit the third band the purple one one of the arms doesn't fit it keeps popping off.
5,Very close to the originals. I ended up finding an original band on Ebay. I just feel more comfortable with the original. I feel that these might break while I'm at work and fall off my wrist with out me knowing and lose my tracker. These are very close to the originals and very cheap. I would recommend only using them temporarily though.
5,Does the job
4,Three bands for the price of one: great value.
4,Seems very nice.
5,The lower tab on my Charge 3 is easy to press but the upper one was choked with debris. I had to soak in warm soapy water for a few minutes to get it to depress. Once it came off these fit as good as the original. 3 for this price is a steal!
5,No other store sell the wrist bands for Fit Bit Charge 3.  I was so happy to see that I could buy them on Amazon and I was able to choose my colors.  The only small issue that I have is that my wrists are so small and the little band that holds the strap doesn't have a little piece to connect.  Other than that I am so happy with this product.
4,These  bands fit the Fitbit and look great.  The problem is that the right side comes undone some times. Two of the bands did the same thing. Good way to lose your watch!
4,Exactly what I was looking for
5,Got these to replace the original which broke off (the tiny loops break).This feels close in quality to the original.Straps feel comfortable and soft. No irritation or rashes.Durability  i need to see but given that I get 3 i think i'll be set for the remainder of the device's useful life.
5,Very happy with the quality of the bands.
5,Replaced original band that had broken. Very nice.
5,I love the colors and these were easy to replace my original band (once my daughter showed me how. ). I didn’t see instructions included . That would have been a plus.
2,Didn’t fit my watch
5,I used the bands for my Fitbit. Liked the colors I got
3,They are very poorly made.  Don't stay hooked on the watch.  Constantly having to clip it back on
4,The purple one that came in the pack broke in 4 days. I was disappointed.  So far the blue one is fine. I've gotten these before with no problem.  Better getting these then paying kohls 25.00 for just one band.I'd definitely buy these again. And this is a good seller!
4,The elastomer is a little stiffer than the original band provided by Fitbit. Snaps into the Fitbit perfectly. No real complaints with this product. I received three bands for 1/3 of the price to replace through Fitbit.
5,These bands came quickly and we're exactly what I expected. Having different colors gives me flexibility to to enjoy a run or an event and have a great style.I recommend.
5,Works great very good value over OEM product
5,The oder came quickly. They are nice colors
3,These are fine as far as quality goes. But the hole at the smallest spot still makes it huge on me. Nothing about the packaging says these are extra large.  Disappointed.
5,2nd time to pick this product. Perfect fit. Comfortable and durable.
5,I purchased the replacement wrist bands for my Fitbit Charge 3 in size small.  The colors are purple mint green and pink (which looks more like a light pastel orange).  They fit very well and with 3 color options (other colors are available) I can now have my watch match my outfits.  The 3-pack silicone bands are durable too.  (I like these much better than the replacement band that I had purchased recently at Walmart which didn’t fit the watch as snugly as it should).
5,
4,I do like this band as it is comfortable.  I ordered the small and I have a 6 inch wrist. I haven't tried all of them in the  just the teal one.  It ocassionally disengages from the watch part if I turn a certain way on the wrist.  I reversed the bands and it works better.
2,I purchased this band because it said it fit fitbit charge 4. They appear to look just like the name brand but don’t fit snug like the name brand.
5,Perfect colors and great quality for a fourth of the Fitbit store cost for one.  Highly recommended!
5,Liked 3 bands for my Fitbit Charge 3 for one third the cost of one Fitbit band.And! The quality seems to be as good as Fitbit's band.The Fitbit band for me seems to last only about 18 months. Replacing them with a reasonable price is helpful!
3,In short order the paint/color on the buckle faded/discolored.
2,The original band I received with my Fitbit Charge 3 ended up breaking (the notorious little plastic piece in the connector to the fitbit itself snapped and fell out like everyone talks about on the forums). So I bought these because they looked extremely similar.Well they aren't. They're a totally different material that's rather gummy/tacky and as soon as they get wet say by sweating on them as people with Fitbits are aught to do they become slimy a little bit like snot.On top of that the keeper (the little loop to secure the excess part of the band into place) is like three times taller than it needs to be so the excess band will just spontaneously slip out or worse the keeper will slide all the way around my wrist up to the Fitbit itself.Will these work? Yes technically. They will actually perform the job. Are you going to enjoy it? Not unless you want to feel like you tied your watch to your arm with a dead squid.
3,Got it to replace my wife’s original band which broke. Looks exactly like the original Fitbit 3 band. It does however become easily unhinged from the Fitbit creating risk of damage or loss.
5,Love the color options for the price! Recommend using their sizing chart — it is accurate. I bought the larger bands and should have bought the smaller ones being a male with smaller wrists. No issues though as I was able to neatly trim the excess off. I work out at least 5 days/week and and do yard work on weekends (desk job on weekdays) and consider I’m ‘hard‘ on these bands. The first one (original) later about 7 months so we’ll see how these compare.
5,I was surprised with the quality and exactly like the original. Great quality for the price
5,These bands are perfect replacements for my Charge and so much cheaper than buying directly from FitBit.
5,I noticed by FitBit Charge 3 band was wearing through and immediately ordered the three pack.  It came within two days.  The only problem was that I was not sure how to install it and there were no instructions.  I found instructions on the web and it was quick and simple.  A good price to protect loss.
5,The bands were a good quality and comfort. The size was too small but I’ll reorder in a larger size.
5,They were what I expected but a large and I definitely ordered a small and confirmed it wih the fellow that helped me on the phone.  Just got the replacements  and finally they are the right ones and perfect.  i GAVE IT ONLY 1 STAR BECAUSE  I HOPE IT LASTS MORE THAN A 1/12 THAT MY FIRST ONE DID.
5,This product is the perfect replacement for the Fitbit Charge 4. I like that there are three different colored bands as well.
5,My 5 stars is probably more like 4.5 rounded up because I ordered the "small" size and clearly received the large. I just ended up trimming the end of the bands off so they didn't wrap all the way around my wrist.Can't knock a whole star off though because they absolutely do what they're supposed to and were a great price.
4,These off brand bands fit my fitbit quite well. The bands are a little more pastel than what is shown in the picture here. Do not expect this vibrant of a color
5,Just what I needed
3,One of the bands came broken but all others were great and very easy to use
4,Haven't had but a few days. They go on fit bit fine. It's all I know for now
5,Replacement for worn out band.
2,The watch bands were too stiff and the attaching mechanisim would not hold to the Fitbit  Charge 3 watch. The bands kept popping off the watch on one side or the other making it easy to loose the watch.
5,Used these as replacement bands for my charge 3. The fit is perfect and the material seems a little softer than the original. I like the fit even better than original. Not sure about the durability but after a couple weeks of daily wear it looks like they will hold up.
3,Nice that this comes in a three pack for a low price.  Haven't even used one band for a year and it is already broken.  The tab that keeps the wristband closed just broke today.  A replacement would be great since they say they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  We'll see about that!
4,Buenas... Pero a veces se salen
4,These fit my charge 4 ok. Not as tight fitting as the band that came with my fitbit though... having said that having extras handy is worth the cost. Maybe only for the small strap keeper that you may need to replace.
4,These were rated very high thus the reason I bought them.  After purchasing I was seeing reviews in which the bands broke quickly.  So far I have not had any issues.
1,Bands do not snap into Charge 4 tightly (like the original bands do). Over time they become even looser and snap off. Each band lasts about 1-2 months. Also one of the slips that tucks away the excess band continues to slide off after a few minutes of moving around and allows the excess band to poke out. 1 star for the look and nice colors though.
5,These bands are a little thicker than the original one that came with my Fitbit. The band took a couple of days to become more flexible. Now it feels like the original. I liked the choice of colors available and these are much better quality at a better price than what I looked at in the stores.
4,Mobile app does not apply. It's a watch band. Like color and hold up good. Would recommended to others. Great value.
3,It came with 3 bands. I returned the first shipment back and I received a replacement. Again only 2 of bands actually stay on my Fitbit. This time the navy blue band falls off.  Still like my original Fitbit band the best.
2,I expect to get maybe 6 months out of one. Cheap uncomfortable plastic just like what came with it. Reminds me of something you'd get out of a cereal box. Gonna try a "leather" one next these are just too stiff for me. If you don't mind the original you won't mind these. Edit: my Fitbit just went flying during a VR boxing session that never happened with the original. Be careful.
3,I did not have issues with the size (small) or the product quality (you get what you pay for) but one of  bands was defective and would not stay put on. A little bit of a hassle to send it back so i have kept it but unhappy that it was the black band that was defective. Would rethink before purchasing again.
5,The bands are a match for the Fitbit Charge just as advertised.
5,Great fit easy to swap out
3,You’re getting what you’re paying for a cheaper alternative to a Fitbit band.
3,The plastic is a little hard and not at soft/bendable as the bands that come with the fitbit. But still good so far.
5,I was skeptical  about buying this  very glad I did  fits just great
5,This band vis very nice
5,These bands are very comparable to original band.  The only minor difference was I had to use 4th hole for clasp instead of the 3rd hole on the original. No problem! Same comfort easy to change bands. Will buy again in another selection of colors.
5,The new band is exactly like the original bend in comfort and fit.  I like it very much.  I am not sure about durability yet because I have only had it a short while.  I hope it lasts longer than 15 months which is is the time my first one lasted.
5,n/a
5,Slightly stiff coming out of the package but molds to your wrist in a couple days and is decently comfortable.Easy to swap different color bands on and off.
5,This 3 pack of bands was to replace my original bands that came with my Fitbit. My original bands broke. These snapped on my Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly. I now have several colors. The bands are smaller than the original so I don’t have the extra strap to get in way. Very happy with my purchase.
5,This 3 pack of silicone bands is really a good buy. The bands fit perfectly. I’m wearing the black one now and still have the blue and the grey one as spares. My original I-fit Charge 3:band broke and these replacements arrived very quickly so I was able to resume wearing my I-fit in a couple of days. I highly recommend these.
4,Product is working well. Just a replacement from a broken band.
3,Bands were too large. It was necessary for me to make them shorter which was not ideal as it is obvious they have been cut. I found the size description confusing when I bought.
2,The durability of these is so incredibly horrible. Had this band for 3 weeks
5,I bought these to replace the broken band on my Fitbit 3. It split after only 16 months. The new band was easy to install and it fit perfectly. Now I have 2 additional bands just in case the band on my Wife's Fitbit 4 fails too.  Thank You
4,These came quickly but when I opened the package they smelled terrible.  Super strong chemical smell.  They were fine after airing out for a few days.
5,Like it
5,Good value for the price.
5,Good quality
5,I only needed a pin but at the price I got 3 bands different colors. Great price
4,Loved the colors.
1,These bands last for roughly a month before the part where it attaches to the Fitbit starts to separate and eventually break and pop off. When it happened with the first band I just thought I had bad luck with one didn’t think anything of it and just swapped it out for the second one in the pack. Now two months out from when I purchased these bands (and now outside the return window) my second band is breaking in the same way. I’ve never had bands do this before and am upset that I’m throwing away a band every month. If you want three watch bands that last a month each this is the product for you! If you don’t want a band that breaks after 30 days look elsewhere
5,My original band was breaking so I needed a new one.  The one snapped on easily (had to clean the connection though - lots of stuff under the old one!).  The only major difference is that the part that  "Slides" to hold the length after you adjust it is a little bigger than the original but it does stay a place (i feared it wouldn't).  I have the charge 3.Very pleased overall!!
3,There is a gap with these new bands which increases the risk of them coming off or breaking. To me it’s a matter of when not if. Maybe it’s because it’s used for different models. Nevertheless it does give me good confidence seeing this gap.
5,The wristbands are very nice and easy to install
2,Don’t hold tight against fitbit
5,Is the same as my old FitBit band works great. And the best thing is I have a variety of colors to use now.
3,You did not list where this came from.  To be fair you should list it came from China.  If I had know  I would not have bought it.  I think it is your duty to list where your product comes from...
3,I'd purchased these wrist bands to replace my FitBit Charge 3 band which broke (not at the attachment point).  One of the new bands stayed attached another did not.  I wish these bands all came in the same color (I prefer black) because now I have two different color bands for my watch I guess I'm making a fashion statement.  The price was very reasonable unfortunately the quality was not.
5,Replacement bands were needed. These did the job.
5,easy to install. fits perfectly as original.
5,I had several FitBits over the years and it was always the band that broke.  I balked at paying FitBit the high price for a simple piece of rubbery plastic for a replacement so I taped my old one back together.  I can't believe I didn't know other vendors sold the bands for a great price.  Love the bands feels just like the original FitBit comfortable and easy to switch out.
5,These for perfectly and were easy to replace the original bands.
5,I got exactly what I ordered and what I needed
5,
4,Good bargain. The only thing I don’t like it that the loop that holds the band in place is too big and not rounded like the original band.
2,I'm throwing these away and buying ventilated bands. A week after these arrived I developed a nasty rash on my left wrist.  So I moved my watch to my right wrist and two days later I had a rash there.I never had this problem with the original band. (I only replaced it because it wore out.) I'm buying a band with ventilation holes.
3,UPDATE: They all broke after 6 months.
5,Great quality replacement band for my broken fitbit strap. Easy to replace.
5,I like the colors that I got I like how they feel. My only complaint about the is the part that the extra band won't stay out so that I'm not always catching it on stuff. But other then that they are great bands.
5,I have purchased these bands for both my son and husband.  Like the color assortment and they fit great.
5,Durable and comfortable
5,The bands work very well. They take a little time to soften up but soon feel just like the original band. Good value too for three bands.
5,My wife loved this activity tracker especially because it has GPS and she doesn't have to carry her phone with her outdoor as she is doing her workout. Once it connects it to the phone it synchronize her activity in a very simple and easy way. The band is very soft and doesn't cause any problem with her skin as she is very sensitive. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Came quick and quality was better than expected
3,The band is comfortable but one side keeps falling off and will not stay connected no matter what. Any movement causes the band to unclip from the watch. I decided to use half of my old Fitbit band that wasn’t broken and use the other half of the new Fitbit band that stayed connected and now I’m good! Haven’t checked out the other two bands yet to see if they connect well or not. I’m just happy the colors of the bands match and wish quality control was better!
4,It came in a timely manner and fits my small wrist. Works with the watch very well.
5,You can match your workout clothes or your daily wardrobe with all the colors available in these smart bands.  The bands are easy to apply to your Fitbit Charge 3.  They have no metal and they fit well.  Easy to attach--just push them firmly onto the watch where the band goes.  I work in the yard a lot plus now I am washing my hands constantly  so they are perfect if you have to get your Fitbit wet or dirty!
4,OK
5,Easy to replace the old band. Looks just like the original. Watch out for the white band though. It does show dirt pretty easily but that’s the case with most things that are all white
5,The bands fit well and are durable. I would like to see brighter colors but I do like the ones I got
5,Besides the fact that the item arrived very quickly everything about this transaction was perfect. The three bands were exactly what I was looking for and I’m so glad I ordered these bands.
5,These bands were ordered so that we would have an immediate replacement for my wife's original wristband and some spares for future use.  They are exactly what we needed and we are delighted!
3,I don't feel safe 100% of the time that I won't lose my Fitbit.  The band came loose once luckily I felt it drop. Also that one drop damaged my Fitbit. Next time I may just go with the Fitbit brand bands to be safe.
5,Bands are a lot longer than my original band. Should have gotten a small.
5,……
5,Perfect fit and the colors are great
5,I wanted a replacement for my original Fitbit band and these are almost identical in every way. The small band is the same length as the OEM Fitbit band and works really well. If you're looking for an exact replacement for your original Fitbit band that has broken this band is a great option.
5,Got these for my Charge 4 to have some variety. I have really enjoyed them so much! I recommend these bands. Sturdy nice and really cute!
3,If you put the bands on too tight they will become disconnected and fall off.
5,Fits perfectly
5,I like having 3 bands to change with easy. Bands are tough. They withstand the chewing of a 4 month old puppy.
2,These bands keep disconnecting and I thought at first it was just because of the self defense class I was doing. Until it popped off randomly. I would return these if I could. Not worth your money find a better replacement than these.
3,Wouldn’t stay on my husband’s Fitbit. I don’t know if it’s because it’s got dirt & grime where it’s supposed to be attached or what. Won’t pop in correctly. :(
2,The connection to the Fitbit isn't very secure and can come undone with slight pressure. I've almost lost my Fitbit a few times when it came off during a walk or run.
5,Works just like the original.
5,The bands were affordable and nicely replaced the on that had broken.
1,It’s to big for my wrist almost lost it too bulky I don’t want it I’ve been in a hurricane disaster had no service to call y’all now I fo
5,These bands are as good or better than the Fitbit supplied bands.
2,After 2 months of use the top band couldn't stay connected to the Fitbit device. I almost lost my Fitbit while outside walking because the top band couldn't connect. I'll go through the next two bands and see if they last longer than 2 months.
5,It works great with my Fitbit . I can’t tell the difference with the original band . The original band worked for 1 year. I am not sure how long this band will last . But I have 2 spares bands . Price was great . I will buy it again !
4,It's pretty good. The size fits as expected and the band is as comfortable as the original. The colors are mild and not crazy bright. Good choice if you want to replace the old band.
4,I should have ordered the larger size
1,All 3 bands fall off/detaches from the Fitbit at the Fitbit joint. It’s only a matter of time before I don’t notice it detached and I lose it forever.  All sucked.
5,Got here quickly fraction of the cost through fit bit and it clips on and works perfect
4,I am impressed for the quality of this product. Although the price is really low the quality of the bands are really good. They are comfortable and work perfectly with the Fitbit.
5,So far so good. The band attached easily and fit comfortably. I hope they hold-up well as the original Fitbit bands (2) both broke within two years. To be fair my wife may have been wearing it to snugly on her wrist.
5,Be careful using the Fitbit band tool to determine size.  The tool said I needed a large but I actually needed a small.  There is a 'S' or 'L' on your current band. (wish I knew that).  Amazon is great.  Return the large and reordered small.
5,Seem to work just as well as the FitBit band that came with my watch. I haven't had them very long so I cannot attest to durability but even if they don't last quite as long there were 3 in the pack for way less $.
5,look and feel like the original
5,Bought these when my original charge 3 band broke and this 3-pack includes a grey/purple strap that is identical to the original Fitbit band which is what I wanted. Installation was really simple and it looks brand new.
3,The white one continues to stain and get dirty. They don’t stay clicked in
5,I have only used one of the three fitbit charge 3 replacement bands and have found it easy to install on the watch and works as well as the original band which broke. The black navy and slate colors are as advertised. Can't repor on the durability yet as I have only been using the band less than 1 week. Packing was fine and the bands arrived a day early.
4,Product is perfect.
1,So disappointed. These do not stay on  My watch kept falling off and almost lost a few times. It does not snap in securely and pops off. I thought it might just be one defective band but all 3 did this. Also the first day the color wore off a section of the navy blue. Waste of money. You will end up losing your watch if you use these bands.
3,The product seems durable so far (1 week in) but the purple color is not purple.
5,Arrived today! 3 bands in perfect condition. My original clasp broke. Out of the packaging I couldn't tell the difference from the OEM. Took the original band off put the new black band on fits exact. The quality is amazing the comfort is outstanding and the band itself looks better than the original! I highly recommend!
5,
5,I really love these bands! I read all the reviews and these seemed to be a great value.  They actually may be better quality than the one my Fitbit came with. The colors in the 3pack are the colors I usually wear and black goes with everything.  So glad I bought these.
1,A day after putting this on my Fitbit I got out of the car and the entire thing fell off and the screen of my Fitbit shattered. Not worth saving the money on the band to destroy my entire Fitbit. I’m sure I put it on correctly and I put it back on because I was going in to an appt and had no where to put it and it continued to just fall off with simple arm movements.
5,Despite the fact I got an empty package the first go around when replacement  arrived they were exactly what I needed. Very good and I love the colors. They are a great value for Fitbit watches
5,I compared these to the Fitbit band I already have and they are exactly alike but a whole lot cheaper!  I plan to get other colors in the future
1,The bands are inexpensive look fine and at first they seemed a great deal. But they keep opening up and my Fitbit falls off. Tried 2 of the 3 with same result. You will save money on wristbands but lose a lot more money by having to replace a lost Fitbit. Do not buy.
3,I was a little disappointed with this item. Within 2 hours of wearing the new band it popped off of the Fitbit. It's like the band doesn't attache to the Fitbit properly.  It comes off by just moving your wrist to much and with just a little tension it pulls away from the Fitbit too. I'm going to give it a chance but more than likely I am goi g to have to return this product.
5,Durable color and worth wearing.
5,My original wristband broke so I went to Amazon to find a replacement.  I just received these a few days ago but so far they are great.  You can't beat the price for 3 bands and the colors are amazing.  They are very sturdy and fit the watch perfectly.  I am happy with this purchase.
1,The strap with a buckle attached doesn't secure properly. When placed into the fitbit the strap doesn't seem to clear the tabs so the release button stays pressed which means a small amount of force will remove the strap. I won't even bother using this have to buy a new strap again.
3,These look really good but keep unattaching from the actual Fitbit.  I am on the second band since I got them in early June .  I ended up losing my Fitbit when it fell off while on vacation.
5,Haven’t tried the glitter bands yet.  But am very satisfied with the black band.
4,They were just what I was looking for.
3,Shipped fast.  Colors are good.  I found the bands (Lg size) smaller than my original band and not quite as comfortable.  Good value though for 3 bands.
5,My original Charge 3 came with this style of band. I love how it matches everything! You can dress up or be casual! When my original band broke I searched everywhere for the same band style and it just wasn't available! Thank you Amazon! Not only was it a replica of what I had it was VERY affordable!
4,These are China cheap...but do the job...so far.
5,I like the colors of the bands and they arrived very quickly.  The size was as advertised and the band is comfortable.  I would definitely order again.  I did not rate the durability because I just got them.  I am pretty active and I am hard on watch bands.  The quality is as good as bands I have had in the past that last about a year.
4,It fits my Fitbit charge 3 well. It looks like the original band. The colors look good. I’ve only had the bands for a month so I can’t speak to the durability but it seems sturdy enough.
4,We ordered these as replacements for the original band that broke. The bands look just like the original and so far hold up great. We would purchase again and recommend them.
3,These bands fit as well as the Fitbit brand bands for me. I do NOT love how dirty the bands get as soon as you stay wearing them! I've tried several different products to clean them but nothing has worked in the staining which I assume comes from the fabric of my sleeves? In any case they end up looking dingy and dirty and the nice colors lose their aooeak.
2,The band fits and looks like the regular Fitbit band but it disconnects from the Fitbit itself about once a day. I wish I would’ve spent more to avoid the risk of losing my Fitbit
1,Bought these replacement straps for my Fitbit but they DO NOT STAY ATTACHED. Even rolling over in the night the straps pop off the Fitbit. Do Not Recommend. Would not but again.
2,This watch band almost fits my Fitbit but there is a little crack right at the seam that wasn’t there on the original band. The band is comfortable but I have already broken 2 out of the three bands in the set. They are very flimsy compared to the original band.
5,perfect replacement
5,Very nice
4,I had the blue band for over a year until it broke. I ordered this 3-pack so I could change them out. These bands are comfortable for everyday wear and great for workouts since they don't feel gross after a workout.
4,Decent band. Fits a little different than the one it came with. Looks the same. Not sure about durability yet only had it a week. Can beat the price for three bands
4,They all eventually break and need to be replaced
5,good bands
4,I’m enjoying wearing my 3 pack of Silicone Bands very much. The fit is perfect and the quality is just as good as the Original Bands that went with my Fit Charge3 Watch.
2,The bands are the same as the original silicone one that came with my Charge 4 except that they do not connect well and fall off.  I did not have this problem with the original band that lasted a year.  I will be returning them sorry to say.
5,I wanted a selection of wrist bands for different seasons! These are beautiful and we’re shipped very quickly arriving in perfect condition!
5,Stylish and easy to use! Delivered quickly too!
4,Wine color is a bit off
2,I ordered a set of three different colored Fitbit Charge 3 bands in the small size Novmber of 2021. The first one lasted several months the second and third bands broke within a week of each other. They did not stay connected to my Fitbit. I didn’t have good results using the small bands. Very disappointed.
5,The only regret I have is that I waited until my original band broke! These are great easy to replace and give me more options! Quick delivery so I was only unable to wear my Fitbit for two days. Very well made and so inexpensive!
5,These bands are perfect for my fitbit.
5,Just what I expectedMany thanks
5,They are easy to install and comfortable to wear
5,Colors offered comfortable fit
5,I was thrilled to be able to obtain the replacement band and in colors I wear.  To purchase only one from the maker was much more expensive and in black.
4,Seem to be very similar to the original one that came with fitbit
1,The bands keep popping off the Fitbit. I thought it may be one color so I tried the next and the next all do the same thing. I should have returned them but have been extremely busy and missed my return window. I will be throwing them away. I would not recommend these at all. Very poor.
2,As someone who moves around a lot at my job the fitbit is great for me. My original band broke so I bought this three pack.It looks good. It feels fine on my wrist. However it comes apart often which is annoying and eventually could lead to it being lost. I've woken up a couple times withe my fitbit underneath me after popping off.Disappointed for sure.
5,This band is very sturdy and I like the different colors. Price was good also
5,I've had these for a few months now and haven't noticed any wear so far. I've worn just the one daily and don't notice a difference from the name brand ones at all.
5,Exactly what I needed.  Really nice bands especially for the price.
5,My order was a day late but I was very satisfied with my order! I really needed them because my last band (from the original purchase of the Fitbit) had broke and I got these on the lightning deal on Amazon! 😄
4,Colors are great.  Easy to use.  Just got them so can't answer to durability.  Love them so far.
5,I did the vender a disservice as I originally ordered wrist bands for a Charge 2 and complained  in my previous review when they didn’t fit my Fitbit.  Turns out I have a Charge 3 and these fit just fine.  I’m sorry about the confusion.  Excellent service excellent price.
5,These bands were a perfect replacement for my original Fitbit band. I read the reviews and saw some folks had trouble with them coming off but I have not experienced that at all. The new band was easy to install and it fits and works well. I would definitely recommend these as a much more economical replacement than the original Fitbit bands!
3,I’ve been through at least 5 Fitbits.  The screen is great but you would think you get the Fitbit notifications to work with iPhone.  Even though they are turned on I don’t get my phone notifications 90% of the time.  It has stopped counting steps randomly even when charged on at least 3 occasions.  Does great with steps and outputs when it’s tracking but very frustrating when it just stops.  My charge 3 did a better job of always tracking and with notifications.
1,I regret my purchase and didn't think to try to return them until it was to late my last day to be able to return them was yesterday.It feels cheaper than the orginal bands that came with my fitbit which didn't bother me as long as they worked. The bands clipped on super loose which I wasn't to worried but then a few days ago it just started unattaching randomly and doesn't work at all really. Maybe it works better with some of the other models but for my fitbit not so much. I believe I have a charge 5 which all the bands from my old charge 4 fit it perfectly so it really isn't the model that's the issue
4,I have only had this product for two days but I love it.  Seems as good as the original band and I like having three choices in color.
4,I received the item quickly but I was a little disappointed in the quality. It’s more rubbery than silicone feeling. It’s definitely not as comfortable as the actual Fitbit band.
5,Works just as well as the one that came with my Fitbit. Let’s hope it lasts longer. Fits the Fitbit and my arm great. I ordered the small and I’m well pleased even though I’ve only had it 1 week but so far so good. Shipping was extremely fast!!
5,I was sooo happy to find a less expensive substitute for my Fitbit that worked and lasted!!!!  I''ve had the band on for 2 months and it is still in perfect condition  unlike the other bands I have tried.
5,Don't waste your money. Tried one band and my fitbit fell on the ground. Was told would replace that band. Tried 2nd band and had the same result. Now I have to return these defective bands. You gets what you pay for!****UPDATE.....changed the rating as received a new pack and they seem better. I have to say this company provides excellent customer service and I would buy from them again. They are very responsive
5,The bands were great- the device- not so much it died 2 days later- but it died with a new wrist band so it looks good
4,Similar to the original but slightly stiffer.  Seems like decent quality and price is good for 3 different colors.
5,Watch bands actually fit Fit Bit Charge 4
5,The watchbands are just like the original that came with the Fitbit. Good price.
3,Not same as original
5,It’s exactly as advertised. Easy to remove broken band anc add the new one. Perfect fit!
4,Bought for my wife. she loves them.
5,Fit perfectly and have 3 options now to change up the look. Worth the money.
4,The band is comfortable but has come off several times. Luckily I've had a long sleeve shirt on and haven't lost it. Otherwise I'm happy with this product.
1,I received the bands on March 28. The original band broke on the band itself not where it connects to the tracker. Last week I noticed that one side of the band frequently came loose from the tracker. I tried the other 2 bands that were in the package and had the same result. At that point I noticed that the part of the tracker where the band connects came loose from the Fitbit. I don't know if this is just a coincidence but that connection was always secure with the original band. None the less I can no longer wear my Fitbit because I can't connect any band to it.
4,Great value for the price. Product a little too rigid compared to the original band but for the price its not a big inconvenience
5,These wristbands work great.  I bought a new Fibit Charge 4 that came with 2 wristbands a small and a large.  Both were too small.  I bought the large in these and they fit perfect.
5,I liked it great value just make sure you purchase the right fit
5,As above
3,I've had this replacement band for about six months. It fits exactly the same as the original which I needed to replace after about a year of wear. This fits well but the metal loop/clasp really wore down. I wanted the black band for my black fitbit. The paint wore off in probably a month. It's pretty much just silver/bare metal now. Again - fit is good look is the same but the paint is weak at best.
5,The original band started to tear and after one failed attempt I found these.  Clicked right on to my Charge 3 and I should have one for the future.
5,OEM quality. 3 colors for under 10 USD. You can't beat that!
4,Although said came in small & large there wasn’t a noticeable  place to specify size. I was sent a large but really could have used the small.
5,Nice bands good quality and fit well as advertised. Holding up like original
4,They are really big. But other than that I like them.
5,its a great set of replacement bands for the fit bit. fit and finish is of good quality.
5,Needed replacement band fir my Fitbit Charge 3.  These are comfortable and fit awesome.  I also got the 3 pack of the metal mesh ones...awesome as well!  Thanks for a great product for a great price!!
5,Like the colors and easy fit.  Works great on Fitbit charge 3.
5,Looks like it says and is a great dupe of the original bands. Fits easy. Been using a week or so and no issues. In any case definitely worth the money.
5,This is a great replacement brand for my charge 3. My fitbit bands kept breaking so these are the answer  instead of having to buy a whole another watch. I love them comfortable  durable fits great.
5,Fits really well and seems to be well made.
2,Fitbit falls of constantly. Maybe I just got a bad batch.
5,Good durable product. Good fit and look for my Fitbit.
3,Reviewed already don't ask again.
5,My Fitbit watch band broke and these 3 bands were perfect to replace the broken one.
4,I bought a size small wrist band  same size as the original Fitbit.  There should be two extra holes to adjust.  The band is a little snug. Over all does the job.
5,On Tuesday my Fitbit Charge 3 strap broke where the buckle connected to the strap.  Tuesday afternoon I had new straps and was back in business.  They were a perfect fit for my FItbit Charge 3 and my wrist.  I was very happy!
1,In retrospect I should have know you get what you pay for! I'm on my third band in the package after less than a month. I had previously bought Fitbit bands which lasted roughly a year before they would fail at the hasp. Based upon reviews I knew the bands would not last as long as the Fitbit band but thought if they each would last nearly as long it would all be good. These bands fail at the connection to the Fitbit. The band connector is made of brittle plastic which doesn't seem to give it good long life.Given the current failure rate I would need five packages of these bands to last as long as the Fitbit brand band. :-(
1,I have tried every band on my Fitbit Charge 4 and the bands will NOT stay in place on the unit. Useless. They look nice but for me thats about it.
4,This is the second time I’ve ordered a band for my Fitbit is good for 6mo.
5,These were for replacement of broken band and they are great
5,Used to have spare watch band parts for my Versa 2.  Exactly what I needed.
5,Too early to comment about durability but appearance is great and especially the price!.
2,The band keeps coming out of the fitbit...very frustrating!
4,I like the bands but one of them doesn't stay on my Fitbit so I can't wear it because I'm afraid it'll fall off my wrist.
5,These bands are exactly what I wanted and needed.  The band that came originally with my Charge 3 had disentegrated (sp?).  I like having some color selections.  They are very easy to install.
5,This product looks and feels just like the official Fitbit band.  It just doesn't have the Fitbit logo on it.  So far it has been just fine.  My original Fitbit band started cracking in several places for no reason at all and I wanted a replacement.  This was good for me.
5,These bands are identical to the band on a Fitbit Charge 3 for which I purchased them.
5,The product is very durable
5,I love how fast I got it
5,I’ve only had the product for one week so I can’t speak to the long-term durability but so far so good. Attached to watch normally and so far has held up to a weeks worth of my normal wear and tear. Certainly can’t beat the price. Delivery was efficient and complete
1,I bought these back in May and I’m already on the last strap. The first strap only lasted a few months. I just switched to the second strap and it already broke off of the Fitbit within less than two weeks.Also this has been a problem with all silicone straps but these really bother my skin
5,Easy to connect to the componentUsed for 2 weeks and have had no issue.A great price for 3 bands in colors I like.
5,All 3 replacement bands come apart from watch.  Original band was 2 yrs. old & I wanted to refresh band appearance.
5,All item were delivered on time.
4,These bands are great. Just one problem.... one band (the color I use) wouldn’t stay snapped into the Fitbit. Two of the three worked great.
5,Strap little too long
5,Easy and  good
1,The bands would not stay connected to the device. After installing the band nearly lost the Fitbit device before realizing that these are just cheap Chinese knockoffs. I even tried all three bands and cleaned the connection on the device just to make sure some debris was preventing the new bands from maintaining connection.. Others were even worse and could not even strap on my arm. Returning to sender.
5,Bought them as a gift  she loved them .
5,My fitbit charge 3 band broke after over a year of almost 24/7 use and I needed a replacement. It was super quick shipping and it looks and feels just like the original band. Also it came in a set of 3 so I can switch out the band when I want a different color. Great value excellent product.
5,I like that there are three color choices to better accessorize with my wardrobe
5,Fit perfect
3,The bands are the same as the original Fitbit ones but the end curls up and the tab to secure it moves all over the place.  The excess keeps getting in the way of things...very annoying!
5,The straps are very easy to attach to FitBit.  Found a youtube video that explained how to attach the straps. Classic neutral colors.  The previous straps lasted a little over 2 years.
3,These wrist bands are a good deal for the price however the quality is definitely not the same as what originally came with my Fitbit Charge 3.  I have already had to replace one of the bands after a couple months of use...I am glad they came in a 3 pack.  They are very comfortable too which is a plus.
5,I lost my original band to my Fitbit charge 3.  It was on the small side for me.  These band are great. I wear them everyday.  I have had no problems.
3,I just received the bands and I liked the colors and material; however 2 of the bands won't tightly adhere to the FitBit and it easily is pulled off. One (dark blue) is currently secured on the FitBit however with a bit more pressure on the wrist it will pop off too.
5,My original band broke.  I ordered these to replace it.  I like the colors & they fit well.
5,Very comfortable silicone bands
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The band itself feels identical to the original name brand one but it doesn’t attach securely! Only one of the three actually fit my watch and it still has a gap. The other two pull of easily or won’t even stay on/click into place. I doubt it will last long.Caption for the media:1. The purple one that is secure enough to wear. You can see there still is a gap between the watch body and band more prominent on the top band.2. The black one that doesn’t fit at all. The bottom one fits but the top doesn’t even click in
1,This is the second Fitbit that I’ve had the same problems with: the wrist band breaks within months and the wrist band attachment on the watch fails before two years have past.Fitbit has been on the market long enough to have remedied both of these faults. It’s completely irresponsible to keep releasing a product with these defects and adding more and more plastic to our landfills.I will never buy another Fitbit until you repair these defects.
5,Comfortable
5,I received the order promptly and it is easy to change bands.
4,They changed out easily and comfortable from the start.
3,These are close but no cigar. They attach very loosely to the Charge 4 and there is a gap. I just ordered one from FitBit. These will do in a pinch but not something to trust because it seems like the Charge 4 will come loose.
2,packaged arrived quickly and bands look nice but something doesn't work with them. The first one I used broke within a week (small plastic part that makes the connection). I've never had that happen with any bands and I've used fitbits for many years. So replaced it with other one in package and it doesn't connect very securely either.
5,Works well for the price.
5,My wife's Fitbit band broke. Found this replacement to get three for just a little more than others were asking for one. I had no problem changing the band out instructions were good. And my wife loves the colors and the way they feel.
4,The red and blue which much darker in person  than they appeared in the picture.  I am disappointed about that. Quality is good.
1,Each band lasted a week. They detach from the watch so I ended up taping the bands to the watch which made them very uncomfortable to wear so I just quit wearing it a month ago.
4,Fitbit charges $35 for a replacement band!! I got THREE for $7.39  Seems durable - high quality. So  - for $2.50 each how can you go wrong?
3,Doesn't attach well to Fit bit. One didn't stay on second has so far. I borderline on size go larger
1,These three replacement bands were supposed to be compatible with a Fitbit Charge 4 and none of the three would keep the connection to the Fitbit and kept coming apart.
5,These are very much like the original band that came with the FitBit. They click onto the tracker perfectly. I find them very comfortable an they feel durable. I like to switch them out to coordinate with my outfits.
1,It literally has one job and can't do it. These bands do not stay attached to the Fitbit that means the Fitbit falls off.
4,Fits but seems like there is a very very small gap between the strap and Fitbit itself.Same material sturdy comfortable.
5,Perfect perfect perfect. My original band broke and bought this three pack to replace it. I believe it’s a charge 2. Wonderful more affordable option. And colors are true to name.
4,Quick worked a couple of colors
1,The first band actually fit the watch.  It broke about 45 minutes into me using it. My hand got snagged on a seatbelt and it ripped right off.  The other two bands were not designed for the fitbit 4 charge because it never fit the watch.  I learned it the hard way when I lost the actual watch and searched about 15 minutes before it.
4,The bands really made my arm moist after wearing all day
5,Fits well like original band that came with fitbit.  Love the 3 color pak to change out with outfits!
4,Fits just like the original fitbit band. Everything seems to be exactly the same
5,Great price and just what we wanted
4,This bands though I ordered small are very large.
5,On time good quality.
5,I was skeptical at first how 3 bands could be less expensive than many one band. I ordered them because of the price. When they arrived I was not disappointed. They look and feel the same than my original Fitbit band. But now I have 3 and  I can change the color whenever I want. Good buy!
2,The first of the three straps lasted almost a month before the strap would no longer snap onto my fit bit.  I am using strap #2 now and It is already starting to pull partially away after three weeks but is not unsnapping yet.
2,The band broke after a month of use
5,Very well-made and durable. They look great! HUBBY was very pleased
5,This three color set is great! I am pretty hard on things so I was happy to buy a multi pack to have spares when I break the next one. These are holding up as good or better than the original.
5,I like that there were three bands in the package. I am pretty hard on my fitbit Charge 3 and wear it gardening so it gets pretty dirty. I seem to go through bands because they crack easily. Hopefully these last a little longer than the ones that come with the fitbit. For three...they are priced very well.
4,Very similar to the original mine came with but runs a little smaller. My wrist is between small and large sizes. Should have gone with large
5,this one match the charge 4. some of them sold on amazon does not. i am glad i found it.
2,The product seems fine but does not attach to the FitBit well. After a months time they would not stay attached to the FitBit and kept coming undone.
5,Fast delivery. Everything I expected
5,I love how easy they are interchangeable and to attach! All are super comfortable to wear!!
5,I love these. They feel great and durable and just like the bands that came with my Fitbit.
4,Band broke in 2 weeks
4,Fits great feels smooth to the touch.however not as supple as the original
2,Looked exactly like original band and initially thought they were good but as I wore the first one it doesn't securely connect so the edges of the band where it meets the watchface catch on sleeves and gunk gets caught in the gap.  Ended up buying directly from Fitbit and this band is much better.
5,The band fits my Fitbit and fits me. No problems! Great price!
5,great connection to the fitbit band length & construction idential to the orginal.  Only difference is that this one is a bit more "rubbery" (bendy) feeling & the orginal a bit more "plascticy" (rigid) but unless you held them side by side you'd never know the difference it's so slight.
2,Ultimately three of the bands broke within a few weeks just as I took them off.  The piece that connects the band to the watch snapped in half on 3 of the sets.
4,They break pretty easily but do replace well.
5,They fit great and the choice of colors was phenomenal
5,I wasn't sure about ordering these bands for my Fitbit Charge 3 but I am glad that I did.  They arrived within a few days.  Replacing the band was easy and they look just like the original Fitbit one.
3,I liked the colors but they didn’t stay attached.
1,I'd give them a negative rating if I could! Bought these to replace a broken wrist band. Put them on and when my son went into the ocean the wristband came off and my son lost his Fitbit. I wouldn't buy them again. Pay the extra money and get the originals that fit properly or risk losing your gear! Very disheartening!!
5,I replaced half of the original band and it’s fine. Now I have more spares for when it tears again.
4,I ordered large and they were really long.  I have 8 inch wrist.  quality is great
5,Good price and quick delivery
5,Was easy to replace my original wrist band with these. I have only had them a few days so I don't know how long they will last. They do seem to be well made and sturdy. Great price for 3 bands.
5,Bought these to replace a band that literally broke in half :/ So far so good! I rotate them accordingly. As an RN that has to frequently wash my hands they’re holding up pretty well and haven’t faded yet! Great deal for the price.
5,We needed a replacement band for our Fitbit Charge 3 we ordered the large as we measured our wrists.  We could have ordered the small for a better fit. But for the price of these they work.
5,I was skeptical of  these bands because the price was so much lower than on fitbits site.  They are exactly like the ones from fitbit and fit perfectly!  Great price 3 for less then one from fitbit.
2,These look very similar to Fitbit Charge bands. The material feels very similar but has slightly less give.I was satisfied with the look and feel of the bands.The biggest issue I encountered was with sizing. They are very close to the size of Fitbit bands. Unfortunately if you are on one of the tighter notches of the band with Fitbit’s size Large the Large in this brand will likely be this band will likelybe loose even on the tightest band. Of course sizing down to the Small is an option but not after you’ve opened the package of Large bands.
5,Fits well and is a great replacement.
1,These bands are supposed to fit my Fitbit Charge 3 but will not stay on.  It comes loose with the slightest movement!  Do not buy!
1,Because I kept getting bugged to write a review I finally swapped out my fitbit band to one of these yesterday - it has disconnected at least 10 times in less than 24 hours.  Save your money
3,They didn't last very long.  Broke fairly easily.
5,I very much liked it
4,Great price!
4,The wristbands work perfectly well. One broke already but the second of the three seems to be hanging in there.
5,I broke the original one that came with my fit bit. So glad I could get new ones.
4,For a quarter of the price of one in the official store you receive 3.Not recommended if you have big wrists.
2,The bands themselves are fine but the locking mechanism to the watch face is pitiful.  There's a gap between the face and the band wide enough to stick a dime into.  That would be livable but the detachment is super sensitive.  I always wore my previous band (that came with the watch) to bed.  I tried for the first time with this last night and it would pop off/disconnect from the watch face every time I rolled over.  After waking up to reattach it the 3rd time I gave up and took it off.  Now I'm looking for a name brand band to replace this trash.
5,Quick delivery! Accurate! Comfortable? Easy to install!
5,The FitBit band was to replace a broken one on my FitBit Charge 3.  In the time I've had the first of three bands on the FitBit I am projecting the life to be less than one year for the band I currently am using.
5,A little bit harder plastic than the original brand but that works for me since I’m constantly moving. Fits and looks just like the original band at a fraction of the price!
2,The connection to the fitbit is loose and easily comes off when exercising.
5,Excellent service excellent product so far. Thanks
2,I bought these replacement bands because they seemed like a good value (3 in a pack) and had positive reviews. However after wearing the white band for 2-3 days it became apparent that the color around the edges and internal ridges was wearing off/becoming translucent. I was dissapointed and surprised that the overall reviews were so high.
5,Adorable
5,My original band finally wore out so I ordered these and it was very easy to change the band out and the new one is great and comfortable.  Thanks for the speedy delivery so I could continue to count those steps...or lack of on some of these hot days!
5,The bands are awesome. Fit wonderfully
1,While the bands look good and seem to function they randomly pop off the watch.  Lost a Fitbit Charge 4 on a golf course.  Good thing it was turned into lost and found!  I do not recommend these bands.
5,My sister has a Fitbit Charge 3 and her band wore out and I purchased these 3 different colors and they fit great and are worth the money! Thank  you
1,I bought these for my husbands Fitbit because the other one we had ordered wouldn’t stay on the Fitbit. It kept falling off at any time. Little movements small twist of the arm or just sitting there. These did EXACTLY the same thing - only this time it completely broke the mechanism on the Fitbit where it attaches!!! 😡Needless to say we sent these back and had to purchase a new Fitbit.
5,Received quickly and excellent quality.
5,
4,Got here fast since my band broke suddenly was thankful
5,Great price. Looks great and attached without a problem. Time will tell how durable it is but from the looks a feel it should hold up for a long time. Comfortable like the original that came with the Fitbit.
4,Just put it on.Comfortable..easy to put on!
4,Nice bands for the price! A little difficult to attach to Fitbit but once attached very secure.
5,I'm enjoying my new gray fitbit band. It was easy to replace the old one and it's nice to have these easy color change options.
5,These new bands for my Fitbit are exactly as described. They fit well. And I love the colors. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for new bands for their Fitbit.
3,The colors are true to the pictures and they’re not uncomfortable. However the gap between the band and where it connects to my Fitbit is entirely too large. I would say it’s because I have a small wrist but that isn’t that case. The band just doesn’t lie flat enough on its own. The price is fair though especially for three colors.
4,Band came as advertised size small. 2 other color choices to change up with. Good purchase
5,Easy to attach and inexpensive.
1,Disappointed in this purchase. These looked great very similar to the original band and colors were nice but they did not lock into the Fitbit unit securely and continued to disconnect causing my fit bit to fall off very easily.
2,Clasp is not a tight fit. Allows band to open.Mine opened and fell off. I haven't found it yet. 😕There is good reason these are cheap.
5,Works great looks awesome would recommend. It's super comfortable works well with my charge 3 and you get three for less than it would be to get one on the Fitbit website itself
2,I ended up getting two bands the same color. One didn't have the hardware to clasp the band shut. One would not clip on to my watch because it was damaged. Basically only 1 of the three bands worked so returned them. Disappointing.
4,Only thing that would have been better would've been a second small band to hold the holes.
1,They all broke within a week or two. The base and clasp don’t align with the watch and the angle puts pressure onto the band’s clasp and it snaps pretty quickly. I had one snap after two days of wear. The gap between the band and the watch is too big for it to be functional.
5,None
1,I attached band to my Fitbit watch the straps did come off sometimes but I pushed back in and thought watch was secure. I already left a review this is an updated. I went to the store today it was raining I got back to the car and saw my watch by the driver side door. The watch appeared to be still working but I just looked at it again and now my Fitbit watch no longer works. I paid over $100 for this watch and thanks to this band I no longer have a watch.
5,They look great and love the colors. They are for my wife's  Fitbit.
3,seemed to work great.  attachment seemed firm thought the band a bit stifffew weeks later fell off
5,These are compatible with our Charge 3 watches.  They arrived quickly.
5,I liked the 3 dark colors at a great price.  They were easy to put on.  Previously ordered a light  pink and it always looked dirty.  Definitely recommend.
5,I recently purchased the wristbands so that I cannot tell how long they are going to last. They look almost the same as the original very comfortable. I am pleased with them.
1,Poor choice….does not snap in properly and comes off with some wrist movements risking the chance to lose the Fitbit.
1,I’d stay away from this for a while. Both bands have the same ends so only fits on one side of the Fitbit. How does a manufacture mess this up? Should be two molds. I’m sure this one package isn’t the only one that was been manufactured wrong. Maybe they’ll fix their issue. I contacted the seller and no response. Good luck!!
5,I love these bands! When my old one ripped due to wear and tear these came to the rescue! They are comfortable and very durable. Can’t beat the price either!
4,The quality is excellent but they’re for a large wrist. They were too big and not the usual size.
4,Not sure about durability because I just bought them but I would give comfort an A grade.
5,Just as promised and at an excellent price
5,Received the items ordered promptly. Although one band was defective I contacted the seller and the seller immediately sent a replacement. Bands attached to Fitbit Charge 3.
5,Great price for 3 bands. Good color options. Fits perfectly no slop no rattle or struggles. Time will tell how durable they are but form the price I'm very happy with them so far.
5,These silicone replacement bands were a perfect fit for my wife's Fitbit Charge 3 where the original band on it had broken. The bands come in a pack of three so she now has two spares for future use.
1,I didn’t read the other reviews carefully or I would have purchased some other brand.  Band continually comes lose.  I’m concerned I’ll lose the watch.  Have placed an order for another brand
3,Bands are smaller then the normal one that comes with Fitbit Charge 3 the band is more rubbery than the original and the part that holds the extra band in place after you put it on is larger and does not hold it down as good. I am keeping them but would look for a different kind if I had know
5,Very good quality for the price. The last one I bought from a different seller was trash quality and broke in less than a month. But this one is very durable. Its been a while since I bought this one and still in good shape.
1,I'm on my 3rd band as the other 2 have broken. If you consider them disposable then their ok. Otherwise they will break.
1,Updated May 6 2022: I am on using the 3rd and last band. I received on March 15 2022. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR YOUR FITBIT CHARGE4. The material of the bands are not the same quality as the one that came with my fitbit. I am already on the 2nd band because the first came apart on the side and would not remain attached. Even the metal bracket piece was loosing its color. I will try another brand next time. And I do not work out like that to impact the band not lasting long nor do I have a large wrist.
4,n/a
4,Arrived as described. So far so good. Only time will tell how long they last but am pleased so far.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This band fit my Fitbit.
1,I have had the new band since May 1st and it has fallen off of my FitBit COUNTLESS times now.  LUCKILY I've realized it each time and have been able to "save" my FitBit from becoming LOST!  AND I was even out hiking in a National Park - so it COULD have been lost FOREVER!  DO NOT BUY THESE - UNLESS you want to be very attentive about the band not staying attached to the FitBit at ALL times!
5,Works as advertised jury still out on durability but at least as good as the original
1,The bands snapped on fine to start but within a couple days of use they repeatedly fall off of the fitbit charge watch.  The clasp to the main part of watch seems really flimsy.  The third time it came apart was while I was running which caused the watch to fly off and hit the pavement leading to the chipped display seen in the photo.  You can also see in the photo where the clasp fell off at the top of the watch.  Steer clear.
4,Replacement for Fitbit band
4,No
5,They hook up like the original. The material it is made from feels strange on my skin. And I don't like how the metal clasps are easily scratched. All in all if you are in need of a replacement it does the trick
5,Good fit for my fitbit charge 3
5,Nice to change bands fir different outfits.  Comfortable fit and great price!!
4,Close but not the same as original band.  Not sure if it’s as durable but for the price for 3 unbeatable.
5,Easy to put on & ready to go. Don’t know about durability since I just got it.
3,Great colors. Fit as stated. Plastic is a bit stiff and edges a little sharp. Not as comfy to wear as I hoped but will work.
1,The bands keep falling off of my Fitbit.  I just opened the package and tried to replace my Fitbit band that was broken and this band keeps pulling away and falling off several times today. How is this a Amazon recommendation?  Unfortunately the Amazon order is beyond the 30 day window so I can't return it.  I will not buy this again.
5,Well worth the price.  You get 3 bands for the price of 1.
3,Do not purchase! Used the white one and on the first day the metal band that holds the two together snapped right off... Not nearly as durable as the band that comes with the Fitbit. Very disappointed.
4,Fit wonderful
4,Great durability and received as expected.
5,This was a replacement for a broken band. It's it like it was supposed to. Would order again
5,Very similar to the fitbit band. Liked the black navy blue and steel blue set for my son.
5,wider which makes it more comfortable to me on the wrist
5,Just what I ordered. Fit well to my fit bit. Easy to attach great price for three bands.
5,Great price
4,Met my expectations
5,Great bands and so much more reasonably price than goin to FitBit directly!  Love the colors.
5,I like the look of these bands and they snap on to my Fitbit great. A little stiff but nothing to complain about. I'd buy them again.
2,
5,Wrist bands for my charge 3.  Work just fine!!
5,These worked out better than expected.
5,Like the colors. Fits my Fitbit perfectly. Easily interchangeable. Would recommend!
4,Works great. A little flimsy but does the job.
4,The are similar quality to the original but I Thought they would be bigger or longer?
5,These are just like the band that came with my Fitbit. They fit well and are waterproof. Work well for me as I am constantly washing my hands.
5,The fit is a little suspect if your watch is dirty. Make sure to clean the watch thoroughly and they will fit a FB Charge 3 no problem. Good quality. Cool colors.
5,I love that you can choose among three colors. The quality is very good and the design identical to the original one.Very good quality-price value
5,It arrived quick and was exactly what I ordered
4,Like the color options and bands met my expectations.
5,Exactly what I wanted
1,These are not made for Charge 2 as advertised
5,Great fit & feel. They appear to be very similar to the original Fitbit band. We'll see how they hold up but now I have extras to mix it up a bit (color wise) or switch if one breaks. And they sure beat Fitbit's price!
4,The product was compatible with my Fitbit Charge 3. I didn't have any issues switching the replacement band.
5,Excellent product highly recommend
5,Seem to work just as the original did
2,Was worth a shot for the price but bands won’t stay connected to the device as many other reviews have stated.
5,These are great and the gray color is really nice.
5,Needed replacement band for my FitBit.  Band fitted well and so far have had no problem.  Can't beat the price.
4,Only complaint is that the buckle is painted and will probably end up being Scratched/chipped.
2,Band broke off insert after only few months. Would have lost my Fitbit had in not fallen off in my sleeve
4,No dislikes!
5,The first bands I received were faulty but the customer service folks were awesome and sent me new ones right away. The second batch fit perfectly!
5,These bands are great. Good quality. Snap right onto the watch. Just like the original. I would definitely recommend them.
3,Promised next day delivery kept getting messages for four days saying it would be out tomorrow no show.  Finally almost a week later got them.  Like I said in Subject product seems good it's comfortable just delivery was poorly timed.  My old one had broken so I had to do without my Fitbit for a week.
2,took the latch anchor off my fitbit. had to get a replacement. Worked for a few weeks but never fit the latch quite right.
3,The bands seemed to be a good price but they are loose on the body of the Fitbit. In this case you get what you pay for.
5,Bought to replace broken hands on original fitbit charge 3.  Fits great and the colors are neutral enough with just enough variety.
5,Perfect fit nice to have extras!!
1,As with the case with every single Fitbit I’ve ever owned it came time to buy a replacement band. I came across these and choose a band that matched my Fitbit color. Shipping was pretty fast and I was able to swap out the bands and that’s when I first noticed a problem. I have a Charge 4 and the band didn’t really latch on strongly but I figured it would be okay…I was wrong. I sleep with my band on so I can track my sleep and this band has come loose every night. It just won’t stay attached so what’s the point?!? To be clear I’m talking about where the replacement band connects to the Fitbit itself it snaps on but won’t stay attached during normal wear and the last thing I need is to inadvertently lose my Fitbit so this is a fail and I will be looking for an alternative.
5,no prooblems
5,Great wrist band I liked that it stayed connected to my fit it unlike other brands I've ordered. Quality product so farno complaints.
4,Spare bands for my charge 3
2,These bands don't fit the fitbit properly - they were very loose on the attachment mechanism and kept falling off on their own.
5,Are they as nice as the OEM band?  No.  But these are cheap and are darn good for the price
5,I just ordered these yesterday! It came so quickly. I’ve already changed out my old band to the pink band out of the 3 cute colors I received. Very good quality and comfortable just like the original black band that my watch came with.
5,They're good for what their purpose is but I haven't worn them all to know if their durability is good.
3,Only one size band included. I am in the smallest notch will probably have to make a new one for winter
5,I torn my last band after two years and had not been wearing my Fit bit so glad to be wearing it again
1,Buyer beware. Clasp came loose 3 times in a month. I was swimming the third time. My fitbit is now at the bottom of a lake and I have to spend another $150 to get a new one. Lesson learned.
4,Came on time fit on Fitbit perfectly. How well it last makes five stars. At price if last two years six stars
5,perfect fit a choice of colors and at a price that doesn't make you spit out your drink
1,The bands I purchased for my Fitbit charge 3 are thin - not the same quality of the original band. The bands unlock while I sleep or I’m readjusting the band. They were inexpensive so I shouldn’t be surprised
5,Color combo was fine. Easy to install. My only regret I should have ordered the next larger size.But the new band is working OK.
5,The product is as shown on app. It is durable use it while working and still lasts a long time. 2bd time I purchase it.
4,I wear a small but they are just a little bit smaller than my original
5,Ordered these after my husband broke two original bands in two weeks.  The colors are nice and attached great to his Fitbit charge 3.  Have considered buying some for myself for more color options.
3,The bands are comfortable and I like the colors offered. I've had them for about 3 months and of the whole package 2 of the 3 have cracked the inner plastic piece that connects to the Fitbit. It creates a gap in the band initially and eventually no longer holds the band together. Not worth the money in my opinion.
5,sdewfergy5r
5,Fitbit 4
5,The replacement bands fit perfectly.
5,It was very easy to replace my broken band with one of the new ones.
5,Product was received quickly and works as expected on Fitbit charge3.It does require cleaning the Fitbit latches and connectors before the new bands will latch but work well after doing so.
4,The colors are fine. The connection was a little loose
4,Very good replacement strap for my fitbit 3... I think it's worth the money
5,The band's were very easy to attach  fit well were comfortable and look durable though I've not had them long enough to evaluate this feature.
5,The bands are well made and look great. My only complaint is that it is difficult to unbuckle to remove the fitbit. It seems like this band might break too soon because of this.
2,I have had the band for maybe a month and the clasp won't stay attached to my Fitbit anymore had to get a new a new band already.
5,A comfortable and durable replacement for my broken Fitbit wristband. A quick and easy recommended purchase to anyone looking to replace theirs!
5,Great price for 3!  Just like the original wrist band now I have a choice of 3 colors.Fits exactly the same.  Good deal..
5,Super easy … easier to replace band than to brighten the dim screen! Perfect and comfortable ! Thank you
5,I have just used one band and it has attached perfectly. So far so good!
1,The straps will not stay secured for any length of time to the charge 4 body.  It is very frustrating when the strap pops off at random times
5,Fits great. As advertised
1,I’m DISAPPOINTED with this product.  I just currently began using the bands and within 3-5 days each band broke.  I work in an office so they were NEVER used roughly.  BEWARE!!! 👎
5,Perfect replacement for original Fitbit Charge 4 band. Nice color variety for changes.
5,Looks identical to OEM large wristband.  May be too big for smaller wrists.
5,Item was as advertised and arrived on time.
5,This was jyst what I needed. Great colors fit and durability.
5,The bands fit my charge 3 and have not had any issue with losing connection like other reviewers mentioned. Good product great price!
5,They fit great and look nice.  I like having multiple color choices. Very comfortable and seem very durable.
4,No
5,I have had the band for a week now and it seems and feels like an original band.
5,Got these for my husband and he loves them!
3,These bands had an absolutely horrible smell when I opened the plastic packaging that they were enclosed in. It took weeks of soaking them in Dawn dish soap and scrubbing them for the smell to dissipate!
5,On the old band I never get the time when fliping your wrist over but on these I can. I like them very much.
1,I bought these thinking they would fit my charge 4 but they don’t. I was disappointed when I got them and they didn’t fit. They do fit on the charge 3
5,Great price.  Bands arrived quickly and were perfect.  Loved the selection colors.
5,Happy with my purchase.
2,The first band broke/ripped in half after a few weeks. The second band is starting to do the same thing. Also this band is much more stiff than the original Fitbit band.
5,I'm glad other companies are making bands for Fitbits; on their website they're about $30 for a single band. Now I can have a few choices without spending way too much money on these bands. They're great so far and I'd definitely buy them again.
5,I like they are light durable and comfortable. Easy to clean!
5,These bands fit very well. Easy to order and quick delivery a big plus!
5,The replacement Fitbit Charge 3 bands seem to be durable they are comfortable.
3,The clasp on this band is very cheaply made.  I have only worn it a couple weeks and the paint is already wearing off.  My Fitbit brand is much better with No wear showing in over a year.  I will not buy this again and would not recommend to others.
5,Great replacement for my original Fitbit strap definitely recommend this product. I have the Fitbit Charge 4 👌
1,I liked the price but the band doesn’t stay on so I guess you get what you paid for.  Might need to superglue it on!
5,These are as good as the original bands. Great assortment of colors. Price is right.
5,Product was as described in their add.  Easy to install.  Size was perfect for my average size wrist.
5,My fit bit
1,I have now tried all 3 of these bands.  On all three the band repeatedly detaches from the Fitbit even during SLEEP!!  There have now been many times when my entire Fitbit falls to the floor because the band has detached.  It is only the piece with the buckle.  What a waste!!  I have seen multiple people report this problem.  Clearly a defect in manufacturing that side of the band.
4,My wife's fitbit
5,I like having 3 colors and the Charge 3 band is very easy to replace. My arm is 7.1 inches so I got the large and cut it. You might try the small if you are right on the middle number like me.
4,Fit like they should
5,These bands seem almost identical to my original which broke after about 15 months. If each of them lasts close to that long they will be a great bargain. They were delivered earlier then the estimated earliest date indicated as well.
5,I bought the wrong size and had no problems with returning and getting the right size. The bands are very comfortable don't come off my fitbit and I really like the different colors. Thank you for your fast respond.
5,These bands are perfect. Just like the ones that came with the watch.
1,I wish they wouldn't unlatch on their own. They will not lock into the fitbit even though it is the correct one. Returns are easy and it offered to send me them again.  Hoping just the 3 I received were defective and the other ones that are on their way actually lock in place.
3,I liked that they were cheap and that two of the three worked. I was defective. You get what you pay for.
5,I think the bands are really comfortable and love the colors. It feels as great as the original band. The durability seems great but I’ve just started using it. The hook part is plastic though.
5,Fits well comfortable. Only had it a week so not sure on durability but it seems to be well made so hopefully it's durable.
5,Great replacement bands at a low price. Very satisfied with how they look and fit.
5,pretty metallic look to the pink and silver bands
5,Great price three colors! Very happy!
1,These bands kept falling off the fitbit. After a week it completely broke off the piece on the fitbit. Now I am stuck with a broken fitbit!
5,Love this item!  It is of good quality and there are three of these Fitbit bands!!!
5,The 3 fit bit bands arrived quickly after the order was placed. I put them on the fit bit and hopefully they will last quite a while.
1,very disappointed  all three came damaged and broken.
5,I liked the quick delivery.  I have no negative comments as the Fitbit bands are perfect!
1,THE ORIGINAL FITBIT BAND BROKE. I PURCHASED THESE. I cleaned the part that the band attaches to. the black one popped off on three different times. I switched to the blue one so far so good.
3,I got a dirty wristband
5,The mobile app is easy to use and convenient when I'm awy and can't use the computer.
5,Make sure you snap them on good cause the watch will fall off your wrist
5,I love how these look but haven't put them on my fitbit yet. They are really secure too. As i tried to pull the straps apart they sounded like a zipper opening really cool!  Wish I could add pictures!!!
5,Bands were great
1,DO NOT BUY FOR FITBIT CHARGE 3.I ordered these bands for my Fitbit Charge 3 but the parts of the band where it secures to the device did not fully click in. At times it seemed like they were secured but then a few hours later the watch would become separated again and pop off my wrist.I was wearing it despite this because I didn't have a replacement band yet and thought the device had finally been secured. Later I looked down at my wrist and realized the watch had yet again become lose and was now lost.I had to buy a completely new Fitbit altogether to replace my Charge 3 which had been a sentimental gift. Not happy with this purchase at all for my Fitbit Charge 3 it ended up costing me a whole new tracker.Not yet sure if it works for a Charge 4 but I won't be risking the trial.
5,They arrived very quickly and are just like the original band that came with my fitbit. Great price and I think they will last.
2,Replacement set of 3 unfortunately band cracked and broke after 1 dau of wearing
5,The bands worked well and were easy to put on.  So far so good!
5,The original band from my Fitbit were cracking at the closure.  Now I have 3 new bands that slide right in to place!
1,The item does not fit as advertised.  Denied return !!!
1,The charge 3 bands are too hard and hurt my wrist. They look just like the original fitbit bands but the material is not comfortable and digs into my wrist. I couldn't wear it for a whole day without my wrist hurting and needing a break. I tried wearing one of the bands for the last two weeks hoping it would flex and "break in" some but it is still intolerable.
5,I received the pI need them.roduct pretty quickly.  It was not much more expensive than getting just 1 band.  This gives me the option of changing the color should I desire.  It also gives me on-hand replacements should
5,I bought this pack of wristbands to replace the broken Fitbit band. These fit properly and the price was outstanding!
1,I ordered these watch bands as mine broke from use. I typed in the model number and name of my fitbit and these bands came up I ordered them. I received the and....they do not fit my watch.
5,Great bands for the money!  I have used these daily since I purchased them and am having no issues at all.
1,Beautiful bands but beware as I lost my $124.00 fitbit due to these bands not staying attached . Out my fitbit now and stuck with the other 2 bands now as well .
5,Easy to put on and comfortable.
5,We got exactly what was advertised - on time!
5,The bands arrived when stated and they look great. Put one on the fitbit and it fits perfectly.
1,I've almost lost my fit bit a couple of times because these things just come apart where the band connects to the fitbit.
5,Bought it about 3 months ago and still wearing using the first band i put on with minor wear and tear.
5,Fits my Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly!  Great quality bands and the colors are perfect.
4,Looks and works like the original version.
2,They would fall off constantly
5,So far so good. These bands replace the original band perfectly and so many colors to choose from. Glad I purchased.
5,They seem good. Only wore for a few days as my fit bit died. But I think the bands were good.
5,The price of the bands works well to be able to change colors to match what I am wearing.  The bands will the Charge 3 and Charge 4.
5,Love that it’s a 3 pack so I can change to band colors when I want.
5,Very reasonable price nice appearance
4,Run Big.. I got the large and it’s on the last notch
4,Great buy
5,I’m very satisfied with the quality of the bands. They fit as well as the original and the quality is equal if not greater than the original. Zero complaints. I only plan to update if it breaks sometime down the road. $8 well spent.
5,I recommend measuring your wrist size before ordering. The large band was too big for me so I had to order the small. Small band fits my wrist well. It’s comfortable.
5,Easy to replace great price same quality as original product.  Arrived quickly.
5,Replacement band for FitbitFit is perfectAppears it will be durable
4,Work as replacement for original
5,Very happy. The colors don't fade and it it's the charge 3 perfectly. The comfort is equal to the original band that came with the fitbit charge 3.
2,Appeared to be a good buy with 3 bands and different colors. After 2 1/2 months of use with 2 of the 3 bands they have become more of a pain than than they are worth. The band that attaches to the "top" of the tracker (on the 2 sets I've tried) continues to disconnect from the tracker during normal use and thankfully the tracker has always fallen from my arm in locations that didn't result in a lost Fitbit. My guess is that the tension on the bands connection is too weak. Pass these up and purchase a different brand as I am in the process of doing.
4,I like it’s easy to put onDon’t like material. It’s hot leaves rash.
1,Can't use the product. All 3 bands fall off where they clasp into the fitbit. I would lose it. Because they just intermittently fall off
5,The wrist bands fit perfectly on my Fitbit Charge 3.  Look like the original band.  Price was great for the three bands.
4,comfortable and now I have a variety.
5,These fit the Charge 4 and were as described.
5,Look and feel exactly like the original Fitbit band. Nice bands
1,
5,Bought because my last watch band broke these three so far have been spot-on replacements
5,Fit my charge 3 fine. Little stiff but should break in fine. Haven’t had it long enough to see if the quality will last. Great price for 3 bands.
2,Nice bands but they don't last. Ordered them in November and last one broke in early March.
3,I actually have a Fitbit charge 2. But I did not know the Fitbit charge 3 bands were not going to fit my Fitbit charge 2. So I’m sure the product is pretty good but I had to return the bands because the latch is a totally different shape/style from the different models.
5,Like the assortment of colors easy to replace adjustments work very well
5,They’re perfect! One side of my original broke and I was able to use one side of this band to replace it. The colors are great!
5,I had a good experience; ordered the product I wanted got it in a timely manner.
5,Fits perfect now I can wear my Fitbit.
5,Good fit and appearance!
1,the clasp on these were not secure.  I had to return them
4,Wife loves them ..... work great..
5,These are exactly like the original band that came (and broke) on my fitbit.  I wish I would have paid attention to the size because I ordered large and it's very big on me but that was my fault.
4,Delivery was smooth and the product does what it supposed to do...
5,Fit on my FitBit Charge 3 without any problems.  Fit on my wrist.
4,LOOKS.  DURABILITY.  RELATIVELY EASY TO REPLCE OLD AND BROKEN BAND
4,As described. Very satisfied! Would for sure recommend for anyone who wants to replace their current band.
5,Ease of purchase! New band every day for my Fitbit 4.
5,The product came packaged nicely it was exactly what I was hoping for and it fit my fitbit perfectly.  Extremely happy!
1,The colors in the picture do not match the color of the bands that were sent. Poor quality control on your part.
5,These are exactly like the original band that came with my Fit Bit. Great color options!  I was replacing my original that tore but these are nice if you would like a different color band.
5,Love the small bands and to have in several different colors is great!
2,The colors were good.  The flexibility of the bands are poor.  I expected them to be like the original fit bit.  These are very stiff and hard to fasten. The band has separated from the watch many times with unexpected movements.
5,A little loose at the connecting point to watch. But very nice for the price
4,Works ok. Couldn’t get the band to snap in place at first.
5,This band is comfortable and functional. It replaces the band on my FitBit and is just like the original. Different colors are nice.
2,The bands themselves were pretty especially the champagne gold.  However I have not been satisfied with the fit.  I find that they do not hold the attachment to the device itself.  I have tried to use all three colors and none of them hold the device if I put my arm down on the counter desk or even on my lap.  I have almost lost my Fitbit several times when it fell off my arm.
4,The colors are a lot more muted than pictures but they do the job.
5,I needed to replace my original band and I was able to get a 3-pack fairly quickly and I am pleased that there were color options and that the bands are easy to replace.
1,Tried the bands with the Charge3 tracker and I find it loose as the tracker keeps falling out of the band. Hopefully it gets fixed as they are good value for the price and quality of material . In the meantime have to return these back.
5,Fit as expected
1,Band that came with watch lasted 2 years this band tore within 30 days! Not happy!
5,They look and feel just like original.
5,It was easy to put the new band on the Fitbit. It is very durable.
3,The quality is good. The bands do not fix tight to the watch. The band separate unexpectedly and may risk losing the watch. It could be a problem of my watch.
5,These look and feel just like the original band snapped into place easily I love them!  I didn’t realize how faded my old one was until I got these.  I have a Fitbit Charge 3.
5,These replacement bands works like a charm. Would highly recommend if your needing a replacement for your fit bit.
5,Replaced a broken band. These are just like the original! Exactly what I was looking for.
5,I wear my Fitbit all time and the band feels and looks good all the time. I ordered my new band on my IPhone and it was easy.
5,Fits the Fitbit 3 perfectly. Such a good deal for 3 colors!!  I have a feeling the bands will outlive my Fitbit.
5,fits perfect - good colors - nice to be able to change daily after sweating so they don't smell while the others dry out from being washed ... highly recommended I love my fitbit Charge 3
5,The replacement bands look identical to the original band!
5,The bands fit good and what I expected. Didn't break my wrist out like the one I had gotten from Walmart.
1,Band didn’t hold Fitbit fell off and is now lost!!!
5,The description was correct and like the multiple choices
2,I wish my review was like the majority however my experience has been frustrating. The band frequently detaches itself while I'm wearing it. The connection point is loose which makes it easily detach making the product virtually useless.To clarify my old band fits just fine and never had issues with detaching. I ordered this replacement product because my original band got cut.
1,I tried all three small bands and none of the bands would fasten to my Charge 4. Will be returning.
3,Don't seem to fit as securely as original band.
5,I absolutely love the colors. I love the comfort of the bands I would 100% recommend this company and the fitbit 3 bands.
3,For the price it was fine except for one of them.  I tried to put it in and it snapped right at the metal piece.  The other 2 are fine so far
4,#CommitToTheMask
5,It's like the original one that I took off the Fit Bit.
5,Extremely happy with these replacement bands. Good quality and excellent value! Would definitely recommend.
5,They went on. But they didn’t “click” on. So I’m not confident in them staying in place. Feels good. Looks good. Time will tell. Will update my review as time goes  :)
5,They were exactly what I expected.  They are just like the one that came with my fitbit.
5,The three bans seem as bit as good as the original.  Snapped into place as it should and works fine.  Price was right.
5,Bands perfect replacement for original; almost identical. Comfortable and appear to be as durable as original Fitbit bands. Grey color not as dark as original
1,Item want stay attached to watch keeps coming lose
1,2 out of the 3 bands pop off my Fitbit charge 4.  this did not happen with the original band that came with my fitbit device.  First I thought it was just a problem with one of the bands So I switched to the second band same problem.  I'm now going to try the third band.  It snaps together just fine but doesn't stay that way continuously it pops off.
5,Purchased a set of these bands to replace my original fitbit band which broke after a year of use. These bands are comfortable and of a comparable quality to the original band.
5,This was a good replacement band for my Fitbit watch.  The colors  of the bands in the package of three were good.Replacing the old band was very simple.
5,Needed replacement wristband for my Fitbit Charge 3. These bands fit. Good colors. Easy to replace.
4,Perfect for my Fitbit Charge 3
5,Love these. They fit and last
5,They fit my Fitbit just fine. So far I have only used one but I am assuming the other  2 will be fine also. The price was great. They arrived as promised.
1,You get what you pay for but I wanted to give these a try before buying Fitbit’s $30 replacement bands. At first these bands had a small gap where they clip into the actual Fitbit & they’re somewhat stiff compared to Fitbit’s but I could live with it. However the top band’s clip-in piece broke within three hours of wearing. I tried another set/color and it did the same thing. This resulted in being unable to cinch the band on my wrist without the top band popping completely out of the Fitbit. Now I have taped the top band to my Fitbit while I wait for my authentic Fitbit band replacement to be delivered. 0/10.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Last in water sweat. Shower glitter stays on good quality super comfy
5,They are fine but don't attach as well as the original bands.  With a bit of resistance they will come apart.
5,It is early to say but the product really looks good. The silicone is tough and the clip is pretty resistent.
5,These bands were a perfect replacement for the original band that broke.  I am very pleased with the assortment of colors.  Especially happy to have received them in one day thanks to Prime.  Great value.
1,Didn’t fit my Fitbit Charge 3/4
5,This was a really good price for the band.
5,Perfect fit. Just like the original band. Great value.
2,Well you get what you pay for. After a week one band has already broke…currently wearing the blue one it it keeps popping off so we will see how long it last before it breaks as well.
1,Terrible. They don't attach very securely to the unit so it'll come off during almost any physical activity which defeats the purpose of having the fitbit. Absolute garbage product.
2,The coupling mechanism is made of plastic and all three bands broke within a month for me. Would not recommend.
5,Purchased as a gift for my daughter she stated that it was as durable as her original Fit Bit band and very stylish.
1,My Fitbit fell off many times and the band would not snap on to the Fitbit.
5,Received these these earlier then stated and couldn't be happier. They are sturdy and durable just like the band that originally came with it. I would definitely buy more or even recommend them.
5,Pleased with the quality color options and ease of use for the price. Snaps right into my Fitbit Charge 3 and simple to swap out band colors to mix and match outfits or moods.
5,These replacement bands works like a charm. Would highly recommend if your needing a replacement for your fit bit.
5,Works as expected. Since it came in a 3 pack I won’t be upset if one breaks sooner than I’d like. But so far it’s great!
5,Great quality bands exactly as described. They look very nice and work great!
5,So easy change out!
5,I like the colors and it feels very comfortable.  It fits the charge 3 perfectly.
5,Left the wrong review these seem to be good.
3,One band already broke. Not made well.
5,Perfect set is well fitting bands in dark men’s neutral colors.  My husband loves them.
5,It matches with the original fitbit3 blue band. No gaps or falling apart so far. Satisfied with the product
5,Speedy delivery and got exactly what I needed.
5,The price is very reasonable and I liked the 3 pack option.  They also showed up earlier than expected
5,I love those wrist bands - I wear my fitbit day and night and during all my workouts. The bands are durable and very comfortable.
5,These bands fit my Charge 3 perfectly. The colors are exactly as pictured and the price can’t be beat!
3,2 of the three bands fit well and look good. However one of the bands does not stay fastened to the Fitbit and I have almost lost it because of that.
5,Loved the price and the colors! Comfortable.
5,Love the bands!! The small is definitely small but fits well with little extra to flop around.
5,Just received them .... love the colors and very comfortable.... arrived quickly 😊
5,This three pack of bands was well worth the purchase price and seem to be functional.
4,Comfortable and durable product for an affordable price
5,Nice bands for my fitbit. The small size is small so be sure u measure your wrist.
5,The bands fit the Charge 3 as they were described.  They are a little stiff but I believe that is because they are new!  Hopefully they will hold up longer than the bands I received from Fitbit!
5,Don't last as long as they should. But extremely comfortable.
5,Easy to connect to my Fitbit.  Colors are great.  Makes my Fitbit look new.Diane Drace
2,I’ve got to be honest I got them wore one for two days and put my beat up old Fitbit brand band back on. These are stiff have hard edges and feel pretty cheap even considering the price. The fit on the Fitbit itself isn’t the greatest lockup either. I’ll keep them in case of emergency but I wouldn’t buy them again for any reason.
5,This band replaced the band on my Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly.  No issues with band or the vendor
5,Great band just like the original band
5,It’s a solid product but they do have a tendency to separate after a year. I play sports and sweat allot is possible the cause of it separating
5,The blue and wine colors are beautiful. The band fit perfectly into the Fitbit Charge 3. They are a little stiffer than the original Fitbit band but may soften with wear.
2,They look nice but feel stick to your skin
5,Good price and great bands!!
3,Eh cheap quality. I don't wear my Fitbit tight instead let it slide on my wrist up and down as suggested and I had this wrist band disconnect from Fitbit on its own. Colors are nice but it is not securely connected to the Fitbit.
5,It's nice to have different colors and the bands fit so well.
5,Good price.  Seems like they will hold up plus there are 3 colors to change out
5,These things are pretty much identical to the original band that came with my fitbit. Definitely worth the money (they are so inexpensive!). They feel like they may even be a little heavier duty than the original. Buy with confidence.
5,Easy to switch out. The fit on my arm was good.
4,Comfortable and easy fit
5,As advertised. Time will tell on the durability but I’m more than satisfied at this price point.
5,Arrived quickly.  Everything was as expected.
4,Great replacement!
5,I purchased these bands when the original band on my Charge 3 broke. They are flexible durable and a bargain for the price.
5,These fitbit watch fit my fitbit perfectly
5,I have a Fitbit 3.  The bands worked fine.
5,Got three bands for an excellent price.
1,Out of the 3 bands that came none stay connected. They are awful. Simple actions cause the band to detach. Should've read the other reviews but was in a jam for quick band solutions. Hopefully they can redesign them.
5,These bands are as comfortable and last at least as long as the original band.
5,They are easy to attach and very durable
1,The strap isn’t made for the Charge 4. The notches that hold the strap in place are too small which causes it to fall off with simple wrist movements.
2,My original band broke after a couple of years.  The price was certainly right on these replacement bands.  However I had the same problem some others reported:  the band didn't stay attached to the Fitbit and the Fitbit fell off my wrist.  Fortunately all three times it just fell onto my lap or table and it wasn't damaged or lost.
5,I was able to get what I needed and they were the right size.
3,Only last a few weeks.
5,Just what I ordered.
5,Prompt delivery of product. Band works great and great price
5,Perfect and super fast shipping! Works great with my Fitbit Charge 3 and love the 3 different colors for a great price.
5,Since I’ve only had these bands for 3 days I’m satisfied with them so far but I have no idea how durable they are but seem sturdy.  For the price I think they are great.
5,These fit my husband’s Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly.  These were a great value!
5,Great color options sleek look and easy to swap bands!
2,First one lasted awhile before it broke.  Second one broke as soon as I put it on.Would not recommend.Just heard from seller who will send replacements.  Thank you!
2,My wife has had numerous straps fpr fit-bits for years. This was the first one to cause a pretty bad rash on her wrist.
4,Band broke these fit.
5,Like how easy it is to wear.
1,Garbage product. Broke after 51 days of use.
5,Very please with the price and super quick delivery.
5,El material ead e buena calidad
4,Fits nice
4,Replacement for broken band.
2,These bands run too big. I'm not a small person I have average size wrists these would work great for a lard male but I needed smaller band holes.
5,Love the fit bit charge 3. Gives me all I need to keep up with my daily activity.
5,Just what I wanted and was unable to find anywhere else.
5,Product was as advertised. Replaced the original bands perfectly.
1,I've gotten replacement bands before but these have been the worst ones I've gotten so far. My bands stretched out the clip on my fitbit within two weeks and now no bands will stay attached to my fitbit. Super frustrating as that's a $150 replacement I now need to purchase.
5,Like colors - very good selection for everyday wear. Soft comfortable and durable.  Easy to click bands on and off.
5,These hold up and do not wear like other replacements I've had.  Great quality in nice colors!
4,Arrived quickly and much the same as Fitbit band.
5,I have Fitbit Charge 3 band fit perfectly.  I like the option of changing to other colors.  Price was right very pleased with purchase
5,Purchased these for my Fitbit Charge 3 and they are very much like my original band. So glad to find these in my size and many colors. Love the product great description and expedient delivery.
5,Nice Job in all facets
2,Appearance is similar to the original Fitbit band but these do not stay attached to my tracker and there are noticeable gaps at the connection points. Bands have snapped off easily during normal activity so I will be returning.
5,I had been wanting a variety of colors for my Charge 3 and this met my needs.  They had a good selection of sets to choose from.
5,They fit perfectly they are just as good as the original band and they cost so much less that I can change bands all the time. I wish I had found these a long time ago!
3,Out of the three bands only two of them actually work. The two that work do so very well.
5,I just recently realized how easy it was to change out bands.  Now I can get different looks for different times.  These are waterproof and comfortable.  The price was definitely right.
5,Love the ease and flexibility of changing my bands.
3,Too sparkly flashy for me. Would be good for a teen. Returned.
1,The 3 bands look just like the original band on my Fitbit Charge 4. After removing the original band all three of the new bands will not remain connected to the device. They seemingly fit but any (and I mean *any*) amount of pull will simply cause them to detach from the fitbit device.
4,Material is pretty close to original material of the Fitbit
1,Poor fit. The band pops off randomly not a perfect fit on the charge 4
3,They fit as well or better than the original band. However they don't stay locked into the Fitbit so if you bump it too hard your Fitbit will fall off.
1,Attachment point was initially loose and after about 5 weeks quickly began becoming unattached when putting on a jacket or such. Out of the 6 attachment points three of them were faulty. Unfortunate that it was after the 30 days. If it is not a very tight fit initially return immediately.
4,Great product-color shown in picture just seemed lighter. Great price!
5,These are a good low cost replacement for the original bands. Seems to be an excellent price for a three pack: Time will tell as far as durability.
5,Cheap and work well.
5,These bands fit fine and seem to be a good value.
5,The colors and fit was great!
5,Liked easy to change
5,They’re watch bands they fit they looked good. Don’t overthink this.
5,Great cheap replacement item. Just as good as the original band my Fitbit came with.
5,These look just like the Fitbit brand bands. Very comfortable and stylish.
1,Product was damaged unable to use when it arrived late.
5,Great price great product shipped on time
5,Love ... colors great really makes my fit bit show nicely ... will purchase additional colors
5,3 different colors but all will work with my watch….
2,I found this band caused more irritation compared to the Fitbit brand bands. I wore this when doing a landscaping project and it got scraped up on a rock. After day 2 of the landscaping project the band broke (see photo with markings). (For reference I’m a 5”5’ 115lb female athletic averaging 12k steps a day.) I’m disappointed in the product but they were inexpensive to begin with. On my second band now. When they all break I will just buy a Fitbit brand band.Update- after second ban use I’ve developed a rash around my wrist.
5,They fit and feel fine. No complaints.
5,They are exactly as discribed.
5,The fitbit bands changed onto my Charge 3 with on problem. Very easy to change and I liked the selection of colors.
5,Good product.  Fit perfectly and easy to change the old band.
3,probably a good value - but I would have liked to have known that the clamps were plastic and not metal
5,Fit my Charge 3 perfectly..
1,The band does not fit securely w the device. It frequently breaks apart. Couldn’t even wear it more than one day. Save the money and buy anything else.
5,The watch bands fit the Charge 3 well. They seem like a near-identical match for the original bands that came with the Fitbit Charge 3 in different colors.
5,Stylish bands attach easily and are durable.
3,First one lasted only 5 months before the plastic band broke at the clasp. This means the three pack will probably last less than 18 months. Not very good
4,IT is what I expected.
5,These bands replaced my old band that finally cracked after 24/7 wear since the day I purchased the Charge 3 about 18 months ago. Looks and feels identical. I’m happy.
2,The bands will snap onto the fitbit but there are large gaps in between the connection and the fitbit face and the connection is loose. The bands are also very stiff.
5,Used on Fitbit Charge 3.
5,I ordered this set when my original band broke. I think these might be more comfortable than the Fitbit brand ones. Color options are great they are comfortable lightweight and flexible.
5,It came fast and the bands are really comfortable for big wrists and small ones!
5,Fits well haven’t been using it for long so I cannot comment to the durability
5,Snaps right in.  Just as good as the band the watch came with + you get two extra bands in different colors.
5,Great deal. Well made comfortable and easy to attach to Fitbit
5,Not used any of them as of yet but they look amazing and the quality seems great.  Looking forward to using them.
5,Used these bands for my Fitbit 4 fit nice and Secure
5,The original band with my Fitbit Charge 3 had cracked.  This replacement fits perfectly and was easy to put on.
4,Pretty close to original band!
5,Perfect fit seems sturdier than the original. Definitely recommend the design and variety of colors.
5,Great product
5,I didn't know the silicone bands could break but I managed it (the one that came with the tracker).  These came quicker than I anticipated and I couldn't be happier.
1,I got 3 in a pack Fitbit watch bands  The first one came off twice. I thought maybe I received a bad one. I put on one of the other ones and it came lose after one day. They don’t stay attached to your watch. Wouldn’t recommend to buy.
5,as advertised
1,The item that I received does not fit the Charge 4 as described. Unfortunately I did not find out until after the return policy. I now have 3 useless bands.
5,Excellent replacement band. As good as original.
2,The Fitbit silicon bands arrived.  Came in a pack of 3 bands as advertised.  They look really nice.  Unfortunately I just literally replaced the first band after about 1 month of irregular use due to torn silicon at the buckle.  Had expected them to last much longer than that.  Might want to review your options before buying.
3,These were a great price delivered within 2 days and easy to install and comfortable. My only complaint is that one band is slightly broken. If shouldn't interrupt the install and use however still not ideal
1,they broke easily
4,Excellent replacement quick delivery
1,Worthless.
3,1 band was great connected perfectly with the Fitbit. 2nd band fit but released from the Fitbit under any kind of pressure. 3rd band didn't fit to the Fitbit at all and was useless.
1,These are no where near the quality of the actual fitbit band. It's a harder rubber/plasitc and they  do NOT stay attached. My almost falls off several times a day. I tried two of the different colors (thinking one might be bad) but they are all the same.
4,itscfine
5,Everything was wonderful/ exactly what I wanted.
2,it comes out of lock easily.
5,So far I couldn’t be happier. Seems to be quality bands that are very comfortable. Unbelievable value at this price.
5,The colors are very nice - just as described! The fit is great and the silicone band is as comfortable as the original band. Thank you!
1,The bands are poor quality. They attach poorly to the Fitbit and they allow the Fitbit to fall off.
5,Very happy with this product. It is a good replacement for my original Fitbit charge band.
5,They look the same as the original bands that came with the watch.
5,Excellent replacement bands for the Fitbit Charge 3.  Easy to attach to the Fitbit and good quality.
5,nice fit on watch
5,They fit look and feel like the original bands. Great value.
5,Cute colors and the quality feels solid! Only complaint is that the paint seems to be wearing off the clasp a tiny bit. Still looks awesome overall.
4,A little stiffer than the original
5,So far so good after 3 days.  Good fit (small) easy to attach and great colors.
2,Only received the black and grayish indigo bands. Was hoping to replace my blue band with the one color I didn't receive. However I settled on the black instead and threw the other one out.
5,Quick delivery Quality is as good if not better than the band that came on my Fitbit.
5,It is a replacement band for a fit bit.The original broke. I neither like or dislike this band It serves a needed purpose
5,The bands are great same as the watch and I live all the different colors you can buy. Will definitely be ordering more
5,I broke the band that came with my Fitbit  so I ordered these and they are better than the original band. I definitely recommend this product.
1,About a month into wearing them they start popping off the face of my FitBit. It's fallen off of my wrist multiple times and find them unacceptable.
5,Used it to replace a second band on a fitbit.
5,Finally got the right bands for my new Fitbit. Like the colors.
5,The price was right and the fit is nice.
5,Perfect replacement for original band.
5,Perfect. Attached easily. Fitbit like new.
5,BOUGHT A 3 PACK HAVE ONLY USED THE GREY SO FAR BUT REALLY LIKE THIS BAND IT'S VERY STURDY AND WELL MADE AND COMFORTABLE.
5,They fit and feel like the one that came with the Fit Bit. They are great
5,Great replacement bands that easily snapped right into the Fitbit.
5,Worked perfectly
5,Good buy for 3 bands.
5,Replaced original FitBit band that fell apart. Looks and works like the original.
5,Fits great but make sure you put them on securely. Thought mine were but the one side came off. Most probably operator error
3,Good quality. Looks exactly like my original band. Can't beat the price!Update - have worn the band for 2 weeks and the paint is rubbing off the buckle - so sad.
5,Perfect ! Versatile fun and easy to change bands
5,I loved the colors!
5,Product is very sturdy and I love that it wears well.
5,Fit perfectly seem to be good quality.
5,Now I've got two extra bands in case one breaks. And they will break in time.  Good quality bands!
5,Easy to replace original bands. Fit perfect.
5,Exactly what I needed and delivered 2 days earlier. Great colors comfort and durability I can count on. Bands will outlast fitbit for sure. Thank you.
5,Super fast delivery. Exactly what I was expecting and for a great price!
5,Received timely. Band was easy to affix and feels like the original. Time will tell how it wears but the original only lasted about a year.
5,I love having the flexibility of switching out the bands with more fun colors than just black. It was really easy to do and the bands fit easily together with the Fitbit.
1,These bands look just like the charge 4 band that came with my Fitbit. They are attractive and comfortable. However after trying two of the three bands they disconnect from the Fitbit and it has fallen off my arm 4 times. Don’t waste your money.
5,Perfect fit.  Looks feels and fits just like the band I purchased from Fitbit only cheaper. =) win-win.
5,Comfortable and numbers are easy to read.
5,They fit better than the replacement band I purchased at a department store.
5,
5,Very nice and well made. Just like the original.
5,Good color choices
5,Fantastic well built replacement bands.
5,Works well and they last longer than the brand type.
5,A great replacement for the Fitbit watchband.  Great price too!
5,The bands were exactly the same as what came with my Fitbit very pleased with my purchase!!
1,These wrist bands do not fit!  They snap in place and seem fine but the slightest amount of pressure will cause them to detach.  This happens when I put on a coat or just flex my wrist.  I wanted to return these but I was outside the period for which I could return them.Do not buy these!
5,Excellent quality and received very quickly
5,My original Fitbit band split and these replacement bands are perfect.
5,These are great! Fit perfect like what comes with the original Fitbit!
5,I was so happy to find 3 bands. My husband is so hard on them. Now if he breaks one he has extras.
5,For me they feel just like the original. I’m a fairly big guy and they fit great. No issues
5,Just recieved them and already started using it. Perfectly fit my charge 3 for the price 7.99 I got a 3 pack. Great colors difficult decision to choose which one.
5,Fit well.
5,Three for $10 is a good deal!
5,Fit well. Easy to attach.
5,Fits my Charge 3 perfectly! Love the colors too!
5,Cheaper than going thru fit bit and now I can switch my bands around so there's less wear and tear.
3,Just a little more stuff than I like- the original FitBit bands are softer and more flexible.
5,Band quality is great.  Exactly like my original.  Love the color choices.
5,Fitbit wrist bands. Work as good and as comfortable as the original
3,The strap does NOT stay attached to the Fit bit. It keeps falling off my wrist. The connection is not reliable. This has happened with only one of the straps as I have not tried the other 2.
1,My dad picked these out and asked me to order them as his FitBit Charge 4 band had broken. When he tried to switch out the band one side wouldn't even connect to the FitBit for him to be able to wear it. I'll definitely be returning these. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Fitbit wanted like $30 for one of these. If these three last three years it was a deal.
5,Love how comfort the watch band is and how easy it was to change the color.
5,So far great. Easy to attach to Fitbit.  Pretty much like original band. Love the color choices and price is outstsnding.
5,These fit perfectly on watch piece. 3 for the price is awesome!!
5,As expected. Bought the small wish I had gone with the large but that’s my own fault.
5,Just what I needed.  And at a great price plus easy to put on.
5,Product connected as well as original and price is great for 3.  Fits well.  Only time will tell about durability
5,Loved that I can change out the wristbands since they are different colors!
5,I really likes the ease that it went on. The colors I got are great!
5,Looks and fits like the original band.
5,Comfortable fits perfectly for my husband’s Charge 3.
5,This product arrived quickly. It is durable fits as described comfortable and had a nice assortment of colors. I recommend this product.
3,Small-med is very small  otherwise the product works well
5,Exceptional quality considering the low price. They came well packaged and have held up very well. Would definitely buy again and would certainly recommend.
5,This set of replacement wristbands works as advertised and was easy to install. If required I would purchase again.
1,Had 4.5 stars at the time I had bought these so I hadn't thought to check why there were 1 star ratings. I have been looking for some affordable yet nice Fitbit bands since the rubber on my last one had since worn and broken off. I received my package and went to attach to my Fitbit Charge 3 only to realize the side of the band with the buckle on it didn't even fit into my Fitbit! I compared the two sides of the band together and realized that they weren't even made to the same size! I checked the reviews and many others have had this problem as well. I am very disappointed in this product and will not be buying from here again!
5,Took this senior citizen a bit to get used to it but was persistent and finally understand  how it works.  Really enjoy it.
5,Like the colors. Same look and quality as original Fitbit bands.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to attach and cute stylish colors
5,This item was exactly what I was looking for and it fits perfectly
5,It fits perfectly. I have a smaller wrist and sometimes its hard to find a band  that fits.  This one works in my favor.
5,Great price dames as old band
5,Very happy with fit quality and price of these for Fitbit.
5,They seem to fit fine. So far they look good.
5,The bands are not exactly the same as the original but for the price they can't be beat!
2,Really disappointed that the paint is already coming off on the clasp. That didn't happen with my original wristband that came with my Fitbit. I wouldn't buy from them again.
5,Quality product at a great price.
5,Perfect  for me
2,Bands broke quickly.
5,Had these for weeks the one my watch feels nice and flexible with plenty of fitting holes. I have the grey one on nice color. No complaints here!
2,Bands lose color fast. They work but don't look nice for more than a month or two
5,Same band Fitbit wanted to charge $19 for one! Much better price.
5,Seems to fit properly. Comfortable.
5,Exactly what was described. The colors I ordered were true size was spot on and delivery was fast! Highly recommended!
1,ok
5,Fits the device and my wrist perfectly. Will probably reorder another pack to add variety to my color choices. Very simple to interchange.
1,I went through all three bands in 6 months. The plastic pieces that allow the watch to clip in kept breaking off. Very disappointed
5,I enjoy all the colors.  Good quality.Thank you.8
5,These bands are very similar to the original Charge 3 band that it came with.
5,Comfy and slightly durable. Wish they were a little tougher but I am pretty rough on a watch.
5,Three bands for a very reasonable price!
5,Quality excellent fit right multiple cars are nice. Durability? We race bmx and mountain bikes. ... very durable
3,I am already on the second one- won’t stay in. Did I receive a bad set??
5,Virtually identical replacement for original Charge3 bands.
5,My bad broke and I ordered these to replace it.So far so good after two weeks.Good value for the amount spent.
5,Super buenas
5,As described and fast shipping.
5,Great bands with three great colors!  Great quality and easy to install!  I’d highly recommend these bands!
5,Like the different colors and easy to exchange
1,one side of the band fits nicely.  The side with the notches to made the band tighter pits onto the Charge 3 loosely and separates from the device with normal wear.  I am sending it back.  I just ordered a replacement band from Fitbit and it fits firmly into place on both sides.  I am not sure if the Charge 3 and 4 have different side attachments or the quality control in manufacturing the replacement is poor.  I am sorry this is how it turned out because I paid $30 from fibit for 1 instead of $9 for 3.  If yours fits than you are lucky.  The batch I got was not manufactured correctly.  Because it is only $9 try it.  Maybe be lucky.  If not it is no cost to send it back.  Worth the try.
5,Quick shipping and items are as expected.
5,This was a gift for a friend who has everything so I got her different color bands she seem very pleased.
3,Product great...unfotunately my watch has quit working.  Would love to know about a warranty
4,Price
5,These bands fit my Fitbit charge 3 perfectly
5,Excellent product easy to switch out.
5,
5,Quality item.  Easy to switch out.
5,These were made much better than my original FitBit band.
5,They fit!
5,Looks just like the original band that I'm replacing and I'm hoping it will last longer since the original only lasted about 6 months.
5,These bands are what they claim to be and I was able to easily replace the band. Mostly due to the FitBit design. It is like new.
3,These looked like the original band that came with my Charge 3 but they feel thicker and less comfortable with a plastic buckle that I am concerned will break. For the cost though they are ok.
5,They were great look like the originals
5,Replacement was fast and easy .
5,Like the product. It’s comfortable and not bulkiy.
4,Great product so far
5,My original Fitbit band ripped so I ordered this 3 pack.  They work perfectly.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase them again.
5,Fit perfectly to replace the one that came with my Fitbit. Fitbit one snapped while playing b-ball. This one has lasted 6 months.
5,Very pleased with the quality and price. The choices of colors was great and my Fitbit Charge 3 looks brand new again !Thank you !
5,These bands fit perfectly the price was outstanding and a great color choice.
5,Easy to clip and looks good
5,Fits my charge 3 perfectly!! Durable thus far. Love the colors!
3,Feels like the original band that came with my fitbit. Only had for a week so not sure about the durability yet.
5,Shipment arrived quickly.  Fits my Charge 4 perfectly.  Easy to put on and remove it you know what you're doing (read the instructions).  :-)
2,All three broke/separated during pick-up soccer and/or putting on and taking off coats.
5,Nice having three bands that change out easily and fit just like the original.
1,Fit on my Fitbit Charge 3 but the slightest bump it would disconnect and my watch would fall off my wrist.
5,Arrived on schedule. Took a minute to figure out how to remove the old band. Putting the new band was a breeze! Works and looks good! Perfect! Thank you!
5,Great product.... works perfectly.
5,the headline says it all
5,This band is flexible and is a great replica of the original Fitbit ban!  I don’t really know what it’s referring to when it says mobile app.
5,Replacement for old fitbit HR3 bands.  The new ones fit and were delivered on time and work just fine.
4,Fit good and right size
5,Showed up quickly and worked as expected at a great price.
5,These bands fit perfect and are easy to attach.
5,I have Fitbit Charge 3 & these bands are awesome!
5,Very durable love the colors.
3,Pay for what you get. They work but they're clearly cheap and the durability hasn't been great
5,I love the product and the speed with how it got here ai could have bought the same thing local for 3x the price .Love shopping Amazon
5,The bands arrived sooner than expected  and the slate grey was an exact match as my original fit bit band that broke. Great deal for 3 bands :-)
5,I got the bands 2weeks ago. They fit perfect  my fitbit charge 3. They are comfortable. I still cannot evaluate durability.
3,Overall the band was just as the same as original.  However after about 3 wears the band broke.  This happen to 2 of the 3 bands purchased.  Disappointment.
3,It works but does not fit tightly around the actual watch.
1,The design of these bands is flawed - the connector that attaches to the watch body is made of a weak plastic that breaks quickly.
5,Exact likeness and durability to original wristband. Awesome buy!
5,Good price good service
5,Price delivery and 3 color choices were just perfect!
5,The wristbands were as advertised and arrived in a timely manner. Swapping the bands over was trouble free.
5,just like the stock wrist band - very nice and great deal
2,After a week of use the black band is separating from the tracker. The gray and white bands don't even fit into the tracker.These are only good for waiting for your bands to arrive from Fitbit.
1,Crappy quality don't waste your money. It was much stiffer and more uncomfortable than the original band and after three months of wearing it it barely fastens to my Fitbit on one side and keeps coming off my wrist because the connecter is so loose.
5,Product as described  great band replacements.
2,The band doesn’t fit tight to the tracker.  It’s really lose
4,They were as expected
5,Very sturdy perfect compatibility...kinda rigid
5,They worked well.
5,Ordered and received next day! Works perfectly and no issues!
5,These bands were a great deal and just what I wanted. They arrived earlier than expected which was nice!
1,The connection is snug at first but then it won't stay on and good luck wearing a watch that won't stay on. I wish there was a band that would snap in a solid connection for the fitbit charge 4. This was a fail for me.
5,These came very quickly and the colors are exactly what I was hoping for!
5,I had a hard time replacing them but thanks to video I fine got it on.
5,keeps my steps
4,Easy to put on.
5,Great replacement band for the Fitbit. Love it...
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
5,The bands fit as expected and were good replacements for the original band.
5,Good product good price
5,3 bands that are just like the original band which finally cracked.
2,The bands look nice but after 2 weeks it started popping off the firbit.  I had to buy a new band to resolve the problem.
5,These bands do a good job and are a great value
5,Seem to be good.  They come easier than original ones
5,The band is comfortable and looks great with my Fitbit.
5,Worked perfectly to easily replace the ripped band on my Charge
5,I love the colors and the fit was perfect!
5,Love the colors.  Fits on my charge 3 perfectly.  Especially like the the band strap holder the slips into the band slit to keep it from slipping.
5,Comfortable easy to change nice colors.
5,Very comfortable and fashionable
5,Perfect
5,Perfect
5,Fit perfectly easy to install.
5,Very easy to replace Look like the original band
5,These bands fit my Charge 3 perfectly!  Easy to attach sturdy and comfortable.  The price is a good deal.
2,There is a large gap where the band connects to the watch. Not confident that it will hold on while exercising and it can fill up with dirt and gunk. Gave it 2 stars because the band seems like it's good quality but I'll be ordering a replacement directly from FitBit.
1,Gosh- I have never left a negative Amazon review but really regret purchasing these bands after the band that came with my watch broke.  I could not get the band to stop releasing and coming off while I was wearing it.  The watch would not stay on with this band.  I ordered a new band directly from fitbit and planned to carefully wear my watch with this band until it arrived.  I should have stopped wearing it. Without realizing it the band came off while I was doing laundry and and the entire thing went through a wash cycle.  Now I have no fitbit.
3,if it's a little tight your wrist will sweat
5,Love the value and variety it adds to my Fitbit
5,Great experience amazing value thank you for your quick delivery I can recommend this seller!
5,These arrived on time and work fine.  They are not exactly like the original one but they are close and fit the tracker..
1,These are super cheap in price and quality. They don't attach very close to the body of the tracker. There is a good sized gap and they are taller than the screen. I could live with that but the really annoying thing is where the excess part of the band tucks in to the little band provided. It will not stay tucked in. The OEM band had a little nub that held the excess band tightly. The one on this one is smooth and it can just fall off the band when not on your wrist. Stick with the Fitbit brand one if you can find one.
5,Great bands for the price colors were as pictured. The small is a little smaller than my original fitbit band but it still fits.
5,N/A
5,When on with easy.  So far no complaints.
5,I can't believe how inexpensive these were and they are just perfect!
5,They arrived quickly. They are a bit large but still work.
5,Fits perfectly. Good deal!
4,Great price
5,Pleased with my order
2,They didnt stay connected to base I came loose. Not worth it. I am thankful I didn't lose my fit bit.
5,Great price still on my first of three after 3 months.
5,These bands fit the Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly. Good colors since I got them for the husband.
5,Fits just like the original band my fitbit came with.  Working great so far.
5,Like
2,Like some people have mentioned. There's gap between the top band and fitbit causing it not able to lock securely. The edge is not even straight. The material is stiffer than the original fitbit band. It doesn't curve around my wrist so it's a little harder to put on.
5,For my fit bit
5,Fits perfectly on my Fitbit.
5,a watch band.Make writing a review an option....do not force a review!
5,I worried that the product would not be what I needed. A fear that was misplaced.
5,My strap broke on my Fitbit and this is a good replacement.
5,Fits great and smooth surface makes it easy to clean/wipe off.
3,One of the bands does not stay connected to the fitbit.
5,Great product at a great price.

5,They work great very easy to install
5,Love the fit look color and value. I bought the smaller size and it fit just as the one that came with the charge 3.
3,The bands don't hug the tracker (Charge 3) as tightly as I would like. Sometimes they come off a little too easily.
5,They arrived in sufficient packaging. Nice quality. Fast delivery
5,They are very durable abs I love the color selection
5,Very sturdy and sleek
1,the ends that clip onto the watch head do not hold.  thought it was maybe just one defect but tried the others in this pack and they were all bad.  have nearly lost my fit bit several times.
5,Just like the original. Love the colors.
2,Bought 3 pack. Price was reasonable. One broke where it attaches to Fitbit. Not durable at all.

5,These bands fit the Fitbit perfectly and are well made.
5,Very fast shipping and fits perfectly.
5,They were a bit large but the price for three was great!  Fit perfectly!
1,I have a charge 4 fitbit. I got these bands about a week ago. For the most part they work thought they don't fit as snuggly to the fitbit as the originals do nothing too bad just detracting at times. Last night i was just sitting and suddenly i felt my fitbit fall off my wrist. Turns out the side with the buckle disconnected out of the blue.Update: Dropped to 1 star. While I was weeding today it disconnected again and I had to hunt for my watch among the weeds.  If it had fallen as I was moving around I might have lost it. Bummer to lose a FitBit because of a strap that won't stay attached!
5,These bands are perfect for the choices of colors provided.  Easy to attach and remove.  Would definitely buy again if needed.
5,They are well made. Good replacement!
5,Great look and durable wristbands. Great fit and perfect replacement for the original band.
5,As described :-)
1,The do not fit correctly like the OEM bands not flexible  and not formed correctly. has a gap between the dial and band which put extra stress on dial side and caused mount to break.
5,Easy to change wrist bands.
5,Perfect fit and can't beat the price.
2,Poorly made. The band keeps coming apart at the Fitbit. I’ve had to search for  it in my bed and couch.
5,They fit my fitbit great. I like the color selection.
3,The bands are not as sturdy as some others I have previously purchased.  Band is too long for comfort and I wear large.
5,Great bands!  Fits a man just right!  Very comfortable
2,I was really excited to get these but as soon as I attached them to my FitBit I was disappointed. They did not attach as security and as tight as the original. I’m afraid it’s going to come undone and I will lose my watch. I also noticed my watch doesn’t turn on when I flip my wrist like it used to with the original band. Definitely returning.
2,They did not fit my phone
5,No issues with the replacement. I like the different colors that can be used.
5,Just as advertised

1,These wristbands do not work. They do not stay attached to the Fitbit.
5,Very comfortable. 3 bands for the price I paid for one a year ago. The white discolors easily but it cleans up great!
5,Fits a described easy to install seems durable. Good value.
5,Ok bands for the price

5,Other than some very minor differences to the original Fitbit band this is a nearly identical replacement. Same feel and fit.

5,You can't beat this price no matter the quality. They have held up fine for me.
5,Easy to snap on and off to change!  Great value!
1,The straps do not hold onto the Fitbit.  The strap came loose and I lost my Fitbit Charge.  Luckily someone turned it in at my Health Club.  I had alerted them it was lost.  My Fitbit was returned and I returned the straps!!!
5,Very easy to change. Band is sturdy and just what I wanted. Also very good price point.
5,The band that came with mg Fitbit Charge 3 broke and this worked as a perfect replacement.
5,Bands are easy to change
3,The fit and look are okay. The paint is coming off the band clasp.
1,All 3 of these bands fell off
2,Did not like the feel of these bands against my skin. Poor quality material.
2,Too much glitter for me. I was hoping the one would be more of a gold tone but the glitter was silver.
5,Band is good quality and comfortable. Happy with purchase.
5,I really like having an assortment of colors.  Each fits perfectly and looks great
5,It fit exactly how it said it would.

5,Excellent fit and they seem to be very durable!
5,Fit my Fitbit just right! It took it to another level with the colors.
3,I usually wear large but these are way to big. Constantly catching the end on everything ☹
5,Looks and feels like the original one that came with the Fitbit.
2,The band gets disconnected from the watch part.  Only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because you get 3.  But went through them in about 3 months.Just pay a bit more for a decent one.They are comfortable though.
5,They are perfect as described! Arrived quickly and a great value.
5,DURABLE AND GREAT COLOR
5,These bands fit my Fitbit Charge 3 no problems.  Very fast delivery
5,Bands fit perfectly!
1,This item worked for a short time and soon became loose and failed after a couple of weeks.  I had 3 in the package so installed another to see if I had caught the band or perhaps for some reason had a watch Charge 4 problem.  Not so.  After about two days I noted that the band was not secured tight on the watch.  I then ordered a "Fitbit" band.  The next morning as I was getting dressed I found my watch on the floor the band came loose.
5,Perfect fit for my fitbit and the price is right.
1,The band caused my Fitbit to break where it attaches to the band. Not worth getting. Cost me much more to replace my watch!
1,I was very disappointed  I don't know how it got over 15000 reviews at 4.5 stars. these bands do not stay connected to my Fitbit charge 4. I DO NOT recommend these!
5,Work great and comfortable!
5,I like i have 3 options of colors and they fit great.
5,Product was exactly what I needed.
3,I needed women small and band is too big

5,Replacement band working great
5,They seem to made well. Time will tell
5,Easy to attach and easy to clean. Fits great.
2,These bands are functional and work well.  BUT the color quickly wears off and you end up with white lines on the edges and places where they would normally rub against sleeves etc.
1,When you buy a Fitbit Charge four you get a short and long strap in the box. As a replacement I expected to get the same in my pack of three replacement straps. This was not the case and as luck would have it I got the short strap which is too short for me.The value of the product is low so not worth the effort to send back to Amazon and so I had to reorder the large size (due this week)Switching to a long and short in the same pack will save you stocking two sku's insteead of one ( more cost efficient) as well as giving better customer service.VBRIan
1,The bands do NOT have the clip that holds them to the fitbit. I had to crazy glue mine. I only bought this one because it said overnight 7am ... That did not happen
5,Fast shipping and fits perfectly.
5,Product is exactly like the original watch band.
5,Looks good and fits great!
5,For a universal replacement wrist band it fits good and fits well with the original watch.

2,This band fit very nicely with my Fitbit 3.
5,initially works fine - on ly had a week so cannot have opinion on durability
1,Returning these.  Have a Charge 4.  One side fit perfectly the other side will not -- it just doesn't go in enough to stay on. Once you connect the strap the one side pops off.  very disappointing.
1,The band fits poorly as many others have stated. The bands do not properly snap into place and are loose. Cheap quality product. I will be returning it. Amazon choice doesn’t mean anything. DO NOT BUY
3,The grey one was defective but I didn't try it until after the return window had closed :(
5,They were an exact fit.
5,These bands are identical to the ones that came with my Fitbit.
5,None
2,Ugly colors were sent nothing like the picture
1,Only the band with the metal clasp will attach to the fitbit.  The band with the holes wouldn't attach and click into place securing the band.  I tried 2 of the 3 sets of bands and had the same issue.  Not happy.
5,Great replacement for my Fitbit band that broke. Works perfectly
5,Very comfortable but the tracker slides a lot.
5,The replacement bands were exactly like the original band that came with Fitbit.  The colors were true to color.
5,Easy to change fits perfectly

5,Durable comfortable replacement bands

5,Replaced a broken fit bit band
5,For my husband fit bit 3 watch

5,Looks like original band.  Great price
5,Came in the time it was promised.  Price was very good for 3 watchbands.
1,The bands break easily where they are attached to my Fitbit. I am afraid of losing my Fitbit. I just ordered recently and am on my third band already. I would not recommend buying.
5,Only had a week but so far so good
1,These replacement bands are cheap and will not work for my Fitbit.  Since they are so inexpensive I will probably trash. I guess you get what you pay for!
5,Just what I needed for my fit bit great price and perfect fit !!
3,Beware band detaches when you don't expect it possible risk of loss
5,The color and size are exactly as described.  Work well with the FitbitCharge 3 with no problem!

5,Good replacement bands.
5,These wrist bands fit the charge-3 perfectly.
5,Good Product Good Price.
1,The bands don't attach well. They kept coming undone fro. The face of the Fitbit. My Fitbit is less than 2 years old. These bands DO NOT WORK. it broke my Fitbit.
5,Great product and quality!! Would buy again!!
5,Perfect
5,These are very perfect and inexpensive replacement bands for my Fitbit. Highly recommend.
5,So glad was able to get just wish had all black
5,Fit my Charge 3 perfectly.  Loved the 3 colors!
5,If you damage your previous bands these are an ideal replacement.
5,The bands are a bit stiffer and thinner but they are a great value.  I would purchase again.
1,The quality was lacking to the point that I went through all three bands in less time than the original wristband lasted.
2,Size is okay but doesn’t fit my Fitbit well. It doesn’t set in the attachments properly so there is always a gap. I don’t notice it during activities but it’s annoying as the gap is visually noticeable and sometimes things get caught in it. I do not recommend this product.
5,like the colors
5,My wife is happy that’s all that matters.
5,Works great.
3,The paint in the metal clasp rubbed off right away
5,I liked all three.  Was as i expected.
5,Came very quickly. Great price. Like that it comes in 3-pack with choice of colors. Fits perfectly. Definitely recommend!
5,So far so good.
2,So the bands themselves look great! However I did start to develop an itchy rash under the band. I ended up just buying the regular Fitbit brand band and haven’t had any issues since. Maybe find another or just dish the cash for the name brand.
1,Very disappointed with this product.  I've tried all three bands in the pack and one side consistently falls off.  Luckily it's winter and with long-sleeved shirts I haven't lost my Fitbit.Will not buy this brand again.
5,Love these. Very comfortable and easy to put in. Will be buying more colors.
5,Just what I ordered really missed my fit it when the old band broken so appreciated the fast delivery

5,Was so glad to find these. Somehow unaware you could change band!!
5,Almost exactly the same as the original Fitbit band!  Love it!
5,Got them for girlfriend whose Fitbit band broke. Has blue on now looks good she likes them.
5,Like
1,Almost lost watch because of the band spontaneously disconnects from the FitBit while wearing it. Luckily I felt it happen and didn't lose my watch. Would not purchase again. I got less than 2 months use out of one of the 3 bands. Changed to another one from the pack. Hoping to get better results.
5,Easy to install
5,I used for my Fitbit Charge 3 as my band had broken.
2,After my original Fitbit band wore out I bought these.  Not even 2 months and the finish is coming of the buckle.
5,Easy to install
5,Wish bands lasted longer.
1,The bands to not stay attached the the Fitbit screen/device. Randomly throughout the day my band will get unattached from my Fitbit device. Thankfully I notice it after a while and do not end up losing my Fitbit. However if I do not then I without a doubt would lose my Fitbit. Do not purchase these!!!!!!
2,Fell apart after 3 weeks
5,The value is great
1,These bands pop off constantly. The connection between the band and the fitbit isn't secure. Today I thought I'd finally lost my fitbit for good after it popped off while doing yard work.
5,Great fit durable easy to change!
1,These bands were great at first and worked well but after a few months they started to become loose and wouldn't stay connected to the fitbit.  Sad that I now have 3 bands that don't work and it's past the 2 month return window for amazon.  Won't ever buy from this company again.
5,I like the different colors of wristband so I can coordinate it with what I'm wearing.
5,Inexpensive fits well  quick delivery
1,My factory band had never failed.  It wore out.  The buckle side of all three bands all detached itself from the watch.  If you didn’t catch it when it happened you might be buying a new Fitbit!  Basically junk!
3,Bands were great at first but quickly no longer stay attached to Fitbit
5,No
5,These replacement bands have worked very well.
5,Works just like the original wristbands
5,Nice and Comfortable I like the change up from the Black band
5,N/A
5,Very comfortable
5,I love my Fitbit!! This is an upgrade from my previous Fitbit and I love it!
1,Got these to replace my original black band and they are not the same. When I try to adjust the size or dry my hands after washing them the top half always breaks off the actual Fitbit. It kept happening on one color so I tried the other and as soon as I put it on it broke off. (It doesn’t break just disconnects so I have to reattach) In fact I just pulled my shirt down while typing this and it broke off and when I tried to put it back on it broke off again. I do not recommend. Spend a little more money for better quality.
5,I like the bands they are durable waterproof comfortable  and nice colors.
5,Love the product its actually just like having the original band
5,Easy to purchase for good price. Just like the real deal!
5,I just purchased a Fitbit 4.  I like the colored bands!
5,Very good material
5,Perfect fit and nice style.
5,Long lasting. Good quality
2,Fits comfortably on the wrist but disappointed that the glitter comes off. Seems very cheaply made in that it is not embedded into the silicone band. Didn't even wear one of them and it has spots missing glitter. I would not purchase again in the future.
5,Nice feel
5,I like that the bands came in 3 different colors.
5,Thus far the ban is holding up. The ban fits well on my Fitbit
5,Looks good. Exact fit.
5,Love them
5,I have a Fitbit 3.  They are easy to change and the colors are subtle .
5,These are great bands. I like coordinating my bands with outfits. Would love some brighter color choices.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought a few of  these cheap knock offs and they all broke within a couple of months. The clasp is really cheap and quickly unsnaps and falls off your wrist outside in restaurants etc. I almost lost my Fitbit twice due to this cheap knock off. You get what you pay for. I suggest buying one with a metal clasp. Not this one.
5,In expensive and beautiful
5,Fit perfectly at a great price!
5,Quick delivery and price was phenomenal!
5,Perfect sale
1,Ordered the 3 pack of bands the ones with the glittered bands.  Love them only if they stayed on my Fitbit Charge3.  The bands come off very easily  maybe I got defective pack.
5,They fit perfectly on my Fitbit Charger3 and very easy to install.
5,These seem equivalent to the original.  Easy to install and just as comfortable.
5,Great product Great seller.
1,Keeps detatching while I am wearing the fitbit.Will not buy again.  2 of the 3 have detached.Will not wear the third as I might lose the fitbit.
1,The material for the band is very stiff and the connection to the Fitbit isn’t tight so there’s a gap and eventually the band won’t stay connected. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing because it’s cheaply made. I purchased the package of three and each band became unusable within a month because the connection was loose and broke easily.
5,It was what I expected
5,Bands work great
1,Looks fine. However I tried all 3 different bands and they will not stay on my wrist. I.e. it snaps off at the intersection of the band and Fitbit. This happens no less than 10 times per day without activity. I lost my Fitbit in an airport because it snapped off at some point while walking and someone else found it for me. I do not wear my band overly tight and had this happen 0 times with the Fitbit branded band. Would not recommend.
5,Works great fits comfortably
5,Worked perfect
5,I like the colors and they seem to be as good as the original one
5,So easy to replace
2,You get what you pay for I guess but I bought these bands in May and now the final one has broken. They all lasted about 1.5 months before breaking. It seems like they get so dirty the clip doesn't stick anymore but I've tried cleaning them out and they still don't stay attached. Don't waste your money buy a different product
5,Price right Great delivery
5,I think these were M/L bands and I didn't notice when ordering.
5,Great product snapped right on no issue exactly as described
5,Really like the bands
5,It was exactly as represented
5,Replacement bands were easy to install
5,they fit
3,Grey is more of a gunmetal in color as opposed to the space gray pictured.
5,The strap is comfortable.
5,So far so good. No complaints as of yet. Enjoying the white band.
5,same as my previous bands they last years
5,Easy to replace.
1,Not one single band actually worked. All 3 colors malfunction. They won't snap on one side into place. The band won't lock in. So you can just pull the band off when on so you will lose your Fitbit if you use this band. DONT BUY
5,Fit  perfect
5,Loved the colors of the bands I received. They fit just right on my Fitbit charge 3
5,Durable
5,Loved the colors. They are very light weight and flexible. Easy to wear.
1,I loved the colors I chose. Unfortunately the band I chose to use ( first day) unbeknownst to me came apart and someone may now be the proud owner of a Fitbit as I sure don’t have it
5,Works great
5,They fit well.  Exactly as described.
5,very satisfied with make comfort and looks very similar to original product.
5,Nice replacement bands at a crazy low price!
5,Bands work perfect with my fitbit fits great and is comfortable.
1,The bands were loose fit on Charge 3 and unusable
5,colors are great and they are easy to attach. looks great!
5,Fits well.
5,Fitbit. Perfect same as the original when I bought it. Just as advertised.
2,I have had these less than a month and I just installed the third (last) one. The other two detached themselves from the fitbit after a few days while simply wearing the Fitbit.Since I am within the return period I have scheduled a return and will now look for other brands.Entrusting a ~$100 watch to a ~$3 strap is false economy.
5,Very easy to assemble
5,The band's arrived quickly and just as anticipated. They are identical to original Fitbit band.
3,I like the bands resembles the original band.  Sizes run bigger.
1,Flew off my wrist at a soccer match about two weeks ago. And now it just falls off all the time. The connections to the fit bit do not last. Waste of money.
5,Perfect for my fitbit
5,Good replacement bands for Fitbit.
5,Exactly the same as the one that came with my fitbit but for much less $$$!
5,My husband loved the colors.
5,I was very pleased with these bands. Comfortable fit. Great value.
5,So far so good
5,Liked the replacement band for my charge 3
5,It was exactly what it was supposed to be
5,Exactly as pictured
5,I am pleased with the comfort and quality of this product.  Will buy again.
5,Love the 3 pack to change up the look. Comfortable.  Delivered very quick.
3,It easily pops open and the screen falls out.
5,The bands came promptly and were exactly what I needed
5,Replaced my worn out strap
5,They're pretty good bands at least so far after a week+.
5,Great value!
5,My husband loves it
5,Choice of colors
5,liked the colors
2,I put one on my Fitbit. It started popping off the watch. I would not recommend.
5,Perfect color... matched description
5,I needed replacement bands and these filled the bill. Pretty colors. Good fit.
5,Love them so easy to put on.love Amazon
5,They work for me. It’s was a great replacement
1,I purchased the package of 3 bands but am sending them back because they will not stay attached to the Fitbit.
2,Tried the purple band first and one side keeps popping off.  Went back to wearing back to wearing the original band that came with the fitbit charge 4.
5,Really surprised!  You can't tell the difference between these and my original bands
5,the product works and was delivered in the time they promised.
5,Excellent value.  Fit great so just hoping these are durable! Time will tell...
5,Perfect! I love the colors I chose. Easy install.Thank you!
5,Looks just like the one that came with Fitbit but extra colors
5,Comfortable and sturdy band. Exactly what is needed with a fitbit.
5,Good product and comfortable to wear.
5,These are very cute and the colors are beautiful
5,Easy to use. Just as described. Wish I would have purchased brighter colors.
5,love this band just like the original
3,A little too short for me
5,They worked perfectly.
1,These didn't fit properly like the stock band that came with my fitbit. And because of the ill fit the band would constantly pop off the fitbit. Not only that it bent the pieces they attached to.Lastly the silicone is so stiff. Not as soft and comfortable as fitbit brand.Definitely invest in getting the brand name fitbit band. Skip this.
5,Works well with Fitbit Charge 3
5,Very easy and comfortable to wear.
5,Product just as described! They are nice and durable
5,Buy with confidence the bands fit perfectly.
2,I loved the white band but after a couple months it started turning pink. Tried cleaning it with thieves cleaner magic eraser and a kitchen cleaner with bleach and nothing helped. Will have to order some sort of replacement now.Also the way the clasps fit was a little loose against the Fitbit module itself.
5,Excelente!
5,The band is very close to the original.
5,Great Price and great fit. would buy again
5,Product was as good as the original piece for a fraction of the cost.
5,The price and color choice
5,Work perfectly. I switch my bands every week to a different color
5,These are perfect and a great price.
5,My old one broke.
2,One of the straps kept coming unattached within 15 min of using it.Luckily it was a 3 pack and I should understand “you get what you pay for”
5,Bands fit correctly.  They look and feel like the original band.
3,Great colors but doesn't stay connected so it was a waste of Money!
5,All good
5,I really like this product
1,These were great but the durability is terrible. They lasted less than a week and then a little plastic piece that attaches the band to the Fitbit broke on me on each of my four replacements. I was very disappointed. My original Fitbit band lasted me for many months and did not break like these. Do yourself a favor and don't buy them.
5,Use it with Fitbit.  Love the colors.
2,I really had high expectations for these bands. For the first couple days they worked like my original one then one side started to pop off. I first thought it was maybe something I had done and ignored it. Until I had lost it again in a pool and almost lost my whole fitbit. They may be cheap but I don’t recommend.
5,Liked the band. Would like it more if it was longer.
1,The product doesn't attach to the Fitbit well at all. One side would fit and then the other half of the band would not. Tried several bands with the same results. And now I unfortunately missed the return window which was quite short.
5,Fit perfect on my charger3.
5,Very happy with product. Easy to replace and fits perfectly.
5,It fits well and appears durable only time will tell. Value for the price!
5,Matches up with the original band.
5,Pretty comfortable!  A little stiff so it is a little harder to put on.
1,Didn't stay on my fitbit. Fell off every time.
5,Exactly as pictured. Comfortable.
5,just perfect
5,Great deal for three. Fit perfectly. Nice dark colors.
5,Great! It was just what I was looking for
5,Bueno
5,Perfect!
5,Same as what I purchased before and comfortable
5,Works great!
5,Love it. And no hassle putting it on.
5,Looks and fits just like the originals.  Good value.
5,Not real happy about the stem on the closer. It a little short
5,it work perfectly and no issues
5,Colors were vibrant  very durable.  Would definitely buy again
5,Great price for three quality fit bit bands.
1,I am not sure how this band has so many great reviews.  I don't normally write reviews but this one I had to tell people don't waste their money.  The band won't stay connected to the fit bit.  I have had it less than a week because my original Fitbit band broke.  My Fitbit has come off my wrist numerous times & if I was not wearing long sleeves I would have lost my Fitbit for good!
5,Very satisfied.  The colors are what I expected and they fit perfectly.
5,Exactly what was pictured and what I expected.  Quick delivery!!
5,Great price point and we received quickly!
1,These feel like real Fitbit bands but they are crap. Everyone I have bought ends up snapping and not being able to connect at the top of the watch where it connects to the actual Fitbit. Literally all three had the same problem. The company should really just send another one for free so at least it would be a whole year of use. I bought it in June and all have basically broken within one to two months of use
5,Good product
5,easy to install nice colors
5,Great price and great product
1,The buckle side does not stay attached. All 3 are like this.
5,Product is great. It took longer to receive it than I would have hoped.
5,Very comfortable and sized just right.
5,Exactly what we needed and at an affordable price arrived in 2 days
5,Works just as advertised. Holds your Fitbit charge 3 on your wrist.
2,They didn't fit my Charge 3 and would not not connect.
5,Same style band that was original to fit bit. Work perfect great price
5,easy to adjust nice bands
5,everything is great..
5,Excellent watchband replacements!
5,Great watch it encourages me to keep moving
5,As promised quick delivery!
5,Just as expected. Fits perfectly. Nice colors
2,As soon as I bend the band to secure to my write the top end falls off.  I tried all 3 colors thinking that perhaps 1 was defective.  No success. This won't work!  I'm returning.
5,Received quickly and was same quality as original. Great price.
5,Reasonable price for three bands. Flexible and durable.
5,Perfect replacement bands for my Charge 3. 100% would recommend!
1,The watch band doesn't stay attached to the watch. If just falls off.
1,Not flexible Constantly popping off nearly losing the watch several times. The last time took a piece of the watch with it so now it is worthless.
5,Just like original band. Now I have gray blue and black.
1,The bands were so stiff that one side would not stay attached then actually broke off the plastic connector piece.
5,My original band broke. Will see how long these last.
5,Love these! They were to replace the broken band on my hubby’s FitBit
5,The bands are better than the one that came with fit bit
5,Great bands just like the original Fitbit

5,Just what I wanted!
5,Perfect fit. Great colors. Durable. Affordable. LOVE.
5,Fit perfectly on my fitbit charge 3
5,Love the colors. Very comfortable to wear.
1,Started out good but 1st band only lasted 2 months.  Something is wrong with the connection point and it separated further and further from the device.  Cleaning and reattaching made no difference.  Had to switch bands to keep from losing my FitBit.
5,They fit and are like the original that cam with my fitbit
5,Package was easy to openand it was extremely easy to replace my broken band.
5,Color and size
5,Comfortable
5,Nice replacement bands

5,Very good quality
5,Matched perfect to the Fitbit
5,Bellos colores
5,Love the color options.
5,I dislike haven to answer this question
3,Not really ‘mint’ color like I had expected...
5,Good color selection good quality.
5,Perfect fit
1,The band is thick not very flexible and sticks out from your wrist. I returned and ordered a slimmer model that was more flexible. I have size small wrists.
5,Perfect replacement for my torn band.
5,Great buy
1,The part that attaches to the Fitbit does not stay on and if you flex/move your wrist it will come off and the watch will fall off. Tried all 3 colors to see maybe if just the one was bad but all three are faulty
5,I like them very much fit great
5,Arrived in time and was exactly as I expected
5,They went on right away and I liked the colors in this group
5,Perfect
1,Band falls off with the slightest pull or catch on anything.  If you wear this Fitbit will surely be lost.  Does not even stay on while sleeping.
1,Did not seem sung
5,Super fast delivery and really nice selection of colors.
5,My order arrived earlier than expected and the bands are as described.
3,Arrived on time and I really like the product
5,Exactly what I had anticipated and received!
5,Very hapy with order (quality and price)
5,Just as described.  Exactly like my fitnit band that broke.
5,easy to replace
5,good quality
1,This is a horrible product. It snapped my Fitbit so no bands will attach anymore. Amazon issued a 5$ promotional credit despite the fact that this broke my 150$ watch and are forcing me to return the crappy product. What a joke. Do not buy!
5,quick delivery and quality product
5,They fit the watch perfectly and came the next day.
5,Fits Charge 3 perfectly!
2,The black band is fine however the silver and gold metallic ones are all glitter and as you can imagine glitter everywhere.
1,The very first day I put this new band on my watch the watch fell off my arm and I lost it. I would not recommend these bands. Now I have to spend over $100 to buy an entirely new watch.
2,Only one of the three bands worked..the black one..the others would not stay on (the side with the buckle on it!!!
5,Great deal - 3 bands
5,Inexpensive and looks great!
5,I just had to change the one side!
1,Wore one of the three bands for 2 weeks and has already broke.  Will not stay connected to tracker.  Onto band number 2 and the connection is already loose and probably will break like the first. Disappointing purchase.
1,I was thrilled to get get new straps. That is until the connection started disconnecting all day when doing nothing strenuous.  Grocery shopping cooking etc. it was good for about a month.  Then disconnecting 15 times a day. I do not Reccommend this strap.
5,Colors are perfect!
5,Great price and durable.  Love the colors
1,Sometime while going about an ordinary day @ home my expensive Fitbit fell off  while using this band.  No warning- just suddenly silently disappeared.  Looked for 2 days & finally gave up.  The bands are inexpensive so I don't mind losing that but now I've had to replace the Fitbit since I use it several times a day to more  accurately  dose insulin.  The seller said they were sorry.  Would NEVER  buy this off-brand replacement band again.  The tracker is too costly to risk losing it.  It was NOT a smart way to save $$$.
5,Very comfortable bands durable !
5,It is very comfortable to wear and it comes in great colors.
5,Works well.  Like the color.
5,Replacement band for a fitbit
1,Only one side of the replacement band would fit the Fitbit. If I could have made it work I would have. This is a design flaw. Returning.
5,The bands are what I expected and they are comfortable.
5,I really like the product. Easy to use  and instructions provided.
5,Sturdy easy to install comfortable.
5,Just as pictured. Fit great and easy to use.
3,Too big
2,Did not work for me. I ordered directly from  fit bit.
5,I like that it came with 3 bands and all different colors.
2,These bands come off the watch when you bump against things like a car door. They fit well but the clasp mechanism needs to be stiffer so you don’t loose the watch.
5,They fit very nice and easy to change
3,Band is much larger then orginal.
1,This band does not stay connected to the Fitbit Charge 4. It is not a tight fit where you snap it to the device. Returnef
5,Prices are good and they look so good.
5,These are comfortable and stylish. I am happy with my purchase!
5,The bands arrived quickly and fit perfectly good purchase
5,Item arrived quickly and is as advertised. Recommend this seller.
5,Liked the material quality
1,It’s only been a month since I ordered these and 2/3 just broke on me at the connection point. They simply don’t connect together anymore. I guess we get what we pay for I’m only buying official bands next time.
5,Meets my needs
5,My wrist feels like a million bucks!
5,quick shipping....
5,Bands are great like that I have a variety.
5,Just as advertised and fits the charge 3 perfect!
5,Same product I got from Fitbit but better price.
5,Worry free transaction. Bands fit perfectly and are comfortable.
3,Too small
5,Fitbit
5,Quick delivery and good quality
5,Excellent product. Delivered quickly with no problems.
2,The wrist band kept getting disconnected which caused me to loose my fitbit just shows how you can't trust non-original parts or replacements
5,Comfortable and stylish!
2,The white band in particular degraded after mere weeks of normal use
5,Comfortable
1,Band doesn't connect properly or securely to the Fitbit.
5,Durability
5,Nice product for the price good quality & value
2,The material and colors are ok but they don't quite fit on my Charge 4. One even came off while it was on my wrist.
5,Love them !
5,Nice hi y
5,Nice watch bands and easily fit Charge 3 Fitbit.
5,Just like my old one!! Came in a few days.
5,Love love love
5,Very good quality great price
5,I like them is what I want
5,Just as expected
2,The straps are very short compared to the original one. I had to use the very last hole in order to use the straps.  If I knew they were this short I would not have bought them
5,Product seems to be of good quality
5,Exactly what i expected & great quality
5,Exactly what I expected and wanted.
5,Works great so far.
5,Colors are exactly as they appear.
5,Works fine
5,Fit really good and nice colors.
1,You definitely get what you pay for with this product.  Doesn’t connect securely to Fitbit and they come unhooked from the Fitbit very easily.
5,I love all three bands and the colors
1,The band would not stay attached to the tracker. After 5 minutes it just fell off. I tried another band from the same package and the same thing occurred. Definitely a cheap knock off of the original.
5,It was exactly as advertised and looks like the original.
5,Great product fast service
5,loved them
1,These do not stay connected to the fitbit.  I got them and tried several at home hoping at least some would work.  There wasn't one set that both sides clicked in and locked correctly.  Sent them back for fear of losing my device if I actually ised them.  So disappointed.  I know you get what you pay for but come one not one set?
1,The part that attaches to the FitBit broke within a couple of weeks.  SO dissappointing.  I'm on my 3rd watchband within 6 weeks!
5,Fitbit strap
5,Easy to change and was a perfect fit!
5,Gives incredible versatility!
5,I love the colors and how comfortable they are.
5,Fits well comfortable
5,Recorded the replacement bands quickly and they work perfectly.
5,Item fit perfectly!!
5,La informacion que ne brinda el fitbit
1,These bands felt comparable to my original Fitbit band but would not stay connected to my Charge 3.  Sometimes you get what you pay for!  Returned.
5,I needed a replacement band for my watch
5,Good product and price.
5,Exactly what I wanted.
2,Ordered multicolored bands. Installed the pink band. It picked up the blue dye from my dark colored denim jeans. Tried several cleaners to remove the dye unsuccessful permanently stained.
5,Affordable comfortable and cute
2,2 broke where it attaches to the watch. On last one. Feel like there are 3 because they break so easily. Not as durable as the original equipment.
2,I bought these to replace the factory band after a couple of years.They are plenty comfortable but the silicone stains easily. They do the job but I wouldn't purchase again.
5,Great replacement product.
5,Quick delivery and easy to install. Very happy with product
1,Do not buy these
5,Works very well and extremely comfortable
5,Pretty nearly an exact copy of the original.
5,The wear
5,It fits like the original strap but larger
1,In less than 2 months all 3 bands have broken.  Complete waste.
5,Item was perfect!  Comfortable and attractive
5,Liked the 3 pack value
5,Pretty good quality.  And delivered fast
1,Ni se ajustan al reloj se salen.De 3 bandas 1 no se pudo poner la parte que se une al reloj es muy ancha y se sale.Las otras dos se pudieron poner duraron una semana y ahora se salen.
5,This product was very sturdy and durable ❤️
5,No complaints. Quick delivery. Quality product!
1,None of the three bands stay attached to my fit fit. Bad product. Don’t waste your time
5,Great service. Just as described.
5,Looks just like the original!
5,everything i expected
1,Bands are a very loose fit to the Charge 4 connectors - don't recommend as the band has come off several times. Tried all three in the package and the issue is the same for all.
5,Awesome
5,Perfect!!!
1,Product constantly unhooks from my fitbit no matter what I'm doing. Didn't happen with my old band. Will be replacing with something else.
5,Great product for the liw cost. Fit perfectly!
5,Great value
1,Not going to return this since the refund amount is not worth the trip to the UPS store but the chasm between the band and the movement is unbearable.
5,Great colors. Durable. Nice quality
5,Fit just like my original band.
5,Good product.
5,Worked as perfect replacement
5,Nice item
1,I'm disappointed in this product. I've had it for two days and the part of the band that attaches to the actual watch keeps coming detached from the actual Fitbit unit. I average 20000+ steps daily so my Fitbit is important to me and now I have to search for a new band. ughhhh frustrating!
1,None of the bands fit my Charge 4. Neither side click into place and stay. Poor design.
1,Doesn’t snap into my Fitbit and sit correctly has popped off my Fitbit multiple times to the point I’m afraid if I wear it I’m going to lose it. Complete waste of money
2,They don’t stay on the watch. Bad fit
5,Fits and looks like original
1,They didn’t fit my Fitbit charge 4
1,These bands last approximately 2 weeks then break. Don’t bother.
5,Great colors. Excellent quality.
5,Ease of shopping
5,They were a great buy for the money
5,Just as good as original
5,I really like the replacement Fitbit bands.
5,The price was great

5,Love them top quality! I definitely recommend these bands!
5,Durability
5,The price was right
5,Like the quality and price.
5,Everything is just GREAT!
5,They fit just rite.
1,They don't stay connected to the tracker
5,Very satisfied.
5,Good staff
1,Wow I can't believe the stellar ratings for these things. I just got them and there is a huge gap between the charge 4 and the end of the band where it attaches on both sides--about 1/8 of an inch. I can't imagine it is very secure and even if it is that's a huge gap for crud to fall and bacteria to fester. All three of the bands have the same problem. I'll be looking for something else immediately.
5,Loving the colors can't wait to wear them.
5,easy to change. Good colors. comfortable
5,Good quality for a great price.
5,Great!
5,Exactly as advertised
2,Low quality. It WILL break after a couple of months.
1,The first one fell apart in three months. The second one I tried was defective and wouldn’t attach to the Fitbit. Wouldn’t order again.
1,The band is not secure on my watch.  After about a week or so the watch starts to pop out. 2/3 did not work. The 3rd is currently working. I am unsure for how long
5,I love the colors and they were inexpensive
5,Easy to change bands; really like them
5,It’s all good
2,They did not fit. I am returning them.
5,I like the colors
5,Great thx. You
5,They fit perfect  and a lot cheaper.
5,The product fits perfectly.
5,Accurate colors easy to change.
1,They are not for fitbit charge 3
5,The price
5,Looks/feels like the original which broke.
5,Fast shipping and are durable
5,There very comfortable and good durability
5,Liked the colors.Used it on Fitbit.
5,delivery on time
5,Perfect! Just what I expected.
1,I got this because my original band cracked and broke.  I've used the off brand ones before this actual brand even but they didn't try with this latest batch.  It doesn't even attach all the way to the watch face there is a visible gap.  It keep coming undone and just flopping off my wrist.  Wasted money.
5,Good material and I loved the color options
5,Exactly what I need
5,Very satisfied with my purchase
2,The White one is horrible. Three days after I bought it I wore an old red long sleeve shirt and the red stained the white band and now I can’t get it off. Be careful buying the white band
1,The band that attaches to the "top" of the tracker continues to disconnect from the tracker. There also is a small gap between the bands and the tracker.
5,Liked the different colors. Comfortable bands.
5,Comfortable and affordable!
3,They come defective
5,Fits my Fitbit Charge 4 perfectly!
5,Fit great
5,Great value!
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
1,The band breaks off the top of the tracker with just the slightest hit or bed of the wrist. Not worth the money.
5,Fit great
5,Fit perfectly and great price!!
5,Looks great wears nice
5,Loved it
5,Like the colors
5,They feel like the original
1,We've had the 3 bands for 4 days. All 3 have popped off the two different Charge 4's and refuse to stay on. I wouldn't recommend them over the ones that can be bought from fitbit.com
1,They did not fit.  Period.
5,Solid replacements and a good price.
5,Price was great!
5,Fitbit
5,Delivered timely and fit perfectly.
5,husband loves the new bands
5,-
5,Great price fits well delivered quickly
5,Its good quality and comfortable.
5,I should of order small bands
5,Fit well look good great price
1,I ordered these because of all the positive reviews. I don't normally put up a review but the product quality is so bad I feel compelled to help others from re-considering their purchase. The band is relatively useless in that the clasp from the FitBit Charge to the band is very week and it fell off within a day of using it.
5,3 colors
5,THEY FIT
1,Bands would not stay attached to Fitbit. One band broke where you adjust the size within a month
2,The product only partly works. It's a3 pack but one of the bands doesn't securely stay locked on to my Fitbit So it's unusable.  Good thing there are 2 other bands at least one of them works and securely holds my Fitbit
1,These bands do not attached tightly or properly to a Fitbit Charge 4.  It always looks like it’s about to pop off the side of the Fitbit face and if you apply any pressure (for example rotate the watch around your wrist) it detaches from the Fitbit and the watch falls off. Don’t waste your money just got to the Fitbit website and find a replacement band there.
5,Fit perfectly!
5,Quality
5,Great product for a great price!
1,These bands were as described. I wore this set to replace my broken original band for only a couple of weeks.  The band came off the Fitbit and I lost my Fitbit.
1,Very cheaply made.  Bought the beginning of January and only a month later all three have already broken.  Don't waste your money.
1,Don't buy it. The straps just fall off they don't stay attached at all.
5,Excellent product.
5,Meets all my expectations.
5,Perfect bands for my Fit-Bit
5,Love it my Fitbit 3
5,Just as pictured
1,One came broken.  The other two tend to fall off the place you attach to the Fitbit.  Very disappointing.  I would not recommend.
2,These look fine but the colors are not even close to advertised. The blue is navy blue and the soft berry is a harsh burgundy. Bummer. Returning.
2,The white and pink were much too blingy for my taste. They are much more sparkly in person than on the photo.
1,Very disappointed with these bands! Almost lost my Fitbit watch since the band keeps separating from the watch just doing normal things like shopping at the supermarket.
2,Returned these bands as the latch was a little too short to hold the buckle securely closed.
1,The straps do not attach securely they fall right off. From now on we will only be buying from fitbit
1,If I could give it zero stars I would! The first band would not stay on. I went to the grocery store and my Fitbit fell off and I didn’t know it. Someone turned it into the office so I did get it back. I tried another band in the package and it would not stay secure. It broke the connectors on my Fitbit. Do not buy!😡
5,I like the variety of colors
2,Not secure or durable.  Separated from Fitbit within an hour of wearing.  Colors are pretty but won’t lock into place.
1,Not sure if I just got defective bands or if they really do not include the metal clip that allows it to click onto the fitbit. Tried for 30 minutes to get it to snap in and just doesnt. Left band in picture shows the clip on original fit bit band right is both ends of these bands. No clip means it won't stay on
5,Love these! Great price!
5,Good
5,just like the original
5,Great bands
1,They do look like the original bands but within the first couple weeks the paint on the buckle came off and the band started separating from the tracker.  The same thing happened to my second band.  I'm on my last band now and each has lasted around a month while my original Fitbit band lasted over a year.  I had more skin irritation with these bands.  They are very cheap but I'm walking around knowing the band will separate and fall off my wrist at any time so 3 months later I'm back researching a better alternative.
5,Worked as described. Was likevorgonal
5,Fits just like the original
1,Save your money unless you do not do any exercise which defeats the purpose of being a product for a fitness watch the band last only 2 month.  This product is junk.
1,These loose at the base and start popping off. Luckily I felt it when it fell off my arm I have gone thru 3 in 2 months.
1,Cute bands but didn't last long 1st one broke within a month
1,I’ve only been wearing these bands for three days and none of them will stay attached to the tracker. Went on a run with the black one and it fell off twice and throughout the day.The white and gray same story. They will stay attached but as soon as you do anything that requires movement they pop off.
1,This band did not stay attached to the tracker. I tied it to a rubber band to keep from losing the watch.  When the rubber band broke I though I had lost the watch for sure but it was under my car seat.  I returned them as soon as I could.
5,Worked perfectly. As expected.
2,Loved the fit and colors of the bands but they all lost connection when trying to snap on the top of the fit bit within 3 months.  I'm afraid to wear and lose my charge 3 fitbit.
5,Pleased with the product
1,Quality seemed ok but these would not attach to my FitBit Charge 3. Returned them.
1,Mine didn't fit on the top side (one with a prong on the band.) One of the bands did fit but very iffy connection no "snap" when inserted.
5,They work! I love them.
2,Very stiff and not a tight fit to the watch
1,These managed to break the fitting on my foot bit the band attaches to.
5,Easy replacement
5,The option to change colors
5,Satisfied with product
5,They were delivered as described.
1,Wore my watch out and due to the design of the cheap watch band it came off and I LOST MY FITBIT WATCH. Don't buy these please be careful when you buy off brand bands or you will do what I did.NOW I HAVE NO WATCH AND HAVE LOST A LOT OF MONEY. SO SAD!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great
5,Great price n quality
1,One of the three bands stayed on the Charge 3 other two didn’t hold on.
5,Very happy with these!
5,Nice colors nice bands
1,The clasp that connects the band to the watch face does not stay attached.  I ended up losing my Fit bit when the band failed and became unclipped.
1,Purchased this based on the high product reviews. Was extremely surprised when two days in the new band had completely disconnected from my Fitbit multiple times. Extremely rigid and stiff. Ordered a replacement and the replacement did the exact same thing. Returning for a refund.
5,Durability and pirce..👌
5,Worked well
5,Fit get and are comfortable!
5,The bands fit perfectly.
5,Love the bands.
1,Only one side of the band fits the fitbit.  The other side does not connect.
5,Awesome cheap price high quality
5,N/A
1,Terrible quality. Started using the band on Saturday and it broke by Monday. Same issue when trying a second one from the same pack.
1,I wore each band daily for about a month before one or both of the clasps broke.
5,They fit get
2,I’m a man with pretty small wrist and these bands barely fit my wrist check your measurements before placing an order for this item.
5,Liked
1,Need my money back.  Bands popping off with light use only
5,Love the product!❤
5,It was perfect.
1,I bought these for my Fitbit 3! Did not stay on watch for long! Fell off!
5,Looks great with anything!
2,The band's look nice and feel good but they do not stay snug on the fitbit charge 3.  I had to super glue them so now my wife can only use the black.  The other color bands sit in the box.
1,Came in a pack of 3...I see why! The bands snap in pieces at the pin where it attaches to the watch. Already used 2 of the 3 bands in the first week!
5,it was fine
2,Two of the bands did not snap tight. Continued to come undone
1,One arrived brokenOne does not stay fastened to fit bit keeps popping offOne I’m using
1,This does not attach flush to my Charge 4 and repeatedly detaches.  Not recommend.
5,Like wrong size
1,I tried one band and it came off the watch.  Put another one on and it seemed to work.  I figured the 1st one was just a manufacturing flaw.  But my watch fell off without my knowledge and I lost it.  Do not recommend.
5,Comfortable
1,Doesn't fit the charge5
5,Works great
1,Item started loosing color soon
1,2 bands broke within months of me wearing them.
5,Like
5,Perfect!!
1,I should have believed the other reviews that said to keep scrolling.  I'm on my 2nd band and while they look and feel great now 2 bands have continually detached from the top of the tracker.  I'm just lucky that the weather's been cool and I had a jacket on or I definitely would have lost my Fitbit.  Sending these back.
5,Comfort and sturdy
1,Cannot use these bands because they react with my skin.  That did not happen with the original fitbit band I replaced with these.
1,The holes are so stupid. I tried to put the FitBit inside the holes but won't even attach. How it was designed was so stupid. I ordered the glitter ones and it looks so cheap like the manufacturer just sprinkled glitter on top.
1,All three bands have broken where they attach at the Fitbit. The hard plastic inside is cheap and breaks.
1,They DO NOT fit the Charge 4.  They sent me bands that only connect on one side of the Fitbit.  Comeplete waste of time.
2,Wrong size.....need to return.....right size already ordered
2,Black band (which is the one wanted to use) would not attach on one side.
1,These bands are terrible.  I have to replace them every couple of months.
5,pick this!!
1,They broke after 2 days!
1,I'm so sad to report that the band wouldn't stay attached to the Fitbit. It seemed secure; I tested it by tugging gently this way and that and then later it fell off twice within three days. Luckily I was at home both times and didn't lose my Fitbit. Otherwise the bands are beautiful and comfortable so I'm disappointed that they didn't work. I am returning them.
1,The strap lasted for a week and after that there was a gap between the watch/device and the strap and it was not locking back in place. Don't waste your $ and time on this.
1,I have other bands for my Charge 4 but I couldn't even get it latch on. As I would go to pull it on my wrist it would pull off.  If I could give it 0 stars  I would.
5,As advertised 😆
5,Good Quality
5,Exactly as advertised
1,Two of the three bands do not stay attached to my Charge 3. I ordered a replacement and the same thing occurred. Other bands work for my Fitbit fine so I know it’s an issue with these bands and not my Fitbit.
1,I got these one the large is VERY large.  Lol.  Another thing on side snapped on and stayed on just fine.  The other side snapped on too loosely and kept falling off all the time.  I mean multiple times in one day.
2,I had a skin reaction. I never had it with the original Fitbit wristband
1,Poor product...Advertisment said the bands fit a charge 3 fitbit.  They went on correctly but did not hold to the fitbit for more than 1 hour.  I tried all three bands and the same problem appeared each time.
1,I cannot recommend these at all- tbh I did read reviews on them and this was cited as an issue for some who purchased but gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried them. Therefore would not recommend.
5,Thank you
1,Does not fit watch
5,Fitbit band
1,Unfortunately the watch strap broke after less than a month if use. My firbit hit the pavement and chipped the face I don't trust the others will do much better.
5,Great fit
1,Returning this item because I don't want to lose my watch!  None of the three bands attach securely to the fitbit charge III as advertised.
1,I was excited to get this 3 pack of different colored straps to change up to match my outfits or mood. Unfortunately out of all three only the black fit my watch. The rose gold and the wine colored straps just popped right off of the fitbit. I kept the pack anyway since my old watch band snapped in half and I desperately needed a new one. The black one will have to do.
1,When I workout with weights the band unhooks from the watch. It happened on one and started to use #2 and same thing happens. It would be easy to loose the fitbit. My original fitband lasted a couple years I will be spending the money to buy another band from fitbit. This was a waste of money.  Just happens when weight training.
1,Inferior product does not stay attached would not recommend
1,Bands fit but one side would pop off the fitbit.
5,Nice fit
5,Just perfect
5,Love thanks
2,Bought these less than two months ago. Am already on third band as other two broke. I do not switch bands back and forth nor do I take off Fitbit often. Poor quality.
1,Band falls off poor workmanship
2,The bands do not stay attached to the Fitbit.
5,fitbit
2,It will do but it does not hold tightly and comes off easily.
1,Continuously falls off and doesn't stay attached
1,Product appearance and comfort was OK however the bands would not stay attached to the fitbit base.  All parts were clean and undamaged.  My original band locks in place and does not come loose even with a significant amount of manual pull.  All three of these bands would come loose with a slight pull or movement.
5,Perfect!
1,Seemed pretty much like original band for Fitbit Charge 3.  However one side kept slipping off of the Fitbit so I pitched them all.  Couldn't take a chance on losing my fitbit.  Definitely not hapoy with them.  I ended up getting a nylon band with velcro.  Problem solved!
1,Does not stay attached to fitbit.  Will fall off wrist easily.  Would not recommend purchasing.
2,This item had three bands. One out of the three is defective. Other two are questionable.
2,These bands do not stay on. They just keep popping off and I keep losing my watch.
2,6/1/2020 Update...One strap already broke. Order placed 4/22 broke 6/1. Just a FYI. the plastic piece that snaps into the watch is weak.. so prepare for failures. Onto strap 2 of 3 now.
1,Junk. Bands popped off my watch within minutes of putting it on with simple wrist flex ion. Tried one of the other color bands which held slight better but popped off both in my sleep and while doing push ups. Safe the hassle and buy something else. Not worth the time or money for this product.
1,I was happy to be able to get a pack of 3 colors but unfortunately the connection on 2 of the 3 bands was too large and did not 'click' onto the fitbit device - it just kept popping off.  One of the bands did fit and I chose to keep the pack just for that one band.  Vendor appears to have quality control issues.
1,All three bands broke in a total of three months.  The catch that attaches to the watch broke on all of them.
5,Pretty colors
1,I went through all three bands in less than two months. And I don’t even wear the watch every day.
2,product should be capable of comfortably wearing on their ankle.  My wife is a small woman but this product is too tight to wear in this manner
2,Easily stained and broke shortly after use.
1,Very loose connection which breaks so easily. Not worth the money at all.
2,Band broke literally in the first five minutes of me wearing it
4,Bought in Feb. '21. Used first of 3 pack until Aug. '22 when the strap started to disconnect from the "watch". The material was fine the attachment mechanism stopped attaching. So for $3.33 I guess a year and a half isn't bad. So if the next two each last a year and a half I'll be satisfied.
1,The bands do not stay on. Keep falling on. One of the three were same side wrist band
1,These bands are not durable. They come apart at least 3 times a day. Regret buying these.
1,First I started with the red band which kept on disconnecting from the watch face so my watch kept falling. Then i switched to the black band and within 2 days the buckle detached from the rubber part of the strap. I was literally in the hospital talking to a patient and it went flying into the person's face! Do you know what kind of a hazard that is!!! These are terrible wish i could give a zero.
1,Jive
1,Not all bands attach to body they keep coming undone risking losing fitbit
1,The product breaks easily.
1,I returned this product because the bands would not stay attached to my fitbit charge 3. I ordered a different set from another company and so far no problems. I would not bother ordering this product.
2,Band became loose after a few hours wearing my Fitbit Charge 3. I found the Wepro bands worked better and did not loosen.
2,Easy to attach and use. Part of the band broke within a few months. Order from a different company that will last.
1,I received my items promptly sadly they do not fit. They are too lose where they connect to the side of the fitbit. So I am unable to use the product because they will not stay attached. Fall right off. Sad I have to go through the trouble of returning them.
2,They looked great but would not stay attached to the fitbit 3.
1,Too big I thought I ordered a small
1,The plastic is so cheap and it is not flexible at all. Every time I tried to put it on my wrist it popped off because it couldn't bend properly. I would get a better quality band even if it is more expensive than this pack.
1,These bands are not safe because eventually in about 5 months one of the sides comes off of the fit bit and you lose it.  I have had this happen to two of the bands but fortunately found my fit bit because I was at home.  I’m in a quandary to know what to buy but definitely not this brand.
1,All 3 bands in the pack keep falling off and don't secure all the way to my Charge 4. Not worth losing it for I will be looking for something else.
1,Initially I was very happy with the bands as they looked just like the fitbit band and seemed to fit just the same. But they have not lasted at all. My fitbit band lasted a year - the first one of these lasted maybe three weeks and then the second one had the same problem only after two weeks. The packaging says 100% satisfaction and to contact them with issues. I did this and never heard anything back. Definitely do not buy.
1,They don’t fit!
1,The size is not accurate as it is much smaller than expected.2 of the bands came damaged as I could not hook them up so only one of the bands worked.
1,Where the band fits into the charge 4 there are gaps on both sides. I worry it will come apart and I will lose my Fitbit.Would not buy again.
1,The click doesn't really work and it somehow comes off while you are wearing it. Today it fell off without noticing and I lost my Fitbit. Ugh -_- I have two extra bands but now I have no Fitbit to connect.
2,Love the bands very comfortable and fit well.... but the metal parts lose the color in as little as 2mos. Especially if worn 24/7.
1,The clasp broke and fell off while I was walking without any warning and six weeks after I received it... and one week after I could return it. I should have just paid full price at Best Buy. Disappointed 😞
1,Bands kept popping off of the part that connects to the Fitbit.
1,Total piece of crap.  Broke within 24 hours of extremely gentle use.  Stereotypical Chinese product.  Just buy the real thing and save yourself a few bucks.
1,The first band broke within the first couple weeks of use the second band broke in 2-3 days. I am on the 3rd and in the process of ordering some new (different) bands because I am not confident this will hold. They both broke in the same spot; the plastic that connects the band to the unit is weak. I do have a very small wrist which could put some Extra pressure on that joint but I would still expect them to last longer.
1,The dont stay hooked up.
1,Have only had this band for 5 months and already it consistently detaches from the Fitbit.  Twice it has completely fallen off my wrist.  Would not purchase this particular band again.
2,Lesser quality than the original band and that one broke after 3 months. Also now my Charge 3 screen doesn't light up when I twist my arm.
1,The bands do not connect to the Fitbit charge 4.
1,Disappointed! It broke within 2 weeks.
1,I bought this for the mint colored one which only last a month or two before popping off easily. The gray one was missing the pin that holds it in place :(
2,I have small wrist so these are way to big for me
1,
1,After having the band detach from my fitbit at home a few times I have lost it while shopping today just walking around! I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. My Fitbit was an expensive investment and I wish I would have taken to heart the warnings about the bands. Buyer beware.
1,Each breaks after two weeks light use.
2,The band frequently pops off of the Fitbit.
1,What happened to the metal clip to lock it into the fit bit?
1,These replacement bands are problematic because they do not seem to stay attached to the Fitbit.  On two occasions the band let loose and my Fitbit fell off my wrist.  The spring in the attachment seems not to be strong enough to hold it.  Not a good thing!
1,All three of the bands that I purchased broke within two weeks of wearing. The clasp around the Fitbit wore down. Waste of money! Poorly made product.
1,Lost a Fitbit!! Doesn’t hold well at all!!
1,They don’t stay connected to device and I would not even give this one star.
1,It breaks off at the connection to the fitbit after the first few days. Will not buy again
1,The same side on all 3 bands didn't attach properly and fell off. I wondered if it was my fitbit but the old band is fine and the opposite end worked fine. I returned them.
1,None of these bands would attach to my fitbit charge HR securely. Purchased a replacement band from local store that fits fine. I believe these bands are defective.
1,Extremely poor quality.
1,Strap consistently detaches from the watch throughout the day. My wife and I had this same experience with this product. Don’t risk losing your Fitbit
1,The band kept popping off where it attaches to the Fitbit.  Finally it popped off when I was sleeping…sadly the dog found it before I did and now I need a new Fitbit!
1,The band it’s self feels comfortable and like the one that came with the Fitbit. But these ones keep popping off the Fitbit itself like they don’t snap all the way in place. I tried the other two cause it came in a three pack and they all do it.  Kind of annoying when your working and the watch falls off over and over
1,Ordered this to replace the original band that had broken. After 8 days it fell off without me noticing and now my Fitbit is lost forever.
1,They were nice bands but they wouldn't stay attached to my fitbit.  The one side clipped in firmly.  The other side would not stay on. Had to send them back.
1,Complete crap.  Immediately kept popping loose from the fitbit.  Switched to a second band.  Same issue.  Now my fitbit screen is broke because the band popped loose while walking and the fitbit dropped.
1,Band broke after two weeks of normal use.
2,The size must not be standardized because even at the smallest size it was very big.
1,I was disappointed that the band did not fit my Fitbit 3. Now I have to return.
1,Got the 3 pack with the black gray and navy bands. Each of them had one end that would not click into the Fitbit Charge. Returned and refunded.
1,Why does Amazon recommend a lousy product like this?  None of the three bands I received will stay connected to my FitBit.
1,Band did not stay closed. Separated at watch face my Fitbit fell off and I never found it.  Had to buy a new one.  Won’t be buying another.
2,Pop off ends
1,The description says it is for women. I can’t imagine what size wrist a woman has  to have in order to wear these bands- they are huge.  There is not a slot that extends to the end so I cannot use them.
1,The bands fit my watch poorly
1,I received this 12 days ago and it is already fading. The color will not stay on at all. It is also very loose when attached to the actual Fitbit which it should not be loose at all.
1,Big gaps where it attaches to watch
2,Had these for 2 months. The second band just broke wheee it attaches to the watch. Need something more durable.
2,Only lasted about 3 months. Band stared to fall off watch face. No good.
2,Only one of the bands would work. Two of the three wouldn't stay connected to my fitbit.
1,2 of the three bands won’t snap to the Fitbit one that snapped broke in 2 months . Bet disappointed.
1,Bought this three pack to replace the wristband of my current Fitbit Charge 3. None of them fit (one side fits very good the other doesn't hold). Has to return
2,They are cute colors but after only 4 days the clips stopped working and my Fitbit would randomly fly off.
1,Very disappointed with these. The side with the hook does not connect well and keeps randomly disconnecting from the face.
1,All 3 straps kept separating from the FitBit device.  Returned for refund.
2,The bands on all three would not stay attached to the fitbit. Only one side would stay connected
2,Clip broke in 3 months on 1 of the straps after normal wear. Disappointing quality.
1,Only the buckle side of this replacement band fits my Fitbit watch. The side with the holes doesn't. I've tried all three bands and they all have the same problem.  And the buckle side is a very loose attachment.
1,I bought these bands in a size small to replace the original band on my Fitbit. I wear my fitbit everyday all day. This band broke within a week of me wearing it consistently. The connection between the band and the fitbit was wobbly to begin with. And then connection completely broke and the band won't stay on at all anymore.
1,I was really bummed that these bands did NOT fit my Charge 4. The colors where fun and sparkly but had to return them.
2,Not the best but works
2,Band is very comfortable but navy won't stay clipped black works so hesitant about product
1,They don’t stay clipped. Wore it for an hour and nearly lost it 10 times. Eventually put it in my purse so I wouldn’t lose it.
1,Only half of these worked.  By that I mean that for each of the three bands only half would stay on the fit bit.  I ended up using half of the new band (which was the part that was broken and half e old band which looks ridiculous). I guess you get what you pay for.
1,These bands did not stay connected to the Fitbit as described. Wore for about 2 minutes then they would fall off and would not connect securely again.
1,This product is a joke and COMPLETELY worthless.  Buyer beware: you get what you pay for.  Amazon should be embarrassed for carrying this crap.
1,Durability: two of the three bands already broke within a few weeks. The plastic in it is very fragileComfort: it doesn't feel much different from the original but it irritates my skin. I now have some itchy bumps around my wrist.I've been wearing Fitbit for a few years and tried different bands. These are the worst
1,It broke off my wrist within one month. I don’t recommend
1,these bands look nice and at first I thought they were perfect. but I have had them all but two weeks and the bands broke and caused me to lose my fitbit. these are cheap. not even sure it it is worth it to return the rest. now i have to buy a new fitbit.
1,I tried all three bands on my fitbit and none of them stayed connected to my fitbit charge 3.  Disappointing.  Returned.
2,These straps fit my Fitbit beautifully!  Very happy with the colors and how quickly the came:)
1,Terrible band my fitbit pops off all the time after only one day of use.  I'm definitely returning these.  Cheap but doesn't work.
1,They sent me a second set to replace the first ones but they all keep coming off the fit bit device.
1,Did not fit my Fitbit properly. Waste if time and money… consequently I’ll end up buying a new Fitbit
1,The fact that the seller put a used band in with the new ones is pretty disturbing. BUYER BEWARE!!
1,These bands detached from my fit bit several times and the last I almost lost my fit bit.  They are an inferior product and I will be returning them.  They should not be on the market.  DO NOT purchase.
1,Only been a couple of weeks since I got these and my Blue band is starting to fade and you can see the white underneath the band! These bands are really cheaply made buyer beware!
1,The bands are made of harder plastic than the original and they do not stay securely attached to the fitbit monitor unit.
1,For awristband what else can you use it forOne side fit ok the did not fit at all had to glue it. It was the side with out the buckel
1,I'll get my bands from Fitbit.
1,Bands will not attach. Fall off. All 3 of them
1,I wore one watch band for less than a week & it is already tearing where it buckles.  Will try another one to see if it is any better.
1,Product is worthless lucky I purchased a 3 pack to get me thru until I find a better band.
2,Too big
1,Replacement band. Doesn't fit.
1,doesn't connect well with the tracker will fall off constantly
3,These bands are almost the same as the original that comes with Fitbit except for one fairly important detail - it doesn't stay attached to the Fitbit. I've had it pop off my wrist a few times now. The connection seems to get worse with wear. The first couple weeks it was fine but then I noticed it started to separate from the Fitbit when I was putting it on. Now it pops off if I put any pressure on the outside of the band. Still the quality of the band material itself is good.
1,This band would not fit my fitbit. It was about 2 millimeters to big. I tried and had several others attempt. Very disappointed.
1,2 of the 3 were defective - only 1 would actually latch onto my charge the others wouldn't stay on. Very poor quality.
4,Ordered as replacement for the original Fitbit wristband.  Nice to be able replace wristband without replacing the whole watch.  Reasonable cost with two other replacement bands.
1,I purchased a 3 pack and 2 of the 3 bands have broken and no longer attach to my Charge 3 after only 3 months. The plastic portion that connects to the device has cracked and no longer clicks into place. I do not recommend this product.
2,durability not good
1,Disappointed that after just a few weeks of wearing this one the paint is already worn off and it becomes loose at my Fitbit so they do t stay connected. It fell off while I was sleeping one night and the buckle was still together.
1,It doesn't stay together. It falls off if i bend my hand at all
1,All 3 of these bands don’t stick with my fitbit charge 3. The short band doesn’t secure with the fitbit device. I made the mistake to try to make it work and my device dropped and cracked. Returned on Day 1.
1,Does not attach solidly like a “real fitbit” band
1,I lost my fitbit the first day I attached your new band and I am so used to wearing it I did not even know it had fallen off until the next day and I have not been able to find it since. So sad!
1,It simply did not fit and was a waste of time and money.
1,The band kept detaching from the tracker device.  I cannot recommend this product.
1,Only one side of one of the sets attached securely to my Fitbit Charge 3. All the others came off while I was trying to tighten the band on my wrist. Returning immediately.
1,Dislike
1,I wore the band for less than 1 day and the color immediately started rubbing off and fading.
1,I thought I was receiving a good deal but these are not worth the money.  The bands are very poor quality.  I've had 2 bands break already.  Each one lasted about a week.  Very disappointed in the quality of this product.
1,For some reason these bands won’t stay connected to my Fitbit.  Kept falling off!
1,The bands were too small and there was no mention of the actual length in the producy info.
1,The bands worked fine for like two days and then the top band kept popping off. I am afraid I will lose my fit bit. Why does this happen?
1,I can only use one out of three of the bands because the bands don’t stay on. Disappointed.
1,Band fell off fitbit. This never happened with the original band but happened within days of using one of these bands. You also can tell it is a little loose connection when it connects to fitbit.
2,Not as good as originals
1,This band has fallen off my fitbit3 twice in the week I've had it on. I'm trying the second in the package but am concerned they all may be faulty and I put at risk my fitbit. Maybe you get what you pay for.
1,The band won’t stay connected to the charge 3 therefore is keeps falling off!!! Afraid I will lose charge 3 or break it. Now looking to purchase from someone else. Will never purchase from this company again!!!!
1,I returned these because I should have ordered bands for a FitBit Charge 2.
1,Keeps coming off
1,If you wear your fitbit to bed then don't buy these as the strap joint would lien up and completely come off in 3 to 4 days.  It happened to 2 of the 3 straps until I figured out the cause.
1,Poorly designed.  It became undone while doing yard work without me noticing and I lost my Fitbit.  I wouldn’t not recommend this item.
1,Does not fit Fitbit Charge 3
1,The bands pop off the fitbit easily. I can't use them as I don't want to lose the fitbit.
1,The angle that these attach to the body is sharper than the OEM parts. Not ideal
1,It wasn't durable and kept unwrapping and I lost my fitbit while walking
1,Doesn’t flush with side of Fitbit. Disconnects constantly. Too stiff. Will return.
1,I finally opened my pkg after awhile. The band on 2 of the straps do not lock on to my watch. I waited too long but at least one set works.
1,I bought this 3 pack of bands and it lasted 2 weeks before the first one cracked and broke. Save your money!!! It is now a month later and the Second one in the pack broke. Very disappointed in this product.
1,Keeps popping off my Fitbit and now have lost my Fitbit. Terrible product.
1,Looks good but all 3 bands did not stay connected to my Fitbit charge 3! Very disappointed!
1,They keep coming off the  Fitbit Charge 3
1,Out of 3 bands NONE would secure to my Charge.
1,The band has already started to fade after a couple of weeks and the rubber slide/loop that keeps the band down is too big so it is constantly moving around which keeps the band from staying down flat
1,Arrived quickly. Looked and felt exactly like the original however the band has disconnected and fallen off twice already in a week.  Fortunately I have found the Fitbit both times no confidence in the band anymore.
1,Ugh they don’t fit my charge 4.
1,Broke my fitbit piece.
1,This is supposed to be a replacement band for the fitbit charge 2. There is no metal part inside the bands that are supposed to click onto the tracker. There  are 3 in the package all three are defective.
1,Does not stay attached as it should...
1,The band will not stay attached to the watch.
1,The band doesn't attach properly to the Charge 3 and pops off constantly.  Don't buy.
1,These look great but don't fit well.  The original band you have to work to disconnect these are very easy to remove with a simple pull.  I am returning so I don't lose my fitbit.
1,They would never snap. Had to return. Still have not gotten money back.
1,They won’t attach to a charge 4
1,Had to return bands. Did not fit charge 3 fitbit
1,The latches never stayed connected
1,Will not stay connected to my Fitbit Charge 3. Would return  but return window is closed.
1,Huh
1,Felt like cheap plastic.
1,Bands for Fitbit charge 3.  Only one strap attached itself.
1,One of the band pieces would not clip securely to the fit bit.  However the seller did promptly refund my money.
1,Not even one of the three bands would connect to my fitbit. Found another band on AMAZON for $8 and it works just fine.
1,They do not fit tightly and constantly pop out
1,I am not really quite sure what this watch band is made of but it has broken out my wrist as you can see from this photo I am not happy at all with this product
1,Did not stay on my fitbit kept falling off my wrist. Loose connections.
1,The band is smaller than the original small band that came with the Charge 3.  Almost any movement causes the band to unclip from the watch.
1,It says small … but its the large one. Fail
1,Lost a Fitbit because it just fell off my wrist.
1,The bands did not fit securely to my fitbit and detach too easily.
1,They did not fit properly connecting to each side of the fit bit itself. Always coming apart.  Would never purchase this product again.
1,They did not fit the Fitbit charge 3. Had to get a refund. Let’s hope the next one I ordered fits
1,I ordered small size and they were too large.
1,These bands did not work for my charge 3 Fitbit. What a waste of time.
1,Doesn't fit the FITBIT Charge 2; no metal connection.
1,product does not fit on the charge3
1,Didn’t fit I sent it back.
1,Doesn’t attach properly. The band came off while I was wearing it. It was lucky I didn’t lose it.
1,Loss of Fitbit!!  Unacceptable
1,The bands did not have the metal part on them that should connect the band to the watch.
1,Recieved items on the 27th didnt open package till the 28th None fit my watch. Return date was the 29th.(wow)Learned my lesson.Customers need to know about the quick return.Very unhappy!!
1,Poor quality. Not attractive.
1,
1,This product gave me a rash after wearing it for three days. The official FitBit strap never did that and I was wearing it for over a year washing it every day.
1,Didn’t fit charge3
1,The bands do not fix properly with the watch
1,I purchased these bands in July.  Today December14th the second one broke.  I am very disappointed in this product
1,These bands leave the skin discolored after wearing. Will look for better bands. These are junk!
1,Would not work with fit bit.
1,Not durable!!
1,Bands were advertised to fit my Fitbit watch but did not.
1,I would like to return as it will not snap into my Fitbit charge three
1,Unfortunately did not “click” to secure band to tracker tried all 3 bands. Tried original band “clicked” no problem. Seemed like decent quality for the price.
1,These bands don’t last more than two weeks. One side detaches and will not attach and stay on again. Delivered June 3 2020 and two band are now useless.
1,For durability these get 1 star. The attachment to the fitbit piece is plastic and flimsy. Mine broke within a few weeks.
1,All 3 of them don’t stay fastened to watch. I know there cheap but no good to me! I almost lost watch when it came off.
1,Fitbit keeps falling off as the connection of the band to the Fitbit is not secure enough.  One side keeps falling off.  Disappointed.
1,Doesnt fit waste
1,Wouldn't stay attached so I returned it.
1,Did not fit my Fitbit Charge 3. Band would not stay attached at all.
1,These are very poor quality bands the clasp and band started to discolor after a couple of weeks of use. AVOID
1,First band I tried was so poorly manufactured the band kept separating from the fitbit.  Can't use it for risk of losing the fitbit.
1,The bands dont stay connected to the fitbit!  They pop off too easy when laying my wrist down on a desk or just with movement
1,I wore the purple one and within a few weeks of wearing it my Fitbit fell of. I contacted the seller and the never replied
1,This doesn’t fit the watch well it falls off all the time. Really poorly made
1,Getting skin irritation
1,Arrived late and one clasp did not hold when inserted.
1,Band twice became disconnected from FitBit while wearing in only a couple days.  Not a money saving option if I lose the FitBit
1,Does not work for a fitbit charge3. Band is not correct size nor does it clip on. Very disappointed.
1,They did not attach or stay on at all. Waste of $ and time
1,Junk. they break right where they attach to the Fitbit. 2 of 3 broke in under 30 days we'll see how long the third one lasts.
1,
1,Not even close on size ordered a small and they were huge even big on my husband
1,Trash
1,Horrible not deep enough to allow a fit
1,Strap broke 2 months after I purchased it.  And I’m not overly active - I just walk and think hard about exercimg.
1,These bands did not fit my Charge 4.
1,Item described did not fit my Fitbit charge 3 as stated
1,Although it looks the same as my original Charge 3 band the connectors were not wide enough to latch onto the watch.
1,It did not fit my fitbit 4
1,These bands will NOT stay attached to the watch. Used all 3 and each one come detached. Junk.
1,I lost my Fitbit bc of these bands. Kept falling off and I’m devastated
1,Any movement causes the bank to unclip from the watch.
1,The clasp finish pealed within a week and the band broke in less than two weeks. Very poorly made
1,The bands did not fit mt FitBit 3
1,The bands wouldn't work with the device and there aren't any instructions about a return with the package.
1,Black one lasted maybe a month and broke ☹️Gray one broke in a few weeksDon’t buy them
1,Great colors... But they don't stay attached... Lost my watch
1,ONLY ONE OF THE BANDS WOULD ATTACH.
1,Should have known price was too good to be true. The bands do not stay affixed to the fitbit.
1,Cheap. Wristband piece that connects to the Fitbit broke within a week of wearing.
1,Not usable
1,It broke when playing volleyball.
1,Wouldn't connect to my Fitbit at all
1,Will not latch to my Fitbit charge 3. lol - made in China...
1,They do not fit a Fitbit charge 3 even though they advertise it does
1,Do not buy! Very cheap. I lost my Fitbit on day 1 with this. Horrible.
1,These are not at all compatible with FitBit Charge 3. They shouldn’t be advertised as such.
1,Bands themselves were descent at best but over a week for delivery is unacceptable for Prime member
1,Product too large
1,These are cheap — and each one broke within 2 weeks. So they’re cheap and cheap.
1,Missing the metal piece that connects it to the Fitbit. Total ripoff. I do not recommend
1,The bands are so fragile and cane loose after 15 days...bad quality...will not buy again
1,Very disappointed
1,Broke after a day or two
1,Too big
1,Broke on the first day
1,Band is cheap hold down broke in two days
1,The band would not click to into place On the Fitbit face
1,Way too big
1,The band's do not fit my Fitbit charge 3.  So disappointed
1,The band popped within two days his Fitbit was lost.
1,There is no clip to hook the bands to the Fitbit. Returning.
1,wouldn't stay on the watch. had to return it.
1,The band's did not connect securely to the fitbit.
1,Cheap design. Doesn't snap onto FitBit Charge 3.
1,Break easily . All 3 broke within weeks.
1,Didn't stay on my Fitbit will return
1,Did not fit my charge 2 even a bit
1,It doesn't fit my fitbit charge 3
1,Does not fit my device
1,Wow horrible they break and don’t stay on
1,They simply were not comfortable.
2,I am reluctant to give this a rating beyond 2 stars as it has only been about 5 days since I received product.  Check back with me in a year or so.  I would expect the product to last longer than a year.  While I love my Fitbit the fact that the bands do not hold up is disappointing.  So lets see how long your products last.
5,Fit perfect fast delivery
4,It's a good replacement band for the worn out original Fitbit one.
2,Se me desprendió y cayó mi reloj el primer día q la usé 😕
2,Band won't stay on
1,My old charge 4 band broke/split. It was the original that came with the device & lasted a long time. I purchased these replacement bands from Amazon & none of them stay attached to my Fitbit charge 4. I have almost lost my device numerous times - the band releases constantly with or without movement. Do not waste your money on these as they are an inferior product.
5,I used half the new band to replace the broken portion of the original one and I can’t tell the difference. As for durability too early to say but buying 3 bands should extend the life quite a bit.
5,Excellent and easy to replace
1,I bought this 3 pack bands for my Fitbit Charge 3. I only wanted the black ones. The band with the buckle was loose fitting and kept coming off by itself. This purchase was a waster of money.
5,Got these as a replacement for me and my sister's fitbit straps...even though she uses a small they fit and work perfectly and we can change the colors to match our mood or clothing
4,At the end of the day it’s a wrist watch band it seems just fine.
5,This was a great value and a nice change up from the standard black band. These are a bit more stiff but fit perfect and work just fine. All three have a slight fun shimmer to the appearance.
2,The bands keep disconnecting from the tracker itself - I thought the first band was a fluke but the second has also disconnected several times while playing hockey leading to my fitbit going flying across the ice. I should have paid more for better bands.
5,The product was received as advertised.
2,Doesnt stay secure item detaches on its own and falls off your wrist
1,Bought these for Christmas. By February 2 of the 3 bands had worn down/cracked plastic and wouldn’t stay latched. Will be trying a different brand once the third one wears out.
2,These work in the loosest definition of the word. They don't connect properly to the FitBit body though so you're left with gaps at the top and bottom. I haven't had them actually come off but it certainly looks and feels like they might
1,Band broke off the fitbit after less than a month.  Went to put another one from the same pack on and it won't stay attached.  Buying more right now but not this brand.
5,Look great. Colors are what was shown
3,The quality appears great but they don’t stay on my Fitbit. Disappointed.
1,They look great & I started with the navy band & I am so lucky that I have been where I realized my Fitbit flew off my wrist.  One time it clunked on the post office floor. After it happened 3x's I tried the gray & it is happening again. I'm disappointed.
5,Perfect. Just as described.
1,I’ve had these about a month and all three randomly disconnect from the tracker causing the FitBit to fall off. I’d return them if I could.  They look nice enough but the quality is awful.
1,This band looks fine but it doesn’t stay connected to the tracker. I finally tied it to a rubber band so I wouldn’t lose the watch.
5,Was a perfect replacement and easy to change.
2,One buckle was broken on a strap. The straps seem to be good quality and delivery time was meet. I’ll be returning this due to the broken buckle.
1,I received these replacement bands today. The original FitBit band snaps on securely and stands up to stressors like getting caught on strap of backpack. These replacements snap on easily but disconnect just as easily with even minor pressure. There is no way I'd use them ... way too likely to lose my FitBit when the band disconnects. Do not buy this product.
1,I purchased the three-pack mid September 2020.  I have used two bands as of this date October 31 2020.  The connection side with the clip stretches over time and falls off.  I have lost my FitBit twice due to the band falling off.
1,Did not fit on the Fitbit as advertised
5,I was really expecting a cheaper knockoff of the band that came with my Fitbit Charge 3 but seriously it's exactly the same as the original I swear. I've looked all over it compared to the old one and can find zero differences - if you were to shuffle them I don't think you'd know which was the original.
5,This was a good cheap replacement after my original bands broke. I’ve had this for several months and I think the quality is slightly lower than the original that came with the watch but it’s reasonable for the price and for getting 3 colors for sure.
4,Beware these do come in two sizes! I was purchasing quickly at work once my original FitBit band broke and didn’t realize I ordered the large which was way too big. Luckily I was able to return and get the correct size!I love the colors of these and I wish I would have bought them a long time ago...I feel like I’m wearing a new watch everyday when I switch out the colors and I can wash and let the bands dry while using a new one. They are pretty close to the original band that came with my watch I find the material to be not quite as soft as the original band but I’m still happy with them.
5,I bought these as my original band started to tear after long use.  I have a Fitbit Charge 4.  These bands are inexpensive but fit just like the original with the same length and fit. I washed the band before using it and have been wearing it for about 24 hours now with zero issues.  Seems very well made and is very comfortable. No negatives to date.  If anything comes up I will edit this review. Good product and great value.
3,These bands say they are compatible with both Charge 3 and Charge 4. However I tried the blue and gray bands and they did not fit my Charge 3.  The black one fit my Charge 3 so that's good enough for me.  My original 3-year old band broke and I needed a new band.  As long as one fit and the price was around $5 it was worth it.  I will hold on to the extra bands for when I finally upgrade to the Charge 4 maybe they will fit that one better.
3,My Fitbit band broke after over a year of wearing it everyday so I bought these. They are fine but a lot less comfortable than my Fitbit bands. They seem like a harder material and they are less bendy. Also my fit bit band closes right onto my charge 3 but these leave a tiny gap in-between the Fitbit device and the band (where they connect) and it bothers me. The connection is fine it just looks weird. Overall I am still happy I got these because I needed them but not the best.
4,I had to buy these to replace the band that came with my watch which was about to split in half. I purchased the "Large" size because I wore the larger band that came with the Charge 3. I used about half the available spaces on my original band. When I put this new band on I had to go all the way to the last opening to fasten it correctly. Just be aware and measure your wrist before you buy.Otherwise bands look great and feel good!
5,It's nice that it comes with three different colors and they look just like the original one the watch came with. The quality is good and they attached easily. Awesome value for the money
5,Just received these Saturday which was a fast processing & shipping.  They are lovely bands and fit my Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly with no gaps. It attaches easily and holds until released via the release button as it should. The quality and colors are great! You will love the quality of these bands. Thank you.
5,This was a replacement band for my Fitbit 3. It is well made and snapped right into place. It is easy to change colors to fit my outfit of the day!  Reasonably priced  and good quality a winning combination!
5,Only had the bands a week or so and have only used on of the bands.  But so far it has held up well and is very comfortable.  The band is soft and flexible and the clasp holds very well.
2,Put new band on and it broke in less than a week. Am using one of the others and it keeps coming apart from the fitbit.  Ordering something else. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my fitbit
5,Fitbit bands never seem to last. I got these for my wife and she loves them. They attach easily and are comfortable.
5,My husband's strap broke on his Charge 3 so I ordered this pack of 3. He had no trouble attaching the band to his fitbit and now has the option of changing the colors. He loves the new bands! I also bought a set for my son and he loves them too!
5,Seems to do the job and is attractive
5,Bought to replace the original on the Fitbit Charge 3. It's as if it was the original band. Easy to put on.
5,Fits my fitbit charge 3 PERFECTLY! The colors are also SUPER cute!
5,Mine broke from excessive wear and needed an immediate replacement and these arrived the next day and it was an exact replacement
5,The colors are amazing and the bands were a perfect fit. The product arrived incredibly quickly. Thanks much!
5,Much better pricing for these bands as opposed to the official FitBit store....$25 for one is highway robbery when you can have 3 for much less. Durable and just as good as any official band...I highly recommend these to anyone looking to replace their original band.
5,This band was very easy to change. I love the choice of colors. Appears to be able to hold up well.
5,These bands are much more durable and sturdier than the ones that come attached to the Fitbit. They hold well during the day and workouts. I change them out to keep it interesting but all of them seem practically new despite months of use.
5,Loved the price and 3 colors. Great purchase!
5,These were purchased for my husband.  His original band broke and he was pleased with having a variety of colors to choose from.
5,Muy buena calidad. Se ajustan perfectamente al Fitbit Charge 4.  Buen diseño. Bonitos colores.
5,The bands were a fabulous purchase for a really good price. Too bad the Fitbit didn't last much longer after the bands arrived.
5,These fit perfectly on my Fitbit Charge 3!  And the look like the original!  Plus i got 3 of them!  Great!!!
5,The hole to connect the band is a stress point. Lucky replacements are easy and inexpensive.
5,Reasonably priced replacements for my Fitbit. No problems!
5,These bands are exactly the same as what came with it when I bought it. They’re easy toReplace and I love the option of colors.
5,They are what I expected.
5,These bands are fantastic for less the a 10th of the price of other brands Thanks supplier for a great product at a great price
5,Very attractive and product was as described.
5,The bands were cheap on price but not quality. The bands fit great! Can’t beat the price.
5,They are like the original that came with the fitbit.  Too bad can't get the color of band that came with it.
4,Looks great and prefect but it feel a little stiffer than the original. Maybe I just need some time with it.
5,These bands are great. They are just like the ones that the Fit bit come with. Great Price too. I totally recommend these to anyone searching for these type of silicone bands.
4,Not as rigid as the Fitbit original could be less durable.  But at this price I am willing to take chance.  The band is keeping the Fitbit on my wrist doing its job.
5,service was quick and great price.  I have it on my fitbit right now.  easy peasy.....Thanks
5,Great product
5,Very happy with purchase! Comfortable fit.
5,Perfect fit I don't know if it is a Fitbit product or not.
5,These bands fit perfectly and look just like the one that came with the watch.  I am very happy with the colors and quality.
5,Unbelievable product and the price was just the cherry on top!
5,Snap on! Snap off! Great fit and easy to use.
5,Perfect fit and price!

5,The bands fit just as well as the original band.  Good inexpensive buy.  I enjoy that I can switch color bands.
5,Work great with my fitbit
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,N/A
5,Difficult to know how the band will hold up since it was just received.  It is comfortable to wear but not as flexible as the original one from fit bit.
5,Perfect. Just like the original but a fraction of the price.
5,Great product comfortable durable and great price.
5,Exactly as shown
5,Great buy

5,Very sturdy
5,Love it!
5,Fast shipping! Great experience 👍🏾
5,Gigi love her it
5,Good quality and fast delivery
5,Did what it is suppose to do!
5,Awesome
5,Cost so much less and I got 3. Fit is fine.  Comfort is close enough to original that there is really no detectable difference.
5,These watch bands fit secure and look great I am very pleased with this item
2,I bought these as a replacement for the original band from Fitbit which started to break after 18 months of continual use.The bands easily and securely connect to the Fitbit. After two months of use I noticed that the paint on the clasp was wearing off. A few weeks later the connection point of the band broke causing the Fitbit to fall off. Half of the plastic connection point was stuck in the Fitbit and required tweezers to remove it before I could attach a new band.Does it work? Yes. Is it worth the cost? Maybe. Will it last long? No.
4,I gave this 4 stars because it came in 24 hours and a large wristband is better than no wrist band.  This is advertised to fit up to 8.5" but actually will fit 9"-9.25". If you're a woman with up to a 6.5" wrist DO NOT get "Medium" size.
5,Nice product
5,A good value for a comfortable band that attached easily and stayed locked in.
5,
5,As advertised
5,The look good they were a snap to install and inexpensive. I like having 3 different colors.So far so good. My originals lasted 14 months. Since I have 3 of these I expect about 4 years or so before replacing them.
5,My watch looks new again.  I really like the variety of colors.
5,It's a good replacement for my Fitbit3.  Included 3 bands.
5,Works exactly as advertised
5,looks good and perfect fit
5,Easy to attach. Good color options.
1,Loose connections and band would not stay on.
5,Colors and ease of installation
5,Bought these for my son and he can easily put on and take off. Colors are great.
5,I have purchased this product before.  Changing the band is a piece of cake.  The bands also wash easily should they show that they have been worn for awhile.
4,My original Fitbit strap disintegrated after 18 months and I found this pack of 3 replacement straps for much less than the cost of a single strap from Fitbit.  At first I was skeptical as the strap did not appear to connect securely to the watch however over a week later it has not come apart and is doing the job very well.
5,It works…
5,These bands look and fit great!
4,These are standard replacement bands that work great for the price.
5,Great as the original.
5,Works good installs super easy. Appears to be identical to the Fitbit one only lots less expensive.  Hopefully it won't tear at the buckle as fast as the Fitbit one did.  Thumbs up.
5,the bands came on time and they are easy to use just snaps on plus they are durable and comfortable would definitely recommend themespecially if your fitbit still works but your bands are old and worn
5,Fit perfect and love the band
5,Beautiful Rose Gold Glitter Band for FitBit Charge 3! Three bands for nine dollars- what a deal! I saw some reviews of people complaining about how long the bands lasted but seriously nine dollars for three bands? I don’t care how long it lasts they are beautiful. Also the glitter does not come off and shed so don’t worry about having glitter everywhere
5,This was a sporadic buy but I was very impressed with the way that it fit.
5,First they actually arrived on time! Second they look good. Finally they fit like they are supposed to fit. A good buy!
5,The colors matched and they connected to the watch with ease.  I would purchase again.
5,The band on my Fitbit charge 3 broke and I wanted to replace it as soon as possible without spending a lot of money. I bought this set of three bands in size small. The bands arrived the following day and I am very pleased. The band was easy to install comfortable and is almost an exact match to my original band. I have been wearing it for a week and so far so good.
5,Three bands for a great price.
5,Received product promptly and as described for Fitbit 3. Colors are all very dark as stated. Comes in package of 3. Pulled off the original band and the new one snapped right into place. Can’t attest to durability as only used for 2 weeks. So far so good.
5,Easy to replace old one
5,Bands were fine. Fit my fitbit perfectly
3,These are cute  but they don't look the same in person as they do online. I thought the material itself was glittery but it's actually glitter on top of the material.  It seems like it's sealed so I haven't had any fall out  but I imagine as you wear them the "coating" breaks down and the glitter will start to wear away. Also 2 of the straps didn't easily stay attached I had to fool with them a bit to make them "catch".
5,just what I needed and wanted
5,The bands are perfect. Large size as advertised.
5,Good value for money despatched in a timely manner
5,Just what I needed
1,I wore one of the bands for a week and lost my fitbit walking around the city today. Never felt that secure. I do not recommend this product.
5,These fit perfectly on my Charge 4 Fitbit and are as comfortable as the original bands.
5,I like it
5,Quality and service
3,doesnt always stay clipped in.
5,It is common for the band of this style of fitbit to fail. Usually multiple band replacements before the electronic tracker itself fails.
4,Easy replacement
5,Great feature is to have wrist bands of multi-color that can be quickly and easily changed dependent upon clothes you are wearing!
5,Good product as advertised.
5,Fits and wears great
5,Fits my fitbit charge 3 watch well
4,The colors are great and they get a lot of attention.  However as soon as you replace your old band you'll notice the difference.  There is a small gap at the point where the band and the fitbit connect.  You'll also note that these are made with a slightly more flimsy plastic than the original FitBit bands.  After all these are so inexpensive you can't expect them to be the same as the originals.  I could not find my replacement bands so these will do until I decide to purchase more originals.
1,Was hoping to have spare bands. The first one was fine but eventually wore out. The other 2 will not snap and stay. They just pop right off
3,Scratchy on face cannot wear glitter band at night.
4,These are for my husbands Fitbit he goes through like a band (worn out) every 3-6 months; So great price for this 3 pak!
5,La durabilidad es relativa la correa no duran más de un año. El plástico se cristaliza y se parte la correa.
1,My original band broke so I ordered these. The first one I tried kept falling off. I almost lost my watch in a sink full of water. I had to return. Product did not stay fixed to my Fitbit. Disappointing.
5,Great value. Seem tobe as good as original. White does not stay clean. I would recommend them.
5,fits good
5,I love them and the price was good
5,Bands work great
5,The bands were great.
5,I absolutely love my new silicone bands for my Fitbit Charge 3. Quick & easy change out not to mention they are so comfortable. The best for an active individual like myself.
5,Very nice! And the price it's amazing :) !
5,The Pack 3 Silicone Bands for Fitbit Charge 4 is great. One side of my Fitbit Charge 4 band had broken and I needed a replacement. The Silicone Bands are nice and seem durable and at a low price. Really nice colors as well.
5,Let's just call this what it is - a 3 pack for less than $9 USD is super SUPER cheap to replace the stock Fitbit band which normally sells north of $15 USD just for one band.  They look almost identical to the stock band fit just about as well into the clips and feel almost identical.  Having 3 different colors to mix things up is nice as well.  Buckle does feel a bit cheaper though (almost like plastic) but at this price it's hard to complain.  And for those folks who say they're getting rashes be sure to wash the bands with soap and water before wearing for the first time - problem solved.
5,Perfect replacement for the original
5,Easy to replace and keep my Fitbit going. Quality for the price paid. Originally ordered a large and it was WAY too big but the small size fits perfectly.
1,Tried all 3 bands and none of them stayed connected to Fitbit charge 4. In fact it ended up breaking my Fitbit due to so many times trying to connect the bands! Don’t waste your money!
4,Easy to install comfortable and looks good
5,It works as well as the band that came with my fitbit.
5,This fit my husband’s fit bit. He really liked the colors.
5,Fits like the original
5,Works well with Fitbit 4 - 2  blue and 1 black - wish it had been 1 glue 1 black. anmd 1 grey.  Assembled perfectly
5,Great watchbands.  Easy to install.  Fast delivery.
5,exactly what i expected
5,Bands seem to be good quality and a great value compared to the much-more-expensive replacement bands available directly from Fitbit.  They arrived promptly less than two days after I ordered them.
5,I have ordered several different fitbit bands over the last year for myself and family members.  They work great are consistently good quality and arrive quickly.
5,Had to buy a new band for my fit bit.  Love that I was able to get the exact replacement color slate grey.
5,Great colors! Quick delivery.
5,Great product for a great price!
5,To replace 2 broken watch bamds for my family.
5,Got these for my boyfriend he loves them.
5,Good value
5,Love the ability to change bands and these are sturdy and easy to swap out. Love the volors
5,There are 3 bands which look exactly like my former Fitbit band.  I don’t know yet about durability but the price is certainly attractive compared to the price on the Fitbit website.
5,This fit my Fitbit perfectly and was very easy to install!
5,Worked great to replace bands.  Worth the money.
5,Great bands
5,Just what I needed
4,Not a lot of difference from the original band which tore. My biggest complaint is that if you put pressure on the top connection it comes loose from the device  but the original band did the same so that's design flaw not a failure of this product.
5,Great band but tends to weaken and break in about a year and a half if worn 24 hours a day. Can't complain though the price was good.
5,These were easy to install and fit pretty well (they stick up just a tiny bit from the face of the Fitbit).  I'm happy with them.
5,Easy to replace original band.  Delivery was fast.
5,His other band broke
4,Has a metal class instead of plastic.
5,Would have liked 3 black bands but price for just 1 was still ok.
1,Product shipped quickly and looks nice. It’s not near as flexible as the original band but is comfortable. The bands arrived on 12/8. I started with the grey band. It wasn’t flush with the Fitbit but did lock in place. The plastic that connected with the Fitbit broke on 12/22. It lasted two weeks. I put on the black band. It appears to fit better. Let’s hope it lasts longer than the first band. Each band lasted approximately two weeks before breaking. Save your money and buy a band from Fitbit.
5,Very comfortable and fit well.
5,These bands were a gift but my sister loves them. She has not gone a day without having it on.
2,The Band Separated from the FitBit while sleeping.  I understand this is an ongoing problem.  Glad it did it while sleeping and not while out exercising.
5,The Fitbit bands were exactly what I wanted.  As the seasons change I'd like to have a band that coordinates with clothing.  The black Navy & wine colors will be perfect.
5,What I expected
5,Quality is good.....Very Durable so far.  Thanks Amazon for free Prime shipping!!!
5,Excellent product
5,After the band that came with the Fitbit broke I found these.  The price is great especially compared to what you'll find on the Fitbit website.  And it's nice to have three colors to switch up.
5,The band feels and looks like the original one.
5,Easy to change out.  Good quality.
5,More glimmering and solidly silver slightly less sparkly than I thought this is also a more substantial and durable-seeming band than I was expecting especially for the price. I was torn between silver and rose gold but find the silver goes with more and I think it has a classy quality. I was afraid this would be ridiculous but it's actually a lot of fun! Enjoy. It fit my Fitbit perfectly I think I have a charge 3 but not sure.
5,Love it
5,Love it
5,Love it!
5,Exactly what I wanted just ordered the wrong size. Went back in and ordered the correct size and its perfect. Durable for all occasions and workouts.
5,Replacement band my fitbit charge 4
5,Wife really like it will last longer than factory. She is very protective of her fitbit and 24- 365.
5,Replacement bands for my Fitbit
5,There is nothing to dislike the ban is comfy and fast delivery
5,Like everything
5,Came fast and fit good
4,These only have one play is part to figure the band into. I do prefer the ones with two. But worked well enough
2,It looks off the strap is tool long and the slots for the strap stay are way too far down the strap and away from the fitbit. Bad knock off.
5,Great Product.
5,Easy change correct fit
5,I bought these replacement bands  for my Fitbit Charge 4 because my band had broken after an entire year. I picked this set because I loved the colors included. I read the reviews and saw that some people had said they did not fit their FitBit properly however these fit the FitBit Charge 4 perfectly. Now I have only had them for less than a week.  If I have Ann problem with them I will update this review otherwise I highly recommend them for a FitBit Charge 4.
5,Good and comfortable
5,Looks just like the photo. Band is very much like the original fitbit band.
5,These are very much like the original bands.
5,Bought these to replace my cracked band on my Charge 4. Easily replaced and appears to be holding up ok. I bought the 3 pack because I figured I’d need another one at some point. The set of colors worked for me.
5,Looks exactly like the old fitbit band thati replaced and fits really well. Also came with 3 different colors. Highly recommend
5,Very sturdy wrist bands.
5,Bought for mom who's current band was too large. Got this installed and its perfect for her slim wrist. She loves the colors in this group of 3 bands.
5,very nice and durable comfortable
5,Very durable and sturdy! I wore 24/7 and only took off to charge!
5,Bought to replace a broken band from my Charge 3. For all intents and purposes looks to be of about the same quality as the original; so no issues replacing the broken one.
5,Reasonable price for the quality
5,I received it in one day and I like the colors
5,Product arrived on time and in perfect condition
5,I had the Fitbit One for years and used a clip because my wrist had an allergic reaction to the fitbit band. I loved the clip. Unfortunately after years of use the end piece broke off. Shortly after that fitbit died. I now have the Inspire BECAUSE I knew I wanted a fitbit that I could use with the clip. It seems solid and like it will last a while but hard to rate the durability after only a couple of weeks of wear and tear but so far it's great and I would highly recommend.
5,Bought these to replace the icky black one that my FitBit came with.  I like the colors and it was super easy to change the band no tools needed.  Should have ordered small but the large work on the last slot!
5,Original wristband broke. Quick delivery but no instructions. Many on youtube. Quick and easy to replace. Works like original.
5,These bands are so affordable and make it easy to switch up frequently.  I like to change my bands often since wearing everyday they get so yucky.
5,Easy to switch out and durable
5,The band looks just like the original and the price was right.I did notice the band is slightly stiffer than the original Fitbit band but overall happy with my purchase. I would purchase again.
2,These bands look great and fit well; however they break at the connection point very easily. On average each band lasts 2 months under normal use. Each of my bands have broken while sleeping. I don’t think these bands will hold up well in any contact sport.
1,I've ordered many bands like this and they have lasted me months this set I never left the house
5,My old band broke and I kept the Fitbit on with a rubber band as I can’t live without my Fitbit. So I needed a replacement quick. I had previously ordered spares but they wouldn’t go on. These came in two days and popped right on. So easy and no incidents since.
5,easy to install fit perfectly
4,I figured out how to click the band on that I was having trouble with. a bunch of trial and error. hope it stays
5,Just what I was looking for. 3 new bands for my Fitbit 3 charge  fall colors
5,Finally Found One That Fits
5,They all fit like they are supposed to and works like a charm.
5,Cute colors and same great fit
5,arrived before expected. fit is perfect
5,Fits well and very comfortable.
5,Good Quality for an affordable price.
4,Fits my charge3 so far so good
5,Comfortable band and easy to replace
5,Got these bands to replace a broken band. It fits perfectly!
5,Very happy with purchase.
5,perfect fit on charge 4
5,No comments
5,I bought my Fitbit years ago and unsure of model. These are exactly the size I needed!
5,Work great on my new Fitbit Charge 4!
5,Love these. They're perfect.
5,Comfortable bands. Easily changed with the Fitbit 3. Very durable.
5,My original FitBit band broke and the second band that came with the device wasn't even made for my model. Amazon delivered three bands in less than two full days and got me back to being healthy. The one issue - and it's not with Amazon -is based on other reviews I ordered the 'small' versus 'large' bands. My FitBit barely fits.
5,—
5,Awesome as expected
4,Gets dirty easily but hard to cleanBuy it’s great fits great also like the 3 pak
5,These are good vans and compatible with Fitbit. I’ve bought other brands and they ended up snapping off of the Device.  So far so good with this one.
5,Nice replacement bands for charge 3. Pretty purple color!
5,Easy replacement
5,It is a good quality. You get exactly what is in the description.
5,Arrived in time exactly what I ordered and very satisfied.
5,I had trouble getting it to stay attached at first like others have said but I noticed it was the tracker not the band because the one I'd taken off wouldn't stay on when I tried to put it back either. The clip on the tracker was dirty and I scraped stuff out and it attached fine.
5,matched the items description
5,I like the variety of the colors especially the red one.
1,The black band would not stay attached to tracker long enough to even get it on. The gray one is staying attached so far but would hate for it to come lose and I lose my fit bit. Makes me very uneasy.
5,Good quality
5,Na
2,Quality is good but they only have one size and it is too large.
5,My Fitbit band broke after 3 years. I found this 3 pack replacement and so far so good. I like that I am able to interchange colors as I please. Purchase price was very reasonable. Color combo is perfect. Item as described.
5,Purchased based upon other reviews had a little problem getting the old band off.  Fit great and seems to hold up well.. have had it on for a week. Very nice and great price.
5,This is for my wife and its Good quality.  Feels good nice and comfortable.  Fits good.  Love the colors.
5,When my Fitbit Charge 3 band broke I was shocked. I looked on their site and at local resellers for the same replacement but couldn’t find. I must admit I was skeptical about ordering this product because it wasn’t a FitBit brand but I was able to find the same color I had which I really like. So far it’s held up and is durable. I ordered a 3 pack (black navy & gray). It was delivered on time. Now let me get these pandemic pounds off!!
4,Low price for 3 bands but you get what you pay for. The only reason for less than 5 stars is that the fit of the band onto the Fitbit tracker is looser than original. The band does not sinch tightly to the tracker leaving a hairline gap. We'll see in time if they pop off. I could have paid $20-30 for Fitbit branded bands but the original failed within a year so I'm thinking it's not a value play.
5,Looks and feels just like the OEM band. Plus I have some spares.
5,The quality was outstanding.
5,super nice and comfortable full recommended and for the price buy it you will not regret it!
4,As far as I can tell these are of equal quality to bands sold by Fitbit.  My issue is that there was only one size available and the bands are very large.  I had to punch a new hole in the band and cut off excess.  If you have a small wrist like I do this is an issue.  I wish they would give option for either large or small the way Fitbit does.
5,These are perfect and it my fitbit just right. Not problem.
5,So easy to order and receve timely delivery! App is excellent
5,I love these bands! I like to change them a lot! Very durable!
5,Looks like an original. Great colors.
5,We all know we will be needing these in time  I highly recommend them!!
5,As described. Fits my charge 4.
5,This shipped quickly! My band broke in the middle of a challenge. I was able to get this next day and kept on stepping.
5,My original strap cracked.  These fit perfectly.
5,works great
5,Great replacement for Fitbit band after mine broke.  Very comfortable and durable.
5,They are longer than the bands that come with the Fitbit making it more comfortable and adjustable.
5,It is attractive and durable
5,Love these charge 4 bands.  Great fit and beautiful colours. Thanks
5,Fit great and look good
5,Great product!
4,The color choice and price was spot on but the clasp that slides back over is a bit loose which makes it get caught on clothing and such more than the original band. Overall happy with the purchase value for cost is definitely there.
5,These bands appear to be the same bands that came with my Charge 2 Fitbit.
1,This product looks and feels great. It snaps right into my Charge 4. However all 3 completely disconnected with light wrist activity. Even came off while sleeping. I cleaned out my watch face with rubbing alcohol to make sure that I got a good connection. Still popped off with any wrist flexion.Would be 5 stars if it worked.
5,I love these bands . They fit my Fitbit 3 perfect!!
1,I really wanted to love these but they do not last. I purchased a 3-pack in October 2021. By January 2 I was putting the last one on. The other 2 broke (and both in different spots). I don't wear my Fitbit in the shower or to bed. I am not sure if taking it on and off is what caused the bands to break but also... it shouldn't?If you do order these here are 2 other tips: I ordered large because my wrist measured about 7 inches. They were BIG. I always had it on the 2nd or 3rd notch from the top. I probably could have gotten the small one. Also order a dark color like black. I got the white/mint green/pink pack and they were always filthy despite wiping the band down daily.
5,They fit perfectly and was cheap to get three of them. Shipped fast
5,Fantastic
2,Hard plastic not comfortable I don’t expect it to last long.  As cheap as they are what do you expect.
5,This product performs as expected.They are looooong and will work for someone with a large wrist.I consider myself to have an average wrist and I have it on the second hole....so quite a long tail for me.Construction and materials are of high quality.
5,Great colors and easy to switch out
5,Nice replacement bands look and feel just like original band.
1,The band was rigid and never right on the physical watch.  After about a week it completely fell off my wrist.
4,Liked  It is been used in a Fitbit Charge 4
5,Easy to install. I should got the small band but these work fine
5,You can't beat this deal if you need a new band for your Fitbit. Same quality as my original band in three colors and they fit perfectly.
5,Great product perfect fit for my Charge 4.  very happy and pleased that I now have band options.
3,The colors are fine. The band itself it quite stiff.  The black band is not as stiff.  Maybe it’s just the sparkly ones.
5,Very happy with the bands for the price. It really does look and feel like the original band the fitbit came with. I also like how the metal clasps match the color of the band instead of being silver. Bought the small size which fits perfectly.
5,Works and fits perfectly as described
5,Good product
5,Good quality shipped quick
5,This looks just like the original band that came with the Fitbit.
5,My other band wore out with in 2 yrs. I love the color bands I change them to match my outfits
5,Loved the colours  it's not too bright .
5,These actually look feel and connect like original bands that come with the device I highly recommend for a direct replacement or just to spice it up and add a little different color to your day  price was very reasonable shipping was fast !!!
2,Seemed good at first but they don't stay connected and keep coming apart. Not worth it if my Fitbit falls and breaks and this happens during rest.
5,It fits and is a great replacement
5,Nuff said.
5,Very satisfied!
5,As described looks just like the old bandas described
5,Very comfortable but a little large.
5,You don't buy this for extreme comfort or style. I got this because my puppy chewed up my first band then my next cheap one broke. This already has paint on the buckle stripped off but it's cheap almost too small for my big wrists; talking comfortable setting it has three notches left. But it's a three-pack so I don't expect this to last ages but considering the official one didn't last very long and costs way more I call this a deal. No one is looking that close to see the buckles paint came off and it seems close enough to the original ones that they can't tell the difference; not like most care that much about the band.But if you broke your original this is a great cheap deal so far still on the first one but I got two more if this fails so that alone makes me like this product. Don't buy this for style. Buy this because your lifestyle means you are shopping for a replacement for the band you broke not new bling.
5,Fit watch fine. Good replacement for original watch band.
5,worked great
5,My wife was pleased with the product. Thank you.
5,Loved the price. Sturdy reliable good looking and a great fit.
5,Fit like original
1,Didn’t fit and snap in.
5,Got these for wife’s Fitbit. She loves the colors and changing was a snap literally. Only put a 4 for durability since we just got them but look good for the long haul.
5,Muy buena calidad del material casi parecen hechos por FITbit.
3,Se instalan fácilmente llevo poco más de tres semanas y una correa se aflojó se me cayó el reloj. Afortunadamente me dí  cuenta y no lo perdí. Voy a ver que tal salen los otros dos pares restantes 😏😏
5,De buena calidad
5,Son idénticas a las originales
5,Muy satisfecho!
2,Paint on buckle stripped after less than one month use. Does attach relatively well to the watch though there is a slight gap.
4,La correa dorada la pude usar solo un par de veces  venía rota o dañada simplemente se desprendió y se me cayó el reloj. Compré la talla pequeña es segun la descripción pero entre el reloj y las bandas queda un pequeño hueco que me parece es el que hace "tensión" forzando lo que sea que sujeta las bandas del reloj. Las bandas no tienen aroma no pican son suaves al tacto. Colores ok solo hubiera querido que me pudiera poner un poco más de tiempo todas las bandas.
5,The 3 bands are exactly as per the picture and do the job no problem !
5,Had this one for 3 months and works and fits well. Had no problems.
5,al colocar por primera vez cada correa se zafaron una o dos veces fuera de eso las bandas se parecen muchísimo a la original y no queda espacio entre el fitbit y la correa. buena compra.
2,Have gotten straps from AliExpress that lasted long than these whilst playing football. Busted super quickly - would not recommend for anyone in high mobility/contact sports.
