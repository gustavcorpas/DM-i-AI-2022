4,Overall a great device and once you get it working things go smoothly. It's just that little thing about getting the device to setup that isn't clear. Ooma clearly has a long way to go with smoothing out their documentation and setup process.First off the advertised setup app on Android does NOT connect to the Ooma and it is not at all clear what version of Bluetooth they are running. Technical specifications could NOT be located for this device which is very surprising. Ooma should make this a high priority in addition to their setup process needing overhaul.Overall here are the issues I encountered in setting up the device:1. The Bluetooth setup process via the mobile app did not work for me because my recent vintage Bluetooth phone was incompatible which is very surprising.2. The alternate procedure using the https://setup.ooma.com ALSO did not work with the laptop connected via ethernet port due to the fact that they insist on using a self-signed certificate which most browers trap and refuse to connect with these days. Shame on you Ooma! You should KNOW this!3. The instructions are disjointed and written by a marketing team and not real world people who are more likely than not to run into real-world issues. I consider the instructional guide for the Ooma to be practically worthless.4. The only REALLY useful documentation is the shortcuts guide which is very well done.  Two copies are provided and I plan to make copies just to keep with all my phones.5. There are no technical specifications which is utterly mystifying to me. This should be standard with all devices especially a VOIP device.Continuing on with my setup experience: What DID work as to access the default http://172.27.35.1/ address. The reason the SSL connection via the https://setup.ooma.com doesn't work is because most browsers intercept and deny connection to self-signed SSL certificates. It is a catch-22 I've seen on a lot of wireless devices. Ooma NEEDS to change these confusing aspects of it's setup process to something more streamlined and easy for people to understand. I'm an experienced (now retired) professional webmaster and it took me 45 minutes to sort through getting this thing hooked up.Wireless does work. The setup menu in the built in webserver does work and extremely basic. I have a Google Voice device which is MUCH more comprehensive but this gets the job done for the bare basics with the Telos. What isn't clear is the order of precedence and prioritization for multiple wireless connections. Again a mystery sauce and I have yet to understand their system for handling this. Once again the Ooma documentation isn't much help but I will keep working to find out how it works and will update when I learn more.It is also not clear as to the Telos boot process and how long it takes. This isn't covered at all in the guide and needs attention. It took a couple of minutes for the Ooma Telos to reach a ready state.  This should be clearly discussed in the manual.The Bluetooth issues were also notable. The system absolutely refused to speak with a Samsung cell phone that is only a few years old and Ooma should state the Bluetooth version minimums clearly on their device and literature. As it sits now I cannot direction access the Ooma setup without their included ethernet cable. At least I had a way to press forward but if the Bluetooth is this picky why not carry a line of Bluetooth adapters that plug into the USB port and give you options for multiple specifications of Bluetooth other than this paltry and non-working version bundled into the system?My take is that the Ooma is a really nice piece of gear. It's main issue seems to be the poor documentation and a Bluetooth issue that seems to be a deep dark secret for those of us wanting to know more. I have yet to work with the Ooma team to port my old landline number but will update here about the experience when I get that all done. I did like the security features to block spam callers with "unknown" and a wide variety of other settings on the web app for the application. Time will tell how well this works.  The other great feature is the addition of a forwarding number you can use when the Internet is down which can be to a wireless device for continued coverage.On to the positive: I'm glad I got this. Price is right for the basic service and I'm considering the premier plan. It is FAR FAR cheaper than what we are getting from a certain ancient carrier whose prices are completely out of line with reality. Goodbye Landline Hello VOIP and Ooma.
3,I needed a landline replacement for a family member and figured this would be the easiest solution. In setting up and then eventually canceling service for this device I found that Ooma is too shady for my liking.First issue: To make sure the device worked I set it up with my info since the previous Ooma device I ordered was DOA. Only this caused major frustration because after setting it up and checking everything I come to find that the outgoing caller-ID is automatically set to the billing name and is not configurable. Okay I’ll call them and have it corrected. I call them and it’s a $20 fee to change caller ID. Seriously? No thanks.Second issue you’re not allowed to remove your credit/debit card details unless you replace them with different credentials. The only way to remove your credit card info is to call their support number and cancel your service and have your entire account deleted in the process. You cannot cancel service anywhere online and must call them to do this.Now what if you delete your account and want to use the Ooma service at a later date with the hardware you bought? You must pay a reactivation fee.A suggestion to anyone turned off by the credit/debit card lack of deletion: look into a virtual credit/debit card. Many banks offer these and there are services around for them as well. They allow you to mask your payment details with virtual numbers that can have customized payment limits and uses. Great for shady companies that hold your card info hostage.Third issue: Ooma makes canceling your service painful and drawn out but I’ll tell you what to say to get it done without their BS. When you call to cancel service they will question you over and over why you’d want to cancel. Then once they accept you don’t need the phone service they will try to offer you a security service that will work with the Ooma device. I had to explain that I don’t need it and just want my account cancelled. They finally agree and transfer me to cancellations. The cancellation department agent asked me all of the exact same questions and then tried again to sign me up with their security service trying to get me to buy security hardware from them. I repeatedly decline and then the agent tells me “it’s probably too late to return your Ooma though” as if to say I’m stuck with the hardware and should just use it. I let her know that I returned the unit already and she immediately cancels my service without fuss. Now I hadn’t returned it yet but just needed to drop it off. So the key to canceling service without fuss: say you returned your Ooma or sold it to get them to shut up. It took me about 25 minutes of back and forth to accomplish this.For background on the last straw on why I returned my Ooma. Everything was ticking me off but the wireless on my unit never ended up working. I needed to have the wireless feature and could ignore the caller ID issue if the unit just worked right. But after the customer service fiasco I am thankful I was able to realize that Ooma isn’t a company I want to associate with.They do everything they can to nickel-and-dime you. Reactivation fee if you cancel and come back or give your unit away/sell it 40 dollar porting fee 20 dollar caller ID fee auto sign you up for a trial of their premium service and charge you for it if you don’t go into your account and change your plan force your to keep credit card info on your account force you to deal with customer service for rudimentary settings that should be available over their web portal and then charge you for it and all of their support is outsourced.I went ahead and purchased a used obitalk 202 device and set it up with Google voice and once Google voice goes I’ll use another voip service with it. It’s a great alternative to Ooma if you can find one.
5,Easy to set up with a seemless number porting process this is a sleek device. At $119 the Ooma premium call plan is heavily feature rich. Aside from the premium plan the cost in taxes and telecon fees (typical for any phone plan) is not even $6/month. This a far cry from $840/year on standard landline. Between cutting the cord in exchange for free/low cost streaming taking on Verizon plug-n-play internet and dumping the landline for Ooma I've been able to save my mom more than $300. A MONTH. I used our current landlne phones and the sound us crystal clear. No complaints here.
4,Got this for my 87 year old dad who was paying too much for cable and phone. Works fine and he hasn’t complained yet. Much cheaper alternative to cable phone service.
4,Was easy to register & hookup through their app luckily has a strong Wi-Fi connection to the network. Strangely when on the device/phone if another party is calling in they do NOT get a busy signal that you are on the line. Other than than it works fairly well - so far…
4,I have known about Ooma for a number of years and seemed like a great idea. and a real bargain.Recently my parents moved into assisted living but Century Link will take a month to move the phoneSo I got the Ooma (I like saying Ooma!) lol and set it up using the wifi at the assisted living place.of course it's a new phone number but we can call and check up on them they can call their friendsThe set up took a little bit pretty straight forward but it still took a little while and then it took about 30 mins for updatesOnce all done the system works great calls are crystal clear.
5,Highly recommended if you're looking for a low-cost landline replacement with advanced calling features.  I've been using a wired Ooma at my house since 2016 and just purchased this wireless one for my Mom.  We're using cordless Panasonic DECT phones with the Ooma at both locations ... the setup works great.Service cost is ~$5/month without Ooma Premier service and ~$15/month with Premier.  Get the Premier which gives you a second line caller ID spam blocking call forwarding conference calling free calling to Canada and Mexico etc. etc.  Previously I was paying ATT ~$35/mo for basic local service and another $10/month to a budget long-distance service.  With Ooma I'm paying about 1/3 of that for a service with many more features.Pros:- Simple installation- With Ooma Premier all the features mentioned above and more.  Spam blocking is particularly great and almost completely eliminates nuisance calls- Fax compatible prepend *99 to outgoing fax numbers- You can keep your existing landline number.  Ooma will "port" it for you and give you a temporary number in the meantime.  Porting takes 1-4 weeks.  I've done trouble-free ports of Pacific Bell (CA) and CenturyLink (CO) numbers- Sends standard voicemail waiting signals to connected phones -- just like phone company voicemail -- so that you can be notified of and pick up Ooma voicemails on connected phones that support this signaling- Reverse powers wired jacks in your house if you want multiple phones or fax machines connected (disconnect your house from the phone company's lines to do this safely and *don't* try this if you have DSL Internet ... it'll likely disable your Internet connection)- Smartphone app allows you to send/receive calls from your Ooma number pick up Ooma voicemail and monitor incoming/outgoing calls from anywhere; the app isn't amazing but it works.- Informative browser/web interface for monitoring and configuration of the service.- Sends address information to public safety when calling 911.  Be sure to configure your address correctly during setupCons and things to be aware of:- Requires a reliable Internet connection with a few 100 kbps of bandwidth for the Ooma.  You can set up Ooma to automatically forward calls to another number if your home Internet goes out.  Otherwise your Ooma voicemail will record incoming calls which can be retrieved after your Internet comes back (or from the app or the browser interface).- Sound quality of voicemails recorded by the Ooma is muddy.  If your home phone has a built-in answering machine try using that instead (just set the phone answering machine to pick up after a smaller number of rings than the Ooma).- If you wire the Telo in your house rather than connecting via WiFi note that you have the options of (a) installing it between your Internet modem and router or (b) behind your router on your home network.  While Ooma recommends (a) for wired Telos note that the Telo will limit throughput to your home network to 100 Mbps in this configuration slower than many of today's Internet plans.  My $0.02: connect a wired Telo behind your home router.- The "flower" light on top of the Telo is very bright by default.  It's brightness can be adjusted by logging in to the Telo (not your Ooma dashboard) or with the Telo rewind button (see https://support.ooma.com/home/ooma-telo-basic-functions-and-faq/)
4,We are moving away from a land line and were looking for options.  Our cell provider would give us a single VoIP phone for $20/month but we currently have three extensions we use.  I ran across the Ooma product and it appeared I could connect it to my home 5G network use my current phones (wireless with a base station) and do that for about $85 for the Ooma device.  The Ooma installed and was working we requested Ooma port our home phone number over and for $60 or so they got it done and our land line now connects via the Ooma.  Our monthly land line charges were <$50  (with Ooma it's <$6) so Ooma will pay for itself in 2-3 months.  Other than the Ooma updating firmware a couple of times (5-15 minutes each time) there were no surprises.  Call quality seems fine after having made 5-6 calls so I call this a win.
3,I have been using a Telo for many years at a second home  and for the most part you cannot beat the overall experience.  Upon arriving back after 6 months the OOMA was not connecting to my wifi. I had to use the wifi dongle as there was no built in wifi at that time and my router was on the other side of the apartment. After calling tech support and being escalated to the 3rd level no one seemed to know why I was not connecting as on setup I was getting a message that I was either using the wrong password or was too far. Neither was the case. I could never really talk to anyone knowledgeable as they would pass my issue up and the same person would call back to repeat whatever they were told. I am no networking expert but I am not a novice either. So also having a second Telo early version I tried the exact same things and immediately it connected but then I was getting the purple light that meant that a firmware update was needed. I had not had this unit plugged in in a couple years ( and to move my story ahead- I cancelled that service today ) and it kept updating for almost 24 hours. I finally was frustrated and just ordered the Telo Air 2. Upon arrival I knew not to try to set it up as I wanted to transfer my telephone number to the new Telo. I called customer service who told me to give them the activation number she immediately knew that I had bought it from Amazon and she said I would receive an email that it was activated in 30 minutes. 2 hours later not having gotten an email I called got a different person who looked up the account and said it was activated and an email just went out. Still have not received it and it is not in spam folder either. I asked about how to set up wifi and she told me to call back. When I got back home I connected it to my router plugged it in and immediately it needed a firmware update which the woman on the phone told me. The instructions say that it should take 5 minutes but could take 30 minutes. 4 hours later it was still showing it was updating similar to my older one that I was not going to use. So I called and got support who had me unplug the unit something I was afraid to do since it was supposedly updating. Then I got connected by lan but needed to be connected by wifi. So he tells me to go to a web site where my units is viewed and has me go thru the same thing that I had done on the older units. And each time I had the same experience as my earlier units. I do not know how their phone system works but they cannot stay on the phone with you for more than a certain time and they tell you they have to call you back before getting disconnected. So he called me back and as we kept trying again the same thing kept happening. I asked a question and the next thing I know I get disconnected. I thought maybe it was my cel phone but after calling back and finding out that they were closed ( after 8pm Eastern ) I realized it was time to go home and he accidentally must have disconnected me since he never called back. So I kept putzing around and finally saw that there was an iPhone setup app. I downloaded it went into it and told it to change the wifi connection. As soon as I did about 3 minutes later I was connected by wifi. I moved the unit waited for it to connect to wifi and I am back working after having much frustration ( spent almost 8 hours on the old units ) all on the part of OOMA tech support. As I have been an OOMA user for many years I can recommend the product but while it should be easy to set up their support stinks. I would never consider buying any of their other products because of this. My setup is with an Apple Airport Extreme and an Airport Express to extend the network. They wanted to blame it on the fact that they use the 2.4ghz band and the Apple broadcasts both the 5ghz and the 2.4 at the same time and the product is to pick up the best choice. Since the OOMA does not work on the 5ghz I really do not know why there was a problem. And I think since using the App to fix everything their online computer system is the real issue. If I could I would give it 5 stars for the product and 1 for their support.
4,Since the cost for a conventional land line has reached a ridiculous price and without even including caller ID and the massive long distance fees to actually call anyone out of the immediate area decided it was time to try a voip service. Setup was fairly straight forward using the downloaded app on a Samsung phone with the exception that others have noted regarding setting up the wifi connection. Had to connect an ethernet cable to a laptop to do this. Ooma really should fix this since many complain about it.  Porting our landline phone number took less than a week. So far haven't encountered any real problems. Call quality is as good as before.A couple of complaints to note. First Ooma gives you a couple months of their premium service package for free however you have to opt out or you'll start getting billed for the additional $10 bucks per month. Secondly the porting fee is supposedly $40 which seems excessive. On our account they also are not showing the actual amount they've billed for the port which is why I said "supposedly". Another small complaint is the device takes more than 5 minutes to come online after cycling power. Seems a little slow slow. One reason to cycle power is the device tends to operate fairly warm. There's enough heat generated that anytime we're on a trip it's unplugged. Not taking any chances on it starting a fire.
3,Seems to be basically functional and the wifi connection seems strong from the router in another room about 25 feet away. Sound quality is maybe a tad less than my fibre provider's phone but most of that is the HD3 handset that isn't quite as good as my old wireless handset especially on speaker. But Ooma is certainly acceptable quality and perfectly usable.  Have not tried to migrate my existing phone number to Ooma.HOWEVER shortly after installing I started getting a flood of junk calls and texts not on the temporary Ooma number but on my cell phone that I provided to set up the Ooma account. Did they sell it?? This is extremely annoying and is close to making my cell phone useless since I have to mute it.  If Ooma didn't cause this it's a very curious coincidence. Perhaps this is how you can get a "free" phone?
5,I had just had enough of paying the local phone company over $70/mo for a landline that we hardly used anymore. For the low price you pay for monthly service the Ooma is a great choice. We had one for a number of years for our son who lived in a cell phone null area during college (this was before wifi calling was popular) and have always been impressed. This box does the trick for us.
5,I got this for my Mom. Lots of scam calls these days. You can hear the message they are leaving you and pick up phone if you choose. Also if you pay $10 more a month you can block unwanted calls. You have to add the app or website to you computer and log in. My Mom is able to do it. There are so many scam calls I am happy with it.
4,Got this for my Mom in assisted living.  They discontinued cable phone and she could not get a land-line.  So needed to hook-up to the Facilities'' WiFi for her phone service.  Set-up is pretty easy - I did it on the App.  I put it in my home first to test and made many outgoing calls.  They will need to change the Caller ID to your name for the phone number you choose - call Support and put in a case.  However I never had anyone call me on it - inbound call.  So when I installed it at my Mom's it would not take incoming calls!  I spent hours on the phone with support over two days (did not have Level 3 support on Sunday).  Took a long time had to switch to a different phone number etc. etc.  Level 3 Support was attentive positive and got it fixed.  Just be ready.  Also I had them turn off the voice mail so my Mom's answering machine would record not Ooma's.  Just remember you also need to have them increase the rings before it goes to Ooma and you hear - "This voicemail is inactive."  I had them take it up to the maximum rings of 9 as my Mom's phone answers at 6 rings.  Now I am happy.  Only pay the taxes for service.  Did not upgrade to Premium service.  Hoping things continue to go well.
5,It was fairly easy to set up and seems to work just fine. Definitely less expensive that my previous centurylink phone.
3,Ooma Telo Air 2 VoIP Free Home Phone Service: $98.99 at the time of reviewI needed to get a second telephone line for a side business and I didn’t want to pay the usual exorbitant fees for what amounted to 4-5 calls a week on this line. Ooma seemed like a great option (afterall they tout ‘free’ service). I do still use the line three years later but it ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.*What I liked*:The service is really easy to set up. Order the box create an account install the smart phone app (optional) and you’re almost ready to go (more on the ‘almost’ in a minute).The call quality is perfect or at least as perfect as a cellphone call with good signal.The features on the smartphone app are great (mobile voicemail answering the line through the app etc.)*What I didn't like*:Free is a relative term apparently. In order to finish setting up your service you are required to put in a credit/debit card number. This is because you still have to pay state & local taxes on the line. So I actually pay about $6/month. Not a big deal for me as it’s a business write-off. But for anyone expecting to pay the $100 bucks for the box and nothing more you’re gonna have a bad time.You know all of those fancy features that the mobile app has? You’ve gotta pay for that. They want you to pay monthly for their upgraded plan. So now you’re paying $6 in taxes and another $10+ for the fancy features. All of a sudden your $100 ‘free’ phone box is costing you $180+/year.And finally my little box died after just under two years. If I had needed it to be attached to a landline phone I’d be out of luck. Thankfully I just need to check the voicemails which I can still do without it.*The Bottom Line:*This phone line from Ooma technically does what I need but only just. Heck the voip service it replaced had a little box similar to this one and that box lasted over 15 years. In fact I only switched to Ooma because that other service ended. This is an overall disappointment. It works so I don’t want to drop it down to 2-stars. But the equipment failure coupled with the hidden charges really drags it down in my book. So I will begrudgingly give it three stars out of five. I definitely wouldn’t buy it over again though. It left a sour taste in my mouth.
3,I've used Ooma for eleven years and am on my second Telo.  In the name of improvement some features have been reduced so for instance on the newer Telos you cannot conference two inbound calls.  On the plus side fax transmissions which used to fail on Ooma in earlier years now do work quite well.  But the volume on the Telo itself such as when you're playing back messages or screening calls is so low it is difficult or impossible to make out.  But the biggest flaw is that for a good many calls the gain -- the volume of the voice coming from the caller -- is extremely low.  Ooma technical support has no cures and always just asks for the phone number with which you had the problem and that achieves nothing.  There are also some security concerns:  Ooma has a very nice multi-ring feature where you can have the call ring both on your Ooma device and concurrently on say a cell phone.  Somehow though my account was reprogrammed to ring on someone else's phone.  Ooma could not explain how this occurred and moreover generates no log that shows when account changes like this are made and who made them.  Its support line also has limited hours and although it operates on Pacific time it seems as if all calls are all serviced overseas.  Also the Telo firmware are updated automatically and although this occurs only occasionally it might happen while you're on a call which means your call is cut off.  Wireless connectivity to the Telo Air is pretty limited.  Ooma's fees for most international calls are rather high -- you might do better using your cell phone for those -- and you have to establish a deposit account from which those charges are deducted.  To get some services that would be standard with a local telephone provider you have to buy Ooma's Premier service.  Still even amortizing the annual fee for Premier and the monthly service charge Ooma costs less than service provided by local telecom or cable companies.  But Ooma needs to try harder to make this a better product than what you can get from your ISP.
4,I'm a huge fan of Ooma. I've been using them for many years for both home and office. The service is dramatically cheaper than an old-fashioned landline and consistently higher quality than relying on a cell phone when at home or in the office. This Telo Air solves one of the constraints of the older Telo models which needed a wired (CAT5) connection to the router. With this new Telo Air you can put the unit in a more convenient location. I have it connected wirelessly to an Eero Pro 6 router and the quality and reliability are great.The one shortcoming has to do with wireless configuration. If you initially activate via a web browser rather than via the app switching from wired to wireless connection is a challenge. I had to call for tech support (which was fast and efficient). They helped me find the IP address of the Telo box and with that I could access it and configure it for a wireless connection. Switching from wired to wireless isn't possible from the Ooma app after activation which seems to me like a major bit of missing functionality. This will also be a problem if and when I upgrade my router since I'll have to hunt for the Telo IP in order to access the device and reconfigure it (fortunately that's easier with an Eero router but in this day and age reconfiguring a devices WiFi connection should be easy enough for grandparents).Bottom line: Ooma is a five-star product and the Telo Air 2 is a five-star device but I'm taking off a star for the poor execution of WiFi configuration since that's the whole point of paying an extra twenty bucks for the Telo Air vs. the wired-only Telo.P.S. As I mentioned when I reached out to Ooma Tech Support via chat I went from queue to active within one minute and the support person diagnosed the issue and offered a working solution very quickly. So kudos to Tech Support for dealing efficiently with a current shortcoming of the product software.
5,Excellent phone service.  Low monthly fee.  Sound is crystal clear.  Just make sure you uncheck the default premium service when initially setting the device up or your monthly fee will go from $6 to $16.  I didn't and had to call customer service to correct.
3,So we decided to abandoned our land line carrier and go with this new-fangled wi-fi calling system OOMA. First one I got was a "renewed" model OOMA air 2. The required software app for iPhone would not accept the code that came with the device. I called customer non-support got put on hold for 15 or 20 minutes then I gave up returned the unit to Amazon. Because I'm a masochist I ordered a new unit. It was indeed easy to set up and seemed to work great. So I ported my old landline number to OOMA and because I had an old antique rotary dial pulse phone that worked great with the old phone company I decided to purchase the Lynx unit because OOMA web site had no indication that it wouldn't work with that style phone. Well my mistake. Guess I should have done a little more research. OOMA DOES NOT SUPPORT PULSE DIALING. They don't tell you that however unless you wander through the maze of questions on the company website and discover someone who had the same issue which in retrospect is probably what I shoulda done. Why OOOMMMMA doesn't just say this up front is an indicator of their lack of customer interest once they got your money. Expect no support from this company. Call theCUSTOMER SUPPORT NUMBER that's pasted all over their literature and their phone routing system sends you to various places none of which actually contains a human. As I found out you get auto placed on hold for as long as you care to keep the phone next to your ear.I DO NOT recommend OOMA unless you are a telecommunications wizard and never need to have a question answered by a human or you just feel the need to punish yourself for the rest of your life. If I had it to do all over again I would run away from OOMA as fast as my little legs would carry me and figure out a different alternative. But alas they hooked me and I'm stuck at least until I can figure out an option.
5,We had landline service for 20 years. We had "Price for Life" and then one day the phone company decided to raise our price...but nobody had died!We live in a rural area with spotty cellphone coverage so just using our cellphones was not a good solution. We bought Ooma disconnected the landline days later kept our phone number took the landline monthly savings and got a great deal on internet service from the cable company and 18 months later couldn't be happier.Our cable modem is centrally located in the basement. We bought the wireless Telo to be able to locate it on the main level and plug in to an existing phone jack allowing us to continue using the existing phone system. That worked but we had noticed some delays in both directions when on a call...you know when both sides are talking over each other and you need to pause. Turns out we had a phone jack in the basement near the cable modem and moving the Telo down there and using ethernet to connect to the modem solved all the problems.Initially when using the existing phone jacks/wiring we had an issue with static on the line. Disconnecting the incoming phone company line at the junction box to the house remedied that.At the time we purchased our Ooma they were having a sale on accessories and I purchased a couple of Linx units (turns out we didn't need them). When I was setting them up one of them was having an issue. Tech support was very good - they were able to remotely access the unit and resolve the problem with it.
4,What I think should have been a simple procedure was extremely aggravating. I should have been able to activate my Ooma by taking a photo of the qr code or entering the activation code on their website. I kept being told my activation code was invalid. I then called tech support in India and struggled to understand most everything the person said. But I finally surmised that they wanted me to send a copy of my Amazon receipt and then call them back. I had hoped to never have to speak to them again. But I called back and they found my email and then activated my device. Being a glutton for punishment I decided to keep my old number. When I got the email that my number had been ported I followed the instructions in the email and discovered the temporary number still worked but my old number had been disconnected and was no longer in service. Another dreaded and painful call to tech support finally got it straightened out. The thing works fine and it's definitely cheaper than AT&T but it's almost not worth the hassle.12/12/21 Update.I signed up for basic service and failed to notice that you're given a "free" trial of their premier service. After the "free" trial you're automatically charged for the premier service no matter what you sign up for. Luckily I caught the charge for triple what I had been paying on my credit card statement and contacted Ooma to get put back on basic. Watch these guys. I think they're kind of sketchy.
3,First the pros: Easy set-up great call quality seamless number porting decent customer support good value.Now the con and I do mean "con": When I signed up for Ooma all I wanted was the basic no-frills plan and the price for that (about $6+ in taxes and fees) was what appeared on my credit card statements--for the first couple of months. Then three months later I noticed the monthly charge had changed to $17+ and saw that I'd been paying that amount for the two previous months. (Yes shame on me for not catching it earlier.) Logging into my account I saw that I was subscribed to Ooma's premier plan. A customer service agent explained that when I created my account I had been awarded a free two-month trial subscription to the Premier level and that I had failed to cancel it upon expiration. Could I have missed that notification upon sign-up? Maybe but I'm usually pretty tuned in to those offers. Could I have missed an email notification that my free trial was about to expire? Again perhaps but I tend to pay attention to those notices. Could Ooma intentionally be burying these trial upgrade notices and not sending expiration notices because well how else can they make money from subscribers like me when their basic service level is free? You be the judge.
3,It may be different for others but for me the call quality was not acceptable. We recently got Starlink Internet which has very fast speeds. But making calls with this device was not good. The call would cut out for a second often making it difficult to hear words when only half of a spoken word is audible.Also be forewarned Ooma makes it difficult to cancel the service. First they don't give you an option of cancelling through their website. You must call then you must wait on hold (I waited a total of about 15 minutes) then you must speak to two different people with heavy accents. The first person will ask you why you want to cancel and then you will get asked again by the second person. In my case the second person tried to transfer me to technical support even though I told the first person I had already sent back the device. Quite the ordeal.The best part of my experience with this device was Amazon's return policy.
5,The Telo Air 2 is not perfect but the sound quality is good as long as you have a strong internet signal.  It has dropped WiFi a few times but usually reconnects within a short time.  The monthly charges are taxes and fees only ours are $5.70 a month.  Ooma starts you out on their Premium plan for a free trial period - but make sure you cancel it before the trial period ends if you choose not to keep it or they continue to charge you for it ($10.00 mo.) until you do cancel.  Overall we'd recommend it.
3,It would fail several times a week. Support gave me needed information to change port addressing on my router. Call ISP and got some help on how to do that. Seems to work better. But support did a half-correct change. Now I am lost as to how to complete what is a job for an IT.
3,The first Telo Air 2 that I received was DOA.  Couldn't use either wireless or wired.  Contacted customer support and they sent a new unit.  That unit only lasted a few months and now it is dead in the water.  We're debating whether to replace it with another Ooma unit or go with something different.Our original Telo (wired only) with a separate phone system worked great for 2-3 years.  Replaced that one with one a family member had bought (note: it was a real hassle with Ooma customer service to get the service onto this device. they really want you to buy a new one).  That one lasted another few years so when it died we decided to try the Telo 2 Air so we could move the base unit to a more convenient location.  As stated earlier two units together lasted less than a year.  It seems like the Telo AIr 2 is just not stable with the WiFi handset and Bluetooth radios built in.When I tried to contact customer service through their online chat they were pretty useless and said to call in.  Calling in got me a very long hold time and then a hang up.4 units two of which lasted less than a few months make it real hard to recommend Ooma hardware.  I still like the service itself even though customer service seems to be hit or miss.
3,I attempted to set this up for my parents in an assisted living with a password-protected Wifi connection.  It was not possible to connect an ethernet cable to the router in this shared living situation so after about 8 cumulative hours of work including calling and chatting with Ooma tech support several times I stopped working on it.  My parents moved to a different assisted living with open Wifi and I was easily able to set it up there.  However they preferred using their familiar cell phone instead.  While cleaning and organizing they kept accidentally unplugging the Ooma device from the wall.  After several months of non-use I decided to cancel the service and unfortunately it required 33 minutes of my time on the phone during business hours.  I waited on hold had to speak with 2 different representatives and heard approximately 5 sales pitches before they would allow me to cancel the service.  It would be great if the cancellation could simply be done from the website which works well for other functions.  I use an Ooma for our own family "landline" and love it had no trouble setting it up.  I feel Ooma's cancellation policy is disrespectful of their customers' time.
5,My husband and I have had a landline for 55 years and didn't want to give it up. We were paying ATandT $59 a month for not even long distance.We are very pleased with the ooma device. My husband put it in and they ported our phone in less than a week. I love the app so I can block calls that come into my iphone and the landline. I would definitely recommend it.
5,I've been wanting to ditch our expensive traditional landline service for a while now and instead have home phone via VoIP. One issue is that where I want to put the VoIP box and phone is far away from any ethernet connection and I wasn't interested in knocking holes in the walls to run a cable. Enter the Ooma Telo Air 2. It connects to the internet via your home wi-fi so you can place it just about anywhere in your home. Using a Telo Air means of course that you use Ooma as your VoIP provider. Their "pay only taxes" service is fine for us but there's an inexpensive premium tier if you want or need more features. Long story short it works really well.If you want to port over your existing home number there's a one-time charge of $39.99 plus taxes which in our case came to a total of about $50.I had to interact with Ooma tech support because I needed to swap out one Telo Air for another. (Amazon lowered their price by $30 a day after I bought it and refused to credit me the difference. They insisted that I return the old one and buy it again at the lower price which I did.) The first thing to know is that Ooma's on hold music is really irritating. But after a couple false starts the tech I spoke with got me up and running with the new Telo Air. So overall their tech support gets a thumbs up.
5,The setup and install were super-easy. I immediately purchased the Premium service so that I could port my landline to Ooma without incurring the normal porting fee.After requesting the port I realized I'd input my mobile number instead of my landline.A call to customer service fixed that error and porting was completed in about 10d.The information regarding the porting status was helpful.After porting was completed I went online to cancel the landline and was pleased to learn AT&T had already closed that account.I unplugged the jacks on the customer side of the outside AT&T box and connected the Ooma output to an unused jack inside.This feeds the wired Ooma signal throughout the house. The old base station for our cordless set works like a charm.I decided to use the base station message system so I could just hide the Ooma device on a window ledge.The app is useful as is the website.The number of Robo calls is about zero. The Premium service required to have the enhanced screening and blocking features.My wifi signal is robust so voice quality is great.The monthly fee varies depending on where you live. Ours is about $8 per month. The monthly fee for our landline was around $52 and a call to the adjacent town wasn't free.Perfect.
5,I found the phone easy to set up.  The sound quality is good.  This is a great alternative to conventional land lines.
4,We were early adopters and our 2nd gen ooma unit just broke down in fact it happened gradually over a period of 12 months.  The unit lasted 7-8 years.  As a user : you ahve to call into customer service 1st before you power up the unit.  Then you use the setup app to do the rest of the set up long with a quick refresh of the account on website.If you are a new user: follow the instructions on the unit.What should be improved is better training for their customer service: I was given 3 different ways to transfer to the new unit none of which was correct.  Sales were awful - as we needed to cancel an order we made with them [ended up buying the unit on Amazon] and the unit still arrived from ooma.  Sales dept too had different answers and some were rude and unhelpful.That said we still love the promises and whilst you need to escalate to the senior engineers if you are not getting the expertise you need.  Thankfully it is once in a blue moon that we need that level of assistance.
5,By far best quality and service yet. Easy set up and provides great connectivity.
3,I have had this since November. I have a complex home network with 3 routers and anywhere from 20-30 devices connected at once. I have a combination of static and dhcp addresses assigned and I have my equipment scheduled to restart a few times a week. EVERY.SINGLE.TIME the routers restart the telo air will never reconnect. I have to not only go thru a full setup again but the ooma app setup has NEVER worked and I end up needing to disconnect my laptop workstation to connect to the ooma directly for setup. There are no available ethernet ports in the office where the modem/main router are so I need this to work wirelessly.I've attempted to set a static IP address to the telo air but it literally won't let me. I set it manually in my router but anytime I go into the ooma setup webpage and try to set the IP address manually it never accepts it.I also received a wireless desk phone as part of the promotion. It stays connected for roughly 24 hours after I setup the ooma base and then stops working. EVERY.TIME.Support is useless. It's 2021 I should be able to have a web chat or email support. Why should I have to call a company for phone support when the phone isn't working? I get no cell service in my house. The couple of times I spoke with web chat they were 100% useless. No steps to try outside of what's in the manual that's hidden in the depths of their website. I had high hopes for ooma based on reviews and I'm extremely disappointed. Maybe my network is too much for it?I paid for the premium year and honestly regret it. I'm going to try to figure out a way to get the base hardwired to a router otherwise this was the biggest waste of time and money.UPDATE APR2021: Turns out it was never setup properly even though the app said it was completed. I reset everything AGAIN and started from scratch and hardwired the ooma base to one of my routers and it's been working great since. Don't advertise wireless if it doesn't work smoothly though
5,My Ooma Telo VoIP Free Home Phone died in less than 2 years of use. It was hardwired to my modem and then connected to my router.  It was causing my router to stop working.  I had to remove it and reconnect my router to my modem to get internet working.  Which meant the Ooma is just a door stop.  I tried many times to reconnect it but I could not get it working.  Normally I would give device like this a bad rating but since by using Ooma did save me more than $600.00 in about 2 years the cost of getting another Ooma is justifiable.To avoid the same issue of placing a device in between my modem and router I purchased an Ooma Telo Air 2 VoIP Free Home Phone.The new unit arrived the next day.  I first tried to connect it with my laptop and I got stuck.  I am old I rather work on a laptop as it is easier for my eyes.  I had no choice but picked up my phone to complete the setup. I scanned the code on the manual but I did not recognize the app that was going to be installed on my phone.  So I went to Google Play and installed the Ooma Setup instead.Using the Ooma Setup on the phone is actually quite easy.  It did take a while for my wireless network to find this Ooma and connected to it.  Once it was connected to the wireless network the setup was easy.  The new Ooma is working great and now I could even move it anywhere I choose without it locating near my modem.I do not have any important contact using my old phone number so I just choose another new phone number even though I could have ported my old phone number to the new equipment.  I used this Ooma phone for my security gate mainly.I made a call to Ooma and cancelled the old phone number (account) and that was it.Following is a review of my old Ooma Telo.  This review should apply to the new Ooma Telo Air 2.https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9NVP60Q20AHK?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp
5,After owning a first generation Telo for a few years we decided to upgrade to the newer Telo Air 2 and are pleased with the features and Ooma customer service. Since we already had a working Ooma account and did not wish to open another we called the support line. A level 1 tech answered in about two minutes. The person's voice was clear and easy to understand. We explained that we wanted to deactivate the old and replace with the new. That required a level 2 tech so we waited on hold for about another minute.The second Ooma customer service person also spoke very clear and knew exactly what to do. Within an hour we were told to replace the box and wait for firmware updates. We then received an email telling us that we we up and running with the new box.Cost? About $5 a month to pay for 911 and taxes. We went for the Premiere at $11 a month to get a second line and advanced voicemail features.There are whitelists and blacklists to enable YOU to be in control of your calls. Kick the RoboCallers with their sucker lists to the curb.The Telo Air 2 call quality is superb. No landline hum and almost no dropped calls. If you have a modern land-based internet connection then you should be fine. Eithernet or WiFi whichever works best for you.And as for customer service if the techs are not located in the United States then they sure fooled me! In addition the wait time on hold was very short.Our big bell land line phone was costing us $770 a year. Now even with the Ooma Premiere upgrade it runs us about $120 a year.  Basic free US free calling will run you 4 or $5 a month.We disconnected big telco's incoming wire and connected the Telo Air 2 RJ output to the wire feeding the house. Easy and effective. All the old phones are now Ooma phones.In summary we are quite pleased with the Telo Air 2. For most people just plug it in and register. You can keep it simple with plug-n-pray DHCP or kick it up a notch with static IP and QOS if you are so inclined and are tech savvy.We believe you will think the Telo Air 2 is wonderful just as we do.
3,I signed up for Ooma when Verizon announced that they were discontinuing our POTS.  Call me old but I don't like talking on a cellphone for any length of time.Signing up for the service was easy and so was setting up the base station.  I chose to save $40 and not port my number so I got a new phone number.  I bought the Ooma handsets because I liked the way that they looked.  Connecting the handsets to the base station was also pretty easy.  I don't remember exactly how long it took.  Everything worked right away but I also remember that the base station needed to update its software and reconnect and that took about 30 to 45 minutes altogether.My ongoing issue was that the call quality over my WiFi was horrible.  Apparently connecting wirelessly to both my modem and the handsets was too much for the base station.  My call quality was very choppy and ironically I started to tell people to call me on my cellphone because I didn't like using the Ooma.  Why was I paying for something I didn't like using?  So I contacted tech support about the problem.Kudos to tech support.  They were responsive and even sent me a new base station without me asking to see if that would fix the problem.  That did not fix the problem.  What fixed the problem for me was connecting the base station to my router via an ethernet cord.Other than the WiFi function being garbage I'm happy with the service.  It's very affordable--actually much less money than I was paying Verizon (shocking I know) with many more features.  I can have my calls forwarded to my cellphone if I'm expecting a call and I need to go out (that never actually happens--but it COULD.)  If you make international calls the rates are also very low.  In my opinion it's not worth the extra money for the WiFi version of the base station because it doesn't work that well.
5,it took me a while to connect the unit to my ATT Uverse internet.  Since then it has never disconnected and provide excellent phone service.
5,So I talked my mom into stop paying AT&T $500 a year for barebones telephone that doesn’t even give you caller ID and getting an Ooma which I’ve been using myself for 10 years.  I decided to go with the air to put the Ooma and cordless phone base in a different room than where the internet was set up.I was a little worried about using Wi-Fi my telos isn’t but in the month she’s had it she hasn’t had any issues with signal reception. These airs have all the standard jacks too so if you wanted to spend a few bucks  more to get the air instead of the standard telos you could use it wired or wireless as you need.
5,Followed the easy directions through the Android app they recommend for setup. Had no issues with install and received a number which I had the opportunity to pick from various alternatives. I did not port over an old number so cannot comment how that process would have gone. I have been using it for a few weeks and am very pleased with the quality of calls. I probably will stick with the "premium" service which is a small extra fee per month. I replaced my cable provided phone which never worked correctly with the Ooma and at 20% of the cost. I call that a win.
4,I did manage to get this thing working but I found the setup instructions for WiFi confusing.  I do not have a smartphone which apparently makes you something of an 'unperson' with Ooma and the online instructions only walk you through setting up the Telo Air 2 with a wired connection.  I wish they would have posted a video for the wireless setup but apparently they don't care enough to do that.  Nevertheless I do like the device itself.  I subscribed to the Ooma Premier service as well which is WAY cheaper than my old landline phone bill.  And they did an EXCELLENT job in getting my old landline number ported to my Ooma device.  I sent Ooma the request at 7pm EST and shortly before noon on the following Monday the porting was finished!  It will be a delight to finally cancel my overprice landline service.  So despite the trouble I had with the instructions (YMMV) I would still recommend this device.  (But I am taking away one star for what I believe to be unclear WIFI setup instructions.)
4,I got this to save money on my phone bill. This is a VOIP internet based service. It works very well sounds good and has been reliable. I wish the blue power light indicating service was not so big and bright. Perhaps they could add a dimmer feature. Just beware it will act like a night light in the room you plan to place it. Finally like many other reviews I had issues installing it using the app. It refused to connect to my wireless network. I did get it to work finally and mysteriously. I was about to give up and call tech support when I looked over and the power light was suddenly solid blue and it was connected! I did nothing different but it suddenly worked. Very strange. So clearly they need to work on the app and the wireless software. However since then I have had no issues with WIFI connection and the product works well. Great value compared to the landline I was paying Comcast for previously I started using the premium service but as I now use my cell phone for most calls and have this as a backup mostly I will drop the premium service at the end of the year of service and pay just the less than $7 per month.
2,I just canceled this service after 1 year - and only having used it for 3 months. (Calls cut out regularly and I received calls for others routinely due to some sort of number assignment issue - it was almost like a "party line.")Anyway calling to cancel was painful which I suspected it would be which is why I waited so long.  After the first person tried to get me to use it as a "security device" I was sent to another department only after I told them I had already discarded the device.Then I had to go through the same process with another agent who tried 3 times to get me use the device for some other purpose. Even saying I had a "regular phone" didn't stop the hard sell.  So I told that agent too that I had discarded the device. Only then did they quickly cancel the account.I was skeptical so I asked about a confirmation email. They said they just sent one but it was never received. So I had to ask for a confirmation number instead which frankly seems like it was made-up on the fly. The agent was also rather "cold" after she learned I had discarded the device.Bottom line... these people do NOT want you to ever cancel.You've been warned!******Original Review******Setup was very easy (used the Ooma setup app) and call clarity seems great at this point.Only one BIG problem. The phone number that I chose from a list provided during the mobile app setup process turned out to already be assigned to someone else.I did a few outgoing calls to test and then called myself back from another line which was then answered by someone else (a local business). Called again two times and finally had to apologize to the other person for bothering them repeatedly.When I called Ooma (from my cell phone) to explain the problem and change my number they didn't seem to understand the problem or perhaps HOW it could happen. The first agent said they needed to call the number to confirm - I was then disconnected. I called back and the 2nd agent understood the problem and assigned me a new number but did let me know that there's usually a $19.95 charge to change numbers.I told support to make sure someone on their tech side was aware of the technical issue. Considering the number I originally chose had been in use for quite some time (long enough to be used on their company websites and be listed in the search engines) there's obviously a technical issue with the number availability list.
5,Was paying $127 a month for CenturyLink with slow rural internet. After upgrading to Starlink I purchased Ooma Wireless connection to the internet. Ooma was great to work with me via email on getting 2 phone numbers transferred even though the second number was a problem. I went with the premium service. Great features. I really like being able to manage my call blocking log and even answering machine by computer. The main thing is to be sure you have fast enough internet for voice over IP.
4,Well....this buy was a replacement for an Ooma that I had purchased about 8 years ago.  It worked perfectly until it started to have static on all the calls.  So I decided it needed replacing with a new one.  It got the new one and was using it via wifi which was how I had the prior one connected.  For whatever reason it did not work well using wifi.  It was not my wifi because I have 1000mbps service coupled with a router wherein I get about a 440mbps signal at the point where the Ooma is placed.  Finally I decided that if I wanted this device to work properly I would have to provide a hard wired solution.  I had a technician come out and hard wire a connection to the location in the kitchen where in we had the Ooma placed.  After that it worked perfectly!!!!!  No problems.I really like the Ooma.  It is a great solution to a cheap land line.  But unlike my prior Ooma with the exterior dog ear wifi receptor the new Ooma has the receptor built in.  Don’t know whether this was the reason for the poor wifi reception but from my personal experience hard wiring was the only solution to getting a properly working Ooma.  And this was after trying many times with their tech service to resolve the problem using the wifi connection.  So good luck folks.
1,I attempted to activate a Telo Air 2 and could not get it to connect to the internet through WiFi.  When I connected the Telo directly to a laptop via ethernet it was recognized but reported that there was no wifi adapter hence could not scan for a router.  At this stage I was following the manual exactly. Then I called Customer "Care" to see what I was doing wrong.  The off-shore relative to USA agents were no help.  Even when I connected the base directly to my modem via ethernet cable it would not connect.  I spent over an hour with no resolution by far the worst customer support I have ever experienced kept asking me the same questions multiple times and making the same suggestions that I had refused such as adding a WIFi dongle.  I decided to cancel the service and was stonewalled for 15-20 minutes before I managed to get them to terminate my account.  They then had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to port my current number to the Ooma system saying I could just use it through my cell phone.I can understand getting the occasional defective unit but their support was poor and I do not want to have to deal with them ever again hence terminating the account after less than 2 hours.BTW I rated sound quality as 1 star as I never got to hear it.  Wish I could have given 0 stars.
4,Really enjoying the lack of an $80 monthly payment to CenturyLink but the Ooma voice quality leaves quite a bit for improvement.  Not sure this can be done with software updates but I remain hopeful.  My ISP bandwidth varies between 150 and 180 Mbps throughput down (>10 Mbps up) so I seriously doubt data bandwidth would be the culprit.  Wi-Fi?  Nope the Ooma is hardwired to the router via CAT-5E.
2,I have an early generation wired Ooma and have been satisfied with its reliability and call quality and wanted to upgrade to wireless thinking that I could just register the new device with my existing Ooma account and phone number.  Oh no.  The iOS activation app only allows you to create a new account and sends you to customer service chat.  Chat response is that this is too complex an issue and you need to contact customer service by phone.  Customer service phone line only keeps "regular business hours" (but does not disclose what they are).  After a lengthy hold customer support directed me to active an entirely new account choose a new phone number re-enter all billing and contact information and then filed a ticket with a higher level tech support to merge the accounts - 24-48 hours.  Still waiting.  You'd think the company would expect (and want) people to upgrade their equipment from time to time and make this simple
3,After reviewing the set up procedures and the hoops I had to jump through to get the service I wanted I decided this was not for me. If you want to change your phone number this may work for you but if you decide you want to keep your existing phone number read the manual very carefully. Lots of restrictions and costs.
4,I don't use my home phone for anything except spam calls and 911.  Ooma seemed like a great candidate to replace my expensive VOIP phone from the cable company.  First off this looks exactly like the Ooma Telo but it has built in wireless and bluetooth.  So don't get all upset if you think Amazon sent you the wrong box.  I bought the Telo Air 2 so I had the option of placing my Ooma anywhere I wanted wired or otherwise.  I set it up initially on the wireless.  I followed the instructions downloaded the setup app to my phone and had Ooma up and running with their phone number in about 10 minutes. I then asked Ooma to port my number.  While I was waiting for the port I forwarded my old VOIP phone to the Ooma number.  It took 3 days to complete the port.  The first call I took after the port was dropped.  Pretty much every day after that for two to three weeks I would get one dropped call a day.  It was very frustrating.  I got zero dropped calls with my old VOIP phone.  Were it not for this I would give Ooma five stars.  In fairness over the past two to three weeks I have had zero dropped calls.  Not sure what is going on but it seems to be hit or miss. Overall Ooma does what I want it to do.  I signed up for the premium service and my house has never been quieter.  Very very few spam calls are getting through their blocking.  Overall I'm happy with it.
3,Day 1 - Setup issues.  Despite being advertised as configurable via an app I could not get my phone and the app to connect to the device using bluetooth as needed.  After multiple tries I ended up configuring it by connecting it to my laptop using the supplied LAN cable.  (Fortunately one of my laptops has a LAN port - many new laptops do not come with them anymore.)Also I notice that when dialing the area code along with the number you must first dial a "1" otherwise it will only use the first 7 digits you dial which can result in a failed call.  Considering most systems these days can recognize that a 10-digit number in the US includes the area code Ooma is a little behind on tech in this area.Finally I notice that the base unit gets a bit warm.  The engineers may want to revise the power ratings on the circuitry so it does not get as warm.So stars off for (1) failed configuration via the app and (2) requiring the use of the leading "1" when including the area code in the dialed number.  I may update this as I get a little more experience with the device.
4,--- Updated review:I had an issue where OOMA was doing DHCP and kicking off my other devices. I turned it OFF. I wish they did this by default. It took me a while to figure out it was serving DHCP I didn't think of it.--- Original reviewI used to pay $15/month for verizon phone services and I got about 30+ telemarketing calls a day and I could not take it anymore. Verizon kept saying they "couldnt do anything" but I never signed up for ANYTHING with the number and the phone calls were just getting worse. We never answered the phone and we didn't have a voicemail. so whatever.I first tried OBIHAI with google voice. It worked pretty well but people complained about the voice quality every once and a while.A friend recommended OOMA and the quality seems better.OBIHAI is free there are no charges no 911 charges you just buy the device and that is it.Unfortunately with OOMA they charge you for the government fees / 911 whatever. It is $5/month for me. I don't need that service but there is no choice.MAKE SURE TO OPT OUT of the PREMIER service or they will start billing you $9 / month (and maybe the $5 on top of that so $15/month)The device is easy to setup. It seems decent from a reliability standpoint so far.I have owned this about 2 months and bought it. Nobody paid me to write / review anything.
4,The Ooma does what we need it to do! I was happy to be able to hook up Panasonic landline phones to it. The customer support online and is okay but quick to end the chat if it detects I’ve “been away too long”-that’s annoying LOL. Getting it initially set up was a PAIN. Do you hear me??? Something with ensuring the WiFi is disconnected when the Ooma is connected to my laptop via Ethernet. Sounds as simple a click or two but it did not work right away and was very discouraging. I will say it does reboot itself if accidentally disconnected from power (the outlet it’s connected to is controlled by a light switch that was accidentally shut off a couple of times) and that is a huge PLUS since I get to avoid fooling around with it and the laptop. Sound quality is just okay - a little fuzzy. But all in all I’m pleased with my purchase.
4,After a little hiccup in the initial setup our OOMA is working fine and was a bargain compared to our previous phone line through our cable company.  The OOMA basically paid for itself in 2-3 months.  I do wish there was an better and easier way to block the telemarketers and scammers though.  Also watch your billing because OOMA automatically switched our service to premium after the first month $15 vs. $5 and I had to request it to be put back to the standard level.
5,Inexpensive way to have a home phone that has great value and quality firts
4,Now I have a great home phone service where home phone isn't easily available anymore. I didn't think I would like this but this isn't your normal VOIP service. If you purchase a Linx and connect your phone to that instead of to the Telo base this unit will function just like digital POTS. I work from home and unlike the other services this works (with the phone plugged to a connected Linx).You don't have to have the best internet to enjoy the best sound quality (on both ends). Satellite won't work but the only other option where I live is dialup or mobile broadband. With my mobile broadband router I see speeds only up to about 40 mbps and as slow as 20 mbps. Even at the lowest speed I have not experienced any sound degradation.Although I purchased the Telo Air I do have an ethernet cable plugged into it for a more stable internet connection. Of course the Linx devices I have are wireless but I often times forget as they seem to connect instantly when I press the talk button. Also with POTS and cable POTS I've always had to use a more expensive phone and an amplifier to be heard well with all customers and some personal calls. With this I have to keep the volume down to about 25% (without an amplifier) so that it isn't too loud.If you use powerline networking be sure to plug this into a surge protector for best results.
4,After 3 days its working great.  I started out with a wired Ethernet connection and had that working in the 15 minutes they claim.  Calls were clear and both incoming and outgoing worked without a hitch - connected to a legacy AT&T touch tone phone I've kept for testing the land line.Next I configured WiFi use and disconnected the Ethernet cable. Still works fine.  If it continues to do so for a week I'll cancel my land line.The reason I deduct 1 star is because the documentation leaves gaps in what you need to know.  For example they don't tell you what to do after you finish the WiFi configuration (e.g. unplug what and when) or whether you need to start with a wired internet connection - not a step-by-step clear set of instructions. Further I used a laptop with WiFi off and an Ethernet wired-to-Telo Air connection - but they don't tell you if you need to configure TCP/IP on the laptop for DHCP or a static IP address or a gateway or subnet mask or anything.  My connection to Telo configuration worked but I'm nor quite sure how/why the never used/configured Ethernet port worked for TCP/IP communications to the Telo.  And what if this port was previously configured (e.g. static IP address such as 10.x.x.x) - would it still have worked?  If the glossy brochure doesn't fully explain then it should point to a web link that does explain.Finally the OOMA web site description of what you get isn't a match to what is in the box - the box's glossy card does say what you should have in the box (no plug in WiFi adapter - not needed).But given those issues the device does work better than I expected!
5,My kids suggested this would work great at our summer home for a phone and they were correct. Works wonderfully
5,I needed a wireless phone adapter because there was no wired internet where the phone needed to be. The company I had been with did not supply a wireless VOIP device. Also tech support was by email only. I looked into Ooma and found their prices were better than my old phone company. And the device for them was very reasonable in price at Amazon. It was very easy to set up the account and connect the device wirelessly using the Ooma setup app on my iPhone. If you do a year of the premium service porting your number is included plus the Ooma app allows you to answer the phone via the smart phone when you are not home which I believe is only available on the premium plan. Voice quality is great and we enjoy many more features than our old phone service for less money. If you choose not to do the premium plan they only charge taxes and fees less than $6.00 a month in our area. I needed to call tech support only once and that was because after the number was ported caller ID showed the temporary number they assigned before my number was ported. I did not know it but I could have changed the setting in my online account and fixed the issue. But the great thing was I was talking to a live tech support person in about a minute.
5,Got this to replace my Verizon Home Phone (cell signal based) after I got a better broadband connection. After you buy this hardware basic phone service is free except for paying the usual taxes that are imposed on any phone line. It comes with a free 30 day trial of their Premier service which adds many great features and costs $9.99 monthly plus those taxes.  I'm going to keep the Premier plan and still save $10 a month compared to my Verizon device and I'm getting a lot of extra features included in that plan including good spam call blocking  caller ID with name and a cell-phone app that allows you to make calls from your cell phone wherever it has a good broadband WiFi signal and without using up your cell minutes and data allowance.  This model the Telo Air is able to connect via WiFi to your broadband router.  The standard Telo model requires a network cable connecting it to the router.
5,Only reason for return was due to Tech support successfully helping me fix glitch I had in my original Ooma box that I thought had slowly died.Love our Ooma.
5,Well it has been years since I bought this Ooma for my mother-in-law in her 90's at an independent care facility.  There is wireless available from the business office and her room is maybe 50 feet away.  The wireless signal receiver ability is marginal but almost always delivers the voice calls.  But there are line drops and times where callers can be heard but not talked to.  I like Ooma's buy the device and only pay the tax on the phone service.  It costs my mother-in-law barely over $6 a month.  Another company name you would recognize would cost 10x that for a land-line.  I also own an older wired Ooma that I almost stopped service on but living in a remote area having a backup phone is never a bad idea.  The fact you can use regular home phones is a real plus for older folks who missed the cell phone transition.  Ooma's voice messaging caller ID and a bunch of other features make it a good deal a great value.
2,Installation:  Connecting the device wirelessly through the setup app doesn’t work.  You have to connect your computer/laptop to the Ooma device using the provided ethernet cord.  After configuring the device on the setup page online it took about 15 minutes for the Ooma device to be active.  Setup wasn't hard.Phone calls:  The quality of the phone calls was bad.  Every other word I spoke was garbled and shoddy.  One of the features advertised with the Ooma device was crystal clear phone calls and it was disappointing to find out this wasn’t the case.  I have excellent internet speed so that wasn’t a factor and I tested the quality on various phones. A technician informed me that due to a very secure wireless internet connection call quality can be affected due to network ports being blocked.  He then proceeded to tell me he didn’t want to accidentally mess up my wireless connection so he would send directions on how to implement this procedure instead.  The email sent was not helpful.  It was loaded with network jargon and zero directions.Device:  The device powers on then off every two hours.  Then the red light would blink for 15-20 minutes.Summary:  Ooma should be upfront about wireless security issues that affect the performance of the device and how you would have to employ network port forwarding in order tor the device to work properly if you have a secure internet connection.  Even when doing that it's not guaranteed that would rectify the problem.  This VOIP has potential but it didn’t work as advertised.  I will be returning.
5,I am a satisfied 8+ year customer of Ooma and was not paid or given anything for this review.I installed my new Ooma Telo Air yesterday. I upgraded from an Original Ooma Telo I bought in 2011. It took quite nearly an entire day for Ooma Customer Service to transfer my account to the new device and they did not contact me as promised but once it was activated it took only 20 minutes to update its software and I was in service.  I added an Ooma HD3 phone but mainly use a Panasonic cordless phone system with my Ooma.The Sound Quality is and always has been great and the cost is wonderful (taxes and fees only for Basic Service about $15 total per month for Premium Service). For the last couple of years Ooma has been my only "land-line" or home service saving me more than enough money to pay for the upgraded equipment which should give me many more years of service.NOTE:  If you port your number over to your Ooma do it with at least 20 days of service left on your old phone provider. Sometimes your local phone company does not want to give up its numbers especially to Ooma. Be firm with your local provider and tell them to allow the number to be ported before you start the process. And you may have to do it again if the first attempt by Ooma is unsuccessful. Ooma could streamline the porting process on their end but what I have just described is NOT Ooma's fault.
5,Very easy to set up. Wifi connection is strong and steady which supports crystal clear calls and error free faxing. Only thing I dislike is the disinformation. There is a monthly bill for the so-called free calls. Very small but a fee nonetheless. Having said that it's still a great deal. I LOVE IT. Obi italk devices by Google were too much work to set up and we're continuously discontinued and needed to be replaced.
1,4-5-22 UPDATE - WISH I COULD LOWER MY INITIAL SCORE OF 1 STAR!  IN ADDITION TO THE POOR TECHNOLOGY NOTED BELOW OOMA IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT ASKS YOU FOR A CREDIT CARD "JUST IN CASE" THEN BEGINS A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.  STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS!!!With the ease and seemlessness of wifi connectivity to every device in your house these days (tv computer cell phone alexa refrigerator etc.) you would think that a wifi-connected voip phone would be a slam dunk.  It's not.  I spent over four hours on the phone with Ooma's technical support over the course of three days and never could get the unit to connect to my wifi.  I give the tech support staff credit for sticking with me trying lots of fixes calling me back when they told me they would and offering to replace my unit.  In the end I just don't think this unit is ready for prime time.The cell phone set-up app is very buggy and bombs out or locks up when it gets confused.  Tech support's fallback is to connect directly to the router or to a laptop via an ethernet cable.  In my case I couldn't go to the router and my laptop doesn't have an ethernet port.  I had to borrow my laptop docking station from work which does have an ethernet port.  Both my laptop and the phone app could see the Ooma device and the wireless network but just couldn't complete the connection.After many rounds of the standard tech support fixes:  "turn it on and off again" "unplug and reconnect the ethernet cable" "delete and reinstall the app" I finally gave up and returned the device.  I'm going to buy a cheap cell phone with a basic plan for my mom instead.
5,My router/wifi device is downstairs and my home office upstairs. I was worried that the Telo Air would be too far away to pick up the wifi signal. It was not. The Telo Air 2 works great no static. It was easy to set up the transfer of my phone number was painless and I am saving money. What more could you ask for.
3,The book say to download the app to quickly get your Telo working but I don't have a smartphone to run an app!  Go to page 16 to use your computer.  Connect the Telo to the computer and launch a browser  go to setup.ooma.com but wait Google will not go there because of security.  I finally got around that problem but now calls will not go through. Tech support is a joke.  I tried using Chat and he say call Tech Support.  I called Tech Support and was sent around circles with press 2 for this problem press 3 for this problem and after a couple of calls I figured how to get a live person.  That live person said try the phone again and call back.  Another time Tech Support said reboot and then try again.  They were not any help.  Part of the problem is the problem messages you get on your phone have nothing to do with the problem; for example my phone said "Check Phone Line" but there wasn't a problem with the phone line.  It was the device updating the firmware.  You can't use the phone when it is updating (thanks Tech Support for that info.)  The book doesn't tell you that.  If I sound like I'm frustrated I am.  Currently it is working and does sound clearer than my current phone company.
5,Love this product
5,My mother's old ooma had major connectivity issues after a week of summer thunderstorms. No matter what I did to get it back online it would go back offline within an hour or two. I figured it was time to replace it as it is probably 4 or 5 years old by now. I decided to go with the telo 2 air to cut down on the number of network devices daisy-chained to each other in the tv hutch. Amazon delivered on a Sunday which was helpful in getting my elderly mom her phone back without another day's delay. Setup was easy. I had to call customer service to transfer service to the new device; this was actually quite painless compared to other customer service lines. The rep was quick helpful patient and friendly despite the fact that my mobile had terrible signal and the call kept going in/out. Once he had service transferred we hung up and I set up wireless via the "ooma setup" app from the apple app store. This was quick and brainless. The device then performed system updates and was online within 20 minutes. My mom tested a call to family and quality was clear. I'm incredibly pleased considering some of the other poorer ratings on this listing. I wonder what was different between my setup and theirs... or maybe time will tell a different story. I'll be sure to update if there end up being issues.
1,I've set up numerous electronics in our home most are wifi based but this product and experience were the worst. The instructions were straightforward and I thought things might go well at first until the final step where the red blinking light would not stop. Called tech support multiple times and after hours of them not being able to resolve the problem I decided that I was done with this product and company I decided to cancel. That opened up another world of problems multiple customer support reps not letting me cancel on my first calls back. Several calls later the rep ignored my request to cancel and told me several times they would ship another I told her I didn't want another and to cancel my account. She finally said she would cancel the account. But two days into this mess and a charge then show up on my credit card. You are required to create an account with them before you even have the device up and running. Save yourself the nightmare and find another solution. I'm going to add another line to my wireless use an old iPhone and just pair it with my already existing Bluetooth-enabled cordless phones in the house which ends up being practically the same cost as this Ooma setup. Oh and porting is free with my wireless company vs the $40 Ooma was going to charge.
3,The product itself seems okay now that it is working but the initial setup left a lot to be desired.  I initially tried to set up the product by using the manufacturer's setup app in the Google play store but the app was "buggy" and useless.  The app allowed me to enter all of my information to set up my account but consistently failed to respond when I selected "activate" on the last step.  I then tried to activate my account using my mobile browser and ran into the exact same issue there.  I finally was able to activate my account by using a browser on my PC.  The next challenge was to connect the device to Wi-Fi.  This was no small feat as it was not addressed AT ALL in the set up instructions included in the packaging!  After searching the Ooma website I found a user's manual for the Telo Air but no manual for this product the Telo Air 2.  After a bit of troubleshooting and physically connecting the device to my PC I was finally able to access the software on the device and complete the setup.  It is now working fine in wireless mode but the requirement to physically connect to a computer to initiate the wireless setup (come on guys it's 2018) and the lack of a manual in the product packaging OR online for this model (the Telo Air 2) is completely unsatisfactory.  What should have been a 15 minute setup took nearly 3 hours due to a poorly developed app and bad logistics.  There is no excuse for sending a new model to market without updating your user manuals.
3,I've had Charter/Spectrum VoIP for years and it has been flawless (but expensive) I switched over to fiber and decided to stick with VoIP for voice and fax which led me to Ooma. Set up over wifi was absolutely dismal and unusable cutting out about every 2-3 seconds on a 500mbs line so I had to hard wire it into router so save some $$ and just get the wired one. Phone service works fine. I have an all-in-one printer/fax plugged into it and that's where it went sideways. It's hit or miss whether a fax can be sent or received. Again never had that problem with VoIP through the Charter modem. Customer care wasn't much help as they'll just read to you what their website says to do- which I had already done to no avail. Faxing won't be a deal-breaker for most people but if you run a home office and have a traditional fax- DO NOT go with Ooma. If you're just looking for simple phone service- then it'll work.
5,I gave Tech Support a lower rating only because I did not use it. The four star rating on the install process was only because it was not clear to me before purchasing this product that Ooma would supply a local exchange telephone number during the install process. I spent many hours researching how to get a phone number inexpensively for my mom's new residence and came very close to selecting MajicJack instead. All of that said I am totally sold on this product. Wifi is provided where my mom lives however she has memory issues and teaching her to use even the simplest mobile phone solutions did not work. She needed a regular old style push button phone that worked exactly like the older land lines many ( or some ) of us grew up with. The Ooma Telo Air is the perfect solution for her. In her case the monthly cost will be less than $7 a month. Combined with the purchase cost this solution will likely be saving money over a mobile phone in about 6 months. Very happy I found this and decided to move forward and purchase it.
3,I’ve owned an Ooma device since 2012 and purchased a new to device to replace my 9 year-old one. While the Ooma device usually works well it’s important that you have sufficient speed in your internet connection if you plan on talking while somebody in your household is streaming TV or participating in virtual video calls. Prior to having a 1 Gig connection there were minor call quality issues for the party I was calling.Activating your device is by telephone only which is problematic if you don’t have a cell phone available. Just as important activation is not possible after 5pm PT. Chat help is likely to be frustrating as they can do very little. Also they are using a script and will not deviate.So if you are a first time Ooma user you'll definitely want to activate the device during a morning when you have all day available to contact telephone support (on your cell phone) to resolve any issues.My replacement device is still not functioning and chat support wrote to wait 24-48 hours for “escalated” help. I mean really. Returning the device to amazon is still an option.
5,Purchased this about a week ago to jettison my Verizon landline phone which was running $60 month! What's nice is you can initiate a free number port of your old phone number to Ooma with a 1 year subscription to their Premier service. Premier offers some nice bells and whistles and for $9.99 a month its less than what Verizon was charging me for caller-ID!The number porting process was completed in just 5 days for my old phone number. The Ooma site indicates porting an existing phone number can be up to three or four weeks. Much of the porting time depends on the old carrier.The device itself resembles an answering machine and indeed basic voicemail review buttons are included on the base unit. The finish on the device is a nice sort of rubberized matte black. Looks very stylish with the blue glowing logo.Unlike a traditional landline the Ooma gives you the option of customizing the way your calls are made and the way voicemail is handled. most of these options can be adjusted on the my.oom.com website. Some of the more hardware-centric options down to the level of how brightly you want the Ooma logo to glow can be set by navigating to the Ooma Telo Air's device web page. You can get there by plugging in an ethernet cable between a computer and the HOME port on the Ooma and using a browser to navigate to address 172.27.35.1.If you disconnect your old landline phone connection physically from the outside at the Demarc or junction box you can then connect a phone cord between the Ooma Telo and any phone jack in your home and the Ooma will power the old internal phone wires in the house enabling you to use your old phones with the Ooma.All these neat features and I'm saving over $50 a month compared to my old Verizon landline. That's the best part of all.
5,I got this to replace my standard Ooma so I would not have to run a cable to the box basically place wherever there's a plug in for the wall wart.  Tech support helped transfer my account to the new unit.  No hassell no waiting.
1,The service is fine but the software is garbage.Upgraded to this version of the Telo to get built-in bluetooth and wireless support. Wireless setup is easy though you need to install a special Ooma-setup app on your phone (not the normal Ooma app) to do that. Bluetooth setup is insanely difficult. You can't do it through the app. Instead you need to actually hook up your computer directly to the telo with a wire then connect to the telo's built-in web server (which it does not expose to the wireless network). If you try that and follow the directions in the ooma tech note (which tells you to go to http://setup.ooma.com in a browser) it won't work. Instead you need to type the IP address for the telo itself into the browser. Don't know how to find that on a PC but on a mac turn off wireless just to make sure you're talking over the wire connect the telo to your computer with a wire using the "home" port on the telo bring up the Network preferences on your mac click on the active network connector (it will have a green dot next to it) and the Router address is on the resulting page. Type that into your browser with an http:// in front of it (e.g. http://172.27.35.1) Those numbers may or may not be different in your device.The Alexa skill is completely worthless. It gives you no real control over voice mail (all you can do is listen to everything. You can't skip for example.). It does not recognize names in my contacts (which have been uploaded to the Oooma site—I checked and it helpfully pronounces the name perfectly when it tells me that it can't find it.) When it fails to make the call it asks "is there anything else I can do for you." I say "no" and it tries to find the name "no" in the address book. You need to let it time out to get the skill to give up control of Alexa. You cannot tell Ooma to answer calls and use the Alexa as a speakerphone. Worthless.Tech support is marginal. Nobody can answer or do anything on chat and when you call the person who answers the phone can't answer technical questions. The online instructions for doing things are not aligned with current version of the web software or the app so are also not very helpful.
4,Our Ooma Telo is very close to conventional landline quality at one sixth or less the cost of a landline from AT&T or Spectrum. There were a couple of speedbumps initially: an echo was eliminated when I moved the unit away from a surround sound speaker and there was a problem with some calls being sent directly to voicemail without ringing the phone (a real problem when a doctor is calling you !). The latter problem went away by itself. Our other older Ooma Telo at our other location is not quite as good: lesser voice quality with an echo and outages due to lousy Spectrum internet service (not Ooma's fault but certainly a limitation with VoIP).
5,Easy to use!
5,Evey bit as good as AT&T voip service nd alot less expensive.
5,Sound quality spotty at times. Phenominal savings in on phone bill.
1,Update: After porting my number and using the system for a couple of months they removed my ported number and returned my account to its temporary number without telling me. I am forced to believe this company is nothing more than a high pressure sales group peddling sub-standard services to try and up-sell customers to the more expensive plans.  I can't find any reputable residential VoIP or virtual phone number company. They all are geared towards business plans. Google voice would not port my long time residential number so I am giving it up as not worth the expense and hassle.Update:  After leaving it sit with a blinking read light which the manual describes as inoperable it eventually starting working.  From the instructions I expected the unit to start working after booting in about 1-5 minutes and not go into the blinking red inoperable state .  It actually took more like 20-30 minutes sitting in the "inoperable" state before it just started to work.The issue with devices like this is poor communication.  I have dealt with many devices with poor documentation but as long as they work like another device in the same category I am usually able to figure them out.This device has poor if any customer service and the device does not act normally.  Issuing a blinking read light that communicates the device will not work while in actuality it is still trying to connect communicates the entirely wrong thing.  The blinking red light described as inoperable in the manual actually means "My first attempts at configuration did not work but I am still trying".I am awarding one more star for actually working.  I will award one more star if my number actually ports as described.  One more if my "trial" premium membership expires with out trouble. Reviews I have read indicate this company utilizes aggressive marketing tactics and I am expecting trouble.  I can't in good conscious ever award more than 4 stars because the instructions manual online and phone support are all unacceptably poor.Original Review:Does not work out of the box. No live costumer service on weekends. I will not be missing work to try and set this up. I am a 30 year software engineer and bad tech ticks me off. This is the worst tech I have had to deal with in a long time.
5,This is by far the best VOIP for business or home use. I upgraded to the Telo Air 2 and have been using Ooma for years. I have tried many others but nothing compares to this. The only downfall is that it doesn't have text messaging.
5,Decided to pull the trigger and but the Ooma Air 2 wireless and it's fantastic. Was paying 36.95 monthly for our basic landline here in Tucson now we only are paying 5.04 a month. I will now save 382.92 yearly now thanks to Ooma. I had my phone number ported to Ooma (for 39.99 plus taxes and city fees which made it 47.00) and it was a breeze. The folks at Ooma kept me updated the whole way through the porting process via email and customer service was very friendly when I called about setting up my Ooma. Setup was a breeze but out of the box my Ooma had a purple flower on it for like a day or two it took a long time to download its software update for some reason (and our internet is super fast) but everything else with setup was a breeze. I would totally recommend buying this to anyone that wants to keep their home line and number and not pay high phone company bills anymore. Oh also the clarity has been perfect with this unit no echo or static it's clear as a regular landline. I think the people what are having set up problems are not following instructions. It's rocket science it's easy to do one must be patient and the folks at Ooma are willing to help.
1,Bought this for my mom’s place (an independent living unit) as an alternative to a landline phone system.  Attempted to install it - it wouldn’t connect to the wireless internet service provided by the facility.Spoke with tech support.  After a few questions and back-and-forth he advised the unit only works with 2.8GHz wireless.  My mom’s wireless internet (the only option she has there) is 5 GHz.  Nowhere in the description of the product on Amazon does it state the product is incompatible with 5 GHz service.I’ve initiated a return of the product.  I wanted to also cancel the Ooma account since I wasn’t going to be using their product.  You can’t cancel online - you have to call them and speak with an account rep (an initial customer service rep and a transfer to another actually).After explaining the issue yet again and asking to cancel the account they wanted to have me speak with a higher-level service tech which I refused.  That would have been pointless since they’d already acknowledged their product was incompatible with our internet signal.  Finally they cancelled the account.In summation:1. Ooma wasted my time by not putting in the description of the product that it only works with 2.8 GHz wireless.2. Ooma wasted my time by not putting in the literature that accompanies the product that it only works with 2.8 GHz wireless.3. Ooma wasted my time by not allowing an online cancellation of the account.4. Ooma wasted my time by making me jump through hoops (yes they are small hoops) to get my account cancelled.
5,Done with $90.00 AT&T bills. I have one for myself and now my baby boomer age mom has this device. If you are looking for a landline replacement with tons of features for a few bucks a month this is your item. Lots of YouTube vloggers helped me make my purchase as well as Amazon.com reviews. I had a VoiP phone with a cable company and I constantly got unwanted calls and certainly no features like what Ooma is offering here.Customer service from Ooma was great and explained all questions I had before purchasing. Love the $5 and change monthly price and the chance to use the premier service for 60 days free of charge ($9.99) monthly value. Love the no contact as well and the reliability of customer service and exact same monthly charges. International calling is great with this product since the device is sturdy and very affordable for like fractions of a cent on the dollar. I highly recommend this product.ProsLove the extra 911 call features and ways to block unwanted callsCustomer service was greatOnly charged local taxes and fees according to your zip codeConsApp is free but you have to add your credit card before the app download is complete; charges taxes/fees for your zip code
5,Finally gave up my home phone which was costing about 50.00 a month. This is super easy to set up and costs about 7.00 a month. I do getan echo once in a while for the 1st few seconds but it's always resolved on its own. Inconspicuous on my desk. Love it!
5,I have used the original Ooma for years and decided to give the Ooma Tele Air 2 a try.  You need to use the Ooma Setup app (which is different than the main Ooma app).  The Air can be placed anywhere you have power and a wi-fi signal.  Remember to be patient while the light is flashing red  it takes 10-15 minutes to configure anytime you unplug.  Port of a new number from Comcast only took 3 days.
4,I give this a 4 star rating as I hate having to call tech support when installing a new item. On this product if you have an older unit and want to upgrade you can't do it online.Apparently the number of the unit is locked into your account and must be changed by tech.So wifi/bluetooth for me was not a problem. Just the need to call tech.The sound is ok. Not the best but good enough for a back up phone.
4,Pro'sArrived quickly easy to set up able to pick a number and use my existing Panasonic digital cordless phone set .ConsQuality of calls not as good as cable digital (maybe unfriendly Fios that have been throttling my service to force me to upgrade and buy new contract) but most disappointing and why they lost a start is the Free service is not free.  It states you can buy credits for international calling - so I wasn't surprised on set up that they asked for credit card). At no point during set up or in what I read in product details did it say there was a charge for anything so I was surprised that as soon as I activated my card was hit with $5.81 charge.  So now I am looking at the service to see why and there are monthly fees - just no cost for calls - they are not upfront about that.  SO my triple bundle phone is only $10 so now I spend $130 to save $4 a month :(
5,Had Vonage from another state and a local landline after I moved. Between the two - $90 a month. I kept putting off dumping either one or both and Ooma kept popping up while I looked for alternatives. I back-burnered the whole concept for a year or so. Finally fed up with the last nickle & dime increase from both providers and ordered the Ooma.Having my 'Line 2' in the house already setup for Vonage usage it was an easy hardware switch over. After trying it for a week or two I dumped Vonage and signed up for the premium service on Ooma for the free number porting. Porting my landline over took less than a week. $6.46 a month (in my area)? Loving that and the $10 extra/month for premium is fine with me too. Some nice features in the premium service.Why did I wait so long to buy this... I've been a happy camper for the last few months that it's been in service. Had a minor issue early on but tech support was stellar and quickly resolved it. No problems at all.
3,I tried to get wifi to work.  Spend hours with tech support but even though I could connect to my wifi OOMA wouldn’t work.  Finally I just moved it next to the router and used an Ethernet cord.  Worked great.  I’d recommend spending less and buy the Ethernet model only.
4,The device it’s self appears to work well but documentation is terrible.  As long as you want to use the device with a cable you are fine but when you want to connect the device using the wifi feature the documentation disappears and you are really left up to your devices to stumble through apps to figure it out.  You cannot activate or setup wifi in the Ooma app have have to install a second app Ooma Telo Setup (or as it says on my Ipad “telo setup”.  The app is very dated and not easy to use with no step by step walkthough by the app.  If you need info it sends you to a user manual setup page with really no helpful info.  If you are passable with computers and wifi give it a try.  If not stick to the wired option.
1,Product design = 1. Large footprint dated design. Quality control is nonexistent; expect to have uneven ports construction that does not align properly and a very flimsy design. Bottom line is that a new piece of hardware shouldn't click and shift when holding it like they didn't quite finish putting it together.  Looks like something from the late 90's and feels like the knockoff tech you see at the night market in Shanghai.  Maybe they sent me a defunct unit but the rest of the ecosystem that the Telo 2 operates in did not increase my confidence in their product.App interface = 1. I'd give this a 0 if possible. App interface is redundant links are broken in many areas and does not appear written in a localized format....i.e. they did not use an proficient English speaker to craft their end user interface of help manual.Tech support = 1. Online tech support make Comcast look like a shining example of service.  You'd be hard pressed to resolve a technical issue as the tech support agent seems perplexed by the basics of their own software and pushed hard for me to call technical support. No problem I understand the need to escalate to a Tier 2 tech however as soon as you bring up providing a ticket number they say "none needed". Not a good sign because now you are requiring me to go through the process with your supervisor that I just went through with you. From an operations perspective this shows a significant lack of sophistication in their operation. At this point I'm returning the product because they seem to have cheaped out at every level. I'll buy something from the competition that reflects investment into their entire operation vs a clunky product with zero back end support.Overall = 1Dated hardware clunky interface that's several generations years behind their competition in terms of features. No  advanced user interface if you need to troubleshoot it. I understand you want to make this a product that works for the majority of users.....but it doesn't and you've locked out users who could solve issues on their own. App itself has a number of security concerns which immediately red flag it.  For fun I let the IS team poke at the device and their comment was "kill it with fire".
1,I bought this for my Mom so that she could keep the phone number she's had for 60+ years even though she's moved to a new city.  I use a wired Ooma at home and it's great.  I bought the wireless Ooma since there is excellent Wifi in her apartment (> 50Mbps) but no nearby ethernet jack.There is something seriously wrong with this device's wireless driver.  The phone would stay online for a day or two and then mysteriously go offline giving me a flashing red light.  Turning the machine off and on didn't help.  Performing a hard reset on the device didn't help.  The only thing that would fix the device would telling the device to forget the WiFi network and then after a minute re-attach it.  Examining the device using their bluetooth software I could see that the device was successfully connected to the WiFi network just not talking to Ooma.And reseting the WiFi network.  Sure I can do that.  But my Mom can't and the device needs to work reliably when I'm not there.I made at least five calls to customer support.  (That's how I learned the disconnect WiFi trick.)  I was asked questions about my firewall.  (Her home has a basic consumer-grade router; the device should be able to handle it.) I got asked about WiFi signal.  (About 25x faster than VoIP should need.) I got asked about congestion.  (I've got a browser open to find your number that's it.) But nothing to explain why Ooma kept on disconnecting.For now I've bought a 50ft ethernet cable and managed to plug it in.  I'm hoping that it will now stay connected.  But why did I pay extra for a device with WiFi?
4,Purchased this to get rid of Hughes Net phone service. It was easy to set up via wifi connection to a LinkZone 2 modem with good sound quality and reliability. It took a while for my transferred phone number to propagate throughout the system so caller ID was correctly showing it on outgoing calls but that issue eventually resolved within a month. Works perfectly with existing Panasonic wireless home phone set.
5,The worst! Works for 30 minutes and drops calls. And good luck getting that to start up.
5,Bottom line:  Clear reliable telephone calls at a very low monthly cost (< $5.00/mos).  Would buy again.Pros:  Setup is very very simple | Equivalent sound quality whether the device is connected via WiFi or ethernet | You can make calls using your home telephone number over any WiFi connected device using the Ooma app.  This is very handy while traveling when cell coverage is limited | Low monthly cost (< $5.00/mos) - compare this to the $25/mos charged by Time Warner | Porting my number over was ridiculously easy and hassle-free | Easily connects to your mobile phone via Bluetooth so it can serve as your home handset if you so desire | This device has built-in Bluetooth and WiFi so you can ditch the bulky dongles and save space and moneyCons:  Ooma does not allow clearing of phone logs (so silly) | The blue indicator light may be too bright for use in a bedroom at night |  I would say phone service is 99% reliable.  In the past month service went offline for a 10-15 minutes at random times. Not a big deal for me since I can use my mobile phone but heavy phone users might get annoyed | The Bluetooth range is much shorter than advertised.
5,This device works well. Good sound quality and no deadtime waiting to continue a conversation. Even on a difficult wifi signal. Setup was easy and quick. Customer service was fast and effective.
4,The Ooma Air has substantially cut down on the number of junk calls we used to get.The only issue I have had is it seems to lose it's connect with my router occasionally. Since i use it for business this is a substantial problem. I will try moving it closer to the router and use a cable to hook it up.
1,Two things that I'm disappointed with;1) I've had my OOMA for a little over 2 months.  In that time its gone offline over a dozen times.  At first I thought it may be the router (its 20 feet from the router in a straight unobstructed line). I needed to upgrade my router anyway but the new one made no difference. I tried 2.5GHZ and 5GHz settings on the ooma but neither made a difference. It just simple goes offline when it wants. I had to mount it vertically so I can visually see the from light and see if its red (offline).2) Just a heads up call blocking (one would think would be a standard function) requires "Ooma Premier"i (an additional monthly fee). This includes not only the useless robokiller BUT the ability to block all calls except the ones in your contact list. So Essentially if you don't pay the additional monthly fee you're open to spam calls. Had I know this upfront I would NEVER have purchased this.I'm VERY disappointed in this device.  YMMV.
5,Setup is very easy although there is one or two confusing questions in the on-line form. Your old number can be ported over but if you don't subscribe to their premier service there will be a one-time-cost of about $40 to port it. It did not take long at all for them to port the number from my provider to ooma. Have had this for a few months now & here's what I learned:  1) You're getting the premier service whether you choose it or not (they will activate it regardless).  2) Once its set up (assuming you don't want the premier service)  you need to log into your ooma account & turn off pre-paid credit because they will charge you $10 a month.  3) Again assuming you didn't want premier service you'll need to call 1-888-711-6662 and tell them to turn it off. Despite these hidden fees (which can be turned off) all in all I think its great & it has reduced my monthly phone bill from $40 to $5.
3,Cuts in and out I started getting more spam calls after transporting my phone number.Don’t like the app and I don’t like it ties into cellular.
5,I'm a new Ooma customer and this new version of the Telo Air is great.  It was easily connected to my Wifi using the Android Telo installation app.I also signed on for a year's worth of the Premium service plan and had my local phone number ported for free.  This is a great option as I plan on making great use of the advanced call blocking features and the Android Ooma App for making and receiving calls while out of the US.My local phone number was ported in less than a week from AT&T.  At which point the old landline service was disconnected at the entry point. This made it safe to plug the new Telo Air into any handy phone jack in the house to provide service to all my other phones. All this worked without a hitch so far.  Just remember you must have internet service.  And if that internet service is DSL a whole house changeover will be trickier since it uses the phone line.I do wish the Android Ooma App had a few more features.  Like for example not being forced to use the same ring tone as my cellular number.
5,We had a land line with a number that was widely used for more than 40 years so we had to keep the number.  Once we liberated ourselves from our telecom company being our ISP getting rid of them as a telephone company was an upgrade in savings and in line quality.  Because this unit from Ooma works over WiFi we were able to place it right where our cordless base unit was (far from our router) and then plug the base unit into the Ooma unit instead of the wall.  Call quality is excellent the number transfer was easy and the added features of better junk caller screening and the ability to use the Ooma app on my cellphone to manage things is a major functional upgrade.  No rating for tech support since I have not needed anything yet but major kudos fr the provided instructions.
5,love it
2,I had the original Ooma Hub which worked well. I (to my regret) replaced it with the Telo Air 2 and the Ooma handsets. The purported advantages were:1) Doesn't need to be connected to your system by cable; can connect via wifi (meaning I can move the Ooma box from my desk and reduce clutter);2) Doesn't need to be placed in front of your router as the old Hub was; and3) Can connect wirelessly to the Ooma Handsets reducing clutter by getting rid of the Panasonic phone base station I previously used.Unfortunately none of these advantages have worked out. If connected via wifi the Ooma's sound quality suffered a lot. Same with connecting it after my router rather than before. Even with a very fast internet connection sound quality was garbled so I now have to run my internet first to the Ooma then to everything else. Finally the Ooma handsets have been a big disappointment; lots of problems where a handset doesn't ring when you get an incoming call or it does ring but when you hit the answer button it doesn't actually answer. I've worked with customer support but so far without success. And with a phone you just want it to work.Maybe overall this is better than paying a monthly fee for a landline (though some in my household don't think so). But it's definitely NOT worth upgrading versus the old Ooma Hub. Just keep that and forget about the new features.
1,I bought this device in order to allow my aged disabled father to have phone connection in an area where it is not possible to run a regular landline.  He is not capable of using a cell phone because he is legally blind so I need to have a way for him to be able to communicate with his friends and few relatives who are still alive.The Ooma device is a disaster! It randomly disconnects from the Internet and even when it IS connected (the blue flower device on top is illuminated) it sometimes produces a buzzing noise that makes it impossible to have a conversation or it cuts off all audio leaving the phone "connected" on both ends but without the ability for either party to hear.I contacted Ooma and they told me that my lag (ping time) was too long to use this device.  Well you know this is something that should be put in the listing if it is true. The support rep said that a ping over 10 msec is too long. It's funny because I can stream movies or conduct Zoom meetings with a 38-45 msec ping time but can't conduct a simple phone call??? Plus I cannot get a refund because I didn't find out what was wrong until far past the return deadline.Do not waste  your time nor money on this device if you need reliable and consistent telephone service!
1,I am giving them 1 Star (should be 0 Stars) until they allow us to block calls by IP address which would mean blocking calls originating from a particular country....in my case "India".Most people do not realize it but a vast majority of all calls now are VIP (Voiceover Internet Protocol) which means the call has both a phone number and IP address just like our PCs do now.India is the base of all scammers that spoof US phone numbers and generate 95% of all the scamming calls to the US and other Western countries.  I get around 10 to 20 scammer calls a day.It is so easy for them to block the calls by Country IP address just allow us to add the country to our profile that would then add it to the Firewall profile.Amazon as a company needs to address this as an issue for their vendor products and terminate products that does not protect the consumer..
5,Well made. Easy to hook up. Well worth the money. I don’t have a landline using only a cell phone. Had an emergency one night at home and physically couldn’t get to my cellphone to call 911. Tried using my Amazon Echo but didn’t work without a landline or VOIP and Echo Connect. So got the Ooma Telo Air for the VOIP. Then had to buy the Echo Connect to bridge the two. Now works great and I enjoy using my Echo for making and receiving calls.A warning about 911 calls. The manual states clearly that because it’s VOIP and not a landline 911 may not be able to see where you’re calling from. I was able to save my address with my set up but even so you’re still warned that not every 911 call center can actually see this information. Still if you’re able to speak to Amazon Echo and call 911 you’ll probably live long enough to tell them your location (hopefully).
5,Wish I'd bought Ooma 2 years ago when a friend told me about it. I would've saved over $700 in phone bills by now! It works great. No problems whatsoever after a couple of months.
5,I purchased this when my older Ooma telo wasn't agreeing with the wired ethernet in my house and kept dropping connections.  I couldn't connect it directly to my modem because I've got 350Mbps internet and the Ooma would have capped out at 100Mbps.  So I purchased this hoping it would either get along with my network or work via WiFi.  It still didn't like my wired network but over WiFi it's been 100% reliable.  Ooma tech support was able to talk my wife through replacing the older telo device on the account with this one they were professional and helpful in that regard.  I've recommended this to several friends and family that were on other VoIP platforms.P.S.  It really is about $2 / month like they say.
4,I live in an in-law apartment attached to my parent's house.  I never needed a separate phone line until COVID-19 hit.  I am a teacher and have a lot of community meetings I need to attend as well (which all became either conference calls or video calls).  My only complaint is once or twice a call (in a typical short call) there is a slight interruption where the sound gets quieter and there is a clicking noise like an old fashioned rotary dial.
1,I’ll try to provide an objective report on why Ooma was a failure for me. The results were totally unacceptable voice quality—lost words every few seconds mostly unintelligible. The puzzle is why. I have good quality internet from Bluespan a provider using a ground-based microwave link to a small dish on my roof. Tests show that I have more than adequate internet service—8.5 Mb/s download 1.7 Mb/s upload 15 ms ping. I can Skype and Zoom cross-country with perfect video and audio but can’t make an acceptable cross-town phone call with Ooma.After several extended painful support calls Ooma says the problem is that their service does not work with ground-based microwave internet. I’m doubting that answer. Is their system far less tolerant than Skype and Zoom? If so that’s lame. Their support line is serviced abroad by semi-English speakers with questionable knowledge.My internet provider was puzzled and did a pretty thorough investigation reloading firmware on my dish checking signal and verifying performance. All checked out fine. They traced the route that my data takes during an Ooma call and found that it goes through 8 servers on the way to destination. They think that this circuitous route may be the cause of timing delay and jitter that Ooma can’t handle.Will Ooma work for you? Who knows. Spend $107 for hardware hook it all up sign up for monthly service and try your luck. If it works good for you! If not enjoy your time trying to explain your issues to Ooma’s very weak customer service. And you’ll need to do this on your mobile phone because they can’t understand you on your Ooma phone.
1,I was unable to use the app to connect my Telo Air to my wifi network.  I called tech support and the person I spoke with didn't even know what the Telo Air was.  He was unaware that there is an app to facilitate setup.  He finally started to understand a bit with much research on his part then instructed me to set up by plugging the Telo Air into my laptop using the ethernet cable.  I explained several times that my laptop does not have an ethernet port which he did not seem to understand and continued telling me that was what I had to do.  I gave up and called again the next day.  The person I spoke with on the second day similarly did not understand what I was trying to explain and eventually told me I was using the wrong setup app and that the correct app was called "Telo setup" even though the app I was told in the instructions to download was called "Ooma setup".  With her still on the phone I searched dutifully for the "Telo setup" app which does not exist.  I told her this and that the only app in the app store is called "Ooma setup".  She insisted that I was using the wrong app and that was the problem.  I asked to speak to her supervisor and she stated her supervisor would give me the same information.  I responded that she and I weren't understanding each other and that I hoped her supervisor would understand me better.  She hung up on me.  Finally I called the tech support provided by amazon.  That person was fairly nice but similarly knew nothing about the product.  I asked to speak with someone with more technical expertise in this particular product and after putting me on hold for 5 minutes told me there was no option to speak with someone with more knowledge.  So back it goes and I've lost 2 hours of my life trying to install it.
5,I was paying a lot for a hard-wired landline which was forwarded to my cell phone and seldom used otherwise.Ooma is saving me a lot of $$ every month and the payback time is relatively short. As a bonus I found that if I disconnected the landline from the utility box and plugged the Ooma into a regular phone jack I can use my phone jacks with standard handsets. Ooma also has some nice handsets as well as home alarms (water motion and intrusion)
5,Easy to put a phone in a room without any ports.  Simple setup. Easy to use. Love the base station that also serves as an answering machine just push a button to hear. Great quality. I can’t see anything that tells me it’s not a wired landline. I use it every single weekday multiple times a day and I have no issues and nobody has told me they have any issues hearing me. I’ve got two now. Bought one for my wife’s home office.
5,Was easily to set up with simple instructions provided. There was a fee to keep my current number but that was expected. Good sound quality!
5,Finally went ahead andbought an Ooma Telo air 2 after long considering it and I'm glad I did. Got rid of a more costly AT&T version of a VOIP device and it works and sounds great. Porting over existing line took a while but was simple and I chose to pay $120 a year for the Premier service partly to avoid the $40 porting charge. This includes advanced caller ID and most importantly allows me to monitor voice mails as they come in and pick up the call only if I want to. So in addition to the cost of the Premier service I am paying about $5 a month in taxes for the service. Will see after the first yerar if it's worth continuing with that. So overall this is a big improvement. Voice quality is great and I no longer have to pick up unwanted robo calls.
5,Relatively simple to install. Surprised after 3 months when the bill tripled. I  called customer service. They said after the promotion period they charge for extra features. I informed her that in the installation process it asked me if I wanted to pay more for those features and I said no. She informed me that if you buy the unit through Amazon you are forced into the promotion but since I caught it early they would refund the difference.
5,So far the device is working well.  I've ported my old landline to Ooma and everything is working well.  I'm saving about $30 dollars a month plus I'm getting features that I didn't have with my old carrier.  I have not  needed technical support.  So I can't comment on that.
5,With my router in one room and master house phone in another the WiFi version was the best choice for my setup and save me from running cable.  You need the Setup App to install the WiFi version.  One thing that seemed odd was it wouldn't give me the WiFi option til the Bluetooth option failed.  Did have a minor tech problem with the call configuration on their end - I could call my Ooma number but everything I called out on would tell me the number was not in service.  They flipped a switch or two and all good.  This is my 3rd VIOP device over a few years and so far the best of the bunch for ease of setup sound quality and configuration.
5,My wife insisted we have a second land line in addition to our cell phones. $50 per month for our AT&T landline!  A friend at work told me about Ooma. It runs off my cable line. You buy the box (cheaper on Amazon) and it is super easy to set up  I signed up for the “premier” plan and it comes out to about $15 month including taxes. The premier plan has a few perks (search on google) that the standard plan doesn’t have.  By the way the basic ooma plan is free. Just pay  the taxes which are about $5 monthly!
5,Easy setup and porting of number from other provider
1,it works but not as well as my laptop or iphone for wifi audio also they automatically sign you up for a way more expensive plan after your “trial” runs out >:( feels very predatory. i regret buying it and they waited till after the return window to sign me up for the extra crap and make me want to return it. annoying !
5,I finally took the plunge and called Verizon to cancel my landline service.  I ported over my phone number to this new Ooma service and after 4 weeks am very pleased with the service.  Yes the documentation is lacking but with the internet it was easy to find out how to get the wifi hooked up and service working.  I am now paying only $5.22/month in Virginia for Ooma service on my existing Internet Service provider.  Used to pay $39.11 monthly to Verizon for a landline without long distance or Caller ID.  Now I have all of that for a fraction of the money.  I find this Ooma Telo Air to work exceptionally well without any problems what so ever.  It is easy to block phone numbers resulting in a much quieter home and less calls in the evenings.  Should of done this years ago.
5,This is our second one.  First one died after about 10 years and I wasn't even upset.  We saved so much money with Ooma it would be a sin to get upset.  Received Ooma sooner then expected & one phone call to customer service and phone number and my account was transferred to the new Ooma.  They said it could take up to 24 hours but it was less then an hour.  If you want more money in your pocket buy Ooma.  You won't be sorry.
5,OOMA was very easy to set-up and it works well.  The voice clarity is okay and other features function good.  It's nice to have a 'land' (internet) line at a reasonable cost.  We have not experienced any problems.
5,My old Telo quit working after 6 years. Upgraded to the Telo Air. It was $10 cheaper Buying from Ooma on Amazon than from their website. Was pretty simple to setup. I tried their setup app but that didn’t work so went on the webpage and had not problem. I use it for telephone service and home security in our vacation home which costs me a grand total of $5.86 per month. Well pleased with the service the price and really like the Telo Air with the built in WiFi and Bluetooth.
5,Works amazing even got to keep my landline number
5,I like the convenience of having a home number along with my cell phone as well. The Ooma is a good price and less than 5 bucks a month is a deal. I quit CenturyLink for dsl and home phone. The cost of phone and Internet was almost a $100.00 bill. I went to cable and Ooma voip for half that. I have no cable other than Internet and do stream occasionally for things I like. The voice quality and dependability are great. My friend has had his Ooma for around 3 plus years and has had no problems. When I am home the Bluetooth feature connects to my cell phone also. Set up was about 5-10 minutes for a tech dinosaur. The only thing is if you lose power you should have a cell phone as I did and called the power company to report it. Thanks.
5,We live way out from town and had very poor and expensive land line service and no cell service so Ooma has been a  blessing to us. I had zero problems installing it and took less then 10 minutes. I give the sound 4 out of 5 stars but well worth the savings and better reliability then we had with the phone company. We have had it for about 2 months with no problems so far.
4,We've had Ooma since about 2015 & can't really complain about the service. We bought the new Air for the wireless capabilities. Which requires a 'clunky' wireless setup.Ooma does not seem to provide easy instructions for replacing a current unit. The setup instructions cover new installs. We have the security products also but were sadly disappointed we had to re-pair each of 13 sensors.To replace an existing telo you have to call ooma so they can replace the unit ID's.Note: Chat cannot help register you can only call during certain hours.So 4 stars for the replacing existing instructions being non-existent.
5,I see a lot of complaints from Fios customers about quality and reliability. Ooma works great when it's not connected to Verizon's router. I used it flawlessly on Altice internet and I connected directly to the Fios ONT in front of the Verizon router. As soon as I connect to the router wired or wireless Ooma starts dropping packets and becomes unusable.I'm going to get a 3rd party router but I thought I should warn people that the big telecom company is intentionally giving your Voip service problems.
3,support says: The Ooma Setup app will guide you through connecting your Base Station to your home Wi-Fi connection.NO. NO IT DOES NOT.By the way - there are two mobile apps (at least on the android side required for setup. One is just "ooma" and the other is ooma setup. The 2nd is the only way to connect to your 2.4Ghz home WIFI and you must first connect your smartphone to the telo with Bluetooth - so undocumented trivia - you apparently can't use the wifi feature without a smartphone.It does work well but setup is extremely poorly documented... Bring your patience and prepare to make a few imaginative leaps. I'm glad I didn't just order this for my octagenarian parents--they'd have NEVER figured it out. The installation instructions included in the package pretty much consist of a postcard that says "go to the playstore and get the app"
5,If you  are re activating  have the serial numer and the MAC address also I think its the setup numberthey asked The  numbers were hard to read so0 took a picture of the infoI reminded them I didn;t want to lose my phone  number
5,I am very happy with this device.It was very easy to set up.The management features are very flexible.I particularly like the ability to limit our phone ringing to numbers in the contact list. Every call not on the list rolls to voice mail without disturbing us.  It is easy to add callers we do want to ring through to the contacts list.
5,This is my second Ooma Telo unit and I have never been disappointed.  This is a great unit for VoIP calling; you just never miss having a land line except when the power goes out.The features are great the sound quality is great.  I like everything about this unit! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in buying a VoIP system as a land line replacement.  Savings on calls is great too!
4,Shipping is delay without correct UPS delivery status and the unit from Amazon is not working after 2 more hours try.  When I decided to return the unit and cancel my Ooma account Ooma customer service offered a replacement which is working good.  The 4 stars is for Ooma customer services.
1,The product description says nothing about it being "open box" or used. The one I got was obviously used before and sloppily repackaged. It also took more than an hour with Ooma tech support to get it working. Sold and shipped by Amazon...
4,We moved to a short term rental and needed a ‘land line’ phone.  Worked out great.  We will probably drop our expensive cable provider phone and  just get internet service.
5,Cut my $44/ month bill to $6.26
5,This Ooma works well.  Had some trouble with the "guest" wireless at Dad's apartment initially.  The guest network (I think) was canceling connections that lasted over a certain time period.  Initially the Ooma would work fine but in a few hours the Ooma was offline.We were able to connect the Ooma to a non-restricted WiFi network - over a cellular hotspot - and the Ooma device has been rock solid every since - over 2 months.The only other alternative for my Dad's phone was a CenturTel hard line - which was just north of $30/month.  The Ooma will "pay for itself" in 4.5 months based off those costs.Also porting the number was easy as well.
4,I choose to go with the premium and keep my old landline number. my cell service in house is awful but not bad enough to be able to use wifi calling... so this is a great thing. I ordered 2 of the handsets as well and love seeing the picture i setup of the caller when they call. i mostly get spam anyway so for 10 bucks a month vs 85 for telco... it's a win win.
5,The instructions for setting up over WiFi were simple and easy to follow. It was basically plug and play there were no problems or issues. Ooma ported over my landline number in about a day and one half from the time I submitted the request. I’m extremely pleased with their product plus it cut my landline costs from $30 to $5.45 per month. I wish I had done this years ago.
1,I had great hopes for this service. I bought a telo air and a Linx. I had a phone in our kitchen (not near the router) and up in our bedroom. We have a mesh wifi router which is less than four months old has consistent 100Mbps+ and all of our connected devices work just fine. Hooked up the telo air in the kitchen linx in the bedroom. Utter failure. The telo air would drop the internet connection every single night. Every morning I'd have to run the setup app fresh it would work all day then drop the next day. Support was no help. So I plugged the telo air directly into the router and bought an ooma handset for the kitchen linx in the bedroom. Now linx is at extreme range of base station and that drops connection about once a week. And for some reason only one phone rings at a time. Sometimes its upstairs sometimes its the kitchen handset but they never both ring.Finally in general the call quality is bad. Other people report that I break up or that there are clicks and beeps every time I speak. I am trying to make this work so that my investment in the hardware isn't wasted and I don't have to go back to $45 per month home phone but my patience is just about run out.
1,I had high hopes for this device. The first step was to install an AP for my iphone.  After doing that it took a while to go through the prompts because they were not working.  Finally I got to my credit card informatin but it told me that it the information I was entering was incorrect.  It was not!  I entered it again and again and it kept kicking back.  In addition there was zero information about fee I would be charged. I think that this was just for taxes on the service but there was no explanation at all.  To ask for my credit card without spelling out what the charges would be raised a red-flag for me.  Not because I felt I was being scammed but because the AP not working and then not being appraised with what the monthly charges would be decreased my confidence about this service.
4,Cool product setup is a pain as it takes a few days so need to have lots of patients. Also does not auto connect if wifi is shutdown for the night.
5,I am really impressed. My first landline in over 20 years. I got it as a back up emergency phone for the kids. Super easy to set up to WiFi took about 30 minutes. Bought a VTech phone to go with it and it immediately linked to the voicemail option on the phone. I was expecting a headache to get everything working properly but it was so easy. And so much cheaper then the cable company phone option. I’m very happy I purchased this.
1,I ordered a Ooma Telo Air 2 but the unit I received is a regular Oama Telo. The difference between these 2 models is that the Telo Air 2 receives WiFi signal through wireless from internet router without using an Ethernet cable. And the regular Telo needs to use Ethernet cable.  I want to bring Ooma's attention that the label on the box shows "OOMATELOAIR2". The service manual is also prepared for "Ooma Telo Air 2". But the unit packed inside the box is a regular "Ooma Telo".  I've ordered a replacement but please check the replacement to make sure the unit inside the box is the correct model as "OOMA TELO AIR 2" before shipping.
5,Some difficulties with the wifi configuration Ooam technical support very helpful with troubleshooting.Took less than 5 business days to port home phone # (land line).  Original estimate was 3 weeks happy with the short turn around to complete the porting.Voice/Sound quality is very good.  Looking forward to big savings moving away from the old traditional phone company.  Should have made the move to Ooam a lot sooner.
1,I've had an OOMA for about ten years. Always recommended it. It died and ordered a new telo air 2 which arrived today. No instructions on how to replace the old dead POS and when I went to OOMA tech on line they said they would have someone contact me within a "few days" with instructions on how to replace it. This is total BS and I will never recommend ooma again.
3,My husband needed a second dedicated work line in our home and my company had issued us telo’s for our home offices.  I thought “why not?”  In theory this was great.  He could use the app when he was away fromHome and not miss calls.  The TeloAir however was not as easy to set up and there were issues with the suffix available phone numbers. Unfortunately After over an hour and a half on the phone with their call center(who gave us completely conflicting “assistance” and passed us off tried to up sell us on making a change to a service that a previous rep had made on our behalf) we ultimately packed the telo up to send it back.
5,I have used this for three months. Works exactly as stated. Great sound quality. Saves me $40 every month.
3,Every time I go to listen to voicemail it tells me my voicemail is not set up.. I have set it up at least 10 times. Read this gets so aggravating
1,I ordered my Telo Air and Handset in 08/21. I have NEVER been able to use the Telo Air or Handset as they would not pair. 04/11/22 I contacted Ooma Customer Service to report that my Telo Air would NOT power on. I verified the outlet was working and I have good wifi with my Starlink system and the fact that i was using their Ooma phone app to place the call over wifi. I was placed on hold for over 27 minutes on the first call a was disconnected. I immediately called back was transferred to their support services and again was oh hold for over 30 minutes. I tried to contact the support on the online chat but was told I had to place call for all warranty. I have yet to be connected to support for warranty replacement.
5,Good features and working as expected right after installing
4,After reading some negative reviews regarding technical support I was a little apprehensive about my purchase.  I originally set it up with a wireless connection which proved unreliable.  Switching to an Ethernet connection was less than intuitive.  I called technical support and contrary to other reviewers I found the support people easy to understand and work with.  So far the phone service is good quality and is reliable now that I have a constant internet connection.  Less than one weeks use but good so far and much cheaper than previous cable phone service.
5,I purchased this because I no longer wanted to pay for TV - Internet - Home phone with my cable provider.  The Ooma works great over Wifi (I do have Gigabit internet speeds and multiple wireless extenders throughout my home).  For ~ $5 and the initial cost to buy the device and port the number it will save me money in the long run.  Porting the number took about 10 days from the initial request. Do not cancel your old service until your number has been completely ported over it will delay the process and cause problems.  Call quality is good don't notice any difference with the VoIP.
5,Picked this up for my Grandmother who had just entered an assisted living facility. Facility provided WIFI but wanted $15+ a month for a dedicated in room phone. For the few phone calls expected it didn't really make sense but we were all sad at potentially loosing Grandma's original phone number. I remembered Ooma from my father-in-law who has been using it for years in his camp. Bottom line this was the perfect solution. Grandma kept her phone number
5,I was with Vonage for well over 10 years.I made the switch to Ooma based on the features for the price. You get more features Premium Plan for the same price as Vonage's lowest tier plan.Quality and reliability is on par with Vonage both are equally good.
1,The Telo was easy to install and get going. However the Ooma service wasn't in use long before I was getting complaints from the people that I called that my voice was breaking up on their end. Didn't have any problems on my end (other than too many robocalls) though. So I called Ooma support a couple of times. The last time I called they told me that they fixed my problem. Well needless to say they didn't. Still got complaints of my voice breaking up on the other end.So I finally left Ooma the other day and the new VoIP service is doing well so far. It was hard to talk Ooma into letting me go when I called after porting the phone number to the new guys my account was still open on the internet. Usually when you port your number away from a service your account closes automatically. They tried everything that they could think of to get me back but I was calling to cancel my account. They eventually got it but only after I repeated that I was calling to cancel my account many times. Since I'm dependent on them to cancel the account and not make any more charges against my credit card I tried to be patient but when I made it clear to them that I wasn't going to use any of their other services or visit Ooma on anyone else by selling the Telo  they finally gave up.Good feeling to have decent phone service again. Cost a couple of bucks a month more than Ooma but actually works.
3,Like everybody our age we have always had a land line phone and phone bills have been part of life. After getting Ooma phone service we still have something that acts like a land line but it only costs about $5 per month. We have some calls drop but we just try again and carry on. Not really a big deal but annoying. We got the wireless one and set up a wireless phone system in the next room. We're happy with it.We tried to make it work but we're unable to get past the dropped calls. We got another VoIP plan that works perfectly. It's worth the 20 per month to lose the problem
5,The Ooma Telo Air 2 performs flawlessly in every possible way. We are extremely pleased with our choice.
4,Was worried about wireless setup after reading reviews but very easy if you download the app on your mobile.  Initially calls were cutting in and out but after a few days it seems to be pretty reliable.Beware if you decide to port your number and you have Frontier triple play like others reported my account got cancelled and i lost internet for a day until my new acct was activated.  No notice of course.  Gotta love Frontier!!!
5,This was my first experience with VOIP setup and Ooma made it very easy.  I bought the wifi version because I didn't want to locate it near the router.  The call sound quality is just what you'd expect from a land-line.  It also has a built-in answering machine which I wasn't expecting.  I paid $90 and feel that was a reasonable price for it.
5,This is my second Ooma devices one is for my main home phone. and this is my office line.  I have poor cell service and unfortunately my company doesn't allow wi-fi calling on the ATT plan we have so my cell coverage is poor at best. So I bought the newer model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi built in.  Set up was super easy using the app and took minutes.  I downloaded the Ooma call app as I have for my other phone and it works great with all the VM call forwarding features etc.  Five stars for super easy setup call quality & ease of use.
5,Product setup and installation was fine.  The problem came from porting my home number.  OOma specifically tells you to NOT contact your provider until the porting is complete.  Fine - my porting was complete and that night my provider (Frontier) cancelled my internet and TV because my entire account was tied to that number no warning just instant cancellation.  I contact Frontier and it takes at least 5 days to reinstate service and start over.  I am disappointed in Ooma for telling me to NOT contact Frontier and in Frontier for cancelling my entire FIOS service.  Just beware prior to porting you number.
5,Works well
5,Ooma works very well saves lots of money compared to phone company.
3,I could not get the phone line to work with my alarm system. The ADT system dials out once a day for connectivity tests and could not do so with Ooma. This even after I changed the dial tone from the default Ooma tone to the standard dial tone. My ADT system is an older one but you should be aware of this. I will now go with a cellular option on the ADT system ($10 more per month)
5,Ordered to replace landline after "cutting the cord"I used the Ooma Setup phone app from Google Play Store and it completed basically on its own after connecting to unit via bluetooth and home wifi.I paired it with VTech CS6719-2 and worked without issue to make/receive calls.
1,I've had Ooma for 12 years now and didn't have to pay one cent after buying the system. This past week when I receive a call all I hear is static. I can call out just fine which is weird. I decided to upgrade to a newer system and hopefully that would fix my problem but this new system won't stay connected and they want to charge me 7 dollars a month for fees and taxes. It's not even about the money it's the principal of the matter. Don't say it's free if it's not. In the title it says Free but in small writing it says taxes and fees.  I'm returning this unit and keeping my old system and hopefully I'll find a solution to my problem.
2,For the first year I subscribed to the premium service taking advantage of the number port credit.  In a year after reverting to the basic service was not able to monitor messages (only play after they had been recorded) and the caller id did not display caller names just numbers if you didn't have them in the contact list.  These 2 "features" render the service unusable in my opinion so I really had to re-subscribe to the Premium service @ 120/year.  To be fair  Ooma is clear about what  services are included in their plans but practically speaking if you want to have a useful phone service you need to pay so it is not so free.
5,Unlike google voice and other voip services this device enables 911 calls. For this there is cost of about $6 per month which goes to covering 911 fees. It's well worth it. There are some premium services and they try to get you to buy into their home security/automation solution. I don't use any of that and can't comment on them.For me this is a great way to have an emergency phone in my home. Be aware that obviously it won't work if the power goes down or if the internet is off.
5,Works great the same or better than a traditional land line.  I'm even a traditional fax machine in addition to an Ooma handset with this device.  Very cool feature can receive phone calls while a fax is transmitting.
5,Whether I'm talking to someone across town or across the country my calls are crisp and clear.  The installation process was straightforward and quick.  I could not be more pleased.Update 4/3/19:  I'm still a very happy customer a year later.  I live in a rural area with minimal cell options.  I recommend Ooma to all of my "Nextdoor" neighbors looking for alternatives to ATT and Verizon.  I've gotten feedback from other neighbors who have been using Ooma for several years and they offer their endorsements as well.  I really appreciate the fact that it re-boots flawlessly after internet service interruptions.
1,Needed a wireless hookup due to location of router.  Wireless did not work.  Called customer no service and they just kept reading me the script they were given. Finally was transferred to tech supervisor.  He could not help either.  Said can we hook up directly.  Tried that and got it to work.  But it was useless where it was. Asked now that connection was made can I go wireless which is the point of the Telo Air 2.  He said yes.  Tried it and did not work and he had no solutions.  I have a top of the line internet router and 400 mbps speed. We tried wireless around only ten feet from router in same room. They should not be advertising wireless when even their experts cannpot get it to work.  Would not recommend.  You will only waste your time.
4,This is a great device I had the older version of the Ooma Telo. I like the smaller size and the fact that the buttons are raised a bit it has the same great sound quality as the older version. I do wish it had a brightness button. On the older version you could dim the center blue light which is extremely bright on this new one. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,We might have been the last house in the country to have good old POTS. (Plain Old Telephone Service) A real landline with twisted pair copper wire. Every year AT&T would inch up the monthly fee. It got to be too much. So finally after much research we installed the Ooma Telo Air. Worked fine after a simple setup. After a few days trial we decided to port our main number over. That took about five days from AT&T.Our unwanted calls have virtually stopped. It's almost eerie. And saving a nice amount every month. A good gadget. Recommended.
4,We replaced a VoIP phone that was costing $40.00 a month with this one and love it! Works with our VTech phones without a glitch.  Saving about $30.00 a month. We are in a poor cell reception area so this phone works well.
5,I purchased an Ooma for my 90 y.o. father-in-law who was moving in with us from another state. We tried getting him a basic cell phone previously but he could not figure out how to use it (or remember to charge it).We connected his cordless phones from his old house setup the Ooma (very easy process) and now he has his own number where family can call him. The call quality is great. Very pleased with the purchase.
1,voice quality is poor. I used to have spectrum and use spectrum VoIP.  phone voice was clear. I move to Ooma to save money. but voice quality is poor.I changed ISP to Tmobile 5g w 120+ down and 29+ up. Upload is 3 times faster than spectrum. but Ooma voice quality still breaks. though a little better than using Ooma on Spectrum.
4,Works great. Easy to set up. No issue with porting my number.
3,The price of this device fluctuates often.  So I assuming this is kind of like a sales pressure tactic that I have to deal with  buying online.  FYI that is why I still prefer to buy things in stores.  As for the Ooma Telo Air 2 I have been trying it since mid-December 2018.  The voice quality is good and the voice mail feature is easy to use.  The monthly fee is reasonable. The major issue I have is that for a few time the Ooma Telo Air 2 caused my modem/wifi to lockup/fail.  Need to reboot.  The modem/wifi (gateway) never failed 3 times in 2 weeks before.  I had 1 failure in many years before.  Will continue to try/test.
1,I had to leave Ooma because I was not receiving *some* incoming calls.  There was no apparent logic to who could get through to me and who could not.  Three months after switching to a new service I was still being auto-billed by Ooma.  When I ported out my number I lost online access and assumed that meant my account had been cancelled as well.  NOT true I have now been informed that they had issued me a new phone number but did not tell me what it was and kept my account active.  I had to call them to cancel the account.  I have never before ported (home or cell) a phone number to a new service and not had it cancel the account and stop billing automatically. They offered to refund one of the three months they have billed me for my shadow account.  Recommendation: steer clear.
5,I work from home so need to have a home phone to be able to dial into meetings.  I had been using the local phone company but between base charges and all taxes it was costing $30+ a month for service.  I did my research and decided that this was my best option.  I have had it for 6 months now and have not had any issues with connections clarity or reliability.  Service is 1/10th the cost I would have been paying for long distance service and I would highly recommend to anyone needing home phone service.
5,I would highly recommend this device for a replacement home phone service that is provided by ISP or Wireless Service Provider.The best part of having this phone is that I pay hardly $5 per month and can screen all calls vs. giving my cell phone number which is abused by many for robocalls.The voice quality is excellent.The only expenses that you will incur are price of the device and port your existing number.
5,Just what needed. I work remote and we were tired of spending a ton of money for the bundle plan when we literally only need the internet. I have two small kids so I need a landline and this works perfectly! We haven't been able to connect it through wifi yet but we've had it two wks with no dropped calls and setup through the Ethernet was fast and easy. Our previous provider would not allow port of our number but that's nothing to do with ooma. It is difficult to contact them other then online chat.
5,Simple to set up and greet technical support
1,I have had Ooma for many years and have always been happy with the service...until today.I spent around 4 hours off and on with them to help me connect my Ooma with my Internet.Prior to buying the telo air 2 I called Ooma and they told me setting it up was easy...just unplugmy old unit and plug in the new.  WRONG!  I must have spoken with at least 6-7 different techpeople and not one of them knew how to hook it up..even the ones I could understand.  Not theway I wanted to spend my birthday.  Had to drink a bottle of beer just to calm down and the bottomline is that I am still not connected.  I've been without phone service for over a week and Ooma sure letme down.  I will probably return the unit and regretfully go back to Comcast.  Well maybe I'll give itone more try because Comcast is just as bad.
3,It was difficult to set up and took nearly 2 hours before a tech was able to figure out why it wasn’t working and get a dial tone. Worth the hassle I guess as it’s Better than having no back up phone and the monthly costs of less than $5.00 makes it worth it.
5,The Ooma is a great device for using telephone over the internet. there is only a monthly charge of $5-6 for utility taxes other wise it's free.  However they say it will work with any phone but I got a old desk type touch tone phone and it will not ring so be careful.
1,This thing is a piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs.First it's a pain to install they say to download the app to make it easy and fast but the app doesn't work. Then you have to connect the device to your computer just to set it up and every time there is an issue you have to reset by connecting to the computer again.Customer service online chat is probably the worst service I have ever experienced they are so slow and when someone answers they make you repeat the question over and over and then add the end they tell you to call tech support completely useless. I tried asking for a supervisor and the agent told me it wasn't possible and hung up on me. If you ever get a new internet provider or change your WiFi password you will have to completely activate your ooma all over again just like it was brand new completely unnecessary for something that is supposed to be easy to use.You will have to troubleshoot a lot all on your own.3 months later the ooma just stood working all of a sudden nothing but a busy tone. Call customer service and they tell me that it must be broken and I will need to pay full price again because the warranty just ran out. This product is a complete scam beware I wish I could return it but now it's just a expensive mistake
1,I should have listened to the reviewers.  The unit works fine when hardwired directly to modem or router via intenet cable but this is the more expensive "Air" version that we buy for the WiFi functionality.  Except that functionality doesn't work.  Unlike the dozens of other devices in my home that easily connect to my TP-Link Archer A7 1750 one of the most ubiquitous routers around with no fuss this product will not.  Nothing but blinking red lights when attempting to connect to Wifi.  Using the iPhone app setup tool - blinking red lights.  Using the "alternate setup" method connecting via the Home ethernet port to access the Telo admin page for setup - blinking red lights.  Many Telo Router and Modem resets and restarts later the best I have achieved is 5-10 sec where it "appears" to connect to Wifi but never long enough to establish service and display the elusive blue indicator light.  I should have gone with the hardwired Telo rather than pay extra for wi-fi capability that doesn't work.
5,Very easy to set up.I was so happy to reduce my spectrum cable bill from $155 down to $70.I just have internet with Spectrum now.I replaced the cable tv with Google Chromecast  Netflix and Hulu.I replaced the home phone with OOMA!I was even able to keep my home phone number with OOMA!They made it so easy to move the home phone from spectrum to OOMA.It is 20 years old and all of my family and friends have it.It only took a week!
5,This is my second Ooma Telo. My first one eventually died after many years of trouble-free service so it was with great confidence that I purchased this replacement.  I have recommended Ooma VoIP telephone service to many friends and they love it also.  I have saved THOUSANDS of dollars by using Ooma over the years.  Installation is very easy.  I could go on and on and it would all be positive.
1,Phone line works but after the trial period of "Premiere" service my credit card was charged a monthly bill of $16. I engaged in a "chat" to downgrade to basic service and was assured this was done. Months later I am still being charged for Premier. There is no way to downgrade yourself online without calling their number. Customer service failed to follow through!
5,So far so good took about 15 minutes to set up with temp number and ported over my POTS. The port took about 5 days and had to connect customer service to make it the main line.  Was paying almost $80 a month to att got the premium service with more features and should be about $14 a month  Calls seem fine. We were getting a lot of spam calls about five or six a day. Only one came through today but have it at the highest security.
4,I like being able to connect to WIFI without the USB dongle. I have had 2 USB dongles and they both went bad by falling apart. Poor construction and design considering that you never touch it once it works.  The hardware for Ooma is improving and the concept of VOIP with their clear sound technology is impressive.
4,Being able to locate the phone connection without a hardwired connection was essential for us but the steps to get there and the ability to interpret when you were at each step along the way made it essential to contact Tech Support for help.
4,Phone works great for receiving/making calls. Just wish we could have a live answering recording when someone leaves a message. Sometimes the call is a little gargled but we can still understand.
5,I put this together with a SIM card modem to replace my parents old landline.  It saved them $70/mo over the old landline.  No problems setting it up when following the instructions.  Sound quality is great!  Lots of features built in as well.  I have had my own Ooma for years now and it was a no-brainer when it came time to help my parents save some $ to choose Ooma.
5,If you are going with VoIP this is the unit to use.  Recently got fiber optics at our residence and hooked this up.  We used our existing cordless phones which have a base station with an answering system.  They are aging and at some point we’ll move on from them....the Ooma has its own answering system.
5,This thing rocks!  Downloaded the app and walked right through set up in minutes.  I then plugged my cordless base unit into it with a phone cord and all my handsets work.
5,Home phone and calls FREE FOREVER. Almost too good to be true....but it's not.Why doesn't everyone take advantage of a bargain like this?
1,No one can hear me when I call. Wasted money.
5,I have used Ooma for many years - excellent service and clear calls. This purchase was to replace a unit that died after many years service.
5,We have had Ooma phone service in our family for years.  It is reliable and very cost effective.  When we looked at the updated Air 2 Smart we liked the upgraded features shown.  We have now had it in service for over a month.  Being able to use the mobile phone app to screen incoming calls and listen to voicemail as well as make remote calls through our home phone number is wonderful.
1,Followed the directions to activate the account and then the device. It had issues connecting to a home wifi network that many other devices connect to from similar locations but eventually seemed to connect a couple of times. However the device never properly activated and kept blinking red forever even after multiple reboots. I did not bother trying a hard-wired connection as I bought this device specifically for wifi.Warning: regarding the account service they want you to activate your account first including providing a credit card. They will automatically charge you for a premium subscription after a grace period unless you actively switch to free tier. Even on free tier you get charged for the government taxes and fees. That's fine unless you get a non-functional device then they have already deducted the first month of fees (~$6 in my case). To cancel you have to call there is no online option. They don't refund the taxes and fees. I asked if they delete my credit card information when I cancel the account. They said after 60 days.
4,Works exactly as advertised and works well! AND...helpful easy customer support you can understand if you need help which you probably won't. Then the bill comes in...$4 per month! My review lacks one star only because it's hard to see the buttons on top of the phone itself and get things done quickly. All else? Great.
3,After several calls to tech support to help solve a issue with losing the wifi connection and the inconvenience of losing dropped calls and lose of time trying to solve the problem I can only hope that the telo will now work without any more problems.
2,I bought this specifically for the wi-fi due to the way I needed to set it up. I did not want to hardwire the OOMA box. After using it for a couple of weeks I realized the sound quality is poor and deteriorates even more over time. Once I understood this and went back to the reviews lots of people stated this same problem. I did not try to hardwire because that set up would not work for me. Bottom line the wi-fi doesn't give quality sound over the phone.
5,I have used this for about one month not frequently so far it's fulfilling the usefulness.I've give another rating as time goes on.
4,I'm not blown away by anything except the price. Works okay with my Panasonic phones. Getting voicemail is convenient through an app on my phone. Sound quality is so-so at best. If you want to save money get it.
4,I love that it’s saving me money& I can have a home phone & unlimited calls anywhere . I’m hearing impaired& I can hear on this phone& it’s clear
5,I have only had this for a couple of weeks. I had been using another service for almost five years so I was familiar with howto use VOIP It was easy to set up and I love being able to use WiFi instead of my Ethernet. I have more flexibility with location. My Wife loves being able to have unlimited minutes  calls to her family overseas with good quality and  connections
4,Sound Quality is good and it is easy to install. I do wish that the LEDs were somewhat brighter.
4,This our second OOMA.  We used the first OOMA for about five years and it generally worked well.  The only concern I have is its live expectancy.  Is 5 years a acceptable?  System works well and has been cost effective.
1,Cool product but you should know the DNS seems to be hard coded and any firewall that most products negotiate easily will cause OomaTelo Air2 to be blocked. Customer service was not very helpful.
4,Works as described.  Only negative is on call forwarding takes a second to forward so get minimal rings when forwarded.  Still cant quite figure out how to outbound on second line.  GOOD call quality call block works easy to use.
2,If you think you're signing up for the free service (just paying taxes and fees) they will push you into premier without telling you that you have to do something to opt out. It is literally not in the emails that you get. I caught it right away as soon as they charged me and they still won't refund me the entire difference even though we aren't using the premier features at all. Otherwise the system works fine.
1,From time to time I can not make outgoing calls. Reading users' forum it sounds like there are quite similar cases in the past and still going around. Ooma's customer service quality is better than average but so far they can not fix the problems for us. And they claim they do not see any problems observed on their side after I provided cases after cases. Finally they asked me to do highly technical things. Unfortunately what they asked me to do was way beyond my capabilities. Now they replace the base unit (Telo 2) which does not work at all even followed their instructions. I am currently using old unit and wonder if I should continue to use Ooma or find some other approach(es) This is two months review and if allowed I will provide further reviews hopefully it will be a good one.
5,It does what it claims to do. Check your billing to be sure they have you on the right plan. Also make sure that you won't end up cancelling your savings by paying your ISP provider more if you drop phone service. Voice quality is good and it's reliable. I wanted the freedom of being able to use this anywhere in my home and so purchased the more expensive wi-fi version.
4,Zero problems with setup using the smartphone app. Works as advertised with my older panasonic wireless phones. One note; when moving the ooma device and disconnecting power the boot time was excessive to come to ready.
5,Took a week to port old phone now have two #'s to ring. I got an Ooma phone to retrieve messages away from home with no problems. No problem with power going off resets OK. Works with my fax machine just fine. Audio quality no different from my old $45 monthly service.
4,Everything works as expected except when you answer...there is a delay. You have to say hello several times and the person calling usually hangs up. You then have to call them back.
5,Annoying to set up but once it works it works. Can't tell the different between this and landline
1,Other device take a few seconds to connect over Bluetooth. Ooma takes over 3 minutes every time. Why? Other devices connect to my Wi-Fi instantly and work perfectly. The Ooma manual says it may take 10 to 30 minutes to boot up before it even tries to connect. Seriously?  It never does connect like it should even after several hours so they they give two alternate procedures but they don't work either. Connecting Ooma between my computer and router via Ethernet did work once but it took forever and still would not connect via Wi-Fi. The support people in India were happy to spend hours trying to help but they couldn't make it work. Maybe other reviewers got good ones and I got a bad one but if so the support people should have been able to see that and tell me to ask for a replacement. I'm sending it back and looking for something better.
5,I am very happy with my purchase.  This device sounds clearer and better than MagicJack.  I was a previous MagicJack customer then switched over to Ooma and love this product!  Definite a better value for the money!!
5,I have an older unit with a USB wireless connector and bought this one as a gift for someone with the wifi connected. So far no glitches or problems...
1,I purchased the Ooma Teri Air 2 several Months ago and although initially had a little difficulty getting it started and set up it worked great for about five months. It came off line a few times but I had to do was unplug and replug in my modem and it booted back up. Now for the last two months it is nothing but a brick. No matter what I do I cannot get it to go back online. I have called tech-support and they said that there’s not an issue with the Ooma. It is just trying to connect to my Wi-Fi but cannot. There is no issue with my Wi-Fi. I have no problems with any other things that are connected to my network. It is only this very expensive brick that I have trouble with. I am so sorry I bought this item because it is completely frustrating. Save your money unless you need an expensive paperweight.
2,Sound quality is good. Customer service is only adequate. It took several days of back and forth with Ooma customer service and tech folks .  The Telo Air would not find my network. I was told at first it could be a hardware issue and then that they would reconfigure  it. Finally I got through to a tech person that found the problem..  Ooma telo will not work unless your wifi system can run on WPA2. Mine is an older unit and only has WPA.  A week later I find that my $39.99 porting fee is actually $48.14  !!! No one tells you they take out Federal Universal Service Fee Tx Universal Service State Tax City Sales Tax [ I do not live in a City ] Federal Regulatory Fee and Utility Gross Receipts Assessment. I now have changed my rating down one star !
5,I’ve always been a fan of these guys. They make a neat product they’re focused and they’ve been continuously improving over the years. The device does everything it advertises. I like the Air model in that you do not have to connect it directly to the router with a cable. I was concerned the quality would not be as good but it seems very clear and solid. Well done Ooma!
5,If you want a land line this is perfect. Less then $6 per month and sound quality is perfect.
5,Nice to have a wireless device that can be placed anywhere.  Install took longer then expected and required a call to their tech support.  It wasn't just plug and play but got working after some assistance.
4,It is not possible to block spam calls from cell phone or ooma phone.  I receive two per day.
1,UNRELIABLE.  Contstantly goes out without notice or indication.  So callers go direct to voicemail even if the phone is not in use.  I have had Ooma devices for over a decade.  Prior to 2021 they worked great.  But since sometime in 2021 I've had one problem after the other with 3 different Ooma boxes (latest purchased 12/2021). Ooma no longer provides the reliable phone service I need.  I think Ooma has server problems but until that is 100% resolved I can no longer recommend Ooma.  DO NOT BUY.
5,I am Ooma customer for years and I bought this one for one of my relatives. Simply the best phone service and experience ever. It is working perfectly for years (I have good WiFi at home you will need that if you buy Ooma). Never disconnected and the voice is always clear and the most important factor it is just for a few dollars every month.
5,Bought an OOma phone device. was brand new and delivered lightening fast!! EXCELLENT service! Highly recommend this vendor. BTW i hardly EVER review amazon vendors.
5,I really don't know how anyone could give this 1 star. Easy to set up technical support was perfect and works wonderfully. I found it to be plug and play  with the app. No computer or ethernet cable required. It has a lot of one star reviews but I can't figure out how that is. GREAT PRODUCT!
1,1. takes 10 minutes to establish a link that allows you to make a phone call2. wireless NIC in it is so bad it does not work 30 feet from the AP had to use a wireless bridge!3. if you get a call it may work for a short time the connection is lost4. in this state if you make a call (calling the other person back) it fails (despite the status indicator saying all is fine)5. you call support and they tell you to reboot it - that is their only resolution crap supportSending it back unless Ooma does a firmware upgrade on the box (that fixes the issue) or replaces it
4,Just got this and it works so much better than my old Ooma devices. Nice that I can put it near my desk phone instead of next to the router which is in an armoire.
5,So far it’s comparable in features and call quality to what we had through Spectrum cable. Ran a little warm but I don’t plan on using the Ooma handset so I disabled the DECT radio which helped. Like the fact I can pair my iPhone with it so incoming cell calls ring on all house phones
2,I was hoping for a better experience but the WiFi feature didn’t work very well. Bought it for my parents.  Talking was sporadic with every call made. We could hear them but they only heard every few words. Tried different phones but same experience. Connected directly to base and problem was gone. I needed the WiFi because phone was in another room. Ended up taking my Linx to get it to work for them like I needed. Wasn’t worth the extra cost.
1,False advertising! When I got this and started the setup process it was already configured with someone else's phone number and wireless network. I had to do a factory reset. Clearly this is refurbished equipment!
2,I was having problems with my 3 year old telo droping calls with just my Ooma connected phones not my hardwired  ones called tech support and was given every external reason for the failure decided on my own to upgrade to a Telo Air Two and started haveing all kinds of issues unit just would reboot still droped calls and my home security part of the Ooma has been not working for over a month. Finally they told me they were going to send me a new unit it has been over a week now and nothing I live chat with them and and offer me no help at all. I really liked the Ooma units when they worked but theiir tech support just does not work for me.
5,It is  easy to setup  and the sound quality is good plus the savings are great.
2,My Ooma Telo functions as advertised - except the wrong name appears on caller ID when I call people. In this day and age of rampant robocalls people don't pick up if they don't see your name.Ooma has a page on their site talking about the issue in which they essentially say "It's not our fault it's the system." If that's the case why doesn't this problem seem to affect other providers? Why has there been no progress two weeks after I create a ticket to fix the issue? Why are they content to pass the buck on a glaring deficiency?Having the wrong name appear when I call people is embarrassing to me why isn't this fundamental flaw in their service embarrassing to them?
5,I'm kicking myself for buying this unit... so late! I should have purchased a long time ago. It is sturdy and just works. I love the visual indicator and built in voicemail. Haven't tried bluetooh yet but wifi connection is quick and strong.If you're on the fence I say go for it. You won't regret it.
5,Works as promised couldn't have been an easier or better replacement for our old copper wire line.
5,Works well and saves me money.A little over 5 dollars a month due to taxes.A bit of an update it is still doing great. I love the service and the app is great to. I can retrieve all my voicemails from my cell phone. It is a winner.
4,So far I like a lot! I like to have landline again. The setup was super easy and the wireless connections works really well with my Erro's around the house!
5,we cut the cord (bundled) and this bad boy operates off our wireless internet feed.love the extra features...the ability to block solicitor phone calls no long distance charges and a home security offering that works in conjunction with the phone to name a few. Customer service is great. We are saving $30 a month on phone service alone. Brilliant!!
5,I think I've used this for about a year now and have only lost connection to my wifi once. Its rare that I use the phone but when I asked a couple of people on the other line they said that the sound quality was good. I've been very happy with the Ooma Telo Air 2 so far.
5,Easy enough to set up. Takes a while to boot back up after unplugging.
5,Switched from MagicJack and the sound quality is far superior. Very easy setup but took a bit to port my number.
1,The sound quality is not acceptable for voice. I’m using it to replace a phone line for my Mom’s ADT so I’m not as concerned as if I actually needed it to talk to her.Updated April 2022:Check your credit card statements! Ooma changed my subscription from their Basic service to their “Premium” service without my permission. They do not allow for subscription changes on their website you must call them to change it back or cancel.
3,Fortunately for the intended use it is not a serious issue but if you're not a fan of constant background static in your VOIP telephone transmissions despite being on a fiber op network?  This is not a product I'd recommend.
5,Best part of Ooma is robo call are down 90%.
5,Ooma what an excellent company! Lots of extras features for your home phone system easy to set up best way for setup is to call their friendly and knowledgeable customer service representative.  Saving us around $50 per month from our previous landline. Recommend installing modem and Ooma on a battery backup just in case.
5,This is my third Ooma.  The first two (combined) lasted about 12 years and were finicky about their connections to my wireless system.  The setup with this was much easier.  I still have to connect to the rest of the phones in the house but that's largely a matter of disconnecting one line at the D-Mark.
5,Easy setup and great inexpensive home phone with voicemails.
5,This is my second Ooma.  The first one got damaged by lightening that struck outside our home and damaged several items.Phone cost is so reasonable and the sound is excellent.  It is very easy to install and takes care of all my telephone needs.Looking to save telephone money on landline?  Bu Ooma.
5,It i easy to set up and use
4,Service is great. Wish I didn't have to opt out of telo premium. This is a pretty minor complaint  however.
2,Bluetooth connective for setup was sporadic. Finally got it working then it stopped after a couple of weeks. Followed the troubleshooting instructions on the site but no luck. I sent it back to Amazon and they promptly refunded the money called ooma to cancel service but they are still billing me. They are not easy to work with.
1,Ooma advertises their service as free if you call within the US but it is not. You have to pay at least $5/month ($60/year) fees. I bought Ooma Telo Air 2 as a backup only for my cell phones. I do not use it on a regular basis. It's a misleading advertisement by the company!I'm not going to use their service. Unfortunately I can't return Ooma Telo Air 2 (they told me about fees 3 months after I set it up).
5,So far I'm impressed.  This was very easy to set up and get working.  I ported my old number and that was accomplished very fast.  It seems to be working like a charm so far.  I'll update this review later if I uncover any flaws that would be informative to folks considering buying this.
5,Great solution for the price. Wifi works great and very easy to setup.  Sound quality is not on par with a landline but is sufficient comparable to major telco VoIP solutions.
1,When this arrived the box had previously been opened and the device had signs of previous use. Not wanting to go thru a return and waiting for a new unit I decided to give it a try. This was a mistake! The device was still activated on a previous account and took over 4hrs working with Ooma customer support to get activated.
5,SOMEWHAT HARD TO GET OPERATIONAL ONCE OPERATIONAL IT WORKS GREAT GREAT FEATURES MONTHLY COST FOR LAND LINE ABOUT $5 PREMIER COST ABOUT $15
5,This is our home phone and functions very well.
2,Could not install wirelessly. After much screwing around and zero help from Telo ended up using an Ethernet cable. Warning: Do not have your old number disconnected until the porting process is completed. You can’t port a disconnected number even if it was yours for 40 years!
5,love this home phone product. Lots of options when blocking or putting a number on on a black list. Helped stopping scram or unwanted calls
1,OK as a backup to your cell phone but do not count on this service for important calls.  I have had several frustrating issues (verified to be non-WiFi or internet connection related).  Even when it is working it can be difficult to understand the person on the other end of the call.  Sometimes the conversation is interrupted by a fax machine sounding buzz.  I don't have a fax machine nor do I have a second line.  On other occasions it will not receive calls until the power is cycled even though the the blue "ready" light indicates everything is OK.  I guess for $5 a month I am getting what I pay for.
3,It works okay. My cell phone plan is through at&t and for some reason when I call the phone connected to Ooma from my cell phone it says the number does not exist. I’d like to know how that could be fixed but oh well.
3,Did not connect to wireless as advertised. Had to purchase some internet connection devices. Customer service was quick and helpful but very difficult to understand. The Premier package is expensive and many of the items should be included in the basic package. So far it is working. Expensive to purchase in my opinion.
5,Love this! Easy to install and works great
5,Like the item works very good I will recommend
1,Fails to reboot when the broadband goes on after broadband service interruption (software driver updates - every night at 1AM).I contacted our old land line phone provider (Frontier) and next Tuesday we will get back with them regardless of much higher service and taxes payments.Failure to reboot automatically is big problem; we have security system on our property and in case of illegal entry the system calls to us for verification. With the Ooma aTelo2 just idiotically blinking red we are not protected!!I called Ooma and after being on hold to a' one hour I gave up. The employee I was talking initially was in Indonesia and was simply clueless.Terrible product terrible support
5,We used this to port over our landline number and take it with us to another city. Worked just like I hoped it would. Wish I had done this years ago. Would have saved lots more money.  Very happy with our Ooma device.
5,Saves a lot of money when you need to have a landline. Also the app is fantastic! Messages left at home come directly to emailetc.
5,Great savings and good voice quality.
5,Previously used a Panasonic cordless phone. The sound quality was awful.  Upgraded to the Ooma Air 2 and HD3 cordless phone. The sound quality is perfect.If you buy an Ooma Telo I highly recommend the HD 3 as well.
5,Perfect replacement for original.
4,Sound on message are not very clear.
5,Grandchildren loved them. 3 year old almost 4 is learning how to use them. She keeps holding it next to her ear like a phone. They luv talking to each other with them. We r campers so they will b good for camping!!!
5,I like the ease adding additional spam phone numbers and only receive the most important calls from family and friends.Easy to set up.  I added the OOMA Linx for my fax machine.  That is a nice addition if you need to operate a FAX
5,Clear calls at a fraction of the ATT price for a home telephone.  Easy to set up and use with many features.  The Ooma blacklist has prevented most robo calls.  And being able to answer a land line call on your cell phone is a great feature.
5,Very easy setup. Works flawlessly.
5,Was able to keep my old phone number for a one time fee.  Great voice quality.  Voice mail can be checked from Ooma app.  Lowest cost to maintain traditional home phone service.  Overall I'm very pleased.
4,Cellphone dual ringing is only available with premier service
5,The Ooma Telo is a great product. My headline is not to suggest that I had low expectations but my wife had been asking about getting a home phone and this is an EXCELLENT alternative to a traditional landline. Very pleased with it.
5,home phone  .need more operating instructions with it.
4,Used for home phone. It has worked without problems once it was properly hooked up.
5,Easy setup works great highly recommended.
5,If you are looking for a great way to cut the cord from your phone provider and save some money the Ooma device is a great option.  This was super easy to set up and the call clarity is great.
1,Terrible. Was hard to set up. Outsourced call center accent is hard to understand. After several tries got it to set up. Oh one of the suggestions was hook it up to router. If I would have wanted it next to the router I wouldn't have paid more for air 2. During a call sound quality is every other or every 4th word comes through. Cannot carry on a conversation. Can only call out. People tell me they try to call but won't go through.  App doesn't work correctly either. Continually shuts down when trying to do anything through it. Wish I would have sent it back when I first got it and got the red flags during set up. STAY CLEAR. IF YOU REALLY WANT A HOME PHONE TRY SOMETHING ELSE.
5,Excellent product
5,The configuration and install was easy and am pleased with the quality of the service. I really liked that could connect to my network wireless.
5,I had some issues initially when trying to set it up but tech support helped a lot to get it working properly.  The phone works great and is a very good value for the money.
4,This has lowered my phone bill greatly. USED to have vontage.
5,Saving me money gives me more number blocking/control features and provides good sound quality with minimal lag.I have to bounce between the iPhone app and the web site at times. My number porting was fast and done with good feedback.
1,I struggled to get it to work and failed.  Examining it closely I find the product is NOT an Ooma Telo Air 2 it is simply an Ooma Telo which does not have wireless or bluetooth.  The image above shows the product I purchase on the left/top and an old one I was replacing on the right/bottom.  Note the model descriptions are identical.
1,The product looked nice. The problem was that it didn't work and it couldn't connect to the internet. I was on the phone for hours with OOMA customer service and they couldn't make it work. Apparently OOMA customer service is offshore and communication could be pretty challenging. Their technical ability is also much to be desired. Return the product was the conclusion.
5,Much improved quality of phone calls compared to our regular phone service. Porting over our home phone number was easy but our original phone carrier is delaying the process by a week. Have a little patience. Easy setup. Good customer service.
1,I have not been able to set up a wifi signal following the directions.  I have called support & support people are difficult to understand because english is not their first language.  Even the directions on the website are not clear from changing my pw.  It is a great product but support & website needs lots of help!
1,Bought this after reading good reviews. I was optimistic that this would provide an alternative to expensive landlines. This system disconnects from our wifi on a regular basis. This requires a system reset. The hardware itself is poor quality. Playing back messages—the most basic function—rarely works as expected. For new buyers... I would consider an alternative to this service.
4,Works great but it's hard to understand the final cost structure.
1,Use your debit card for verification and be charged monthly with no easy way to cancel. Misleading and a waste of money
2,I regret buying itdo not read those stupid paid review. I would recommend try it first and u have one month to return.maybe and maybebut personally I do not like
5,AFTER  CALL FOR REGISTER A COUPLE MINUTE   IT WILL AUTO CONNECT IN THE FUTUREIF LOST WIFI SOMETIMES  . PERFECT .
1,A very frustrating experience with trying to connect to my WiFi network.  A couple of hour long sessions with Ooma customer support did not solve the problem.  I don't know how well this device works on a wired network but you should not get your hopes up for an easy WiFi setup experience.  Bummer.  Really wanted to this work.
1,I have used this phone service since January 24 2021. The sound quality rivals two tin cans.  I has not held WiFi connection for more than 3 days in right weeks. Tech support should seek tech support. No one can say why this happens. The phone is approximately two feet from my router and modem. DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS PHONE TO WORK WHEN YOU NEED IT. THIS SERVICE  IS WORTH ZERO. CAUSES MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH. You get what you pay for.
5,Eliminated my costly home phone service with this device. It's the same over internet operation I had. Ooma accomplishes it with great service at a fraction of the cost.
1,Service from provider gets interrupted a lot with reboot service not working and then 10 minutes to hours later it suddenly works. I think Ooma wants you to buy this overpriced device and then have you leave because of bad service while stuck with the electronics. I am going to switch to my internet provider's $10 phone; much more reliable.
1,I ordered one of these and have used it for six months.  Half the time no one can call me and I cannot call out.  When it works it is passable but not great.Net/net: don't buy this.
5,This is my second Ooma my first one lasted about 4 years.  This has saved me so much money over a land line... I highly recommend this if you have a fast/stable internet provider.
1,I bought with with high hopes.  I've used ooma for over a decade with the wired device and have been pleased.  When I saw a wireless device I realized I could move my router to a better location freeing up my phone to remain elsewhere.  However after five phone calls to support with no help I finally figured out I could only get the wifi option to work when I removed all router security.  This is unacceptable and I will be returning it.
1,Bought this would not work using WiFi or ethernet.  Called customer service they were rude and dismissive.  Try using another service.
5,Works great.
2,Don't waste your money on the WiFi option it doesn't work.  Get the cheaper one because you'll want to plug it in.  I've tried the app and through a PC to get the WiFi working.  Being a voice device you'll want the lowest latency any way.  WiFi won't give you that.
5,Great product much better than having to pay a home phone bill.
2,Difficult to figure out whose fault it is but this equipement is constantly disconnecting from the internet giving you a busy telephone signal intermittently. I tried wireless and wired. Under wireless the disconnections require a reboot (unplug-replug). Under wired it still disconnects regularly but reconnects on its own. I called OOMA and they said it was ATT's connection. Not sure it is true since I also have a different piece of equipment from them for a business line and it works fine.
5,This service acts as our home phone!
5,Not to difficult to setup but not easy either.  Once setup it works great.  With a good broadband connection this will save me $47 per month on my old landline.
3,Wrong  pass code print on the device!
5,Good Buy
5,Purchased to replace older still functioning ooma box and tech-support handled deactivation of old box and reactivation of new one quickly and efficiently.
1,I tried two different units and encountered issues with both. While trying to set them up I had created accounts and company proceeded to keep billing me though I was never using. They bill $7 per month essentially regardless and then try to get you up to the premium monthly charge if you want any of the services. I called customer service and they then repeatedly try to re-sell me on the product no matter how many times I explain that there product would not work. So glad to be done with Ooma. It looks cool and seems like a great idea but this is a flawed company.
5,I still wanted my landline.  The price is right for the Ooma telephone system.  I have to use my fax machine periodically so this is a good option.
5,i Like it thank you
5,Great option away from standard landline. It has worked great for us and was very easy to set up. We should have done this two years ago when I first learned about Ooma.
1,Heed my warning- they are morons. The set up app demands a Bluetooth  connection cell phone to Ooma station. The problem I learned from tech support is that Bluetooth on the station DOES NOT WORK AND YOU WILL NEVER CONNECT. Then you call support: you have to make a hard wired connection to your router first. Then use your browser AND CONNECT TO 172.27.35.1 and configure wireless connection. YOU CAN NEVER CONNECT TO 172.27.35.1 no matter what you do- connect THE device to your router connect it via home port directly to computer: YOU CAN NEVER REACH THE CONFIGURATION PAGE.  YOU CAN NEVER MAKE A WI-FI CONNECTION .THEY ARE MORONS.
5,it was quick phone land number to internet phone number  over a week and make sure pay full year void the fee for transfer
5,Indistinguishable from a land line but cheaper and with more features.  Love it.
5,We have one "home" phone number now.  We have 2 homes and it is great to have one phone number.  Super product.
1,As others have reviewed the major weakness of the product is its WiFi support.We’ve owned versions of this product for years. The phone service is good and reasonably priced.However the WiFi will fail on a fairly regular basis. The latest Air 2 that we had lasted about 9 months.Then the WiFi became very unstable and ultimately unusable. This is what always happens.Their tech support is not going to be able to help. The only real solution is to replace the device. Or use something else.
5,This unit works well and is economically one of the best phone services out there.
5,This is the best phone over internet you could buy for as little as $5.25 a month
5,These are great! So easy to use even with so many features. And I am so glad I don't have to rely on Comcast Voice any more especially at $23/line.
5,Works as advertised.  You do not need the premium service.  Basic service of state federal and local taxes (about $6) is all you need.
5,Ooma was rated best home phone service by Consumer Reports and it saves me about $150 a month for phone and internet services.
5,Liked the sound quality but shouldn't have ordered the Wi-Fi version which frequently disconnected & I did not need. Using wired connection it worked perfectly.
5,I don't get clear reception on my cell at home so I got this phone for backup....love it!  Cheap to use and it's like using a regular phone!
2,Multiple issues with WiFi occasional downtime tough to reconfigure
2,They make it a hassle to disconnect service.  The device worked ok with average sound quality.
5,Got this 'Ooma Telo Air 2 Smart Home Phone Service with Wireless and Bluetooth Connectivity' quickly. It is easy to install. I recommend this device.
5,The Ooma is great. I went from a $43.00 a month phone bill to $6.63.
1,Ordered (and paid for) Telo Air 2.  May or may not have received one - ooma support claimed it was a telo the box and manual and app all said telo air 2.  In any case after a couple of frustrating hours I gave up and am returning it.
5,works great sounds great really good price and get away from land lines
5,Easy setup
1,I got a defective device even tech support could not get the device to workCountry of origin may have caused this device to be defective.
1,The product itself is great but OOMA service is such a scam!My number got deactivated after I paid $45.59 to have it ported. Called customer service and they fixed it right away and refunded me the porting fee "for the inconvenience". Thought they were really nice for doing that. This was 08/21.Fast forward to today 09/23 I got a charge for $46.68 for "porting fee". Called customer service and they said "it's a valid charge" and when asked for the persons information (ID or Badge #) he disconnected!I saved all screenshots no worries.
1,Telo Air advertised to come with Wi-Fi adapter- none arrived with unit.  Ooma can sell me one or I can get any adapter anywhere - This is NOT mentioned in Ooma's website. Big Mistake in getting Ooma.
1,This item is very poor. Stopped working. Called Amazon and the girl on the other end did not help me at all. Since it was past the 30 days Amazon would not return it. She connected me with the actual company and all I got was a recording. Don’t buy it. A wait of money
1,I bought this for my home office six months ago and transferred my number to the Ooma.  From day 1 there was a delay of 4 or 5 seconds between when you pick up to answer a call and when the connection is made.  If you say "Hello" once or twice the caller will never hear you.  Same when a caller get voice mail.  No greeting for several seconds.  The voice mail greeting quality is awful.  Ooma set me up with premium services that I didn't ask for.  I wouldn't recommend.
5,I really like this. It was easy to connect wirelessly. The sound quality is great. I'm going to get 2 more as gifts for my kids.
5,Wireless capability good design and price on Amazon. Not easy to install as instructions are confusing.
5,Was easy to set up no issues just getting rid of the old phone company was the only issue and keeping my internet data.
5,Ooma should give more clear setup instruction in the box once you set it up it works fine no problems
5,My first ooma died from old age. I saved plenty of money over the years from not having a landline.
1,I live in an area that has spotty cell phone reception so I bought this device thinking it would be a great option to save money and bypass the technical issues of cell reception. 24 hrs later of debugging on my own following every user guide plus an hour on a call with tech support it’s still not working. I’m packing up and sending back for a refund. There are better and cheaper options available. Deserves 0 stars. Also interesting that Amazon has pulled the product and it cannot be replaced through them. This implies something is wrong with the current release.
5,Works as expected.  This will save you a fortune over using Telephone company service.
2,Mine lasted about a year and one month had to buy another the tech support ask me to reboot and buy a new one if bot working . They were not surprised and said They have  had many similar issues
5,We have a lot of phones gradually converting over to Ooma - they work great and just keep on working.
5,A great alternative to overpriced landline through your phone company.  Setup was easy and it just works.
1,After reading and watching several reviews I decided to give it a try because of the cost savings. The sound quality the delay in the calls and actual cost of monthly service made me quickly decide against it. Now I'm still having a challenge with trying to get them to cancel my monthly subscription even a month after I returned the item.Don't waste your time and effort.
5,Ok
1,I'm no neophyte when installing tech products. But after 2/12 hours of attempts to configure this equipment I gave up. The base station would not connect to my Samsung 8 bluetooth allowing me to connect the wifi no matter what. The combination of multiple apps and online configuration make set up a royal pain. I finally gave up and called to have my account closed and cc info removed.  Unfortunately I am too late to return the equipment but at least I'm not wasting more time trying to activate.
1,I had problems with the sound quality from day 1. A delay from when something was said and the other person heard what was said. Slight buzzing. Sometimes a person couldn't hear me at all. I spent too much time talking to tech support (each time I talked to someone they sounded like they were in a wind tunnel). Problem not resolved. Too late to send back.
1,I bought the wireless model the Telo Air. It has given me nothing but problems. Calls coming in are fine but phone will not call out to all numbers. It will not call any of my families cell phones and some land lines. Some calls take 40 seconds before call will start to ring. Also manymany calls are dropped. Ooma has been working on this issue for 2.5 weeks and still not corrected. If not fixed this week I will be sending it back for a refund before my 30 day return date.
1,After the Android app created a corrupted account hours of calls with 1st tier support finally being forwarded to advanced support the final straw was when the representative couldn't complete the configuration told me she would call back in 15 minutes and then never did. After three days of frustration I returned the product for a refund.
2,After hours of trying to connect via WiFi 3rd level tech support tells me it is a known issues connecting to an open WiFi router. Since I had no other WiFi type available to me I sent it back.
1,Absolutely zero information regarding setup of wifi or bluetooth. I'm tech savvy but struggling to find any information and chat help was worthless. Also the process to associate the my old Ooma number (the previous unit lasted 7 years) with the new unit was complex and time consuming.  Also again no instructions for course of action if you already had a previous Ooma.  I had to look online for help and then call the customer service number.
1,I set it up and activated it through the modem. No sign o f any part of it working. I ordered the blue tooth adapter and still nothing happening. No way of knowing it is defective or what. I am returning it all. They said it was easy now I find it is almost impossible to set up and many people have problems.the blue light is on. And somewhere it is receiving phone calls but not in my home. So is it defective.
5,Works super but you need to hard wire to the router for the initial setup
1,Spent 3 days with Ooma support heard lots of goofy excuses. Finally on my own connected the Ooma Telo Air 2 directly to my router with a cat 6 cable and it then worked perfectly. Returned the Telo Air 2 and bought a regular Ooma Telo and I'm very satisfied. Incidentally Ooma second level support told me that Ooma would not work with satellite based internet. I don't have satellite internet but if you do be aware. There used to be concerns due to latency but I'm not sure that's still true today.
5,Easy to setup. No issues
5,Solid connection to my wifi and no issues.
1,Don't buy if you have satillite internet service!  Ooma didn't tell me this but was glad to take my money and set me up before I found out it wasn't compatible.  Then I had to try and re-port my old number back with Verizon.  Pain in the neck all around.  Hughesnet offers their own phone service but I'm tired of trying.  Back to Verizon and $64/mo.
5,Why pay more with my cable provider when I could save with Ooma Telo.
5,Easy to set up wireless connectivity makes placement easier. Number porting quick and easy.
5,Excellent
1,I don't know how there are so many positive reviews.  We bought the top of the line ooma and ooma handset and have never been able to use this service.  We have 200/200 fios and the calls drop every time the phone is picked up and if we call out the static is horrible.  Waste of money very disappointing in reviewers not being honest
5,Easy setup. Save almost $70 a month versus traditional land line costs...
5,Easy set up! Works great. So inexpensive to run a home line.
5,I haven't used it as much as I expected but it works well when I have used it.
1,First one did not work. second came today. Does not work. Can't call out or anyone can call  in. HOWEVER people can call  in directed my voice mail. Which is odd to me. I gave all my husband doctors the new number. Also family and friends.When it worked we loved it . Not now. Don't waste your time and money on this product.
5,Very dependable as long as you have reliable internet service.
5,Easy to install and good porting service.
1,The telephone connector in the back only has one pair (L1) of telephone wire. The standard telephone jack has the ability to contain two pairs (L1&L2). This unit does not. A standard two line telephone plugged in does not "see" the second line. This forces the user to purchase an additional unit from Ooma. If I had it to do over I would do it differently.
1,The phone itself is passable - the connection isn't the greatest but for the price it will do.  HOWEVER the customer service SUCKS.  The women I spoke to on March 21 at around 12:45PM was rude -I  couldn't understand her very well and didn't have a clue how to help me.  Figured it out myself.  Shame on them.
1,Ooma wants to charge $10 a month?I thought I buy the unit and buy 4 of their specialty phones for $33 each that the service was free.I didn't see anything about  a monthly charge on the page where Amazon sells this.Too late to return now so be aware if you buy.
5,Excellent sound quality and very reliable so far.
5,Had it for a little over a week and it works great. Have no complaints.
5,Very easy to install. Works perfect!
1,Tried it. It did hookup to my internet. But the number Ooma gave me did not work. Customer support was of no help. I was charged $7.80 for trying to use it. I do not recommend this product.
5,Easy to setup and use.
5,Love this system. Wish I hadn't waited so long to get one.
5,Works as advertised
1,This started out OK but most of the time there's an echo and I can hear myself talking which is extremely annoying.  I first had it on WiFi then plugged it directly into my computer but still not good.  Other family members have had Ooma and were happy with it but this didn't work for me.
5,Good quality
5,HW phone simple service
2,I plugged it directly into my FIOS 150mx 150m  router to optimize performance. I am still getting dropped calls. Not happy . Going back to a landline.
5,I really love having this and have no complaints.
5,What was ordered nice update.
5,Great sound quality
1,First unit took several years to fail. This second wireless version lasted exactly 1 year and 6 weeks and then suddenly it doesn't recognize any handset is there.
5,Easy to connect.
1,Just another gimmick of "smart" phone spying on you BS. I WANTED A HOME PHONE not a smart phone required phone!Home phone service that requires a smart phone for setup? WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING A HOME PHONE???
1,Product did not work for me. Tried several different ways to install but all the calls were bad or could not hear the other person at all. Would not buy again. Also the ethernet cord was missing and had to purchase one.
5,Works great! Easy setup.
1,Not sure why a company would make setup so difficult. I finally figured it out after a couple hours. I honestly don’t think they pre tested their instructions at all. I wonder how many customers they lose from bad instructions.
5,Easy setup works great
1,I had high hopes but I could never get the product to work. I tried multiple times to connect/set up and called customer service. Still unable to connect. Had to return the product. Would not recommend.
5,Great value. Works perfectly
1,Phone service is greatProblem is I've gotten billed twice once by Ooma and once by Amazon. Not happyWhen I've paid twice as much and can't seem to get someone to acknowledge a problem!
5,OK
5,Works as advertised.
1,Had high hopes based on favorable reviews. would not sync out of the box attemped to troubleshoot with Tech Supt.  They logged off in the middle.  Guess I was taking too long.
1,I probably would have liked it but their website to set it up kept rejecting my credit cards for no reason and their tech support sucks so I sent it back
1,I sent this back. It did not work with our satellite internet provider - even the new one. Even after we trimmed all the tree branches away. I was disappointed.
1,The sound of the phone service sucked for the people on the other side of a call
5,Excellent product
5,It worked great!!!
1,Horrible quality. Customer service tried to help but could not get me up and running. They gave up on me. I am stuck with all tThis OOMA EQUIPMENT
1,Would not recommend this product until Ooma makes nomorobo  - a robo call blocking a premier feature for $9.99- part of basic package. I receive constant robocalls.
1,Just wasted 2 hrs of my day trying to get this device up and running.  You can’t configure this via wifi
5,Works great.
5,I have this unit connected via a wired connection to my gigabit network. I also tried it on wifi to compare performance. In both cases the unit connects quickly and solidly providers great phone quality and requires very little technical knowledge to get it going. The setup app is very useful and walks you through every step. So far I'm very happy with both the Ooma Telo Air 2 and the Ooma service. I chose a wired ethernet connection only to reduce traffic demand on the wifi side of my network and given that it was being installed near my primary network switch. Speaking of wireless range I also use 2 of the Telo HD handsets. With the Ooma base located at one end of my house in a first-floor office I have reliable voice communication anywhere in and around the house.
1,Way too much latency in calls.  Getting rid of and replacing with something else.
1,It is unreliable.
1,Never worked as advertised and Customer Service very hard to work with!
1,Returned product wifi too slow.
1,Sent it back connects to the internet fine but does not stay connected to the ooma server.
1,save you money.
4,For those having trouble connecting the Ooma Telo Air 2 to Wi-Fi read onI had this issue so what I did was connect it to my internet modem and waited for it to program. Then once it was sat up I picked up the phone and dialed *#*#501. Phone beeps 3 times and that activated the Bluetooth. I then signed out of the app then back in and started the process again with the wifi method and it worked successfully and connected to my wifi. Save time and aggravation and do it this way. It's worth it!
4,Customer service is bad.i tried activating my old account and port my old number and the CS named Arnel gave me an attitude saying that the first CS rep i talked to gave me wrong info on porting my old number. Not helpful Ooma should train and demand better service from their Philippines based call center.This call center couldn’t care less if Ooma lose customers! They don’t even try to retain or help just does what the screen in front of them says.i used Ooma formany years until my Telodied bought a new one and tried to activate it but the unit was defective.The Call center reps are not helpful at all.
4,We switched one line from Verizon to Ooma in December 2010.  The service has been excellent.  The only thing we lost was a bill for about $165 per month from Verizon or close to $2000 per year.  When we moved we switched our other two lines.  Our total bill for Ooma is just under $300 per year which includes custom services and a $5 per month charge for a third number.The downside of any VoIP system using the Internet is the Internet itself.  If the service fails your phones will fail.  We took that calculated risk using our cell phones as a backup.  In reality we have lost our service only a handful of times in those 7.5 years and usually for a short period of time.  One Comcast systemwide outage left us without service after midnight for about four hours.One other outage left us without service for a good part of the day while a downed utility pole was replaced following a car accident.  That outage likely affected Verizon customers as well.Below are a few things to note with the Telo in no particular order:1.  Fax service is not guaranteed.  In reality it works well as long as you use the primary line.  I have never had problems with conference calls or other services that require dialing digits during the call.2.  There is a slight delay in connecting calls.  When you answer a call wait a second or two before speaking.  This is not necessarily a fault with Ooma.  .3.  Unlike a copper phone line electronic lines use a switching system for talk and listen.  If two people talk at the same time only one side of the call will go through.  This is not a problem unique to Ooma.4.  Call quality is usually crystal clear.  The Telo is designed to do what it does and to do it well.  A prior VoIP service we had used a generic ATA device which worked but not as well.  Ooma works well.5.  The voice mail system cleverly works without a password if you call from your Ooma line.  That is very handy.6.  The dial tone is different.  This is not a problem but some people think it is odd.7.  There is no "stuttering" dial tone if you have messages waiting.  Unless the Telo is in view you have know way of knowing you have a message.8.  You can keep your old phone number as long as you have Ooma "port" it from your carrier BEFORE you terminate their service.  Telcos can take 2-3  weeks to release a number so you may pay for two services for a while.  That is not a problem unique to Ooma.9.  If you want discrete lines each with their own phone number Ooma Tech Support can program the Telo to support it.  You will need a Bluetooth "Linx" device to provide a telephone connection for the additional numbers.There are many options and accessories available including business services.DISCLAIMER:  My relationship with Ooma is that of a satisfied customer.  I have no vested interests in writing reviews of their products.
1,Terrible sound quality.  After I transferred my number to T-Mobile Ooma continued charging my credit card. When I called Ooma for refund the first Ooma person said my account was still active even the number has been transferred out and I was required to call Ooma again to close my account in order to stop auto-payment. This means Ooma charged my credit card for an account no phone number  and no service. I hanged up and called Ooma again hoping to speak to an honest Ooma person. The second Ooma person said my account was still active because my number was still active with Ooma even my number has been transferred to T-Mobile. This is a lie!  It is not possible a phone number can be active with two carriers.  The third time I called Ooma with T-Mobile on the line to verify my number has been transferred to T-Mobile and should not be active with Ooma.  The third Ooma person said the reason my account was still active and my credit card was charged is because Ooma automatically activated a new number for me when my number was transferred out which means Ooma activated a new number in my account without my permission. Lies after lies!
1,Ordered Ooma's Premier package directly with Ooma.  Received Telo Air 2 from Ooma supposed to be pre-activated and be able to get up and running in less than 15 minutes.  Totally not the case.  With the setup app was not able to get pass the login screen (user ID/PW were fine displayed loading user data then drop back to login prompt).  No issue logging on through the web page.  On phone with Ooma support for 2 hours.  Told to connect Ooma with direct Ethernet but device got stuck at software update.  Was transferred to L2 support who had no idea told need to escalate ticket to L3 support will call back 24-48 hours.  Next day right at Ooma support's closing time (5pm PT) they called twice (2-min apart) unfortunately I was away and missed call.  Tried calling back right away said support hours passed.  Called support back early next morning told to go to their activation page to enter activation code.  But web page showed "error for site owner: invalid domain for site key" for reCAPTCHA.  Received same error on phone iPad PC.  After a while said my ticket needs to be escalated.  Frustrated with the run around.  To me the issues all appeared to be on Ooma's end and the boarding process should not be this difficult.  One customer specialist told me my ticket was never touched by their L3 support (not what I was told 2 days ago).  Decided to cancel.  Per Ooma's agreement had to pay for return shipping for the device (since ordered direct from Ooma with Premier package).  Also for phone # porting per Ooma's support page "It takes an average of three to four weeks to complete the porting process".
3,....And it's a BIG BUT.  While the service is the best of all that I have tried so far -- and I have tried Vonage Verizon and MagicJack -- in terms of consistent sound quality and never any dropped calls Ooma service is bar none top of the line excellent.  Add all the calling features you could ever want for free with only a few that require a small up tick in pricing for the premium level.  Then there is the cost which can be as low as just paying for the local municipal fees and taxes...who else does that?  You can opt for the  premium service which adds some extra features like call blocking -- I found that feature worth the extra few buck.Now here comes the caveat:  while the actual service is impeccable the hardware sucks.  In about 5 years I have gone thru THREE of these Telo units (basically the modem that interfaces to your Ethernet/internet connection) which you must use to connect to your analog house phone and extensions.  I have also gone thru 3 of their bluetooth adapters that allow your cellphone to ring thru to your analog phone and extensions so you can answer your cellphone on any phone and extension in the house.  A really GREAT concept but the adapters that plug into the Telo unit each died within a year or so and all after the 90 day coverage was over (of course).  VERY frustrating.  As much as i love the feature when it was working I just gave up on them due to the failure rate.  Each of the Telo units stopped playing that audio messages within a year or so forcing you to pick up the analog phone to hear your messages.  Not a huge deal because you can still get your messages but since the same problem shows itself on EACH of the units it tells me that whatever factory in China Ooma is using to make these devices it is doing a crap-ass job.  Buying a unit every few years really eats up that great saving you get on the cost of the service.  I stopped buying then after the third one crapped out and just pick up the phone to get voice messages.And I really am bummed out that the unreliable bluetooth adapters for the cellphone interface that also stops working altogether in short order because that was a great feature -- you could answer your cellphone from any analog extension in the house and not miss a call because you are not in the same room with your cellphone. not to mention you get to talk into a REAL telephone handset...one molded to fit your ear instead of trying to hole a flat slab of electronics to the side of your face.So even with all this criticism i would still recommend this VoIP service -- it is the closest you can get to the old copper wire landlines of Ma Bell.  And I still can't figure out their business model and how they can offer this service for practically no cost.  Now if they could just find a Chinese manufacturer that can turn out reliable hardware it would be a real win.Below I give 5 stars for Sound Quality; that refers to the telephone call audio.  The playback sound of voicemail messages thru the Ooma Telo device is only passable...until it totally craps out and will not play back anything....then it's you know NO stars.
2,Cheaply madeTerrible sound qualityYou have to answer twice”hello….hello” before caller hears you.Just say hello once and there will be nobody there ……forever
1,My goodness what junk.  Activation has been a nightmare.  Manuals have wrong instructions.  Website does not activate and displays errors. Two layers of tech support are incapable of activating a device.  3 hours spent day 1 to get this to replace a 7 year old unit I have. What a joke. To top it off OOma refuses to take back product. Over time they’ve ruined the product and have NO tech support capability.
3,While all other Wi-Fi devices work consistently Telo air loses its Wi-Fi connection frequently like every 2-3 days. Powering up the device fixes the problem after 5-6 minutes. Sometime the router has to be powered up. Other devices such as 2 TVs Cell Phones Printers Roku players and Computers maintain their Wi-Fi connectivity.  I am planning to connect the Telo air directly to the router as soon as a telephone jack is installed near the router.  Paid $119.00 for Telo air and in hindsight that was a mistake. Basic Telo is much cheaper. Very disappointed. My recommendation: do not buy Telo air until the problem is fixed. I have Comcast internet but I can't blame Comcast since all other devices connect when the addresses are reassigned every 2-3 days by Comcast. Tried assigning static IP addresses but still lost Telo air and had to reboot the device. When it is connected it works great with good sound quality.
4,I've used Ooma with the original Telo box (not the "air") for about 8 years. It replaced a conventional land line and has saved me thousands of dollars. The reliability and quality is not quite up to a traditional copper land line but close enough. I like that I can call my own phone number from my own phone and leave a voice-memo (say I just remembered I want to call a friend with a birthday greeting tomorrow. That voice memo show up in my email.  I general use my traditional hardware answering machine for incoming messages.... but if say my Internet connection is down voice mails go onto my Ooma account show up in my email and (when my internet is back up) can even be played back right on the Ooma Telo box.  Tech support has be fairly easy to reach and pretty competent (though rarely needed.)  Ooma's filters for robocalls and scam calls are mediocre... but better than nothing.  I like that (if you have one of the Ooma handsets) me and my wife can make (or accept) two separate phone calls on one phone number. Recently after 8 years I believe my Ooma Telo box is getting flaky and may have to be replaced. In all if you want something very very close to having a traditional phone line (not willing to just have a cellular phone) but don't want to pay the price of a landline this is a good service at a very good price. (I should have mentioned I pay the extra $10... or $15 or whatever it is... can't remember) for the premium service.
1,How do I prevent Ooma from connecting to 5 GHz Wifi?  It is not a dual band device only 2.4 GHz is supported. Spent 7 hours yesterday trying to get the Ooma Telo Air to work.  Still no phone since September 6 months of working with tech support.  Already swapped out one unit because it appeared defective.  If the Ooma only works on 2.4 GHz why does it connect to a 5GHz network? Here at the senior living facility there is no choice there are dynamically assigned 2.4 and 5 GHz connections available 10 of each are within range. I am being billed monthly and can't understand why tech support is is helpless and why the unit is not simple to set up. It has never done anything but flash red for 6 months.
5,I did not buy this from Amazon but instead from Best Buy 2 years ago. Best decision ever. Home phone service went from around $55 a month to about 2 dollars a month (I think its state tax or something). The audio is super clear and I just have peace of mind knowing that I'm saving all this money. I even opted to keep my home phone number. For this the website said it could take up to 2 weeks but it took less than two days and my mother and I were so happy we made the switch. The set up was quite easy and the box looks so sleek. It's a really great device. When I move into my own apartment I will likely buy one for myself and upgrade to be able to receive homephone calls on my cell using the app.
3,I loved my Ooma when I first bought it. Now I must pay for 'premium' service to block ANY calls whatsoever- even NomoRobo (free) can't be used. Come on Ooma- EVERYBODY wants call blocking as a minimum feature. You lost 2 stars from me.
2,I've had 'the' original OOMA for over 12 years and it has served me well.  The confusion as to why it suddenly no longer works has been cleared up.  Ooma has changed something in their system and many original owners have reported bricked devices on their forum. Only a PM saved me from changing internet providers trying to fix this.Lost what I thought was a reliable old friend.  I paid 130 a year for all those years when all I really needed was the free service that came with the unit. It appears they're eating their young. I can't use wireless devices and all their new stuff is wireless. Plus who would go back after they thew us under the bus. I'll wait a few more weeks for it to be resolved. Not optimistic as it has never been down nearly this long. I have no way to call in an emergency. I can't use cell phones.I chatted with their customer service and they were never forthcoming that this was happening to all original ooma owners. They acted like it was just mine. I deducted 2 stars for that alone. They don't show the original ooma on here anymore so I'm leaving this here.
4,I bought this Telo Air 2 to replace an old Ooma Telo that would occasionally lose my phone connection and had to be powered down physically and rebooted. I wasn't happy about that (but have been happy with just about everything else). So far this replacement unit has been working well (although it's a little too early to be sure the problem is fixed). Calling Ooma to switch my service from my old Telo to this new Telo Air 2 was easier that expected.Note that you do have to pay monthly taxes and fees with Ooma which amount to about $6 for me in "low tax" Texas.TIP: Check to a place that starts with "C" and ends with "ostco".... includes the HD3 handset.
1,We've been using Ooma for years and it's been working reasonably well.  Recently our device would reset anytime a call came in.  I called support and they said we need to buy a new device.  We did so and he said we would get it within 3 business days and it would be automatically configured for us - we just need to plug it in and we'll be set.Well it took longer than they said to deliver so we were without a phone for a week.  Then I open it up and there's a sticker that says you have to activate it first which means downloading their app or using the enclosed quick start guide.  The last thing I need is to download yet another app so I decided to use the quick start guide only I find that they didn't actually include a quick start guide...  So I'm forced to install their setup app which I do.  It tells me to scan the QR code on the device and after I do so it says "there's an issue you need to call support".  Stellar job so far.  I call support wait on hold forever finally get someone and he takes my info and says "Ok I'm going to create a ticket and someone should call you back within 24-48 hours ok?"  No that's not ok what are you thinking?Bottom line if the service works it's fine (nothing special but fine).  If you have any problems good luck you're going to need it!
5,I have used ooma successfully before at least five years. I am very happy with this machine
4,Pretty easy to setup via web portal/android app. Getting the wifi to work seems to be only possible via the smartphone app but it was rather easy once I installed the app. Previously I contacted OOMA directly to query them on the wifi band potential for this new Gen 2 version of the Air and was told 2.4GHz only however I just hooked up my new Gen 2 directly to my 5GHz band without a problem. Time will tell if it will work or if I have to add to the over-crowded 2.4GHz band.
1,The clicking and word skipping complaints from those on the other end of my phone conversations with Ooma proved frustrating and tiring.  I called into customer service several times and each time the person I spoke to had a menu of possible solutions which didn’t work as well as a menu of excuses.  At the end of each call the person would ask if their service wasn’t just excellent.  When I told them that they meant well but weren’t helpful to me they just glossed over my response.  Their self-help online community revealed that I wasn’t alone with my problems.  The person from Ooma who moderated the forums always seemed to offer being placed on the “east coast server” which would make life on Ooma grand for them.  I asked if I too could be placed on it they said I was not eligible because I was west of the Rio Grande River.  So after getting sick of being SOOL I called to cancel my service and they pleaded with me to sell the Ooma so someone else could benefit from having it.  After laughing at this I told her that I would not sell it as I did not want anyone coming after me following the sale.  I told her I was going to throw the unit in the garbage and she pleaded with me not to.  I ended up throwing it in the garbage.
1,Made of a collection of obsolete components. Slow beyond imaging. I can't imagine what a mees the network stack is. For grandma and people who don't know what wifi calling and headsets are. Enough plastic waste to kill 1000 fish too
2,They dont tell you that you are limited to the # of numbers you can block which is 1024. Now that may sound like a lot but when you get 2-3 robo calls per day that limit gets filled up fast. Also they have not adopted the FCC Shake/Stir protocol to filter out robo calls and spoofed ID's and based on my discussions with them they have no intention of doing so until forced. Also the app is weak it works but it lacks the functionality of the web gui. I am always looking for new service to replace Ooma but sadly there arent really many in the price point but I am hopeful there soon will be so I can make the switch.
1,This was a major time suck. I bought this because I really did not want to give up my landline but was tired of spending a fortune on it via cable. So someone suggested ooma. First it takes 3 to 4 weeks to transfer your existing number. You don't know that unless you read the small print... or in my case after I received the unit and opened the box. I opened my ooma and it looked pretty nice. They get one start for making something that looks good. So here's how this works. First they want your credit card number. To set up the account they want you to buy a whole lot of other services. You can get past that but it's a time suck too. Then it's time to plug in the equipment. I bought the wireless version thinking this would be great but actually it's not. In reality the directions recommend you use an ethernet cable. When I went to plug in the power pack to the back of the unit the plastic immediately snapped and there was no way to fix the problem. It was very frustrating. Like most companies they route you through a customer support system that is like going through a bunch of hurdles. They first offer to send you a new unit. That's nice. But by the time I had spent two hours setting this junk up and then another hour trying to talk to a real person... I was kind of done.  I will say they are very good at saying "I'm sorry that happened." They said it 7 times on the chat and both of the people I spoke too also said it (they have to route you around a bit). This was a major disappointment.  Don't waste your time or money. Just cancel your landline and route the number to your cell phone.
2,Had I read reviews here on this website I would not buy Tele Air 2 wireless system. I spent last two days working with level 2 support it is still not working - wireless wifi connection got dropped frequently.  Level 2 tech asked me to connect to my wifi router via ethernet cable for 24 hours to find out whether it will be dropped. It is sure a goofy solution. I purchased for wireless not wire connection. I am going to return the product. Problem existed in 2018 is still existed today Nov. 2020.
5,Best money saving purchase I have ever made. I purchased an Ooma Telo ($149) and have been using Ooma for phone service since December 2011.  By cutting the cord with CenturyLink I have SAVED $5460 to date!  Ooma has proven to be extremely reliable and offers excellent sound quality and many features that I have come to rely on.  As a home based biz owner I had a business line and a personal line in addition to my cell phone service.  I wanted to keep those numbers but save money.  Ooma to the rescue!  Goodbye traditional land line.  Simultaneous ring* allows me to answer calls on my home / office phone or my cell phone.  So I never miss a call.  I also recommend Ooma Premier for additional features such as 2nd tel number free calling to Canada and Mexico simultaneous ring to your cell phone 3-Way Call conferencing etc (*Simultaneous Ring is an Ooma Premier feature)  Ooma also has good customer service with real people you can talk to if you ever need help.  My highest recommendation!
1,Please stay away from this company it constantly charges me over and over again. The annual premier I've been charged 3-different amounts in under a Year. 144.92 on 11-02-18 then 129.31 on 5-16-19 then 134.15 on 7-26-19  I finally reported my card stolen by Ooma. We never even wanted Premier we don't use anything but one phone to make like 3 calls a week. But didn't wanna deal with poor CS to get premier off. But charging us for Annual premier 3-times in under a year is crazy and gone to far. Screen shot for proof.
1,Ooma is a terrible phone service period. I purchased this for my mother to replace her main phone service and everything was fine until they canceled the service and left me scrambling to replace her phone service. The backstory is that there was a death in the family and she was the one left having to handle all of the arrangements for the funeral notifying family members of what happened and acting as the middle person for everything. She spent a large amount of her days after her brother died on the phone and used up alot of minutes. Next thing I know I get a call from ooma saying that because of that they will be canceling her phone service and had x amount of days to port her phone number to another provider or it would be given away. I explained everything that se was going through and they did not care. I now have a piece of expensive useless plastic sitting in my closet.
1,The device works at first but drops its connection on a daily basis forcing a restart of the device. It's not my internet connection: I've got fiber optic a new router I've tried with ethernet and Wi-Fi. Tech support is terrible. The phone app that you use to configure the device is terrible.
2,used the Ooma service for a few years. Although the sound quality was adequate dealing with their customer service was awful: long waiting times and also being passed from service agent to service agent. Canceling the service today took almost an hour! And repeated requests for a confirmation email or number were met with resistance.
2,Painfully bad customer service both by phone and chat. The line had echoing and a delay.
1,I purchased a new telo air and had just set it up and was about to port my existing number on their website and was surprised that there was a $39.99 dollar fee for this to happen. This was never discussed with me when I placed the order. All I was told was that my existing telephone number was able to be ported. I have the transcript of the order and even there it was never mentioned. So I decided to cancel my service since I was deceived by their shady practice. So if you are considering this device beware of their dishonestly.
1,After 3 sessions with Ooma tech support I'm still not able to get my unit set up. Their app wouldn't install on either my or my wife's phone. Trying the Alternative WiFi setup the unit stayed in red mode (waited 4 hours) and never booted. Trying the Ethernet method the unit also stayed in red mode (waited overnight) and never booted. Will return. In my last tech support chat the agent gave me their customer support phone number and just hung up on me!
1,I connected my Ooma Telo Air 2 direct connection to my AX6000 router. This router is connected to my gigabit Verizon FiOS 1gbps connection. Calls constantly drop sound distorted and Ooma service connectivity is unreliable. I am disappointed as I heard great things about the Ooma service and even paid the year premium subscription to get all the enhanced features. I would have returned the device but it was way past the return window.
1,I don't recommend this unit or company. You will have to sign up for a monthly subscription service that is IMPOSSIBLE to cancel and will be charged on your cc even if you cancel the card. We switched to Magic Jack same quality NO MONTHLY FEES!
1,Same issue as another reviewer. My unit refused to connect to wifi only worked when I plugged it directly into my router don't waste the extra money just get a normal telo.
5,I was pessimistic about the quality of the phone and the service when I learned that the phone service is free. Because I generally believe in the statement "you get what you pay for". Later I decided to try it after someone recommended it. After using it for over a month I am pleasantly surprised to see how amazingly it works. It is not at all inferior to any of the landline services available out there. In many ways it is superior. Clarity and sound quality are amazing. It displays the picture of the caller if you have included it in the caller-list. Filtering out unwanted calls is among the useful features. I am really impressed.
1,I have had ooma now for about 3 months. Every single day I have to reboot the unit 4 to 5 times a day. Whenever a call comes in it knocks the unit off. Then I have to reboot. Also randomly it asks me to press 1 to accept the call. My daughter calls from the same number and sometimes I have to press1 and other times I do not. After hours and hours of being on the phone with ooma support with them telling me each time that the problems are fixed alas it happens again! I'm done with them! Worst $200 I ever spent for phone service!
1,Keeps dropping my internet so now it is plugged into the wall wasting the extra $$$ I spent to get the wireless version.  Other devices in my house work just fine via wireless internet so I think this thing just has a crumby signal.  I did not want this stupid thing in my kitchen where I now have to plug it in so it sits there in plain view reminding me what a piece of crap it is and how I paid extra for no reason.
1,Ooma will not let you cancel service. Do not get caught in this trap.
1,It mostly worked but came to a point where I switched to a better device. Now comes the fun part. Trying to cancel OOma service. I (thought) I canceled the service but discovered they continued to bill me. I called customer service to complain and they insisted I keep paying for OOma! Then they said "if you don't want it we told you to give the device to a friend or sell it". I'd never recommend OOma to anyone.
5,We have 3 phone lines and each 3 Ooma Telo's to go with them. They were easy to set up and have worked beautifully for several years. We also have an HD2 handset that is excellent. We're getting great service and have saved 100's of $! Thank you Ooma for the great equipment you provide!!!
5,The service is simple to install and  use. I have had three other VOIP service carrier and OOMA is the best yet. Unless you have my OOMA phone number the phone does not ring.NO robo calls. OOMA does not sell your number. The calls placed and received are clear with no interruption and static free.
5,I’ve had this for years and love it. Can’t beat long distance calling for less than $5/month.  It works even when my router says internet connection is lost!
5,The service works very well and you just need to remember that when your internet service goes down so will your phone. A very cost effective telephone and you get to keep your number and take it with you wherever you go.
5,Really not much to say. I've had this unit for more than a year. It works fine. No garbled speech..no problems whatsoever.
5,i had the original ooma that worked for 4 years and it finally died. i dont know what happened it just wouldn't work any more. i restarted it reset it called tech support and couldn't get it online. this one was wired. so i went online and shopped for a new one. of course i had the wires so i went with this version. built in wifi no usb dongle needed.if you you already have service and buying a replacement you need to call tech support. you cannot swap the unit on your own. they have to authorize it and link it to your existing omma account. i really didn't like that because i dont like calling tech support for something so simple.ooma your wasting money on tech support for swapping out units. allow your users that know how to do it. allow them to enter in the authorization code and MAC ID from the website and you'll cut cost on technical support.ooma support did link up the new device to my existing account and i was up and running in 15mins. after a 30min hold time for tech support. this isn't important for regular users but i'm a techie and wanted a static local IP but after another 20mins with ooma tech support the new device cannot take a static IP. even tho it has a section that allows you to set up a static IP it wont let you. it keeps error'ing out. ooma said it's a known issue and i would have to setup my DCHP with MAC reservation to issue the static IP which worked but they should really fix that. why have that option if you can't set it?even with that minor issue. love my ooma great easy to use. perfect upgrade from my old one.
5,Easy installation Good tech support Very inexpensive  Excellent sound quality. No more additional surcharges fees tariffs and taxes form your land line provider. Just great service and a great price. Will work with the cordless phone setup you already have. I have had one for five years - this one I bought for my daughter and she had it setup and working very quickly.
4,I was disappointed that the call-fwding feature did NOT come with this product - contrary to one of the Q&A below. CFwd is necessary for my business.  >> It pays to read everything!  However Customer service was very helpful!  With the Air 2 VoIP you will receive 2 mos free trial of Call Fwding (reg $9.99/mo).
5,Replaced another VOIP system with this.Less dropped calls better service and considerably less expensive monthly fees
5,Works as described need tech support was excellant
5,Switching to this is saving me money from xfinity and att. I am only paying taxes and fees which is about 5 bucks a month.
5,I love OOMA.  I used it in the past and now am using it again.  I only pay 6.80 a month versus 40+ with AT&T.  Sound quality is great on it.
4,Unit works great ~ 4 weeks now. Big savings monthly by ditching ATT ~ 1.1 months payback.Strong WIFI Signal no need to run a CAT6 cable from Modem located upstairs to Cordless Phone Base station downstairs. Dial tone takes some getting use to.Downside is the Voicemail playback tends to be garbled most of the time. Can hear it but not clear as it should be !
4,My ooma is working fine. Connects to my wifi and allows me to use a land line as described but the package had previously been opened. The unit looks new but I hate getting orders that look like they were returned. Especially electronics and precision tools. Amazon has to figure out how to fix that.
5,Works great clear sound quality.With wifi feature I can position it anywhere...
5,I just lost my dad in sept my dad was a 35 yr veteran of AT&T so he had employee discount for the home phone. But once he past that discount did not stay for my mom so here phone bill went sky high for a landline. I followed in my father’s footsteps and work in telecommunications. Since I’m a voice over IP engineer I stated researching reliable phone service that’s affordable. I compared Ooma against Vonage and felt that Ooma was a better buy for my mom who is on a fixed income. I would have given it 5 stars but I feel the Wi-Fi needs some work I had to add my netgear Orbi mesh system to get enough coverage for Ooma to pick up in my moms room.After we ported her number over from AT&T the call quality is crisp and clear for a fraction of the price. I even used her exist AT&T wireless dect 6.0 phone system which works perfectly.I highly recommend this product if you want a home phone. Easy set up and you own the hardware so no monthly equipment cost.
5,As a retired former Bell System employee I was curious about internet based local phone service. After researching various providers I purchased the Ooma Telo Air 2 unit. I activated with a new number from Ooma for testing purposes but will port existing Windstream number during 60 day free trial of Premier package. Ooma offers more features that work better than Telco. Ooma website is rich with account and call log information as well as easy ability to modify account settings. Sound quality is better than Telco. When I had questions about Ooma service tech support was quickly available and very knowledgeable. I did not utilize WIFI feature as I was able to connect Ooma directly to my house wiring through a single RJ11 jack.  I was able to send outgoing Fax but have not received an incoming Fax as of yet. Not everyone has the skill or resources to connect this way but it can be done. HOWEVER with all these advantages the most important aspect of this service is the cost. Local Telco with no Long Distance package and only Caller ID is $55. Ooma with Premier package is $17. $7 if you do not need Premier package. Since I was able to purchase this unit for $89.95 from Amazon the payback even with porting charge is less than 3 months not to mention the increased flexibility provided by Ooma features. If you pay a year in advance the $40 porting charge is waived. NOTE: this service is even less expensive than Spectrum home phone service in my area. Give it a try if you are looking for less expensive more feature rich and flexible home phone service.UPDATE: Porting went well from OOMA end however Windstream was a pain. Finally ported and all is well. Satisfied with quality and support. Great communication with OOMA staff.
4,We replaced a regular unit that had started needing reboot daily. We got this to move it where there was no wiring so it could reach the living room easier. It does that until it decides to quit working. Tech Support has no idea what to do other than reboot it frequently.
1,Well marketed but impossible to set-up successfully.  Spent 2.5 hours each day for 3 straight days with their "tech support" trying to get the unit set-up to make calls.  I could hear the phone tech turning pages in an effort to help . . . Is the unit plugged in? Is the light blinking?  What color?  PAINFUL yet unrewarding.  Sending it back today.  What I found out through the experience:  a) you MUST have a PC connected to the unit via ethernet cable (regardless of their set-up manual instructions to the contrary);  b) you MUST be connecting to a SECURED WIFI NETWORK (even though this is not stated anywhere in their set-up guide nor acknowledged by "tech support".  Slick marketing company with a product that may work well in their lab but just doesn't perform in the real world.
5,Magic Jack did not work with New 5G Cellular Internet.  (T-Mobile)  Ooma was the final puzzle piece I needed.
5,Works well except not compatible with our security system. Had to invest in a new alarm monitoring system!
1,didnt work
5,Works great and is saving me so much money. I use this as my business line and haven’t had a single issue!
5,Works perfectly hard wired to router.
1,Ooma is complete junk kept getting phone calls from other countries phone calls from companies thinking my phone number was an old company continuously you could barely hear you had to walk around your house saying can you hear me can you hear me now
5,I had the regular Ooma Telo and people would complain about the sound breaking up on the call. I decided to buy the Ooma Telo Air because it could be directly connected  with an ethernet cable to my fios modem/router.  It has solved the problem; sound is much better than previously.  If you already have an account with Ooma as I did call them and they will take the information on the new Telo over the telephone--the information is rather small so you may want to have a magnifying glass handy. Then they will switch your old number to the new account and send you an email when everything is ready to use.
5,Easy set up works as expected
5,Easy to setup and install.  Decided to go with the pay service for the extra features and had a seamless transition to port the existing phone number to the Ooma.  I really like that if I'm not in my office the Omma forwards to my cell phone through the Ooma app so I know it's  a call from my home office and not coming to my cell phone directly.  Much more economical than the $30/month I was paying for phone service.
1,Got this unit from Amazon Canada and then the nightmare started.  Setup would not let me enter a Canadian address so I called Ooma fo help.  They told me to use a fake US address and then change it back to a Canadian one.  OK so a little weird but I tried.  It worked got the box started but when I tried to change the address they told me it was impossible that it was a US machine not made for Canada and even suggested that I purchased it in the states.  Now I have to wait for an Ooma supervisor to get back to me.  So beware if you download the installation app and it wont let you enter a Canadian address STOP and either send it back or see what can be done with Ooma.  THe easy bit is putting in your cc info that'S gonna be interesting with US billing on my account.  THe product is OK but the service and instalation is amateurish at best.
1,Unlike the Telo non-Air unit on Amazon this one can't be activated in Canada (as others have said) without using a US address.  However that won't work if you want a Canadian phone number.I purchased a Telo Air directly from Telo and it (like the Telo non-Air from Amazon) both activate with Canadian addresses and permit Canadian phone numbers.The product is fine I'm sure but I can't imagine why you'd come to amazon.ca to buy a US unit.
1,Product is a US unit
1,Totally useless in Canada. Just wasted an hour of my life trying to activate it only to find out it can’t be used in Canada.
2,J'ai reçu l'appareil très rapidement. Toutefois c'était un appareil pour les États-Unis. Je l'ai retourné et tout s'est bien passé. Le service à la clientèle d'Ooma m'a recommandé de me procurer le bon appareil (pour le Canada) ce que j'ai fait. Très bon service à la clientèle chez Amazon et chez Ooma (en anglais seulement).
1,Bought this off amazon.ca for us in Canada.  I receive a US only unit.  Get your act together.  Returning.
4,I have saved hundreds of dollars using  the Ooma voip telephone system.since 2012. I have had one unit fail after the warranty period and the Speaker fail on another Unit which was replaced under warranty without a problem. I have found their Customer Service to be excellent. the Telo Air 2 wi-fi is excellent and the hds 3 handsets are  very nice and efficient . I especially like the portability of the Ooma system. I use it in Florida and in Canada.Sound quality could use improvement  for me to give 5 Stars. but I am more than satisfied with this product..
1,I have used Ooma for about 7 years now and had to replace my device.  I ordered a Telo 2 off of amazon Canada and received it quite quickly.  When I tried to install it I realized if I wanted to use the same number I had to call customer service.  This was the first pain...  After a Lengthy conversation the number was transferred to this new device ( I was told) .  I did the setup process and it would never connect to wifi.  I called customer support again explained the issue and was told to try several things and they would call me back.  They never did.  I called again a few days later and was told to do the same things over and over.  Still didn't work.  So I decided maybe it was defective and sent it back and ordered another.  Rather than have to phone again ( I had probably spent 4 hours on the phone) I thought I would just get a new number it might be easier.  I tried to setup a new number and it wouldn't let me use a Canadian address.  Customer support told me to use a fake US address.  But I didn't want a US number...  They then said I would have to go up a level in support.  I went and purchased one at Best Buy in Canada.  Plugged it in set it up in minutes.  Not once did anyone in support realize that they sell US devices on Amazon Canada.  They won't work with a Canadian number.  After all that when they changed my original number to the new device they took away the long distance credit I had and never returned it.  I blame both Ooma and Amazon for these issues;  Amazon Canada for selling a US device and Ooma support for not being able to figure this out.
5,When I received this Ooma device I went to work setting it up- turns out the one I had was set up for a US system. I attempted to set it up with my Lap Top- advice- Don't. Once I used a cell phone- scanned the code and waiting about 45 minutes - it was up and running. It has great sound quality. My problems setting up the system was more Shaw related than Ooma.  I'm not who Shaw is hiring for Tech Support but the one lady I spoke with didn't even know what an Ethernet Cable was.
1,C'est vendu par Ooma store en $CAD et j'ai payé les taxes Canadienne applicable mais il s'agit d'un produit US donc selon le service à la clientèle Ooma je dois le retourner. Déçu!
1,Apparently Amazon will send you the unit  via the ooma store but it's completely unusable in Canada.They dispatch US units because... that makes sense.After an hour on the phone with OOMA they told me this.
1,Why I received a us based technically not compatible in Canada ?Coucou ????
