5,Still have the first one on my camera lens and is holding amazing have dropped my phone alot and still on their good
4,Can’t give an honest review until I’ve had it for a while. It seems fine. There were no directions so make sure you pull everything out of the box before applying and use your imagination. I missed the cleaning clothes and wipes.
5,I have been searching for a camera lens cover for months. I am glad I ran into this product! It definitely does its job!! I recommend this product! It has great reviews. It even comes with a little paper slip that leads you to a website on how to install the lens protector! Please buy this if you need a camera lens cover!!!
4,These are pretty good quality I drop my phone here and there and these last through several hard drops. Can’t complain for the price. I’d buy them again.
4,It was really good but having to place it was really hard my mom struggled for half an hour trying to put it on perfectly and after some time it worked very well! Definitely recommend and would buy again
5,I would buy it again
5,I highly recommend I dropped my phone from the second floor balcony at the safari park in Escondido and if it wasn’t for them my phone camera pieces would be broken or shattered because it actually shattered and save my lens so I purchased again
5,This is my second time using this item cause my friend gave me the extra one she had but this is my first time buying it. I had to replace my last one because I dropped my phone on a small rock or something. The protector cracked but my camera was fine thank goodness. But anyway I have no complaints pretty easy to install comes with cleaning and drying wipe.
5,Nothing much to say
4,Easy to install protect your camera a simple fall will crack it.
5,If it’s perfectly doesn’t come off and it’s peace of mind to know that your lenses are well protected
4,I guess I wasn’t paying attention and ordered the wrong one
5,Des it’s job.  When I dropped my phone  the protector took the shock and crack not my phone lens.
5,The best product out there
4,It was pretty easy to install. I think they improved the design with the black glare absorbing ring on some of these protectors. I kept it on regardless.
5,I dropped my phone on our concrete porch. The lens saver I had on my phone cracked. I'm sooo happy that's all that cracked. I immediately ordered more!
4,Muy bueno
5,A few days ago I had dropped my phone outside onto the pavement and the top camera completely smashed. I was so upset and saw that Apple doesn’t replace camera lens so I looked into how to do it myself. I ended up buying a new lens to replace the old one and after I did that I put this lens protector on top. It completely covers the cameras so there is no chance of breaking them again and the picture quality seems pretty clear right now! It also fits perfectly with my phone case which is super important so that was great!I’m hoping it holds up well.Overall I’m happy :’) very glad I was able to fix and protect my cameras.
5,Fast and EZ
5,Everything was easy from ordering to usingGreat protection for my grandsons phone
5,Not so good in sticking it to your phone
5,They fit well. Looks awesome
3,Wet wipes to clean were not wet it was dry :-(I cleaned my phone’s camera as much as I could. I used the microfiber and the dust sticker to make sure. I put on the camera protector on and it was a little easy to install but I did notice that there was a bubble and when I went to press down on it to take the bubble out another bubble would appear on the opposite side. I didn’t want to make it any worse so I left it and figured it would adhere on its own with time and gravity lol. I hope it’s enough protection considering around the camera there is a small gap of a bubble. I wouldn’t advise to press down to hard to end up breaking the camera. Then again if you have to press that hard to take the bubbles out and make sure it grips firmly around the camera circles then how good is this company’s camera protector anyway.Update: 10/26/2021So we have the camera covers on the phone and we noticed that when we take a picture with the flash the camera doesn’t adjust well to focus and there a white glare in photos due to the side of the camera protector :-( I pressed hard but there still is a gap. This is jr good
4,I put this on my iPhone 11 13 days ago as of writing this review. The protector works very well and I feel much more comfortable putting my phone in my pocket with other things that could scratch it. Installation was pretty easy. I did get it slightly out of alighnment on my first attempt but luckily it wasn’t fully pressed down or anything so it peeled off and I tried again. I will say there are some smudges/streaks that seem to be on the underside of the protector HOWEVER I do not entirely blame the manufacturers because plenty of other variable could have contributed such as readjusting the protector not cleaning the phone good enough etc. I didn’t notice a decrease in camera quality. There might be a very slight decrease but let’s be honest you didn’t buy the iPhone 11 for the camera. All in all I recommend this project if you are as concerned about keeping your technology in great condition as I am.
5,Very easy to installGood quality materialGreat price
4,Does what I need it to do.
5,This product gives you two camera lens protectors for your iphone. I used one on my iphone 12 mini and gave the other to my sister who has the iphone 11 and both were very easy to install. Tested both for the glare of what some other reviewers mentioned and there is none.[Just make sure you are dead center on your flash when installing and you won't get that glare.]Installed both one time each and after that it just works.Best product to get!! A++(See photos of both iphones camera lens protectors) (The test shots are with flash on).ex: iphone 12 mini + test shot |iphone 11 + test shot
5,All good
5,It fits perfectly and protects the lens.
5,Easy to use
1,The description said this product (camera lens protectors) was new.  When I received the package the outer envelope was completely sealed but the inner package - a small box - had been torn open. One of the screen protectors was inside its little foam envelope like it I should be. The other screen protector was stuck to the dust removal sticker and was broken.  I tried to contact the seller but never got a response from one of the email addresses included in my order. I messaged the other email address and received a reply asking for a significant amount of personal info (not happening!).Hopefully I get the seller’s attention here and get the broken item replaced.Regarding the one good lens protector I received:  it seems to be of acceptable quality. It was a little hard to install because it needs to be perfectly straight to not interfere with the camera & flash. If it isn’t installed correctly it creates a terrible glare.  I put a toothpick in the hole in the protector to help hold it in place while I pressed it down on the phone.The adhesive seemed weak when I put the protector on but it hasn’t fallen off or slid. (It’s been installed for about a month).Update: lens protector shattered today. I didn’t drop my phone or bump it into anything I have no idea why it broke.  Don’t waste your time & money in this product find a better brand.
5,Great product
5,Can’t even tell this is on your camera and love that it is tempered glass
4,Thanks
5,I WNAT TO KEEP THE PRODUCT DO NOT SEND THE REFUND
5,son broke the cam lens on his phone. the cam kept trying to auto focus and was basically broke  I cleaned out the broken glass wiped down everything real good. Installed this protector. All fixed. 8$ much better then 400$ fix.
5,La facilidad de instalartlo
2,This thing literally cracked within days which causes a glare in my camera. When I tried to remove it it took two people tread a needle and a knife and when it did start to come off it shattered into pieces and scratched my phone and camera. Luckily none of the damage it lefts effect how the pictures come out but it’s toll upsetting and I would not recommend.
2,They say they are same size as phone but they did not fit right. It was very hard to try and put on and the lense cover was way too small.
5,I am happy with my purchase.
5,I accidentally dropped my phone directly on the camera and it cracked the camera protector but not the camera. Just ordered some more!
3,the product is amazing at keeping my phone camera safe but whenever i take pictures with the flash on the pictures come out a big white orb looking thing in the bottom left corner. it makes the pictures look foggy bad quality and a little blurry. it’s pretty frustrating but at least it’s protecting my camera
5,Easy to install doesn’t make my picture or video blurry with the protector does its job just like the description.
5,These are great and helped to protect my camera!
4,The product works well
4,I bought this for both my phone and husbands phone. I have a no brand case for my phoNe and this fits perfectly unfortunately my husband’s phone have Spigen tough armor case and this doesn’t fit right. It won’t even sit on top of the lenses so the adhesive is useless. If you have a different brand case for your phone get it it works but if it has a Spigen case get the spigen brand which is expensive that is why I chose this.
5,Very good screen cover lets you use the fingerprint function. What you have to know is watch the video on Amazon  not the video mentioned on the box. I emailed customer service and they were very helpful. Adhesion is excellent. It does not crack appears durable so far. Would recommend. Would buy again.
4,There is a card in the packaging offering a free gift in exchange for reviews. The sheer volume of reviews is a testament to this.Just installed it a few hours ago. Fits well and sticks. It is truly case friendly the edges of the glass protector do not protrude out from the camera platform (currently have mine on an OtterBox).Using the flash will result in that reflection pictured by other reviewers. Yes it will happen. This is a non-issue for me as I steer away from Iphone flash photography all together.Hope this helped someone.
5,Fell at a concert and phone made direct contact with the concrete floor cracked the protecter but saved the camera!
5,I can’t take a pic because I’m writing this on my phone duh but my camera would be shattered without this protector. I just got the phone too so I’m really glad I had this! I would recommend buying one for sure. I drop my phone all the time but I dropped it on concrete and a rock got the camera
3,The product isn’t great the dark lines around the lens makes it difficult to apply. It is also not good for focusing on an object. I had to take it off as it was affecting my picture quality.
5,i like this camera protector i think it protect my camera just fine. It’s flat and almost feels like it’s apart of my case. A lot of people were talking about the flash and saying a halo shows up when taking photos with the flash. i have not had that problem. but the camera protector i got has a black ring inside where the flash is and i’m pretty sure that prevents the halo from showing up and i don’t think earlier version of the protector had that so. also it was easy to apply.
4,Covers the camera lens and the raised part of the camera so everything on that square is evenly flat. There is a black ring around the flash circle and mine fell out. Not sure if it is supposed to remain or not. I don't think this sticks completely flat but that doesn't bother me. Sticking this onto your camera does not affect the camera quality and the flash/microphone portions are not covered (there are cutouts for those). All in all not sure if this is absolutely required for your phone. I got it for ease of mind and it simply does what it claims to do- nothing more nothing less.
5,Dropping my phone more and more these days.  So this was great to protect screen and camera. Pictures still look great!!!
3,I installed it just like the video said. it was easy   it fell off after a day can’t find it …. Will try to use other one in package
5,Me en canto es muy bueno material se lo recomiendo
5,My kids are always dropping their phones so when I bought the new iPhone 11 for my daughter for her birthday I wanted to double the protection on this thing.  I purchased a case a screen cover and this the camera lens protector.A week later it saved her camera lens!  While working out she dropped it directly on a weight lifting bar and it cracked.  She was hysterical!  After showing me I could see that the cover saved it as it was ONLY the cover that was cracked.  This is a must-have!  Get it...you will be sorry if you don't.
5,I bought the iPhone 11 (upgrading from an iPhone 5 so I don't spend money like this often). First thing I thought was OMG these camera lenses are going to get scratched. I bought this and it was easy to install (comes with 2 so I'll have to gift the other one or save). Some reviews seemed to indicate that their photo quality diminished with this on it. I think they made modifications to it because my photos look fine and I noticed after a few complaints others seemed to say their photos were fine also. Also once installed it doesn't stick out any more than the lenses normally did and my case fit perfectly fine over it! These were all things I was unsure about when I bought this.
5,Good price great product; prompt and professional
5,Great protection
2,Very easy to install but unfortunately I noticed a rough spot on the outer edge and can’t remember how that could have happened.
5,I’ve had this camera protector for a few months now & I can say that I don’t have as much of a heart attack when I drop my phone. I was so worried about my camera breaking until I got this product! Im very satisfied & I also still have the second one they send you as a back up which will come in handy some day. When installing make sure your camera is clean. Super clean. Any smudge or dust particle will mess up your photos when using the flash.
3,Ok but has glares. You have to keep wiping it off
5,Very easy to install doesn’t obstruct camera views or flash doesn’t really add any height to the lenses. Comes with everything you need and has an installation video. Everything it advertises to be.  I can’t speak to durability as I’ve only just installed it. But it looks and feels sturdy so I suspect it is 5 star worthy as well.Edit: I’ve had this for a while now and embarrassingly shattered it by holding it in my teeth. So don’t do that! I’ve also noticed green spots in my photos when the light is just right. My daughter thinks they’re fairies so it works out for me.
5,It protects the camera without compromising photo quality
5,Fits perfectly and sturdy.
3,This product comes with wipes and cloths for the installation process. There is also a super helpful installation video if you need help. It seems really durable and it was easy to install. I have noticed a difference in my camera quality especially when taking photos at night. The before photo is how my photos look without the protector the second is with the protector. Both were taken at night. Notice the blue glare in the photo. As other comments have said it is probably light reflect off of your phone (I have the mint green color iPhone 11). I plan to take it off because of that. If you don’t plan to take a night photos with flash then I guess it would be fine. It does seem like it would do a good job at protecting your camera.
4,Just got this.  The At&T Sales Person put it on for me.  She thought it was great and she was meticulous and she was impressed.  She only commented that she had a tiny difficulty with aligning it.
1,I bought these (I had some in the past that were fine).  I put one on my phone and within 2 days part of it had broken off.  I didn't drop my phone and my phone is either always on the charging stand or inside a pocket in my purse.  They are much bulkier than they were prior.  What a waste.  I shouldn't have trusted them.
3,I have an iPhone 11 Pro with 3 cameras and this product is for 2 cameras.  It's totally my fault and really I shouldn't even review the product but chose 3 stars in case it helps to alert others.
2,I bought this as a camera lens protector for my iPhone 12 mini because the product title said it's compatible with the 12 mini and I could also tell by the product images that this would fit my lenses. However this is NOT case-friendly with an iPhone 12 mini. The product is awesome has great adhesion and is definitely durable the only thing is that my case would not go flush back on my 12 mini after this was installed. If you don't have a case on your 12 mini you'll be just fine. If you have an iPhone 11 you'll be just fine and in your case I recommend this product. If you have the 12 mini however look elsewhere! Get one that is meant specifically for the 12 mini.
5,Easy to install
4,I just applied this to my phone so I can't speak to the durability yet. So far I can say that the pictures I take aren't affected by the protective cover. They're clear. Application of the cover was very easy. It's quite slim so it doesn't affect the case I'm using at all. I'd recommend this kind of cover to anyone buying an expensive phone.
5,I just applied Camera Lens Protector to my new iphone  11. I am so glad I got lens protector because the case that I bought for my phone doesn’t protect lens at all. The installation of lens protector is so easy. I did it within a few minutes. Took a picture and it is as good as it would be without the protector. Now I don’t have to worry about lens to be accidentally scratched.I would definitely recommend this product!
5,Awesome product
1,It popped right off and I followed all the instructions. I will be returning FYI I just saw a video that our iPhones glass is almost impossible to scratch anyhow and that these protectors because of the film the glue and the plastic make your pictures dull. So Google it it’s kind of like bottled water you don’t need it. And again this pooped off when I was wiping off my phone Not even an hour or so later.
3,Easy to install but didn’t stay on all the time.
5,Wanted to protect my camera and I’ve had one of these on for a year. No issues scratches or damage to it at all (I’m clumsy & drop my phone often)
5,The title says it all. Not a scratch on her camera from where she dropped it. This was my 2nd pair I ordered. Have one on my phone as well luckily I haven’t dropped mine at the right angle yet 😉.Have an otterbox and hard screen protector on both phones as well. If you’re on the fence buy this.
2,Break easily
5,These seem like a really useful product if only had my iPhone 11 for about a week but have been terrified I was going to scratch the lenses to the camera so these are a life saver for me considering I don’t get nice phones usually I just go with a prepaid but wanted something nicer to take pictures of my kids. Will definitely be ordering more.
1,This product first off doesn’t look like the photo presented and then doesn’t even do the job of sticking on my phone it was sticky for a little while but then fell off and didn’t even stick
5,I like how thin it is and you can’t tell you have it on the phone also the camera still looks the same like nothing there gonna order more
3,My first one of the two pack broke in under three days which was definitely weird because I had this pack before and used one protector for months. I just put the other one on yesterday hope this one keeps up like my first did.
5,Just received my Camera Lens Protector for my iPhone 11 and I love it! It's of great durable quality it was very easy to install and it fits to a T with my phone case on. I highly recommend this product. A+++
5,My pocket is the go-to storage for change keys and phone. I like that my camera is now protected from scratches And I can take clear pictures.  It comes in a pack of 2 so it’s easy to swap out if the lens protector gets scratched or broken.
2,Okay so pros: this lens cover was easy to apply and has held up well for several weeks of regular phone-dropping without any cracks or scratches.Cons: seriously effects the color contrast on all photos (they all look a little…foggy? Blacks are all gray-ish.) But the real dealbreaker is how it reacted to a picture with flash. I took a few with the night vision setting and they turned out okay-ish but the flash created a hazy white vignette obscuring almost the entire photo (see attached image.)So. I guess this is okay if you aren’t super attached to photo quality and never use your flash.
5,Very nice case.  Fits well looks good easy to put on.  Protects my new phone well!
5,This was the perfect glass cover for my iPhone 11's camera glass. It has kept my phones's camera safe for 6 months with no issues and has not lost any sticking power. It is very durable however the only issue is that it messed up the flash when I take photos. Other than that this is a great product
5,Just received these and immediately put one on. The install process was quick and easy. The lens cover has a quality feel to it and the cut outs lined up well. Using it with a Miracase Liquid Silicone case and they fit perfectly together. The lens cover does attract and hold finger prints like crazy so you will have to check it/wipe it before taking a photo but otherwise I am very happy with my purchase!
1,Dropped the phone and this product shattered as did the camera lense on my phone so it offered no protection.  Don’t waste your money!
5,Nice product.  Easy to install.  Well worth it to protect your camera on phone.  It is very reasonably price.
5,It does really protect the camera!!
5,arrived quickly easy to install on my iPhone 12mini...very flat on back case...don't even notice it's there...reassuring in case of dropping...takes clear photos
5,First time using a protector for my phone. So far so good! Was easy to install and seems like it will do its job
4,Protects the iPhone 11 Camera perfectly. Highly recommend.
5,Nice glass piece that protects the iPhone lens from scratches. I would highly recommend it. The picture quality is good even with the lens cover.
4,Works good
5,I bought a cheap lens protector and regretted it. It made my phone look old and used since it scratches easy and gets dirty easy. This one is better at resisting scratches and smudges. I could tell that this would last a long time. Installation was a breeze they provide you with good instructions.
4,Great product just wish it came with front screen protector
5,Easy installation! It has saved my phone camera(s). I’ve dropped it many times since I bought it a year ago and it has cracked and broken on the edges but my camera is in tact safe and sound.
5,I like that it comes with a kit and flat surface so you don't have to use your greasy fingers to flatten it out. I think it's good for the price we'll see how it holds up.
5,This item was just as described. It fits great and protects just as good. I’m more then happy with my purchase.
4,Upon opening the package I noticed one of the protectors was smashed into little pieces.
5,so far i cant tell a difference in the camera taking ability of my phone with this on and i am so happy that i do not have to worry about anything scratching the cameras! i like having a slim phone case so this allows me to have that and have peace of mind! video for installing is great.
5,Good for my daughter iphone 11
5,I have learned the hard way that the new iPhone 11 (s) are easy to cracked lenses. Already had to replace one on my phone. This little guy is way cheaper to replace than a lens yes I would get one if you haven't.  Thanks for a great and cheap solution UniqueMe. You are more helpful than Apple has been.
4,Protect my camera on my phone from getting scratches.
2,Thought I was going to love these new camera protectors; however the first one I installed shattered after a few days. I don’t recall ever dropping my phone so I was surprised when I noticed multiple cracks throughout the cover. Will not buy again.
5,Did great had it for over a year until I dropped my phone on concrete and the edge chipped so ordered again survived many falls before it chipped
5,This product works great
3,I wanted to love this but every time i change my cell phone case the protector pops off. It seems durable it is crystal clear and doesn't seem to cause any variation to the pictures. It stays on well if you don't change your case. But I like to change my case.
5,Came very well packaged safe shipment. Excellent video to show how to install. Installation went very smoothly all necessary parts came with product. Fit my phone perfectly. camera screen remained clear no change in color or picture quality.Very pleased with this lends cover!
5,Love this product i just bought some for me and my daughter. I bought them because i was afraid to scratch my new iPhone 11 cameras so i bought them.  They are great! They fit perfectly and don't affect the camera quality at all.  They really saved me from some anxiety. Highly recommend great product!
5,probably the beat lens protector on the market. Easy to install. The hard plastic is very thick providing safety and durability. In the package you receive two protectors wet/dry little towel and info for installation. I just purchased another set for my kids phones
3,makes camera blurry!!
5,presence of glare at night
5,It's crystal clear and super easy to install! Just make sure you follow the instructions and ensure there's no dust or fingerprints on the lenses. The material is durable and I have confidence it will last a good long time.
5,I used it for my IPhone camera and it’s amazing
4,Easy to install and well made.
5,Works very well. Came with all of the stuff you need to prep your phone wet and dry cleaning cloth microfiber cloth and more. Easy to stick and fits perfect with my phone case on.
5,The product is a great quality. The glass is durable and very easy to apply. It comes with everything you need to apply easily and make sure every surface is clean during the process.
5,Only had this product for a few days but have been pleased with it.  Easy to install.  There is even a link provided for an instructional video.  Works well with my phone case.
3,I noticed that when I would take a selfie there was a dark background then I took off the lens protector and the problem was gone. I don’t know if it’s just mine or what because I lined the protector with the lens good. So I just took it off .
5,Fit is perfect and can be used with the tightest fitting cases! You won’t even know it there. Camera works just as it should with no distortion at all. Highly recommend because the iPhone 11 camera is raised more than past models and can be damaged. Great product and the give you two just in case!!
4,Was very easy to apply. Fits perfectly over the camera lens.
5,This product was really easy to install. Fits inside my phone case and doesn’t stick out!
4,Saved my camera recently and doesn't effect pictures
5,It’s really easy to install as well as it arrives very quickly / soon . The product clearly protects the camera lens and personally I believe it even improves the camera on the phone .
5,Easy to install
5,I was told about the camera protector from a friend and am so glad that I order it. It comes with a set of two camera lens proctors. Super easy to install and does not effort the quality of the pictures. Great product.
5,ok
5,It’s so easy to install and it is very good quality ! Will be again!
5,The shipping was very fast. I have nothing to complain about the camera lens protector that i bought for my iphone 11.
5,Can barely tell that this is on my camera! Just purchased the iPhone 11 and want to protect it as much as possible! Doesn’t affect camera quality at all and is durable.
5,Gives me confidence that my phone is protected and can actually take it and use  it.
5,Easy to install! I’ve had it on for a few months now and it’s been dropped plenty of times. Only one small nick on the lens protector which is better than one on the lens itself. Works with every case I’ve tried including Otterbox.
5,Wonderful! Fits with my case and covers my lenses. Easy to install and comes with everything needed. Now I don’t have to worry about my lenses. Also fills gap in case to help keep out dirt.
5,If you follow step by step the video tutorial you should have no problem putting on lens. Camera function is the same lens looks very clear.
5,This product worked so well!! It went right on and I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about my camera breaking. It’s very transparent and seems like it’s not even there. I will order again.
5,super easy to install
5,liked it very much----on my phone
2,The two protectors had already broke within the first month of me having them. And one of them had already came in broken. Definitely not worth the money there are better options out there.
5,It looks great. I wish I had bought protection for my camera before it one of them cracked when it fell on gravel. But better late than never. You can’t even notice there’s a little screen over the two cameras.
5,Super simple to apply and works great at protecting my camera that had started to break because I didn't have a protector on.
5,Good product and easy to installkeeps camera lens clean and does not diminish picture quality.Great value for the cost
5,Awesome!! Great price and fits and works great!! Totally case friendly. My wife and I love them!! Especially since I broke the camera lens a week after I got my new phone and didn’t have this protection on it. Phone fixed and NOW protected!!
5,Easy to install lens protector for my iPhone 11 crystal-clear photos with lens protector attached. Would recommend this product.
5,Stay on great  strong and durable
5,Broooo this thing is amazing ma camera is crystal clear i work in ruff areas under houses n crap n i was scared to break ma camera but so far so good its held up really would recommend if u value ur phone
5,I love it it fits great you can't even tell that it's on
3,The most wipes were dry. There was a tiny hair that was on one that we didn’t notice until we put it on. I would go with another brand next time.
5,This product fits as designed and fits with my case too. I like that it covers the lenses without degrading the picture quality.
4,Not bad
5,The cover fit perfectly. Easy to install and even came with a video link to install... not to mention free upgrade and free gift!
5,Did what it was designed to do and easy to install
4,Perfect fit should protect camera lenses very well we’ll see about the scratch resistance
5,The installation of this product was easiest that I have had in all my experiences.
5,I highly recommend this for your phones! Has saved my camera from a lot of damage from being dropped.
5,Very easy to install and it’s a very secure fit too. I got one for me and my mom. We both like it very much. We would buy it again if we ever get new phones.
1,Lasted only a few days just in my purse
5,Easy to fit
5,I purchased this to help protect the lenses on my iPhone 11. Not only was it easy to install it fit perfectly. The high quality glass did not degrade the camera lens image at all plus it allowed for glare-free flash photography.
5,Relatively easy to install. I can't speak to the durability but I'll feel better about my phone having this on it.
5,This was a very easy install with no hidden trick.  The result is awesome and I know that my phone is well protected.Highly recommend this product
5,I like that this product was very easy to install and fits perfectly.
5,Amazing product and super easy to put on.  It will save me long term since it won't allow my camera lens to get scratched.  I bought 2 packs and will by more if needed for other family members.
1,in less than a week these fell off my and my kids phones.  not good quality
5,Great product.
5,Fine
5,This camera protector was exactly what I was looking for my case on my iPhone 11 kind of leaned forward so I was worried about the camera lenses getting scratched. This solved the problem!
1,The first one broke.  Replaced with medal one. Much happier.
5,It was easy to install the lens protector and fits great. I feel a lot better about having the lens of the iPhone 11 protected.
5,This was a perfect fit.Easy to install.
5,This is a great product. I’m glad it came with 2 in the pack. Me and my husband both get one.
5,I ordered one for iPad and iPhone and both work nicely. It’s easy to install and comes nicely packaged
5,Works great and easy to install.
5,Easy to install hard but soft material on camera lens. I totally recommend if you have an iPhone 11.
5,Product was exactly as expected. Easy to install. Fit perfectly under phone case. Did not have any trouble at all installing. Pictures are still perfectly clear!
5,Seems to do the job well! Was very easy to install. Might affect the flash a small amount but haven’t tested it a ton yet. Photo quality is not affected at all.
5,Great product so farProtects the phone well
5,will purchase agiain for my next phone.
5,Covers the cameras on my iPhone 11 perfectly and protects them without diminishing the quality the pictures. I’m super happy with my purchase.
5,Like
5,Great
4,Like product
5,This is best for camera lens
5,The camera proctector was so easy to install that a child could do it. And it completely covers the lens so there’s no risk of them getting damaged
1,I had this on my phone for one whole day and it cracked.  All I did was out the phone down on the counter while making dinner and it shattered.  Buy another brand please.
5,Very well designed ! Didn’t ruin the photo quality and now I feel safer knowing it has a protection
5,Fit good with phone case over it. Does the job to protect camera lenses and open area that is unprotected by phone case.
1,It was fairly easy to install and it worked great at first. After a while when I turned on flash for picture a blur from the flash was noticeable on  my pictures. It did its job and protected my lens when my phone fell on concrete but it cracked. So when I tried to replace it the thing was almost impossible to get off! It would chip tiny pieces of glass off and it left sticky adhesion residue that I can’t get off. Very disappointed with that fact. I wouldn’t recommend.
5,Great item as described! A++
5,Very easy to install love that it came with a video for installation reference! Also a great value because it comes with 2 lens protectors!!
4,Works
5,Fits my I phone perfect
5,The install video is simple to follow making application of lens cover unquestionably easy to complete. Durable attached securely without interfering with phone case.
1,I was pretty surprised that both lens protectors fell off within a few days after installing. Applied correctly didn’t drop the phone or get it wet and they just fell off. Definitely a waste of money.
5,It came off after 2 weeksAnd it disturbed the quality of the picture
2,I love how perfect it fits how easy it was to install however the is not very durable. I’ve gone through both protective covers in a month. After one drop it cracks….
5,Very easy to apply and fits perfectly! Now my camera is protected if it falls!
5,It was easy to put on and does not diminish quality of the pictures
5,It does what I want it to do.  Down side is there can sometimes be glare in the photos
5,Easy to install and has perfect protection and does not mess your pictures up!
1,Advertised as lens protector for iPhone but in reality it is an iwatch screen protector…
5,It was a perfect fit and great quality. The video instructions were clear and concise. I would definitely buy this product again.
5,Great product. Easy to install and did it’s job well
5,Love this product. Superrrrr easy to put on and serves its purpose !
1,Warning:  When connecting the cover to my my camera it  instantly stuck which I guess the adhesive is strong but it wasn’t aligned correctly so when I tried peeling it off to realign my protector it shattered the protector!!! It was a good thing I wear glasses or else the plastic could have landed in my eye.Due to that incident I have a feeling it won’t protect your camera and will break easily. AVOID buying this product. !!!!!Protect your iPhone with a different protect!
5,I’ve tried multiple other brands and returned it. This is very easy to install and stays in place. Highly recommend it!
5,easy to put on. looks goods cant even tell its on there
5,Easy install of the UniqueMe Camera  Screen Protector!
5,This product seems to stick well to the phone camera and I have had no problems with it yet.
5,Easy to install no smudges fits right over the camera screen and doesn’t ruin the quality of pictures.
3,Just put on the lens protector. So we will wait and see if they work.
5,Easy to install does not interfere with the quality of photos and I know my camera lenses are safe!
5,Great product and easy to install. Very fast shipping. Highly recommend to everyone I know.
5,Really protective! Can barley tell it’s on the camera!
5,Great packaging. Easy to apply and did not affect photos
5,It fits well and super easy to put on phone
5,This worked great! Keeps my phone safe
5,I liked that it aligns with the phone case and is really easy to install

5,So far so good
5,Excelente producto le quedo perfecto a mi IPhone 11
5,Easy to install
5,Looks awesome! I feel better about the extra protection.
5,I am surprised by how well it stayed !Would recommend !
5,Definitely recommend this product
5,I like it and fits my phone perfect
1,These were easy enough to install but they broke almost immediately and despite escalating with Amazon twice and being told from the company a replacement was coming (in6-8 weeks..!) it’s been 5-6 months now and still no replacement. Wish I would have just bought a different brand to begin with.
5,Everything is good with this item
5,Good!
5,Works great!
5,Easy to install and fits perfectly.
5,It was exactly what I was looking for
5,Absolutely must buy for your phone!!!
5,Receive within a few days. It was easy to install and works great.

5,Great camera protection!
5,My order came fast and was easy to install

5,it fits great and looks good
5,Hands-down the easiest screen protector I’ve ever had to install on my phone
5,Great
5,Great quality easy to install! I do recommend this product
5,I very happy with product.Thanks
5,Great coverage. I feel much better about putting my phone in my handbag.
2,It fits perfectly and covers your actual camera lens but they break so fast ! They will literally crack over the smallest fall. They only provide 2 weak poor quality lens that breaks fast and charging you $12 plus tax for only 2 lens..... Order elsewhere and save your money !
5,Works great for protecting my camera! Easy to install and fits perfect!
5,Terrific product based upon initial use. Hoping it continues to stay durable
5,Great resource for all you mobile phone needs. You can buy with confidence.
5,Easy to install. Very happy
5,Love it!  Fits great on the phone and under my case.
5,It’s worth every penny and could save you 1000 bucks
3,Es muy buen producto pero daña las fotos con flash
5,It is very easy to install and does not affect photos
5,Easy to install and fits perfectly. Price ain't bad either.~Andre
3,Easy to install affects camera quality and led flash
5,Fits great and barely notice that it’s even on there
1,Not really durable they cracked when my son dropped his phone once but was easy to install not sure if I would buy again
5,It is really worth the money spent
5,I’d buy again
5,Easy to install
5,Haven’t had any issues with it at all
1,Does not work with flash at all i tried restructuring it many times and no fix.
5,Great product
5,Installing the cover is easy and the protection is great.
5,Easy to put on and doesn’t distort the camera.
5,Excellent Product and I received fast just before of the expected day.
5,Works amazing
5,Great quality with great price will recommend this product to other buyers
5,Very easy to install and works as described
5,Works great very good to have protect the lenses
1,This is a terrible product.  I put these on both my 2 iPhones.  Within 2 days both cracked.  Not worth the money.  Just by normal use having my iPhone laying on my desk.  I could not believe how fast these cracked.  It is better not having it.  Not worth the money and terrible quality.  Not durable.  Save your money.
5,This leaves no smudges on the camera its perfect.
5,Great product. Protected camera wonderfully. Very easy to install.
5,Lens fits perfectly for the iPhone 11. No complaints.
1,Only received 1 out of the 2 camera lens protectors.Looks like an okay product but I was lied to.
5,Very useful and great design
5,quality protector for the price
5,Exactly as described wonderful product easy to install!
5,Great product
5,Great product!
5,Cheap and easy to install.
5,Perfect for me
5,to protect my iPhone camera
5,Very nice Product Installation is smooth as a breeze.
5,Great item. Good job.
2,You cannot take pictures with flash with this cover. There is a haze every time. I returned and bought a Loopy cover which has no flash issues.
5,Broke on the first drop.
5,Nice Product easy to install
5,Worth the price
5,Perfect fit looks good! Very easy to install.
5,Very nice product
5,Works great
5,Awesome product would buy again
1,Did not fit at all
1,Makes photos or videos with flash on hazy on bottom corner I tried to clean it again and redo it still was the same also one of the protectors came damaged wouldn’t get these cheap and not good if you use camera with flash or night time photos
5,Awesome just what I needed
1,got them in them in And try to install them on my phone they were so difficult to put on that I gave up and ended up returning them because they would not stick on and fit to what I thought they were designed for
5,Its durability
5,Amazing
1,Item not as described
5,Great idea
2,It was easy to install however when I took pictures I would have a red (color of phone) glare going over my pictures so I removed the camera protector
5,Easy & fast install
1,Le quedo muy pequeño y muy poca pega
5,Very easy to install
2,Back when I used to have my red iPhone 11 I ordered this junk. It never wanted to stay in place. Kept moving. Heavy dust collector too. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
5,Comfortable and convenience.
5,It fits perfectly!
1,Damage easily and stick to your phone and take tremendous effort to get glue off
2,Looked great and does the job until you put it in your pocket. Broke both in three days from just having my phone in my pocket. Can’t expect much though with how cheap they are
5,Great product!
1,The lens is very hard to remove once you want to take it off. The adhesive is too strong and will leave a ton of adhesive residue when you finally take it off.
2,Product was pretty easy to install but just as easy to break. Put phone in side pocket and took it back out and found it broke already
1,One of the protectors was already broken when we opened the package… we’ll see how long the other one takes to break too
2,This make my camera have white on either side of picture l. This was installed properly and I tried both protectors
1,The case protector is easy to install. After installation I put my phone case back on. After a few days I took the phone case off and the camera protector came off with it. Based off of this experience I think it is best to use this camera protector without a case. I’m disappointed that this camera protector cannot be used with a case.
1,Se rompió al despegarlo y el acabó es feo
1,The protection has the wrong dimensions doesn’t fit well and doesn’t match and described. Very weak adhesion as well.
1,You cannot take pictures with flash because it casts a halo in the picture. Definitely not worth the purchase. I had to buy a different protector that only goes over the cameras and that works much better. Don’t get this product.
1,Not sure how this is supposed to provide protection. If you touch it with your finger on accident it cracks. Went through 2 packs.
2,I love the idea of these but it causes light flairs when taking pictures in the dark.
1,I received a broken screen protector and to top it off each time I used flash at night the screen protector would cast a shadow ruining my picture.
1,I'm in may 40's and have installed enough screen protectors to know how to read directions and do it properly. Purchased and installed these on my families new phones. Two weeks later we realized that two had fallen off the phones and were missing. Other two seem to working for now.
1,Followed all steps perfectly...This product does not adhere very well on my i phone 11
1,It’s a two pack 1 came broken they are very delicate but one came broken
1,The reason I am giving this product 1 star is because the lens scratched in less than a week. I have had other cover for previous phone that did not scratch. This one is not worth it. It holds finger prints and smudges horribly. Waste of my money and I bought 2 2packs
1,It’s listed for the 11 but has the 3 camera layout so it bid not work for the 11.
1,Poor design.  Broke 2 in 2 days.  They do not lay flat on the screen completely.  Easy to catch on clothing and the like.  Once caught on something can easily break the corner or complete screen protector.Dont waste your money.
1,I can’t use a flash with this on the lens. The photos were hazy.
1,No good
1,I was hopeful. But will not stay on the phone.
1,This is supposed to have a lifetime warranty. Mine and my husband’s both broke within a few weeks of use. I tried emailing the company to receive a replacement over a month ago and never heard back.
1,Put the extra dollars and buy a better one. Not worth it cheap and not durable at all.
1,Not a good product.. Picture in dark got reflection .
1,This camera “protector” crack right on the lens I was worried it damaged the lens but luckily it did not. Buy the ones that are for each individual each lens.
2,All of the shattered
2,Cracked within two days of having it.
1,Constantly falls off
1,Lasted a week for me. A week and a half for my daughters phone. Would not purchase again.
1,These include the black flash circle which makes picture quality foggy and blurry.
1,Did not fit my phone watched numerous videos on how to install did not fit.
1,Broke within an hour of putting it on
1,Creates a weird glare on my camera. Wish I could return.
1,The lenses both came scratched!  0 stars
5,Relatively easy to adhere.  As regards to durability it’s too early to tell but 4 stars because it feels like it should be durable.  It doesn’t feel cheaply made. For the money one pays for an iPad it would be nice if the protective paraphernalia were included. It’s not. If you want the extra protection you’re on your own. The UniqueMe camera lens protector seems to be a good choice.  Plus you get two of them-even better!
5,Great easy to install resistant recommend!
5,Love it works great much more cheaper than buying from the phone store. It was easy to install on and the adhesive is very strong.
3,Just received the camera lens protectors. I went to their website and watched the installation video. I followed the instruction and the installation was easy. When I looked closer I noticed a blemish on one of the upper lens. It looked like a smug and I tried to wipe it clean but it was on the underside. I removed the protector and noticed it was a defect in the glass protector. lucky it came with a spare. I replaced it with the spare and it seems to be ok. Keep this in mind if you purchase this item. "One out of Two."
1,This scratches way too easily.
5,Surprised with the quality of the product. Came with all the necessary tools. Easy to install. I have more confident on my phone with this protection.
5,Very sturdy and awesome quality. It was as far as the easiest protector to apply to my phone.10 out of 10 RECOMMENDED!
5,Used this product to help protect our new phone cameras. Very easy to apply and durable!
5,Great product. Protects the camera lens
5,Fits perfect!
5,Very happy with this product.
5,Pretty great protect.
5,Pretty nice
2,I’ve had this screen protector on my camera for a while and it cracked making a glare when I use flash. Since two come in the pack I thought I would just switch them out but this screen protector is actually extremely hard to take off. 15 min later and my screen protector has cracked in many different places and I only managed to get half of it off 😤
1,The UniqueMe screen protector was super easy to put on like they say follow the instructions from the video mad easy. But please don’t waste your money the pictures truly came out blurry I took it off the same day At times y’all should listen to bad reviews because they be so true and you truly have wasted your money The first picture is with it on the second picture is without it
1,Garbage. Sure it’ll likely protect your camera if you drop your phone but it makes pictures you take be garbage. Not worth it. If you take a picture with flash the picture will be blurred because the flash reflects on the glass protector
5,Very good product I would definitely recommend this to family and friends and it was worth the money
5,I like this productIt’s durable
5,Recommend this product
5,👍
5,It was so easy to install and so far I like the sheerness. I will buy it again for my husbands phone.
5,Really easy to use and pretty durable I recommend this product
5,I recommend this product. People tend to protect the front screen but not the cameras in the back. I’ve purchased this product now twice. First time was a little over a year ago and has lasted the whole time until I just changed it for a new one. Easy to install. Super durable. I will continue to buy this product.
2,it cracks very easily you could get an better screen protector from 5 below!!
2,Super minor when I noticed the wet wipes was straight dry. But once I fit it on one of the holes weren’t perfectly centered and there was no way to make it work. Ok It’ll just have to do for now. But then I noticed the flash on pictures were terrible. So getting a refund now.
1,the protector blurs your camera doesn’t work for flash and is extremely difficult to take off. not worth it.
1,They are garbage. Mind broke within the first week
5,Super easy to install. Protects my iPhone camera perfectly.  2 pack is great since I did break one after 4 months of use.
5,Very easy install & I bought this for my sister. Because  she love to take pictures. Don’t want any damage on the camera lens so it perfect . Thank you!!!
5,It’s very easy 2 put on. Works w/ both of my iPhone cases!! Video was very helpful!!
5,I actually ordered from different places before and they’ve always felt bulky or had that thick black line around it and this one I just love I’m going to order more in the future for my mom and my husband😊
5,Great product
5,There exactly what I needed an fit perfectly
5,Perfect fit.
5,great protection and super easy to install
4,They are nice and work well.
5,Good protection for lenses!
5,I use the product to keep my lenses from getting scratched up . I’m in the construction business so it’s important to have the right tool for the job. And this is the right tool for my job.
5,Very pleased with the product.
5,i like very much this camera screen protector my son drop my phone but nothing happened i Tell all my friends to get the same protector for there phone.thank u
5,I’m not sure how it happened but somehow I must’ve dropped my phone and there was a crack going across the lens or so I thought… when I removed the cover it was only the cover that was cracked and my lens was perfect and intact. I bought another set right away. I’m thankful that I had this as it saved the lens on my phone from having cracks. I take pictures all the time with my phone and it’s a new phone so I’m thankful that it worked
5,Loved it easy to install
5,Everything was great! With this item 😊
5,Easy install. Adhesion good. I see these as disposable as they will take the first impact or when you lay it down. Don’t expect them to last as long as you’re case. Don’t have any issues with photos or video. Prefer to protect my camera lens. Good value
5,Awesome great packaging and material !
5,easy to apply seems like it is good quality. not bad for the price
5,This is a must.  People think to protect their screen but when a little hairline crack appeared in my camera lens and then slowly got bigger off to the Apple store I went to get it repaired.  And you have to back up your phone and reinstall everything.  This is definitely worth the insignificant price
1,It shattered while I was peeling off the plastic. Even worse… a small sliver cut my finger drawing blood. I had to use a pair of tweezers to pull out a piece that lodged in my finger. See the photo.
5,It works good
5,Easy to install /great adhesion / tempered glass protection for iPhone camera lenses
5,It has a black outline and it makes it look way better
4,These glass protectors for the camera lens on the iPhone 11 are pretty good for their price.I would give them four stars but my image quality was affected in the slightest way but I’m actually a photography snob so I might just be noticing the slight image quality reduction.But there is also the possibility I didn’t clean the lens well enough before installation or smudged the protectors adhesive side before placing it on the device.They actually totally protected my camera lens from a pretty brutal drop so I’m happy with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 2nd protector is a huge plus!
5,So far don't have any scratches nor has the protective screen cracked has been protecting my camera lenses well. This is coming from a clumsy person who drops their phone at least 3 times a day. Worth the money.
5,It excellent products
5,Easy to install with good online video.
5,
5,The camera protector fits perfectly.
5,This camera lens protector works great. Don’t have too worry about my camera lens getting scratched since the protector is pretty thick. Thank you.
5,Easy to install
5,These are a life saver for me because my camera is the first to break always. They're simple to install and durable.
5,It was easy to put on and to date after a couple drops screen still intact.
5,I love having this camera protector…why these don’t come with other phone protection packages is beyond me!I actually purchased this because my camera was cracked and I decided not to fix it for a while so I needed to cover up the cracked glass. The protector fits great with my otter box case. I don’t even notice that it is there over my camera. The application was very easy and it has held up for almost a year now.
5,great deal easy to install. saved my phone camera
5,💯👍
5,The item arrived very quick. Easy to install and is very durable. Thank you.
5,I was skeptical but it was great. Fits perfectly and was surprisingly easy to install
5,Very easy installation. I’m what I like you can scan the QR code and it sends you directly to the YouTube to watch how to install it. The only downside is that it is very delicate so make sure you align it correctly. Mine has a small crack which I would replace since it came with two lenses.
5,Works great
5,Perfect  easy and durable
5,Buy it plus - there are two. Highly Recommend.
5,Perfect fit and materials
5,Perfect fit
5,It easy to install the only thing that I see that’s different is that that the camera is a little darker but still take nice pictures
5,Protector covers both lenses of the iPhone 11 plus the entire camera square. Quality is good and seems like it will last quite a while. Packaging is good though it took a minute to figure out that entire camera square just peels off of the large plastic backing.The edges of the protector are smooth and don’t catch on my pocket when putting it away or taking it out. The flash has a black ring around it and both the flash and depth sensor have holes down to the phone.Highly recommended. I would purchase again.
5,The product is really good. I just loved it. Would recommend to my friends as well.
5,Fast delivery!Excellent product as described.Easy to install and have the great guiding for customer.Good service.I’m really happy with that. I ordered 4 of that for my whole family.
5,Very fast delivery. The product came two days before the expected date of delivery.Very good product and easy to install.
4,Service Amazon très satisfaisant livraison sous 2 jours
5,Protector was easy to install and fit great. Also fast shipping. Will be buying again.
5,As shown
5,Highly recommended!! It fits perfectly and no noise at all!
5,Protège parfaitement la caméra !
5,The lens screen already feels less fragile with this on. I always felt like the glass was going to shatter every time I set the phone down.While the application is very straightforward I found I still got bubbles. However since this is just for the camera lens and the bubble was not on the lenses itself I’m fine with it. This is a must-buy for iPhone 11/Pro/Max.
1,The product itself feels of good quality - installation was easy. Unfortunately i gave it a 1 star due to grey/fuzzy images when using the flash while taking a picture or video. The advertising insinuates that with this type of protector you will not have blurry/grey images produced by ny taking pictures/videos. Feel let down as that is the reason why I decided  to go with this product only to find that what was advertised was not true.
5,This product is excellent for peace of mind protecting your iPhone camera. I work in an industry where my phone goes through a lot. Durability is a must for me. This is easy to apply the camera is completely functional and it protects my phone camera from scratches and fingerprints.
1,The flash is ruined basically can’t take pictures with the flash on. And the glass is prone to fingerprints and you end up having to clear it off every time. If your going to spend the money on the phone for an extra camera don’t buy this to make the camera look like an iPhone 5 took it
5,Awesome video to follow.  Makes it super easy and clean.  Gives me a piece of mind when I have my phone out and am taking photos. I think its great that it comes with a squeegee of some sort to help you press it into place. No issues!
4,Super easy to put on but unfortunately the first one fell off within 3 days but the second one has lasted a few weeks now.  Worth buying if you really beat up your phone...or have children! Haha
5,definitely saved my lens dropped phone and it landed on a rock the right was and broke the cover lens was without any scratches.  It also didn’t crumble just spider webbed -
2,This does protect Camera but it changes quality of picture and can not tale flash photos. And leaves the sticky residue on Camera lenses. Great idea though.
5,These came quickly and were as described however I did take it off my phone because whenever you need flash it makes the picture red because it’s reflecting off my phone.
5,Very impressed with the product and the quality!!Easy to install protects the cameras and does not distortion the pictures!!100% Recommended
5,Wasn’t sure how this would work after install with my phone case. It fits perfectly and was so easy to put on after watching the online video. The glass is clear so doesn’t affect the picture quality of the camera.
2,The package arrived on time with no damage. Easy to install. But the photos taken with Flash are fuzzy and grey. It seems a problem with the flash reflection or sth.  I am not sure!I wish  I could return it :/
5,Not only was this lens protector easy to install but you can't beat the price for a 2-pack.  I am extremely satisfied with this product and would purchase it again.
4,I just received my screen protector for my iPhone 11 camera lenses and couldn't wait to put it on. I was a bit nervous but UniqueMe had a short and easy to follow tutorial on their website. Took me less than 10 minutes to apply it! Hopefully it protects my camera lenses!
3,Protects my phone but when I use flash it really messes up the picture. But what can I say it protects my expensive phone so I can’t really complain. (:
1,I expected the same adhesion as a screen saver. Not even close. I don’t think it will do much of anything.
4,Would recommend but a bubble spot thatbi can’t remove but other than that its perfect edges are smooth
5,Since dust could collect around the camera lenses this product solves the problem by making the lens area just one flat surface. Also it adds good protection in the one area that is most prone to damage and is exposed from your case. Very easy to install. Highly recommended.
5,Donne une bonne protection  utilisé avec le caisse de protection
3,The product itself is okay I can’t use the flash on my phone because it turns the pictures white but the application process is easy and so far it’s staying on and protecting my camera lenses.
4,Quick delivery. Problem free installation. Daylight photos are fine but any shots taken with a flash suffer from washout of stray light.These shots look like old polaroids
5,I loved the easy installation and I love their little kit to keep your phone clean neat and tidy. This is a very beneficial product and for such a low price there’s no excuse for you not to buy it for your iPhone.
5,Delivered fast everything is included in the package to clean the lenses before installing the protector. The instructions made it clear and easy to install and I’m overall happy with the product.
1,Came scratched and dirty doesn’t work with flash and overall very bad quality.
5,I have ordered this product for my new i phone11 and i very happy of my purchase! Easy to install good fit even with my iPhone case doesnt change the picture quality and seem to be durable.
5,Protects my iPhone camera lens
4,It's a great product.It came with good package.Only little bit  did not stick well but it fits my iPhone lenses.
5,Easy to install. No issues so far.
5,I am glad that I ordered this. It came faster than it said when I ordered it. Now my phone is completely protected. Definitely recommend
5,It is excellent item I liked it thank you
5,I love this product provides great protection for my camera.Definitely recommended this to my friends! It truly protects your camera lens!
1,Protective lens came with hair and dust stuck inside it not sealed properly and not able to remove. Sticky side too so when i tried to clean it just made it worse.
1,Listed as a 2pack came with only one! The top of the box was already open. Not happy at all paid for 2 got only a 1 pack
5,Awesome product! Was very easy to install and has been very durable while on my phone and it didn’t mess with the quality of my camera one bit! Very happy with this product!
5,Great to keep camera safe super clear glad so can’t even tell you have a protective cover on
4,Great
1,Comes off easily if you use a case
5,It fit perfectly with my case really easy to install and the material it looks really good. I really recommend this product!
5,Easy to install and fits well with my case phone

5,So easy to install.  Would recommend to everyone!
5,Fantastic protection for the rear camera on my iPhone 11. Easily applied and doesn’t distort the camera function.
5,Nice product.
5,Ordered it and got it the next day.Installed it with a case and fit perfectly on 2 iPhones very easily.
5,Very clear instructions and easy to use. Camera still looks very clear too. Delivery is faster than expected!
5,Easy to install protects the whole camera. It fits with my case. I would recommend this product.

4,Excellent
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden!!! Die Kamera ist davon absolut nicht beeinträchtigt! Tolles Produkt und schnelle Lieferung!! Sehr empfehlenswert!!
1,I was super excited to get this for my new phone to protect the cameras. I put it on Saturday night and it came off Sunday afternoon... I had it on for less than 24 hours before it popped off while I was holding my phone but not touching anywhere near the camera area. Then when I tried to stick it back on the little black circle around the flash came off. Very disappointed with this product. Great concept but I don’t recommend buying it.
5,Love this addition to my I phone gives a lovely subtle Bling to it without being tacky !!!
5,einfache Montage Reinigungsmaterial sinnvolle Ergänzung zum großen Cover
5,Hat bereits einmal meine Kamera vor Zerstörung geschützt. Abdeckung ist zwar beim Aufprall gebrochen jedoch blieb Kameralinse unversehrt.
5,Purtroppo sono sempre di corsa e un po’ maldestra di conseguenza le cadute del mio Iphone sono all’ordine del giorno….non potrei fare a meno di questo prodotto;
3,L'installation se fait rapidement mais la qualité et plus que moyenne je n'en remettrais plus sur mon iPhone pas de très grande utilité au final je n'en mais plus et je n'ai aucun problème.
5,Gutes Produkt leichte Montage
5,Easy installation easy cleaning with the extras given. No difference to the uncovered camera. Flash works perfectly. Cute lil surprise inside. All in all 10/10.
5,Bildqualität ist gleichbleibend. Ich bin total begeistert. Hab mir schon das zweite mal bestellt damit immer was da ist.Leider fällt mir das Handy oft runter aber so geschützt kann nix passieren. Vielen dank für das gute Produkt.
1,I hate giving bad reviews.  I am also definitely willing to change it if seller can make it right.  Install is easy product arrived undamaged and timely was exactly what i was looking for.  Then I took a picture with the flash on my phone and the resulting picture was this weird greyed out fuzzy highly exposed photo.  I also know that it was infact this camera protector because i removed it took the same picture and the photo turned out fine. Not something you want when you are using an Iphone 11 that has two cameras.  This device was built with a focus on the camera.  I can't endorse a product like this.
5,Dieser Linsenschutz ist sehr gut leichtes Anbringen hält gut und schützt sehr gut
5,Was easy to fit and as this was a replacement because I had dropped my phone and smashed the first one. It had done a great job at protecting my camera as underneath the cover it was fine.
4,Happy with purchase👍🏻
4,Bin sehr zufrieden ist schon mehrfach runtergefahren und trotzdem ist alles ganz obwohl ja iPhone sehr anfällig ist
5,Leicht abzubringen Bild weiter gut leicht zu reinigen wenn Schlieren drauf sind.
4,Ich habe mein iPhone 11 gerade mal einen Monat und habe heute Morgen das vierte dieser Schutzgläser angebracht weil die ersten drei ungelogen bei jedem Sturz zerbrochen sind - und das im Innenraum auf Textilteppich aus einem Meter Höhe trotz zusätzlicher Silikonhülle um das ganze iPhone. Es ist als würde mein neues iPhone immer ganz gezielt auf die Kamera fliegen und das ist für mich - als seit 11 Jahren äußerst sturzerfahende iPhone-Nutzerin - sehr ungewöhnlich. Wie auch immer - das Schutzglas macht einen wertigen Eindruck lässt sich sehr einfach aufbringen und beeinträchtigt meine Kamera überhaupt nicht. Es wäre nur schön wenn es wenigstens ein paar Monate länger halten würde.
5,Bon produit facile à installer
5,It stayed on for a whole year at least! Crazy sticky it was impossible to take off but it worked marvellously!
5,Happy with themEasy to assemble / add onComes with dust material cloth to clean themCan get a case on tooNo damage
2,Once I opened the package I noticed there's an obvious scratch with one of the camera lenses. This is likely a quality control issue.
5,Very easy to install.Holds up to the promises on box can see perfectly out of camera.
5,Super Qualität 👍
5,Very happy. I smashed a previous iPhone camera lens with some help from my toddler. I’m happy to know I have added insurance that won’t happen again. It it perfectly sized for the cut out in the case too. Very happy
5,Ottimo materiale aderito subito buon acquisto
5,Very happy with this product to protect my iPhone 11
1,Did not fit
5,Perfect! Fits on your phone even with a case!
5,Très facile à poser. Aucune trace sur les lentilles. Impeccable!
2,This product came cracked upon opening the package which was super disappointing. I was still able to use one since it came in a pack of two but unable to return it as I had already put the first one on before realizing the second one was damaged.
3,Leider halten die nicht lange zerbrechen schnell.Nach ca. 2 Monaten sind die beiden Schutzhüllen zerbrochen obwohl ich meines Erachtens sehr sorgsam mit meinem Handy umgehe
4,It’s great
5,デリケートな部分を保護出来るのでよかったです。
5,facile dinstalation
5,Ottimo per protezione obbiettivo fotocamera
5,Très bon produit qui protège évidemment votre caméra du téléphone et qui remplit très bien son rôle !-Vous avez 2 verres trempés dans la boîte ce qui est bien si vous cassez le premier pour le changer.-Un verre assez épais qui se fend dans la coque une fois mise mais qui peut prêter à confusion si on veut le retirer par peur de casser l’appareil photo mais non il s’agit bien de l’épaisseur du verre qui dépasse donc on peut y aller franchement.-Un Verre assez solide mais qui peut tout de même se briser légèrement en cas de mauvais coup ou autres donc c’est cool d’en avoir deux dans la boîte.
5,I am so impressed that this was delivered within a day! Thank you. This js exactly what I wanted.
5,Dies ist eine sehr gute Qualität.  Mein Telefon fiel auf den Marmorboden und ging nicht kaputt.
5,Die Fahrer sind zu b....das sie es richtig liefern egal was...Sie lesen einfach nicht.Immer liegt es irgendwo das ist eine Katastrophe.Ich bestell nix mehr das nervt nur mehr.Die Post fahrt nicht.  Immer diese komischen Amazon Fahrer die net LESEN !!!!!! Es reicht
4,Die Lieferung war wir immer pünktlich und nett.Es sind zwei Schutzhüllen für die Kamera drinnen gewesen mit allem was man sonst noch braucht. Das aufkleben auch für weniger geduldige Menschen wie mir kein Problem.
3,An sich gut aber die gehen zu schnell kaputt und es ist eine funmel arbeit die wieder abzulriegen wenn die einmal gesplittert sind
5,I got this for my wife’s phone. They stick on easily and stay there. Probably more importantly the wife likes doesn’t even notice it.
5,Facile da mettere resistente
4,Wirklich gut
4,Leider doch nicht so frei von Blasen wie in der Beschreibung beschrieben. Zwischen den beiden Kameras ist eine Blase die man nicht wegkriegt. Der Preis ist ebenfalls zu hoch wenn man überlegt dass es Cent-Artikeln sind!
4,Facile da installare ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
4,Esta muy bien y se coloca también bien y las fotos salen bien
4,Encaja a la perfección con el iphone 11 he probado varios y todos tienen el mismo fallo cuando realizas fotos con flash se ven borrosas.El protector viene con una gomita negra en el agujero del flash es aposta no se tiene que quitar si lo quitas las fotos con flash se ven peor.Lo recomiendo para proteger la cámara en un dispositivo tan caro pero recomiendo limpiar un poco el protector al realizar las fotos  para no perder calidad al fin y al cabo estamos poniendo un cristal en la cámara y es como el cristal de la pantalla se ensucia mas fácilmente.
1,Bad quality
5,Die Warner war sehr schnell da und das Glaskontor Komplikation super sofort aufgetragen werden beeinträchtigt nur die Kamerafunktion und Kamera super geschützt
3,Personalmente avrei preferito non ci fosse il bordino nero intorno al flash ma immagino che abbia uno scoop anti-riflesso  per il resto è totalmente trasparente senza ulteriori disegni o bordi  cosa che apprezzo moltissimo. Peccato solo che sia lucido e invece il pezzo originale dell iPhone intorno alle telecamere è satinato ed è un bellissimo effetto elegante a cui tocca rinunciare per la sicurezza delle lenti … se facessero anche questo vetro o von effetto satinato sarebbe il top !
5,Fiyatına deger
5,Preis/Leistung stimmt. Würde ich wieder bestellen👍🏻
3,Avrò ricomprato questa pellicola almeno 4 volte nel giro di 4/5 mesi.Ogni volta un problema dalle bolle d’aria che si creano e fanno staccare la pellicola al fatto che quando faccio la foto con il flash da un po’ fastidio la luce. Nel complesso non sono un prodotto scadente ma non penso di ricomprarle più.
5,貼り付けも楽で、ガラスの厚みもあるので割れるのも心配ないかなと言う感じでした！しばらく様子を見てみようと思います！
5,Alles einwandfrei und zufriedenstellend geliefert
2,黒い円が、くっきりと。可愛い黄色のiPhone11が台無しです。貼る時のガイドかと思って、一生懸命剥がそうとしてしまったけど、取れないんですね…
2,Quando il grandangolo è a 05x si vede il bordo circolare nero della protezione dell’obiettivo. Già a 06x è perfetto ma al massimo del grandangolo ha questo problema su iPhone 12 mini.
5,mi aspettavo una semplice pellicola invece è come se fosse un doppio vetro. Soddisfatto.
4,Easy to install and provided a good protection too. Unless you have a bulky case the cover will protrude quite a bit
5,Das Sicherheitsglas ist leicht anzubringen und Bildqualität ist auch sehr gut.
5,👍🏻
5,Easy to fit good value
3,It fits onto the camera perfectly and is indeed case friendly the only downside is that because the protector covers the camera it changes your picture quality. It’s not a drastic change but it’s a noticeable change. But in terms of protection it’s perfect.
5,Halten wie eine ☝️
3,Sooooo easy to install it’s crazy I even took mine off twice after the first application and it stuck right back on! My only minor concern is that the glass may actually direct the pressure of falls into the camera because I use a case with a raised lip around the camera to protect it but with this attached it is level with the case so I’m not sure if when I drop my phone this could do more damage than good; that said I will continue to use it because I want to avoid scratches on the lenses (e.g if I place the phone down on rough ground)
1,The are large black circles around the edge which it does not show on the pictures or say so in the description. The other photos on reviews do not show this either so seems like they are selling two different products under the same listing. Disappointed as my phone is green it stands out very obvious and looks pretty silly. The last set from another site I got were like this and I ordered these because it didn’t have the lines around the edge only to find out they do when they arrived.
4,Fanno il l’iro dovere
5,Ich nutze die Folie beim iPhone 11.Aufbringen funktioniert einwandfrei und ohne Probleme oder Luftblasen.Die Bilder haben keinen Qualitätsverlust lediglich einen dezenten Solarflare erkenne ich bei Bilder gegen die pralle Sonne. Allerdings ist der auch ohne da nur in einer anderen Farbe.Nach einem halben Jahr löst sich der Kleber noch nicht also absolut gute Qualität.
1,I hate giving bad reviews. I am also definitely willing to change it if seller can make it right however I don’t know what they’ll do. Installation  is easy product arrived undamaged and timely was exactly what i was looking for. Then I took a picture with the flash on my phone and the resulting picture was this weird greyed out fuzzy highly exposed photo almost as if it was in a room filled by a fog machine. I also know that it was infact this camera protector because i removed it took the same picture and the photo turned out fine. Not something you want when you are using an Iphone 11 that has two cameras. This device was built with a focus on the camera. I can't endorse a product like this.
4,No estaba muy convencido de comprar este producto ya que había visto comentarios buenos y malos. Ahora que ya lo he instalado me he quedado muy satisfecho con el resultado. Debes mirar el video que te dicen y la instalación es muy fácil. Protege todas las lentes es fácil de instalar (mucho más que un protector para la pantalla) y se adhiere fácilmente. Espero que dure así durante bastante tiempo.Muy buena compra producto recomendado.
4,C’est un très bon produit et facile à installé
3,Il prodotto di per sè svolge la funzione richiesta di proteggere la fotocamera - ed essendomi scivolato varie volte di mano se non ci fosse stato sicuramente la fotocamera si sarebbe rotta- ma probabilmente per la forma stessa dell'oggetto appena subisce un urto anche leggero su uno dei lati inizia a incrinarsi. Dal momento che il vetro incrinato poi si impiglia in qualsiasi cosa dopo un paio di giorni inizia a staccarsi sui bordi perdendo qualsiasi efficacia rivelandosi inutile se non dannoso. Detto questo per il prezzo e l'utilità che ha comunque posso ritenermi soddisfatto tanto da averlo comprato una seconda volta. Spero solo di non doverlo comprare una terza e una quarta volta visto che in breve tempo entrambi i vetri del primo acquisto sono stati da buttare per i motivi sopra citati.
4,Me gusta en general repitiria
5,Sehr schön passt alles sehr gut
5,Pellicole ottime non creano effetto “nebbia” e non ostacolano il flash facilissime da installare consigliate.
3,for me it's a bit tooo thick but i think that's what it makes secure..
5,It protected my phone camera and I have it for 2 years now but there is always dirt inside it and I can’t clean it up that easily
3,Ambos protectores venían con huellas por dentro imposibles de limpiar por el adhesivo que llevan. Está claro que lo tocaron por dentro antes de embalarlo. Un cristal/protector que va delante de un objetivo de una cámara tiene que estar 100% perfecto para que no altere las fotografías. Así que ha sido una decepción... lo devuelvo.
3,...akzeptabel.Aber mehr nicht
5,Super facile à installer seul bémols : il y a un rond noir autour du flash alors que sur les photos de présentations il n’y ai pas il faudrait le rajouter dans l’annonce.Mais sinon je suis très satisfaite du reste !
5,Completely satisfied with the quality of the product. Came with all the necessary tools to install( whips cloth stickers) just as any screen protector would. I am now more confident having my phone in the bag knowing the camera will remain protected.
3,Facile da applicare e comoda ma quando vuoi sostituirla si salvi chi può! Nn si stacca facilmente
5,Super um die Kamera zu schützen
5,Ah c'est pratique à installer et dans l'ensemble protège très bien les lentilles de l'appareil photo mais je trouve qu'ils sont quand même un peu fragile
3,Le produit est bien mais j’ai eu l’occasion de remarquer que lorsqu’on prend une photo dans le noir avec le flash la photo est floue à cause de la protection.C’est dommage...Ceci dit la journée il n’y a aucun soucis
5,Produkt wie beschrieben ich werde weiter empfehlen
4,Montieren geht alles einfach und gut. Wenn der Glass gekratzt ist ist es schwierig zu entfernen. Muss man aufpassen das es zwei Schichten gibt und beide komplett entfernen muss.
4,Apparentemente questo vetrino sembra efficace come copertura per la fotocamera esterna del telefono. Ho scattato alcune foto e per il momento non ho notato nessuna differenza. 4 stelle perché solo perché è passato poco tempo dall’applicazione.Ps l’imballaggio e la presentazione del prodotto erano ottimi lasciandomi pensare che la sua qualità- prezzo non siano da meno.
2,Where can I start with this.Very easy to apply with clear instructions.The included wet wipes were dry but installation went fine.Problems only arise when using flash during photos and videos. I have a red iPhone 11 and when this protector is installed and I use the flash a red colour cast appears in the bottom corner (see example photos with it applied and without).They have tried to circumvent this problem by installing a small rubber o ring around the flash area but this doesn’t work.If you never use flash then get it. If you do then don’t bother.I’m now looking for single lens protectors hoping they will be better.Thanks for reading. If this helped you out then give me a thumbs up. Cheers and stay safe
5,Le istruzioni le si seguono su YouTube una volta inquadrato il Qr che si trova all’interno della confezione.Tutto semplicissimo e facilissimo.
2,Lo compré porque como todo el que pasa por este producto pensamos en proteger el móvil pero también en disfrutarlo y sacarle su máximo rendimiento. pues con este cristal sientes que pierdes cámara pero ganas protección. ¿compensa? en mi opinión no.  El flash refleja y crea un destello blanco. Lo tengo puesto hasta que encuentre una solución efectiva a sabiendas de que no puedo hacer fotos con flash y de que hay que pasarle un papel cada vez que hagamos una foto porque se ensucia y crea una capa que a simple vista no se aprecia pero si tomas una foto del antes y el después de haberlo limpiado notas esa capa de suciedad.Hay comentarios que aseguran que no les afecta al flash yo he comprobado que lo había colocado correctamente y de hecho probé a quitarle una gomita negra que rodea el flash y que en las fotos no parece existir e igualmente hace ese efecto.Viene bien equipado con toallitas y además el enlace de acceso a un vídeo muy bueno que te explica todos los pasos para que antes de colocarlo las lentes estén perfectamente limpias.
4,Das Produkt wurde schnell geliefert. Das Video als Anleitung war sehr gut. Das Reinigungsmaterial war okay. Das Glas für die Hülle ist etwas dick. Könnte für meinen Geschmack etwas dünner sein. Keine Kratzer auf dem Glas. Keine Beeinträchtigung der Kamera und bei Fotos mit Blitz. Ans sich ganz okay.
5,Gestern Abend habe ich dieses zum ersten mal gesehen und sofort bestellt. Heute Vormittag ist es zu mir gekommen das war so schnell!Es war in einem kleinen Schachtel und fast alles drin was beim Anbringen gebraucht wird.Laut einiger Bewertung gehe bei einigen Leuten die Kamera nicht schön oder nicht sauber aber bei mir ist es ganz normal wie gewohnt.-Was mir ein wenig fehlt : In der Verpackung gibt es zwei Feuchttücher sowie zwei Trockentücher - das Problem war bei Feuchttüchern dass sie beide überhaupt nicht nass sondern trocken sind wie ein Toilettenpapier.
4,Fast delivery. Great product. Not super thick but I’m happy anyway. Easy to install. It does not affect the use of my existing case either so great.
2,Ich habe dieses Produkt zum dritten Mal gekauft. Ich war bei den ersten zwei Malen sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt. Es hat seinen Zweck erfüllt und gut gehalten. Jedoch bin ich von meiner jetzigen Bestellung enttäuscht die Maße übereinstimmen nicht mit dem meines Iphone 11. Die extra Löcher für den Lautsprecher und der Taschenlampe sind nicht passend sondern versetzt wenn man das Glas genau auf die Kamera klebt.
5,Bis jetzt sehr zufrieden nur das aufkleben war etwas knifflig.
5,Bien reçu bon produits j’ai pas mis la note max car je veux voir dans le temps comment le produit se tient
5,C'est la première fois que j'achète une protection pour caméra d'iPhone j'ai été surpris par la précision du produit. J'ai pris des photos sans protection et des photos avec protection c'est à dire avec le vitre pas la moindre déformation ou zone asembri. Maintenant ça fait un mois que je l'ai installé il faut voir encore sur la durée. Je recommande vu le prix du smart phone sur tous pour la revente.
5,Es el primero que compro de esta marca y tiene buen aspecto. A ver si no se despega como otros al llevar el teléfono en el bolsillo.
4,Einfach anzubringen und funktioniert.
5,Nach der Bestellung einer anderen Kamerafolie welche schnell kaputt ging habe ich mich für diese entschieden. Nach ca. 3 Wochen des Benutzens ist immer noch alles in Ordnung kein abgeplatztes Glas an den schmalen Stellen! Die Anbringung war kinderleicht. Mit den mitgelieferten Tools säubert man die Oberfläche vorher ordentlich. Einiges Manko: um den Blitzer Herum ist ein schwarzer Rand. Sieht beim weißen Telefon nicht so hübsch aus. In der Artikelbeschreibung stand davon auch nichts. Aber ansonsten klare Kaufempfehlung gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis!!
4,Ce produit fait bien son travail lorsque j'ai fait tombé mon téléphone c'est bien la vitre qui a prit et non l'appareil photo. Je recommande.
4,The design dosen't look that good also is quiet expensive but overall i think is doing their job so protecting the camera
4,Sehr gute Qualität im Vergleich zu anderen Herstellern leicht verständlich beschrieben in dem dazugehörigen TutorialBin sehr zufrieden
5,Gibt mir schon ein besseres Gefühl zu wissen daß das Kamerasystem meines iPhone 11 vor unmittelbaren Kontaktschäden geschützt ist. Das Schutzglas im Bedarfsfall auszutauschen ist einfach und günstig - wesentlich teurere Reparaturen an den Kameralinsen können so effektiv vermieden werden und die Bildqualität wird nicht beeinträchtigt... Nie mehr ohne Schutz!
4,Installation rapide grâce à une video en ligne très pratique et pour l'instant l'adhérence est au rendez-vous ! La qualité est présente le prix est justifié. Bon produit ! (Iphone 11)
4,Lieferung schnell und problemlos wie auch die Montage allerdings werden die Bilder mit Blitz milchig und verschwommen
4,Delivery quick. Installation instructions good & easy to follow. Although I haven't used phone camera after installation am very satisfied with product & will recommend it.
2,Das Anbringen war schon etwas schwierig ging aber noch. Das mit den Fingerabdrücken konnte ich bei mir jetzt nicht feststellen. Die Bildualität leider ja das merkt man schon wenn auch nicht gar sooo sehr muss man sich halt überlegen was einem wichtiger ist.Was mich jedoch stört dass das Glas sehr schnell gebrochen ist obwohl es mir nicht mal runter gefallen ist. Und es verbricht in sehr sehr viele kleine Stücke. Ich weiß aktuell noch nicht mal wie ich das kaputte Glas wieder runter kriege. So wie man es von Display Gläsern gewohnt ist - Fingernagel rein und das Ding löst sich in einem ab - so klappt das hier leider nicht. Ich habe gerade größte Bedenken mir durch das Enrfernen des Schutzglases meine Kamera zu zerkratzen.Fotos davon wollte ich hochladen ging aber nicht (Fehlermeldung)
5,Great product! Excellent quality easy to install & comes with everything you need to ensure a perfect fit including access to an installation video for guidance if required. As you can see from pic it is such a great fit it’s difficult to tell there is a protector on there. Prompt delivery too! Very happy with my purchase.
5,Only jut installed this so have not had chance to take many photos after. Installation was a breeze though very easy as it stick to the top of the lens does not interfere with case at all which is a plus cant speak for how easy it will be to remove or the longevity of the glue but there are two of these in the case so hopefully they are changeable.
4,Acabo de instalarlo y no sé como irá pero el material y la instalación ha sido muy buena y calidad-precio no se puede pedir más. Protege la lente de la cámara que está demasiado expuesta en este iPhone.Es genial!
5,Buena relación calidad precio
4,Très bon produit reçu rapidement facile d’utilisation malgré aucune notice. De plus j’apprécie que cette protection recouvre complètement les deux lentilles de l’objectif. Très bon rapport qualité prix je recommande.
1,Ok
5,Ist in Ordnung.
5,Todo perfecto. Envío muy rápido y protector para cámara de 10. Muy recomendable para evitar que en posibles caídas tu móvil se quede con la cámara totalmente rota.
5,Ich brauchte für mein iPhone 11 einen Schutz für die Kameralinsen.Die Hülle allein schützte nicht diesen Bereich. War auch skeptisch ob trotz des Panzerglases nich gute Fotos entstehen. Ich bin begeistert. Super Bilder und Videos bis jetzt.Die beiden Schutzgläser waren in einer stabilen Verpackung versendet worden und auch das Produkt selber in einem festen Karton.( siehe Fotos) . Kann ich nur Empfehlen!
5,Installazione guidata dal video e resa perfetta! Non comprendo veramente i feedback negativi! Lenti protette da polvere e graffi e foto e video perfetti! Preso per mio 12promax e per mia moglie 11! Super consigliato! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Salva vita e non aggiungo altro.Fotocamera che sporge e quindi questa è una grande invenzione. 🌟 stra consigliato!
1,Ich werde es zurückschicken denn ich habe für ein Panzerglass gezahlt und nicht für eines welches schon kaputt ist
3,Did like it a lot as when it came to its protection function the problem was when i had to take a picture with my back camera with the flash on the picture would come out with a cloudy side light.I guess it was because the flash couldnt go straight out of the cut of the protection so when i had to take pics i had to remove it and then put it back. Overall it protected my phone lens quite well propsnfor that.
4,Ha sido fácil de poner. Parece de calidad. Cumple con su función de protección. No afecta a la calidad de las fotos pero cuando haces una foto con flash se ve mal la foto...
4,È la seconda volta che L acquisto facile da installare. La prima si è rotta non appena è caduto il telefono a terra. Fortunatamente il telefono è rimasto sano perciò ha fatto il suo dovere
5,Bis her sehe ich keinen Unterschied von Aufnahmen mit und ohne die Folie. Ich bin zufrieden und auch entspannter mein Handy nun in meine Tasche gleiten zu lassen. Geht auch super mit der Hülle und habe da keine Probleme. Fand das Anbringen etwas poppelig da das Teil klein ist und keine seitliche Folie zum halten vorhanden ist. Aber hat trotzdem gut geklappt
3,Aufbringen geht gut und Schutz bewerte ich gut aber das Entfernen ist sehr schwierig und es besteht dabei die Gefahr die Linsen zu zerkratzen.
3,an sich passt diese panzerfolie sehr gut. sie lässt einfach und präzise anbringen. der schutz ist damit gewährleistet. leider für mich nutzlos da die bilder mit blitz dann unbrauchbar sind. die fotos sehen dann aus als wäre die kamera beschlagen und hätte kleine tropfen darauf. daher werde ich diese folie nicht weiterempfehlen und habe sie umgehend wieder entfernt. schade eigentlich.
3,Pas pratique avec le flash ça fait un effet vert sur la photo
5,Top
4,Si applica perfettamente alla fotocamera posteriore del cellulare installata in pochi secondi senza problemi MOLTO SODDISFATTO
2,Lieferung ging super schnell. An sich wirkt das Glas wertig und passt auch perfekt.Allerdings hilft das alles nichts wenn sich das Glas nicht wichtig festklebt. Im Bereich des Blitzes löst es sich ständig wieder ab und so fällt das Glas mit der Zeit wieder herunter. Es sieht so aus als wäre an der Stelle der Kleber nicht richtig aufgebracht. Montags-Glas?Hoffe auf Stellungnahme vom Verkäufer…
2,Das Produkt an sich hat meine Kamera gut geschützt. Als die Folie gerissen ist wollte ich sie entfernen. Aber sie splittert nur etwas ab. Ich habe alle möglichen Tricks aus dem Internet probiert. Aber ich kann sie einfach nicht von der Kamera ablösen. Die Zweite werde ich auf keinen Fall nutzen!
4,À l’apparence très bon produit mais se retire très facilement.
4,Everything is ok just one of them is like quite scratched. Nice product for iphone 11. thank you!
3,Cuesta poco de poner pero al primer golpe se me ha roto 😅
4,Easy to install provides that extra protection
5,Perfekt
4,Peccato per il cerchietto nero attorno al flash per il resto tutto ok 👌🏻
4,è perfetto per iPhone 11 ma è un po’ sporco dentro( dove si contato diretta con il fotocamera) ho spento tanto tempo per pulirlo e non sono riuscita per pulire bene perché si attacca sempre i poveri da qualche parte mentre pulisco. A questo momento va bene il resto
5,Like how it’s perfect fit and protect the camera  and the fast delivery
4,Prodotto facile da istallare e fa il suo.
5,Lente fácil de instalar no perjudica a la calidad de la cámara. Calidad precio muy buena. Totalmente recomendable. En el paquete vienen dos lentes.
5,Leichte Installation dank Anleitung. Das Glas sitzt perfekt und stört die Qualität der Kamera Aufnahmen bisher kein bisschen. Reinigungstücher und Staub Absorber sind enthalten. Einziger Kritikpunkt: Vorsicht beim Herauslösen des Glases aus der Pappe. Beim ersten Versuch ist das Glas herausgesprungen und auf den Boden geflippt war natürlich nicht mehr zu gebrauchen. Zum Glück waren ja 2 in der Packung ;:)
4,Facile da montare
1,This has shattered a week after me having it broken bits of glass keep coming off in tiny shards making it unsafe
4,Der enthält alles nötig zur Montage.Anleitungsvideo ist auf YouTube verfügbar.Reinigungstuch ‚wet‘ war ausgetrocknet.Alternative Mikrofasertuch war als Ersatz ausreichend.Montage an sich ist einfach und unkompliziert.
3,The class is extremely weak
3,Acheté pour mon iPhone 11 rouge. Très facile à installer mais quand je prends des photos avec le flash des reflets rouges apparaissent sur la photo. Un peu déçue même si la qualité a l’air bonne
4,Si applica facilmente - credo sia importante aumentare lo spessore perché dopo un po’ di tempo si rompono
4,Schütz sehr gut ist jedoch etwas zu dick.
5,Zufrieden
5,This product is worth every penny you pay for it to protect the camera lenses on my new iPhone 11. With the quality of photos that you can take now with a mobile phone surely it makes sense to protect the lenses from scratches etc without it affecting the quality of photos taken. My advice just buy them!
4,Good product would recommend
4,Todo bien te adjuntan un vídeo para explicar detalladamente la instalación. Lo único malo es que las fotos con flash se ven muy mal.
3,C'est super mais quand on fait des photos avec des flashs elle est facilement rosé pour cette cause
3,Bei Tageslicht stört das „Glas“ nicht. Jedoch ist es bei Nachtaufnahmen unbrauchbar. Zumindest wenn mit Blitz aufgenommen wird. Denn hierbei kommt es zu einer starken Lichtstreuung In die Linsen die Bilder unbrauchbar macht. Zudem handelt es sich nicht wirklich um reines geschweigedenn geschliffenes Glas sondern um eine Kombination aus einer gelochten Kunststoffplatte mit einer aufgeklebten dünnen Glasscheibe. Finde nicht das der Preis gerechtfertigt ist.
5,Qualité du produit très bon
4,Très satisfait une sécurité supplémentaire qui je l’espère fera son affaire dans le temps.
5,Prodotti arrivato nei tempi previsti e facile da installare guardando il video.  L’unico problemino è stato che entrambe le salviette erano secche (penso per il caldo estivo) ma è stato sufficiente usare una salvietta con alcol. A volte temevo che poggiando male il telefono si sarebbero scheggiate le lenti visto che sono leggermente in rilievo con questo mi sembra siano ben protetta e mi sembra anche resistente.
4,Non do 5 stelle solo perché si è graffiata un po’  quasi subito ma nel complesso la consiglio visto il mio utilizzo molto rude del telefono
3,Für die Funktion Kameraschutz hervorragend geeignet für die Funktion Fotos mit Blitz absolut nicht zu empfehlen ....Sobald bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen der Blitz benutzt wird sind sind Bilder verschwommen und seltsam belichtet.Der Versuch ohne Schutz hat gezeigt das Fotos wieder gestochen scharf  vernünftig belichtet werden...
3,Als Schutz für die Kamera grundsätzlich gut. Es gibt aber auch einen Wehrmutstropfen: die Qualität der Fotos leidet leider massiv in demMoment wo es etwas dunkler ist und der Blitz auslöst. Dann sind die Bilder überlichtet.Habe jetzt einen anderen Schutz wo die Linsen wieder alle frei sind und da tritt dieses Problem nicht auf.
2,Eine der beiden Abdeckungen war nicht zu gebrauchen da die untere Kamera Aussparung nicht richtig ausgestanzt war.So ist es ein gutes Produkt nur halt eine von zwei Schutzgläsern aufgrund eines Produktionsfehlers nicht verwendbar.
5,Bellissimo è facile da istallare comodo
3,Leider konnte ich mit dem Schutz auf der Kamera keine guten Bilder mit Blitz mehr machen da sich dann immer ein Schatten auf dem Foto abgebildet hat.
5,Good value for money. I can see this item protecting my iPhone11 camera and thus photo quality from scratches when put on surfaces as the iPhone 11 camera protrudes slightly from the phone.
5,Das Panzerglas für die Kamera gefällt mir sehr gut und ich muss mich nicht mehr um die Kamera bei einem Sturz sorgen da ich überzeugt von dem Produkt bin. Fühlt sich sehr robust an und liegt bündig mit meiner Hülle an. Empfehle ich aufjedenfall weiter. Leicht anzubringen ohne viel Kopfschmerzen und an der Bildqualität ändert es nichts!
5,Arrivato velocementeSi installa facilmente il contorno nero sul forellino ne è consigliata la rimozione per un miglior utilizzo del flash.Resta perfettamente incollato. È il secondo che installo. È perfetto come aderenza e misura come potete vedere dalle fotoOttima protezione.Se la mia recensione vi è stata d’aiuto mi farebbe piacere se cliccaste su utile.
5,Très bien
2,An sich ein sehr gutes Produkt! Schnell angebracht hält gut und die Bilder sind trotzdem scharf und qualitativ gut!Leider war aber nur ein Schutzglas in der Packung anstatt wie geschrieben zwei. Kann sein dass es ein produktions- oder Verpackfehler war. Aber daher der Sternabzug!
4,Nix gut
4,Producto de calidad
3,Guter Schutz für die Kamera. Aber komplett durchsichtig ist es nicht. Sieht aus als wären Fingerabdrücke drunter  dabei wurde sie fachgerecht montiert.
5,This had good reviews and I'm so pleased that I chose this camera screen protector. Very easy to attach and the video was a great help. Everything you need is in the packet. It only takes a couple of minutes to put on. Worked with my case. Am a happy customer.
1,2枚カバーが入っていますが、その内1枚はカメラ保護部の内側が汚れていて使用出来ませんでした。残り1枚使用しましたが、カバーを貼り付けた時に接着面がムラになり気になり使用を止めました。微妙な出来の製品でした。
2,Ich habe mir für mein IPhone 11 diese Schutzhülle für die Kamera geholt.Es hält was es verspricht - aber mehr nicht.Ich konnte mit dieser Schutzhülle keine Bilder mit Blitz machen da diese dann rötlich waren. Ich habe auch versucht den schwarzen Gummiring raus zu nehmen auch das hilft nicht.Dazu kommt dass ich mein Handy in der Zeit nicht fallen lassen habe und mir beide Hüllen innerhalb eines Monats „zersprungen“ sind. Ich hatte danach Risse drin die die Kameraqualität beeinflusst haben.Nachdem beide Hüllen kaputt waren habe ich mir bei Media Markt eine Hülle für knapp 8€ gekauft.. diese hält sehr viel länger durch und ich kann jetzt auch Bilder in der Nacht mit meinem Blitzlicht machen.
5,Ottimo prodotto ottima protezione
5,Da bei meinem iPhone 11 das Gehäuse um die Kamera zerkratzt ist habe ich mir diesen Schutz geholt um mehr Kratzer zu vermeiden. Es Schützt die Rückseite perfekt allerdings passt nicht jede Handyhülle optimal mit dem Schutz.
3,An sich eine gute Idee aber nach meinem Empfinden leidet die Bildqualität etwas und mit Blitz ist es nicht zu gebrauchen. Nochmal würde ich dieses Produkt nicht kaufen. Zumindest nicht für den Preis :P
5,Great product instructions easy to follow and apply.
5,Easy to install.
4,Ottimo prodotto necessario per chi vuole una sicurezza per la propria fotocamera. Consiglio l’acquisto!!
4,Einfach zu montieren
5,Rempli son job  facile à installer colle bien ! Nous l avons tout de même enlevé car la nuit avec le flash cette protection ( une autre ferait certainement pareil !...) reflété sur la photo la couleur du téléphone
5,Il prodotto è arrivato nei tempi imballato con cura i contenuti tutti al loro posto comode le salviettine per pulire la camera ed i pannini in microfibra per pulire successivamente le lenti installate. Video istruzionale su come utilizzare tutto il materiale. Ottimo!
4,Chiesto dalla figlia che è rimasta soddisfatta del prodotto che fa il suo lavoro. Non compromette la qualità delle foto.iPhone 11 per sempre. Consiglio
3,Great product but one of the lenses came broken. Photo shownOther one was great and easy to installWill prob still order again
4,Es erfüllt seinen Zweck nicht mehr nicht weniger Bilder sind weiterhin top
3,Prodotto di facile installazione protettivo ed esteticamente gradevole. Il grosso limite è dovuto all’alone che si crea durante l’uso del flash nelle foto in notturna che le rende praticamente inguardabili. Se poi come me avete scelto il colore rosso per il vostro iphone l’effetto è una sfocatura rossastra sulla parte sx della fotografia
5,Ideal stick on cover to protect your camera lens
3,Deckt perfekt meine Kamera Linsen vom iPhone 11 ab. Schneller Versand und Preis Leistungsverhältnis ist in Ordnung
5,So easy to install my old protector was getting a little worn so this should do the trick.My phone looks like new again
2,Non si vede bene.
5,Das Glas für die Kamera finde ich sehr gut. Es schützt die Kamera vor Kratzern und Staub etc. Keinerlei Beeinträchtigung beim Fotografieren. Gutes Preis-Leistungsfähig.
4,Ci sono le istruzioni nella scatola con il link del video dell'istallazione! La qualità sembra buona e aderisce bene. Speriamo che duri nel tempo. Non ho notato alterazioni nella qualità delle foto.
5,Buono
5,Ein mega Produkt! Ich finde es sehr qualitativ und es ist sehr leicht anzubringen. Meine Kamera hat null an Qualität verloren. Würde ich zu 100% weiter empfehlen!
4,Braucht man nicht unbedingt .Hülle mit Kameraschutz finde ich besser
4,Passt macht was es soll
4,vite reçupose rapideje recommande
5,Einfaches aufkleben fast blasenfrei dann auch noch zu einem fairen Preis. Diese Folien haben mir schon mehrfach meine Handykamera geschützt. Bildqualität leidet kaum bis garnicht.
5,Nickel :)
5,Schnelle Lieferung und super Qualität der Ware. Anleitung zum Anbringen war auch dabei.Alles Bestens
5,Exactly how it looks like on amazon. Comes with everything needed to apply and a helpful video about installation. Good thickness to protect the camera but does not impact the quality of photos. Really good for the price
4,Schützt sehr gut und die Passform ist auch gut. Perfekt wenn man keine Handyhülle will.
5,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product. Came with all the necessary tools to install( whips cloth stickers) just as any screen protector would. I am now more confident having my phone in the bag knowing the camera will remain protected
1,easy to install but shocking quality
3,Wurden 2 Stück geliefert. Eins davon da waren leider schon Kratzer drauf und unbrauchbar. Ansonsten aber gut bin unsicher ob es die Fotoqualität beeinträchtigt. Aber das eine Stück ist auch nach 2 Wochen noch drauf immerhin  hält es weiterhin.
5,Pensaba que podria tener reflejos al usar la camara una vez instalado el protector pero no funciona de lujo no se pierde calidad y proteges los objetivos de la cámara del movilito que te ha costado 1000 pavos encantado con la compra ademas vino una semana antes de lo previsto entrega muy rapida a pesar de haberlo pedido en plena pandemia.
3,Fácil de colocar pero no de quitar son bastante rígidas así que no duran mucho ya que con un golpe se rajan por la mitad
4,Perfetta
5,easy to install and good protection
5,Buen producto entrega rápida y excelente atención al cliente.
3,Purtroppo usando il flash nelle foto si vede un alone bianco.
1,フラッシュ撮影時、光がレンズに入り込み白くなる
5,This lens protection 2pack for iPhone 11 was super easy to install. Really slim and minimalistic design
5,El protector es muy fácil de instalar y se ajusta a la perfección. El material es resistente y parece dar protección fiable. Las fotos no parecen verse afectadas después de colocar el protector.
5,Alles dabei was man braucht um den Kamera Protector in weniger als 5min anzubringen. Es gibt sogar ein Videotutorial dafür. Der Prtector ist aus einem Stück deckt beide Linsen ab das gefällt mir viel besser als einzelne pro Linse; so ist der ganze Bereich durch das Glas geschützt.
3,Personalmente non mi sono trovata bene si è rotto subito con il rischio di scheggiare ancora di più la fotocamera
5,Gran relación calidad-precio. Muy fácil de instalar. La calidad de la cámara no se ve afectada.
5,Excelente producto. El compañero ideal para proteger la cámara trasera del iPhone 11. Muy fácil de instalar siguiendo las instrucciones. Incluye un anillo (tipo Junta) para rodear el flash y unirlo al conjunto del protector. Se lo regalé a mi mujer y súper contenta. Muy recomendable. ¡Gracias!
3,Geht
5,La protection est très satisfaisante. Facile d'installation et 100% case friendly. Les photos à lumière naturelle ne sont pas du tout altérées par le verre. Satisfaite de mon achat.
5,Arrivato nei tempi previsti. Ottimo rapporto qualità- prezzo nella foto ho già messo la pellicola e devo dire che è stato molto facile. Viene con un panno umido per pulire ed un altro per asciugare. Lo consiglio!!!
2,Istruzioni d’applicazione abbastanza confuse comunque Ho tirato fuori una lente d’ingrandimento per assicurarmi che fosse applicato in maniera precisa. Non si vede sulle foto descrittive del prodotto ma il buco del flash è bordato di nero. Purtroppo a luce solare questa pellicola genera dei riflessi (glare) di luce rifratta che compromettono le foto mentre col flash inviluppano l’immsgine in un caos di luce bianca diffusa. Per essere solido lo sembra ma probabilmente lo toglieró. Al momento per iphone 11 non ci sono protettori di lenti adeguati (provati diversi..).
5,Produit conforme à mes attentes. Dommage qu’il n’y ait pas une notice explicative écrite avec schéma. Sinon contente de mon achat. A voir dans le temps
5,Encaje perfecto. Todo genial
5,Great product fits perfectly around my iPhone camera lens’ and doesn’t interfere with my case. Really easy to install and hasn’t effected the camera quality at all. Happy buyer!
4,Im zweiten Anlauf hat’s gut geklappt.
5,It’s ok easy to fit but after about 2 or 3 months it starts to show scratchies  as it is proud of the cover   but better then damaging your lenses. So a good buy
2,You are unable to take clear images with the flash on when you have this cover on.
3,Zufrieden
5,Acquistato per proteggere il mio nuovo iPhone funziona ottimamente.Le pellicole si adattano bene e sono molto resistenti il display rimane perfettamente intatto.L’applicazione è molto semplice basta pulire bene il display ed appoggiare la pellicola si adatta facilmente.Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.Consiglio a tutti quelli che vogliono essere sicuri di proteggere il proprio telefono.
5,Die Kamera ist jedem Fall geschützt v.a. Super für Handys die in vollen Handtaschen liegen!
3,Passt super anbringen ist auch kinderleicht. Allerdings ist fotografieren mit Blitz nicht möglich da die Bilder milchig sind.
5,The camera lens cover was easy to install and straight forward fits perfect around the lens and the whole camera. Would definitely but again without any hesitation
3,Bien
5,Great product great price! Can’t believe I ever paid somebody in a phone shop to apply this for me comes with instructions and so easy to do!
5,My iPhone camera lens broke after a few months of having it protectors like this are now a must. Installation was easy and to my surprise it has no effect on pictures!
4,Le foto vengono bene ma in videochiamata si vede un po’ a puntini
5,Great product I had damaged my last phones lens so with new phone wanted to make sure it didn’t happen again.So easy to fit.
5,Works well to protect your camera lense a must have easy to install and 2 in a pack well happy
5,J’ai acheté ce produit pour protéger les caméras de mon iPhone 11. Livré dans les temps il correspond parfaitement à mes attentes. 2 protège c’est super au cas où j’en casse un.
5,Fácil de instalar y aparentemente de calidad.No ha quedado ninguna burbuja y la cámara se ve perfectamente sin ningún  tipo de distorsión o cambio en el color.
5,Le ho sia sul mio telefono che su quello della mia compagna e dopo 6 mesi sono ancora al loro posto senza nemmeno un graffio. Hanno protetto benissimo il telefono; spesa garantita e di qualità.
4,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
5,Sehr einfache Montage sehr dick super starker Halt des Glases sehr passgenau.Kann man nur weiter empfehlen.
5,With 2 sets included this is good value. Its fits well with my slim case with no protruding. easy to install and no problems yet.
5,Producto que cumple su función y se ajusta perfectamente al telefono. Lleva dos orificios para el flash (para impedir que haya reflejo) y el micrófono (para que no haya problemas de sonido en los videos). Llegó antes de lo esperado. Viene con kit pequeño para la limpieza previa a pegar el protector.
1,Delusa mi è arrivato un pezzo già graffiato come in foto!!!
5,Das Glas ist ein toller Schutz für die Kameras.Das Glas Beeinträchtigt nicht die Qualität von Fotos oder Aufnahmen.Es haftet hervorragend und bleibt FettfreiWeiterzuempfehlen !!!
5,Au top
5,I was always worried about scratching the camera lenses and this solves the problem perfectly
5,Heute angekommen.  Passt - macht was es soll.
5,Buen producto fácil de instalar y cumpliendo perfectamente su funcionalidad. Magnifica relación calidad precio.
5,Definitely worth the buy to save your camera but get a few in stock.Will save you a lot of money in the long run.
5,Gran producto  muy recomendable
4,protege bien la cámara calidad buena no se puede usar el flash pero merece la pena
1,This cracks very easily even if you have a cover around it. When it cracks the piece doesn’t stay together so actually you’re more likely to cause damage to your lenses than if you just didn’t bother having one of these in the first place.
5,Weißer Schleifer beim Video oder Fotos machen. Müll
1,Die Qualität ist sehr schlecht es bricht schnell
5,Passt alles super für mein Handy(Apple11) und ist einfach anzubringen . Tolles Preis-Leistungsverhältnis.
5,Sehr schnelle Lieferung einfaches Anbringen gleiche Bildqualität.
5,Easy to fit following the video on the link provided - all items needed to fit were included in the pack
5,Passt perfekt rauf!Tut was es tun soll.
5,Hatte vorher andere Kameragläser doch diese hier sind am besten! Sehr paßgenau (ohne Lücke) und die Fotos sind sehr klar. Absolut zu empfehlen!
4,Passt genau und schnell zu montieren
5,Le produit est très efficace contre les griffes qu’on peut avoir sur la caméra et même à côté de la caméra
5,Schnelle Lieferungschönes Case.Macht einen guten Eindruck und sitzt sicher auf der Linse.
5,Super produit de bonne qualité ! Fourni avec des lingettes pour pouvoir bien nettoyer les objectifs avant de poser le verre trempé. Je recommande
3,Mi è arrivato il prodotto è sono arrivati 2 pezzi uno era rigato. Non aderisce molto bene alla fotocamera e influisce sulle foto se non attaccata bene. Bisogna saperla installare. Per il resto è abbastanza resistente e fa comunque il suo dovere.
4,Super einfach zu installieren!
5,Très satisfaite de mon achat facile à mettre protège bien la caméra arrière je le recommande produit conforme.
4,Ottimo prodotto e consegnato in tempo.
1,Beide sind nach 1 Tag kaputt gewesen. Und das nur beim silikonhülle anbringen.
5,Facile à installer. Rendu attendu. Protège bienSatisfaite
2,Bei mir war kein „Dustremover-Klebestreifen“ dabei was dazu führte das ich ein wenig Staub auf meiner Linse habe. Die Bildqualität wir dadurch nicht beeinträchtigt jedoch ist es ausschlaggebend für einen punkteabzug bei meiner Rezension...
4,Buon prodotto 👍🏻👍🏻
3,Facile à poser très bon produit
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt.Von der Lieferung bis zur Passgenauigkeit alles perfektKann es klar weiter empfehlen.
5,Ich bestelle dieses Produkt bereits zum dritten Mal . Bin sehr begeistert
1,Facile da mettere ma quando ho provato a sostituirla non si è scollata ho provato con tutto pinze forbici alcool niente è sempre lì adesso mi tocca andare in un negozio per farmela togliere mai più 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
5,supergut!
5,PARFAIT !
3,La pellicola fa il suo dovere egregiamente niente da dire. L’unica pecca è che quando si fanno foto con il flash altera l’immagine finale. Comunque protegge bene la fotocamera.
5,Definitely buy again very good price
5,Ottimo
2,Il vetrino che ho installato sembra aderisca bene non si muove se lo tocco o pulisco;La colla però è visibilmente fastidiosa perchè crea degli aloni sulla tutta la superficie della parte opaca della fotocamera!Altra cosa che mi ha fatto storcere il naso è che nei vetrini che mi sono arrivati c’era già della polvere ancora prima di staccarli dalla plastica protettiva
5,Bilder werden nicht beeinträchtigt
5,Die Kameraleistung lässt durch das Glas nicht nach und die Glasscheibe sitzt wie angegossen. Durch einen Link auf der Verpackung kommt man zu einem Anleitungsvideo wo die Installation erklärt wird.Top!
4,Presa per iPhone 11 e perfetta e facile da installare
5,This was super easy to install and does not degrade the camera quality! Love it!
5,Exactly what I needed. Easy to install (includes a link to an easy to follow installation video) and fits perfectly with my existing phone case. Would recommend!
5,Instalación muy facil. Protección asegurada. Muy contento con el resultado
1,Purtroppo non si incollano
2,Il prodotto di per se è buono in ottima confezione   però se pensate di comprarlo per un XR  come ho fatto io sappiate che non aderisce PER NULLA AL VETRO .. ho fatto flop
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Panzerglas für die Kamera. Das Produkt kam schnell an und ist einfach anzubringen. Da es ein Doppelpack ist kann mein Freund das andere Schutzglas haben. Er ist ebenfalls zufrieden.
5,Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis!
1,Das richtige perfekte anbringen ist nahe zu unmöglich und die klebefläche hatte von werk aus bereits ein staubfussel enthalten also nicht zu empfehlen
5,Ich bin dem dem Schutzglas absolut zufrieden. Es war einfach es zu installieren und stört auch in der Handyhülle nicht. Die Verpackung war sehr hochwertig.
3,buon prodotto se installato correttamente
2,Wenn ich ein Foto mit Blitz machen möchte habe ich ein Schleier auf dem Foto.Habe schon mehrfach versucht das Panzerglas anders draufzusetzen bringt nichts. Nutze es nun nicht mehr. Qualität  und Sitz ist aber sonst top!
2,The lens protector was good but it only came it one... I bought this for two too (one for me and one for my brother)  :(Update: it broke so quickly I don’t know how it broke.
5,HalloMeiner Meinung nach ist dieses Produkt ausgezeichnet.
5,Hat die Erwartungen meiner Enkeltochter erfüllt.
5,Réception ce jour du protège camera je recommande s’adapte parfaitement au téléphone et n’importe type de coque
4,Es muy fácil de instalar y se acopla perfectamente
5,Top Produkt bisher! Die Montage lief schnell und problemlos ab. Von Problemen beim Fotografieren mit Blitz habe ich bisher keine Indizien festgestellt. Vielleicht hab ich es einfach gerade angebracht 🤪.
5,Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis pünktlich geliefert
5,Il pacco è arrivato in tempo. La cover per la fotocamera del mio telefono è facile da installare e le foro vengono come se non ci fosse. La consiglio vivamente.
5,Perfecto facil de colocar
3,Prodotto valido e facile da applicare
3,Prodotto conforme alla descrizione.Unica pecca con il flash attivato vengono male le foto poiché crea animale luci sulla fotocamera per tanto non è tanto comodo
5,Plusieurs mois qu’il est collé et le nombre de fois où j’ai fait tomber mon téléphone ça n’a pas bouger
5,Comprato per il mio iPhone 11 arrivato nei tempi previsti e con confezione in ottimo stato. Facile da mettere aderisce bene e non intocca la definizione della fotocamera. Ottimo rapporto Qualità/Prezzo. Lo consiglio
5,Muy buen protector para el i phone 11 de muy buena calidad y fácil de instalar. Incluye link al video para instalarlo y tarjeta regalo.
5,I purchased these on behalf of my sister for her iPhone does the job
5,Great until it breaks
5,Super Passgenauigkeit schnelle Lieferung.Einziges Manko wen man mit Blitz fotografiert ist das Licht auf dem Foto zu erkennen.
5,Répond à mes attentes merci
5,très bon produit et très simple a installé avec la vidéo
5,Schnelle Installation gutes Video was will man mehr. Passt auch vom Preis her.
5,Very easy to apply and case friendly! Not too thick.. was great :)
5,Top Qualität keine Beeinträchtigung für die Kamera leichte Montage echt super tolles Produkt kann ich nur weiter empfehlen
2,Eine echt super Idee - ABER leider werden die Fotos nicht wirklich scharf und wenn man mit Blitz fotografiert dann legt sich so eine Art weißlicher/milchiger Schleier über das Foto. Sehr schade. Idee ist super aber muss optimiert werden.Handhabung und sonstige Qualität/Verarbeitung des Produkts waren sehr gut - daher immerhin 2 Sterne von mir.
5,Muy buena calidad. Tenía miedo de ponerle protector de cámara a mi iphone 11 ya que muchos protectores comprometían la imagen al ser tomada con flash algo que no ocurre con este modelo. Lo recomiendo totalmente.
4,Prodotto di qualità ottima. Consigliato
5,Vraiment discret et idéal avec une coque
5,Content de mon achat  il protege bien il arrive juste pile a la même épaisseur que la coque l'installation est facile...
5,Rápido en llegar. Se ajusta perfectamente y no afecta para nada a las fotos con flash
5,Amazing quality! Professional package with everything you could possibly need top quality!
5,Veramente soddisfatto la confezione contiene tutto il necessario per l’installazione è possibile anche vedere un breve video per applicare il prodotto al meglio. Spessore leggermente elevato ma sicuramente protegge al meglio io la fotocamera.
5,First class delivered on time top quality product. Would buy again from you
5,Leggermente difficile l’installazione. Ma c’è un link che ti rimanda ad un video di spiegazione. Sul mio telefono non altera l’anatomia ma soprattutto non altera la qualità delle foto ma mi da sicurezza in più soprattutto visto che le nuove fotocamere dell’iPhone sono abbastanza sporgenti e delicate.Spedizione Amazon come al solito da 10 e lode.
5,Au top ! Produit conforme ! Protège parfaitementN’hésitez pas !
5,Muy fácil de instalar con el vídeo bien explicado y se ve todo con claridad se fija bien al iPhone y se ve resistente protege bien las cámaras y les da grosor. Muy rápida la entrega.
5,Ottimo prodotto
5,Super schnelle Lieferung außerdem sehr leicht zum installieren sieht auch gut und geschützt aus.Nur zu empfehlen!
5,Fast delivery and easy installation great for the extra camera protection.

5,Facile à poser envoi rapide identique à la description merci beaucoup
5,Easy to install and good instructions. Good quality product.
5,Es muy aconsejable ver el vídeo porqué así seguro que lo haces bien y no te saltas ningún paso.
3,Grazie a questa pellicoho salvato il mio cell
5,Das Panzerglas für die Kamera erfüllt meine Erwartungen. Das Produkt wurde sehr schnell geliefert und ist super einfach anzubringen.
5,Die Tücher (wet) waren leider trocken der Rest alles super. Hat genau gepasst.
5,Really great quality product. Easy to use. Nicely packaged.
5,Bombe
4,Buon prodotto
3,L’ho appena applicata ed è stato facilissimo. Sembra super resistente.
2,Das Glas passt genau! Aber leider werden die Fotos durch das Glas ein wenig unscharf.
5,Rien a dire livraison très rapide le produit es de très bonne qualité pas trop difficile à installer sur mon iPhone
5,Arrivato nei tempi giusti come sempre lo consiglio per la facilità di istallazione e la protezione eccellente. Un giorno mi è caduto il telefono e ha salvato la fotocamera poi la confezione da 2 ha permesso la sostituzione immediata. Mai più senza!
5,Sehr gut Danke
5,👍🏿 perfetto
5,Finde ich sehr gut kann ich nur empfehlen hält sehr gut
5,Great girlfriend very happy with it!

5,Excellent easy to install and as described
5,Very easy to fit and the backing case did not foul on the screen protector very good product
5,Ottimo prodotto : rapporto qualita prezzo giustissimo e mi sembra mto confortevole. É di facile installazione e si incastra perfettamente anche nella cover
5,Buen protector de camaraa mi en mi iphone 11 no me dificulta en nada la camarano le noto ningun reflejo ni nada.Protege por completo las camaras y flash
5,La protection s’adapte parfaitement aux capteurs photo. Reçu à temps et bien emballé. Rien à dire.
5,Es perfecto para proteger la lente buenísima compra. Fácil de instalar y no afecta la calidad de la imagen ni el uso del flash. Vienen dos protectores
1,Schützt die Kamera ja. Aber Fotos mit Blitzlicht haben einen weiß Schleier wie andere Produkte.
2,Si applica facilmente e mi pareva molto utile però cambiando la cover ho sentito uno scricchiolio e questo glass si è frantumato. Mi pareva di averlo applicato seguendo alla lettera le istruzioni ma questo è il risultato. Adesso ho applicato il secondo vetrino che c’era nella confezione. Speriamo bene!
5,Protège parfaitement les objectifs de l’iPhone 11
5,Sehr schnelle Lieferung passt perfekt zum iPhone 11. Immer wieder.
5,Ich bin förmlich begeistert•gute Verpackung•robustes Material•leicht zum montieren•keinen Einfluss auf de Bildqualität•Preis ist völlig gerechtfertigt•schneller VersandEcht ein super Produkt!Kann es nur weiterempfehlen!
5,Das Produkt ist wirklich 1 A perfekt sozusagen  passt auch gut aufeinander.Bin glücklich hier bestellt zu haben...
2,Produkt kommt super verpackt mit Anleitung und allem. Leider muss ich sagen dass es beim Fotografieren doch Einschränkungen gibt. Beispiel beim Blitz reflektiert es und man bekommt ein Schatten ins Bild. Leider deshalb nicht so gut und nicht zu empfehlen.
5,Kann noch nicht beurteilen ob es sein Versprechen hält dazu muss das Panzerglas erstmal etwas länger in gebrauch sein.
5,Great product 5 star all round
5,Great Product with astonish quality!!!!
5,Perfect and fits well with my case
5,Fantastic for the price
5,Parfait! Se met facilement et est au même niveau que la coque.
5,Parfait protège parfaitement mes caméras. Je recommande ce produit !
1,le produit s'est décollé au bout de 2 joursce produit s'adapte bien mais ne colle pas aux caméra et tombe parterreaucun nécessité du produit a fuire
5,Perfect for IPhone 11
5,Sehr gut 👍
1,Total enttäuscht. Lasst die Finger davon.Lieferung war wie immer schnell und problemlos. Nach dem Auspacken und dem Anbringen (man muss für die Installationsanleitung eine Website aufrufen) stellte ich fest das alles super gepasst hat allerdings von innen waren fremde Fingerabdrücke auf der Innenseite des Schutzes. Dort kommt man beim Anbringen niemals gegen bzw. in die Nähe. Zudem waren auch bei dem zweiten noch unbenutzten Schutz im Licht Fingerabdrücke von innen zu sehen. Absolut mangelhafte Qualität und wohl handverpackt.Des Weiteren kann man mit Blitz keine Fotos mehr machen ohne das die Bilder total unbrauchbar verleuchtet sind.Ab in die Tonne damit.
5,schnelle Lieferung. alles bestens.
4,Spedizione ottima articolo perfetto
5,Das Produkt hat uns mehr als überzeugt Es hält was es verspricht. Preis Leistungsverhältnis stimmt.Können wir nur empfehlen.
5,Alles ist gut
5,Easy to fit
5,wie erwartet gut
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Direi formidabili e facile da installarle sono molto soddisfatta
5,Super schnelle Lieferung einfach an zu bringen und hält was es verspricht
5,Easy to use ... perfect
5,Dieser "Screen Protector" schützt die Kameras meines iPhone 11 durchgehend zuverlässig! Daher ist der Artikel absolut empfehlenswert.
5,Easy to fit good quality.
5,Ho usato questo prodotto per il mio cellulare iPhone 11. Dentro ho trovato tutto il necessario per l’applicazione della cover fotocamera e in più un volantino con il sito dove andare per poter seguire le procedere per l’applicazione . Grazie UniqueMe
1,Leider ist der Kameraschutz trotz Schutzhülle am IPhone nach nur 1 Tag abgegangen obwohl alles genau so gemacht wurde wie in der Anleitung beschrieben. Hier scheint die Klebekraft nicht genug auszureichen damit es langfristig hältVon daher leider eher nicht zu empfehlen. Der Schutz der Kamera ist allerdings gegeben wenn der Kameraschutz aufgebracht ist
5,Fácil y rápido. Vídeo web con tutorial de instalación.
5,Alles gut
5,Arrivato a casa in tempi brevissimi. Applicazione facile e veloce e miglior rapporto qualità prezzo nel mercato!Da comprare assolutamente!
1,Der Kleber der dort drauf ist hat beim ersten Sicherheitsglass nach 2 Tagen schon nicht mehr geklebt das zweite Glass ist nach knappen 8 Stunden auch wieder runter.
1,Ho comprato questo articolo per proteggere la fotocamera del mio iPhone 11 lo spessore del vetrino è molto buono l'installazione risulta essere abbastanza facile ma non sono per niente soddisfatta con l'acquisto. Ho rimosso il vetrino nemmeno dopo un pomeriggio di utilizzo perché mi sono accorta che le foto scattate con il flash risultano rovinate. Il mio iPhone è rosso e in tutte le foto scattate con il flash è presente il riflesso del mio dispositivo.Sconsigliato per chi utilizza il telefono per scattare foto.
5,Facile à installer on verra ds le temps...
5,Habe die Folie seit mehreren Monaten im Einsatz. Haftet gut und liegt blasenfrei an.Empfehlenswert 👍👍👍
5,Super facile à installerA voir sur la durée !
5,Die Schutzfolie passt perfekt. Die Bildqualität leidet nicht darunter. Bin sehr zufrieden.
5,Muy buen producto tal y como esperaba. Bienen dos protectores.
5,Gefallen
2,La protection est top mais si vous avez coque ( pour ma part j’ai la coque transparente de cher Apple ) il est pas possible d’enlever la coque sans décoller le verre ou le casser...
2,Me gusta que se encaje perfectamente a la zona de la cámara pero las fotos con flash no salen bien. Tendré que comprar otro tipo de producto. No lo recomiendo.
2,Je pour habitude d’installer des verts trempé et franchement celui-ci est médiocre il laisse toujours des traces qui sont pas forcément visible À l’œil mais quand on prend des photos on peux le remarquer
5,Super leicht angebracht hält was es verspricht und würde ich nicht mehr missen wollen!!!
1,Bricht ziemlich schnell und zu groß
5,Alles schick
5,Alles passend!
5,Fantástico protector. Muy efectivo y fácil de colocar. Se adapta a la perfección al Iphone 11 y va de maravilla con la carcasa puesta. Estupenda relación calidad-precio. Totalmente recomendable.
5,Amazing purchase!Really happy about it !
5,Ottima
5,Installation facile je vous recommande cette protection
5,Beschützt die abstehende Kamera.Sehr zu empfehlen für das iPhone 11 sowie iPhone 11 Pro
3,Ottima protezione ed adesione purtroppo però influisce sulle foto con il flash come da allegati
5,Ne avevo già provati altri questo invece è più resistente assolutamente resistente all’acqua ( ci ho fatto il bagno al mare) e aderisce perfettamente alla fotocamera del telefono
5,The product is really good.No edges and gaps.It fits perfect with my phone cover.
5,Nach 4 Wochen kann ich mich den hier positiven Bewertungen anschließen. Keine Trübung beim Fotografieren. Bin zufrieden
5,Protege bien la cámara y no se empaña ni nada por el estilo vamos que las fotografías salen perfectas
5,excelente nos indica un video para su instalación  facil y rapida. Lo recomiendo calidad precio y facilidad
5,Comperato per il mio iPhone 11 arrivato nei tempi previsti e con confezione in ottimo stato. Facile da mettere aderisce abbastanza bene e non inficia la funzionalità della camera. Ottimo rapporto Qualità/Prezzo. Lo consiglio
5,Ha llegado antes de lo previsto. La colocación ha sido super fácil y a simple vista veo que no afecta a la calidad de la cámara. Muy satisfecha.
1,Only one of protectors fitted (holes misaligned) so only 1 star otherwise everything ok.
5,Semplicissimo da installare. Protezione fotocamera garantita
5,Super
1,Non mi è piaciuto perché non calza alla perfezione non è tagliata come si deve
5,Good Protection
5,Me ha encantado ajusta perfecto a las cámaras sin que pierdas resolución agujero en la zona del flash para evitar que se refleje. Ahora tengo las lentes protegidas de cualquier golpe
2,Apprezzo il tentativo non so se si possa fare di meglio ma nelle foto il filtro del vetro si nota sono decisamente meno nitide. Una volta tolta la protezione (era rimasta una bollicina sotto che non andava via) non è stato possibile rimetterla perchè il cerchietto nero intorno al flash è saltato via. Usata la seconda protezione.
5,Excellent
5,Gerne wieder hält was es verspricht. Top Produkt !
5,Erfüllt seinen Zweck und fällt kaum auf:)
5,Prodotto veramente eccezionale.... a dir poco eccellente.... protegge a acqua e qualsiasi tipo di urti la tua fotocamera.... super consigliato !!!!!
5,Super Verpackung. Bis jetzt tolles Produkt.
5,Guter Schutz sehr zu empfehlen
5,Rien à dire le produit est top
5,Perfekt für die Kamera
5,Muy buen producto!
1,No coincide el tamaño de cada agujero con la cámara. Si encajo las cámaras el flash no queda bien ajustado y viceversa.
1,Trotz sorgfältiger Handhabung ist die Folie schon nach einem Tag gebrochen und schützt die Kamera nicht mehr. Mir wurde das Geld unverzüglich von Amazon erstattet was super war. Leider kann ich das Produkt so nicht nutzen.
1,An sich eine super Sache um die Kamera zu schützen. Allerdings hat man sehr schlechte Bilder wenn man den Blitz verwendet und wenn das Glas bricht bekommt man die ganze Folie extrem schlecht ab und wenn dann nur in kleinen splittern.
5,Non ho notato differenza della lente prima e dopo aver applicato la protezione. Inoltre la confezione è arrivata con un sacco di accessori per il fissaggio e la pulizia!
5,Sono di un vetro resistente facile da applicare su fotocamera
5,Schnelle Lieferung gute Verpackung und großzügiger Inhalt hervorragende Videoanleitung online Montage ohne Probleme - klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,Perfecto de instalar y buena calidad
5,Perfect product- will buy this brand for sure again !!!

5,Alles super
5,super ! installation tres simple et efficasse
5,Cada perfecto y estoy tranquila ya que protege las lentes de roturas
5,É un ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La pellicola presenta delle bordature nere (non specificate nella descrizione del prodotto) attorno al foro per le fotocamere... che per un iphone bianco lo fanno sembrare un telefono non originaleRESO!
5,Me a gustado mucho la facilidad de montar el protector y no pierde calidad de las fotos y videos
5,Muy buen producto. Protege la camara y las fotos se ven bien
5,Parfait

5,Prodotto ben fatto.È il terzo kit che acquisto...Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo!Facile da istallare!
1,Geht zurück! der Blitz strahlt da in das Plastikteil rein…Foto mit Blitz und mit dem Schutz und ohne…
5,Soddisfatta a pieno del prodottoArrivata il giorno dopoApplicata in pochi secondi
5,Ottimo prodotto per proteggere il gruppo ottico di iPhone 11. Semplice da applicare. Due protezioni nella confezione.
5,Se ve bien y para proteger la cámara creo que cumple su función lo q más me preocupaba era el uso del flash y no molesta para nada..
5,Ottima qualità facile istallazione e si adatta bene alla custodia
1,Purtroppo decisamente al di sotto delle aspettative. Quando utilizzi il flash la lente protettiva  diventa inutilizzabile e perde tutto Ila sua utilità . Sconsiglio vivamente non si possono spendere 10 € per una autentica fregatura!!!Tra l’altro nelle foto e nelle descrizione di questo non viene parlato quando sarebbe opportuno avvisare il cliente delle pecche rapportate alle aspettative.Il peggior acquisto che potessi fare.
5,Misura perfetta facile da applicare durevole nel tempo. Prezzo molto accessibile per il prodotto
2,No me han gustado se despegan en días una la puse sin calor y no duro ni 5 minutos y la segunda aya la aplique con secador y se despegó. Por último las fotos con flash salen difuminadas.
5,Sehr gut Produkt überzeugt auf ganzer Linie
5,El producto es de muy buena calidad lo recomiendo. Protege todas las partes de las cameras
5,Sono veramente molto resistenti nn si notta quasi poco spesi però molto resistenti
5,Sehr gutes und schönes Produkt

5,Buen producto no afecta a la calidad de las fotos y protege totalmente la cámara. Siempre cogemos este producto

5,Top
5,Sehr gute Schutzhülle für die Kamera
5,Excelente
5,Encaja perfectament con la funda del mòbil no molesta para nada y en las fotos no canvia nada
2,Leider war das erste Schutzglas defekt und ist immer wieder abgefallen das zweite hält also zur Hälfte minderwertig.
1,Sieht super aus und für die ersten 10 std. hält es prima dann leider abgefallen an zwei Handys. Schade aber wieder mal Schrott gekauft. Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung!!!
5,Ottimo prodotto pellicola in vetro che si applica facilmente e perfettamente. Compatibile con le custodie non modifica la qualità delle foto.

2,Ok
5,Va muy bien
5,Gut und leicht anzubringen erfüllt seinen Zweck nichts zu beanstanden.
1,Las fotos con luz no se ven afectadas sin embargo a la hora de usar el flash las fotografías no merecen la pena.
5,Perfecto para el movil se acopla bien facil de ponerY el kit para ponerlo perfecto
2,Facile à installer mais fait perdre en qualité photo. Dommage.
5,Ottimo prodotto protegge molto bene la fotocamera la cover lo rende quasi trasparente
5,Protegge benissimo la fotocamera sporgente dell'iphone 11! Consigliata!
5,Perfetto si adatta benissimo all' Iphone 11
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Ci sono due pellicole all’interno e il kit per l’applicazione. Ve lo consiglio per proteggere le vostre fotocamere soprattutto per quelle un po’ più sporgenti
2,trop épais depasse de la coque vraiment très bof
5,Super
5,Aderisce praticamente da sola senza creare bolle e sopratutto non compromette la qualità delle foto sia con il flash che senza. Ottima la consiglio!
5,Molto comodo di facile applicazione.Buon rapporto qualità prezzo
2,Las fotos del móvil no salen igual. Se ven con brillo y no tiene la misma nitidez. Al final se lo he tenido que quitar. No lo recomiendo
5,Todo perfecto. Fácil de instalar y la calidad de la cámara no cambia veremos cuanto dura
5,Très bien !
5,Arrivato in un giorno ed in perfette condizioni. Sono rimasta sorpresa dai molti accessori dati insieme alla protezione. Facilissimo da inserire e perfetto per proteggere le fotocamere. Una vera chicca da avere!

5,Ottimo prodotto  lo consiglio
5,Bien
5,Excelente producto muy fácil de instalar y una protección inmejorable
5,ottimo prodotto.perfetto ed utile
1,In teoria è fatta bene giuste le dimensioni però non è vetro assolutamente è una plastica dura molto fragile dopo un mese neanche si crepa tutta da sola senza neanche essere mai caduta. Pessima insomma.
1,Le foto vengono malissimo! Ho richiesto il reso ma il corriere non ha ritirato ma è stato scritto alla mia email che devo essere io a consegnare il prodotto al centro DHL più vicino! Assurdo.Cattivo prodotto e cattivo trattamento.Sconsiglio.
5,Ottimo prodotto
5,Ok
1,Die Folie klebt nicht mehr. Es wurde auf der Folie draufgefasst. Man erkennt an dem Bild dass es nicht professionell behandelt wurde.
5,Genial me encanta recomendable
5,Super bien
5,L'applicazione è molto semplice e veloce e da una ottima resa ottica della camera fotografica. Sembra di non averer vetro di protezione.
5,Perfecto para cubrir la cámara del iPhone
5,Facile da installare si incastra a perfezione nella cover
5,Puntuali nella consegna di facile installazione grazie alle indicazioni del video guida suggerito ottimo prodotto per proteggere il tuo iPhone!
5,Queda perfecto
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
5,funziona ok
1,Nicht zu empfehlen. Nach nur drei Tagen war das Glas zersprungen ohne das mir das Smartphone herunter gefallen ist.
5,Es genial cómo se acopla. Estoy encantada.
5,spedizione velocissima e prodotto top la fotocamera non rischia brutti graffi!
1,No lo recomiendo a nadie. Las fotos con flash salen veladas. He seguido cuidadosamente las instrucciones del vídeo y lo he instalado correctamente pero no sirven. No volveré a comprar este artículo nunca más.
1,Leider bin von dem Produkt maßlos enttäuscht da es viele positive Bewertungen hier auf Amazon hat. Die Anbringung ist einfach und die Anleitung sehr hilfreich jedoch beeinträchtigt das Schutzglas den Blitz des Smartphones und die Ränder sind hell und verschwommen. Die Spiegelung des Schutzglases ist sehr deutlich auf den Bildern zu erkennen. Keine Kaufempfehlung!
5,Prodotto molto buono e facile da installare. Le foto non vengono compromesse. Ottimo acquisto
1,Says 2 in a pack and only received one. Could of brought 1 for a lot cheaper but I got this as I have two iPhone 11’s. Not happy.
1,Si presentava come un ottimo prodotto facilissimo da applicare e per niente fastidioso. L'unica pecca è che in modalità flash le foto venivano come sfocate perchè la luce riflessa nel vetro protettivo "accecava" la foto. Niente ho dovuto farne a meno peccato perchè sarebbe un ottimo prodotto altrimenti
1,Tutto ok facile da mettere senza alcun problema
5,Me ha encantado el producto muy facil de poner.
5,Ottimo prodotto veramente facile da installare. Lo consiglio
5,Prodotto validissimo e di facile applicazione. Utile per proteggere le fotocamere e la performance delle foto rimane invariata
5,Ottima protezione delle fotocamere per IPhone 11
5,Facile da montareVetro di buona qualitaFoto nitide e ottime
5,Tutto regolare comodo per far si che la fotocamera non si righi.
5,Prodotto come da descrizione molto semplice da installare e quasi invisibile. Ottimo spessore che con una cover classica di maschera benissimo.
5,Ottimo prodotto facile da installare completo di accessori per pulizia ed installazione. CONSIGLIATO
5,Prodotto molto facile da incollare e perfetto contro i graffi  urti . 👍👍👍
5,Pars proteger el Iphonr
1,Je n’aime pas ce produit trop épais et lorsque U on lave le contour avant de l installer  j ai attendu  et qq minutes plus tard il y a eu de la buéeJ’en’ ai donc enlevé
5,Perfetta in ogni cosa ottima
1,Sarà stata per mia incapacità nel montarle ma nonostante gli svariati tentativi non mi hanno assolutamente soddisfatto. Con una buona cover è inutile proteggere le lenti della fotocamera.
1,Se utilizzata senza flash sarebbe ottima ma con il flash risulta tutto il riflesso. L’ho tolta subito
1,Ce produit ne se fixe pas les côtés sont trop larges mon iPhone 11 est neuf de quelques jours et ça m’a abîmé l’appareil photo. Je suis très déçu et choqué que ce produit soit en vente sur Amazon. Un produit qui abime un téléphone aussi cher c’est honteux.
5,no se pierde nada la imagen
5,Molto utile avvolge alla perfezione le fotocamere del telefono.La consiglio!
5,Ottima e facile da applicare
5,Vetrino spesso e applicazione facile
5,Bastante bien
1,Das Glas ist zwar unscheinbar und nicht zu sehen aber auch nicht zu gebrauchen denn sobald ein Foto mit blitz geschossen wird ist das Bild unbrauchbar. Durch das Glas entsteht Streulicht und die Kamera ist nicht mehr zu gebrauchen.
1,Uno de los protectores roto el plástico o machacado y la caja machacada
5,Muy buena guia de instalación
5,Il prodotto è perfetto per proteggere le fotocamere di iPhone
2,Con el flash se ve borroso
1,Se casse beaucoup trop facilement je le déconseille vivement ....
5,Good product.
5,Buonissimo prodotto
1,Das was ich befürchtet habe ist eingetreten. Die Abdeckung ist so dick das die Fotoaufnahmen mit Blitzlicht nicht zu gebrauchen sind. Das Blitzlicht reflektiert zurück und es ensteht ein heller Nebel auf der Aufnahme. Für mich daher nicht brauchbar.
1,La pellicola in vetro è estremamente semplice da applicare il problema più grande però è quando si scatta una foto con il flash. In queste circostanze si vede un alone bianco intorno alla foto.
5,Muy bien
5,Ottimo per iPhone 11 perfetto
5,Qualita prezzo ottimo
1,Empêche la bonne utilisation du flash cela fait un reflet blanc sur la photo. J ai installé le deuxième et même problème en suivant à la lettre la notice d installation.
1,Voilà qd on met le flash pour prendre une photo article qui altère énormément la qualité des photos de mon iPhone 11. Et qui est n’est pas de bonne facture
5,Tutto perfetto! Niente da aggiungere
5,Tutto perfetto!!
5,iphone 11 prodotto top! facile da installare e resistente. super consigliato
5,Lo recomiendo.
1,Purtroppo la pellicola ricoperte anche le fotocamere di conseguenza le foto sono opache. Il flash inutilizzabile. Ho dovuto rimuoverla immediatamente
1,Leider kann man die Fotos mit Blitz vergessen. Dachte erst es liegt an dem Anbringen und habe deshalb die zweite Folie angebracht. Auch das hat jedoch nichts gebracht. Wirklich sehr schade
1,Das Produkt macht ja erst einen guten Eindruck. Kommt mit viel Verpackungsmüll daher naja. Das Teil passt gut jedoch sind beide Linsenschützer bei mir vom einfachen Ablegen des Telefons zersprungen. Geldverschwendung!
1,No lo compréis es un timo nada más ponerlo se ha caído una parte negra que va donde el flash que será para que no salga sombra y ya no ha manera de ponerlo. Las fotos con flash salen fatal. Muy DECEPCIONADO de este producto. 😠
1,Das Schutzglas ist durchgefallen hat sich 2mal einfach abgelöst und hat sehr unschöne Klebereste hinterlassen! Aber Amazon war so freundlich und hat mir das Geld erstattet!
5,Ottimo prodotto aderisce perfettamente e non ostacola la buona uscita delle foto...lo amo!
1,Awful quality. Lasted two minutes before cracks appeared waste of money
5,e molto bene
5,Prodotto per perfetto per iphone 11.
5,Ottimo prodotto
1,Schreckliche Umsetzung eines eigentlich gutem Produktes nach mehrmaligen erneuten anbringen des Schutzes gab es immer wieder Probleme bei Fotos mit Blitz.Ich würde vom Kauf fernbleiben.
1,Ohne Blitz gut aber mit Blitz schlechtDas Loch für das Blinklicht ist nicht komplett lichtdicht. Daher wird Streulicht zur Kamera geführt und macht das Bild zu nichte.
5,È funzionale non presenta nessun difetto le foto sono perfette come se non ci fosse pellicola
1,Habe mir das Glas aufgrund der ganzen guten Bewertungen gekauft.Leider ist die echt schlecht. Es wurde alles nach Anleitung gemacht um trotzdem klebt das Glas nicht.
1,First lens does not stick very good low quality
1,Beim Blitz reflektiert er die Farbe des Handys wie bei mir (mein Handy ist Rot) und die Bilder  sind nicht scharf
1,Se me han roto los dos protectores en cuestión de una hora cada uno y cuando los he ido a quitar han cedido a la primera por lo que evidencia que el pegamento es muy ligero. Un timo total
1,Hinterlässt beim abziehen des Panzerglas einen Klebefilm um die Kamera.Nicht kaufen !!!!
1,Pessima fattura del prodotto nn compacia e quindi entra polvere
1,Eigentlich hat alles gut funktioniert aber als ich mein Case drum gemacht und wieder abgemacht habe ist das Panzerglas wieder abgegangen.
5,Buena compra
2,Se me ha despegado como puedo volver a pegarlo?
5,Perfecto
1,Non mi è piaciuto affatto perché  quando facevo le foto con il flash veniva tutto sfocato quindi non le uso.  Vorrei il risarcimento.
5,Muy buen producto y fácil de instalar
1,Aggiornamento in condizioni di mancanza totale di luce il flash risalta nella fotocamera facendo venire le foto pessime...peccato! La lente aderisce perfettamente alla scocca della fotocameraBasta 5 minuti di calma per installarla! utile la videoguida di montaggio
1,Facile L’ istallazione  ma una volta messo si è rotto sull angolo dopo un’ ora. Per quello che costano credevo fossero di qualità migliore. Non lo consiglio
1,Il prodotto è arrivato puntuale ma la confezione era aperta e un vetrino era rovinato. Devo rispedirlo indietro
5,Perfetto! Proprio quello che mi serviva! Aderenza top!
5,Prodotto valido
1,Keine 24 stunden drauf und schohn kapput. Und nein ich hab da handy nicht fallen lassen
5,Semplice da applicare e resistente
1,Nach dem ersten Sturz geht die Hülle sofort kaputt.
1,Facile à installer mais absolument aucune résistanceSi votre tel tombe de 40cm l’écran explose.Très chère pour ce que c’est
5,Semplice da installare e sembra non alterare in nessun modo la fotografia
5,Me ha encantado. Se ajusta perfectamente
5,OttimoProdotto  facile da installare !! Top
1,Trotz des schwarzen Blitzrings werden die Bilder mit Blitz milchig weiß.Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung.
1,Mal. El protector bien y tal. Pero a la hora de hacer fotos nocturnas con Flash no cumple el efecto que promete. Para ejemplo una foto. Lo he tenido que tirar a la basura
1,Not at all recommend
5,Ottimo
1,Produit pas conforme du faite que quand vous installez le filtre sur les caméras les photos sont floues donc j’ai du retirer cette protection des caméras de mon iPhone 11
5,Perfettamente aderente anche con cover!
1,Das glas ist müll. Jetzt sind spiegelungen im bild die waren vorher nicht da.
1,Il prodotto non è idoneo alla descrizione è arrivata la pellicola per la fotocamera di un iPhone 11 Pro anziché iPhone 11. Essendo completamente differenti non ho potuto adattarla.
5,Ottimo prodotto e facile da installare
5,Producto maravilloso
5,Fácil instalación
5,Molto facile da applicare ottimo direi
1,Je viens de le recevoir et à ma grande surprise il y a tout dans la boite sauf la dite protection du coup ça ne me sert à rien
1,Viel heiße Luft um ein kleines Stück ohne Nutzen.  Besser nicht kaufen!!
5,Ottimo acquisto molto facile da installare
1,Keine gute Qualität. Ist nach kurzer Zeit gebrochen.
1,Mauvaise qualité s’est cassé à la première chute.. je ne le conseille pas
1,Protegge le fotocamere Dell iPhone 11La qualità delle foto non è disturbata ma si stacca spesso anche facendo attenzione.Un caso che non l'abbia ancora persa.
1,Ho acquistato il prodotto ben due volte spendendo tra l’altro un botto!.. risulta molto scadente in quanto si graffia e rompe facilmente! Sono stufa di dover sempre cambiarlo!
5,Completamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto. Facilissimo da installare.
5,Ottimo sia prodotto che consegna
1,Ist zu schnell gebrochen
5,Ottimo prodotto si adatta perfettamente su iPhone 11
1,L'écran est facile à installer mais la qualité des photos est altérée lors de l'utilisation du flash (présence d'un voile blanc).
5,Tutto perfetto come da descrizione
5,Ottimo prodotto così  come da descrizione.
5,Ottimo prodotto
1,No funciona con las fotos con flashSolo sale un destello blanco¿Para que quiero proteger una cámara que no puedo usar?Muy disgustada
1,1 des deux protections et arrivé rayé !!!!Puis ne fonctionne pas correctement avec le flashAltère légèrement la qualité photo
1,Es klebte null. Hat nicht das gemacht was er sollte.
1,Fotos werden bei Verwendung des Blitzlichtes sehr unscharf und milchig.
1,Al abrirla venia rota y claro mi hijo la tiro a la basura sin mas “con 7 años el no se queria cortar”
1,Vraiment inutile même pas une semaine casser dans la poche et l’objectif de l’iPhone avec 🤬🤬
5,Ottimo
1,Hält bei mir iwie gar nicht.. fällt immer ab
1,Al hacer las fotos sale una sombra lo he tenido que quitar y tirar. No lo compréis. Adjunto foto y está probado en 2 móviles distintos.
1,J'ai acheté ce produit mais quand il est arrivé la boîte était vide!
1,Me duraron 3 semanas los dos .... como metas llaves en el bolso junto con el móvil se rompe enseguida ...
5,Prodotto perfetto! Molto facile da posizione sul telefono.
5,mi sembra che dia una protezione efficace
5,Fantastiche pellicole! Ricevute prima del previsto.
1,In 2 Tagen war schon kaputt
1,No comprar pierde toda la calidad cuando empleas el flash ahí podéis ver ladoferencia entre una toto con el protector y sin él. Pésimo producto.
1,Purtroppo è arrivato in frantumi. Confezione esterna intatta perfettamente ma il prodotto al suo interno era danneggiato. Peccato

1,Nach 2 Wochen bereits kaputt
5,Si adatta bene ed é facile da installare
5,Facilissimo da applicare prodotto di qualità ottimo acquisto

5,Pellicole ottimeConsigliate
1,No sirve para hacer fotos con flash.
1,Se ha caído al segundo día
5,Molto buono
5,Ottimo
5,Ottima
2,I am not happy with the type of product more than the item per se. As soon as you unpack it dust gets trapped on the glue. The glue is insufficiently sticky to keep it firmly in place when the phone is also dressed in a case. Finally the glass seems to be a fingerprint magnet - way more than the lenses. I would not recommend buying these types of products - your iPhone cameras will be fine so long as you have a case on your phone.
5,Rien a dire  il est parfait !
5,Livraison 2 jours  produits comme l’indication. Très facile à installer . Merci Amazon
5,Easy to install
1,I put one on my phone. It was super clear and seemed solid. It broke from just being in my pocket with my car keys. No harsh use or anything. This product is not durable at all. I read the reviews that mentioned that it wasn’t durable but figured that people just abused their phones. Nopethis product sucks!
5,Très bien emballé et Facile à installer.
1,It’s seemed good at first then noticed when recording video in flash it became very bad quality with the light affecting the video quality. I wasn’t gonna write a review either but just noticed it cracked in less than 48 hrs I’ll put the second one on.
5,Not only will this protect the lens it also styles up your iPhone! It just looks better. They did an excellent job.
5,Parfait pour utiliser sur la construction
5,Einfache Montage
5,Went on like nothing solid and durable so far after 2 months ish
5,Affordable and easy to put on
1,Nach langen Diskussionen mit dem Unternehmen habe ich immer noch kein Ersatz für meine zerkratzten Linsen bekommen. Traurig.Sie kamen beider zerkratzt an und lösen sich ständig von der Kamera ab.Ich kann es nicht empfehlen!
