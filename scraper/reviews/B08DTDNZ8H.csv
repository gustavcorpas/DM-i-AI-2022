4,I needed this to have in the kitchen so that I can read my recipes on my phone. And it does what I needed to do. Now if I can get my cats to stop chewing on it that would be great. 😹 I haven’t traveled lately to test it out; therefore I cannot rate travel.
5,It works well. Four bendy legs and a bendy neck. Hold up pretty well so far. Haven’t tried it as a mountain the car yet.
5,It's a phone holder for phones with popsockets. My phone has a popsocket and it holds it. 5 stars.
5,Only lasted 1 year
5,Not bad it's very sturdy and flexible I was extremely surprised at how easy it is to bend and move it around but it's very sturdy.
5,Use it at home or in the car if you have a pop-socket on your phone. If you don't why not?
3,Bought this to help with video calls while I'm overseas. Really cool design but not strong enough for our heavier phones. (Kyocera Duraforce Pro 2) it just sags or falls over it doesn't hold its shape under the weight.It can prop at an angle if the phone is resting on something else but it will not hold the phone by itself.
5,This is a must have for travel. We use on airline to take baseball videos at our son's games outdoors indoors etc. We get so many compliments on this especially from flight attendants. Must have a pop socket to use
5,Man this kickstand is a clever contraption!  Used with a pop socket I can prop my phone for zoom calls FaceTime calls and watching Netflix videos in bed on my phone.
3,holds my iPhone pretty well but I have to adjust it often to prevent it from falling over from the weight of the phone. Over all it is worth buying.
4,If the feet/bottom weighed more you could angle your phone better but I still love it just gotta adjust some more
5,Used this with a PopSocket to make a stand for my new (2021) Kindle.  Worked great; very sturdy and perfect for hands-free reading. Some reviews had trouble supporting a larger item than a phone you just have to extend the legs back a bit and work with the angle.
4,As expected with item like this once you have changed its position a few times it started to lose its original form (twists in the metal aren’t so easily removed legs have a hard to making and keeping contact with table). But it works and honestly exceeded expectations. It holds up my phone adjusting for small amounts of motion is easy it doesn’t want to return to its original form if your trying to move it. It’s a good investment.\
5,This this is awesome! Enough said!
3,I think this is wonderful stand for temporary use…however after using this as my only stand for around a week it not only pulled off one pop socket but two. Ruining both pop sockets. I love being able to put this stand anywhere but it is not a long term solution
5,We're flying a couple times this year and one flight is going to be around 13 hours. I always have a hard time setting my phone up to watch videos. I'm looking forward to trying this out with my Storm Trooper pop socket!**Update 05/13/22**We flew to Arizona and I was able to use this twice. I had to get a bit creative in bending the legs on 2 different planes but I was able to watch movies on my phone without holding it or staring down at the tray table. This one is a keeper!
5,Very durable and sturdy.
5,personally i love this popmount! they are so usefull and besides they work with the popsocket which i also think is great and so easy to use. totally recomended!
4,I have an iphone 12 max pro and it is a very heavy phone. The stand holds it very well with some adjustments. It is very flexible but I find that if you manipulate it too much it's hard to reshape.
5,Love it.Like I say though I wouldn't trust this to hold a phone on bike handlebars (or similar wobbly application)
5,Perfect for what I need it for. Lightweight stand for watching movies or videos or perfect camera stand for those group pics.  Had absolutely no idea what this pop socket thing on the back of my phone was good for. So glad I found this stand.Using it for Samsung S21 Ultra.
5,I have a pop socket on my phone which I refuse to give up. I just bought a Cadillac and the front only has two cup holders. So now I have one on my steering and my phone downst slide out of it when I turn the wheel which is awesome and the other is in my truck on the phone cup holder  when I'm traveling for motocross. I would recommend this to anyone!!! There fun to plate you too in traffic haha
5,It’s a little like having Gumby hold your phone it’s great for watching videos and video calls
2,I purchased this item for 19.99 it was definitely not worth the money it is made well but it will not work with your cellphone sitting up like the picture says - your cellphone is too heavy and will tip over! I went pass the 30 days which was my fault! What a waste of $20! Good luck if you decide to buy!
4,Cumple con su función y versatilidad. Dependiendo del tamaño y peso del celular puede dificultarse su equilibrio. Obsolescencia programada una vez se rompa por fatiga ( de tanto doblarse) el alma metálica .
3,It's not a bad idea but it has a couple of issues. It ends up in being top heavy depending on where you're trying to set it which makes it easy for it to be knocked over. The material it's made out of does seem to attract hair and dirt which is really annoying if you have any pets that shed.
5,I really needed safe space for my phone in my gym because I spend way too much time during my workouts trying to find a safe place for my phone as I move equipment around between different exercises.  I end up dropping my phone about ten times a day.  I have a PopMirror PopSocket and I was reluctant to pick a mount because not all of the mounts fit the PopMirrors but I am sooooo glad I bought this.  I mounted it to my squat rack and now I have the perfect spot where my phone will stay safe but is also easy to see and access.  It is very strong and sturdy and very durable.  It is perfect!  BUY THIS!!!
5,So simple yet super handy. It can be positioned virtually anywhere. Great stand for reading recipes too.
5,Its pretty good you can adjust the height and everything you can even wear it like a bracelet.
5,I had my eye on this for awhile now. I’m always setting my phone propped up against something. I’ve tried other stands in the past but with my pop socket grip this is absolutely perfect! Everyone comments on it especially while on a FaceTime of Zoom meeting.
5,I absolutely love this lil stand. Although I ordered a pink one so I wouldnt loose it as easy im very satisfied with the black one and love the material this stand is made of. Even if u do not use a pop socket all the time you would enjoy this epic stand for your phone. Especially one in a diff case that may not work in others.Great value for under 20 bucks
5,This thing is pretty nifty. And sturdy. I used it to film while exercising. It did not bounce around.
5,I love this holder so much! With everything being from home these days I have to video call all the time. Other holders have a tray design that blocks the speakers and causes poor sound. With this the sound is great AND you can charge your phone at the same time. It’s perfect for watching tv too as it holds the phone in landscape position as well. I love the flexible legs for balancing because it makes it usable on any surface. It balanced on my bed just fine. Very happy with this purchase and I hesitated buying it for a while as I thought it was a bit expensive. I’m glad I got it!
5,It is just perfect with my phone  I can bend the 'legs' to whatever I need and it doesn't slide  It is absolutly perfect
5,This item is so cool and durable. I can do my zoom calls at work and watch my movies at home. Love this item.
5,Omg we use this all the time. Not even for our phone lol we use it as a bag holder when shopping or strolling out and about. I do use it as a phone holder to let me son watch cocomelon sometimes or to hold our phone for a quick family pic on timer mode. I think this is the best stroller accessory I have !
5,Love it
5,It is very useful if I am using my phone to play music while using my elliptical while out riding my bike and if I am sitting down in a virtual meeting.
5,Incredibly versatile and the tangerine color rocks!!!
5,I was looking for something that would let me read while I knit and otherwise hold my phone vertically. It’s also great for cooking (so you can see the recipe) and video calls. It takes a little fiddling to get it to sit upright especially if you have a heavier phone but is super simple to use. Love it!
5,Love this for zoom calls or for watching videos on my phone. Will be great for travel!!! Will use this to take pictures of myself and husband when out on trips will use Apple Watch as shutter remote. Lightweight well made sturdy!!! Love the color easy to see in my bag!
2,I bought this 9 months ago. I used it about once a week on average over that time and today the leg with the Pop Socket holder snapped rendering the whole thng useless.I understand that things don't last forever but I was gentle with beding and storage I didn't use it a lot and now... kaput fooder for the landfill. This makes me really sad.
5,Very durable and flexible for easy bending.
5,I LOVE this!  Have been looking for the right holder for my phone but frustrated the beloved pop socket doesn't work with most.  This is small but mighty.  Can adjust for countertop car lap and anywhere.  Holds securely.  Perfect for travel.  I came back for 3 more 2 days later but it is no longer available on Amazon.  Very upset and sad!!!
3,I was really hoping that this would work for me but in the end I couldn’t make it work. As others stated no matter how you position this it is lopsided and falls over easily. The legs were very difficult to bend. I much prefer my old gorilla pod’s style of legs. This product went straight back.
5,With my popsocket it's nearly impossible to find stands it's not even placed where a popsocket would normally go because I wanted to use the induction charging. This is the perfect solution for me. It does exactly what a stand is supposed to do.
5,We used this for my dad when he spent an extended period of time in the hospital. His phone was easy to access but out of the way and didn't get lost. He loved it.
5,Think this would work with any popsocket set up! I love it!
5,Holds up nicely. Surprisingly sturdy. You need to figure out the balance but once you do it works wonders. I can also put on the end of my guitar to look at notes while I play so that’s also very convenient
5,It's quite good at what it does. Other reviews do have a point the center of gravity can be something of an issue. I was able to find a stable position that didn't cause me any grief though.
5,This is an awesome product. It works as advertised and I have no complaints. In fact this is my second one (wife wanted her own lol)Awesome for the price!
2,I really wanted a small tripod or stand to use with my phone while hiking. Something I could set up and take down super fast. The ones that are spring loaded and clamp around the phone are good but they can be a huge pain to take on and off. I kept thinking something with a pop mount would be perfect so this really excited me! Unfortunately it’s super hard to get it to balance and hold the weight of the phone without falling over. I’ve managed it a few times but it always takes me long enough to balance it just right that it defeats the purpose since I’m looking for something quick. Bummer.
5,Great product. So great I ordered another one a few days later. One for home and one for work. Very flexible yet sturdy. Can turn your phone from portrait to landscape with one finger. Very customizable.
5,It’s sturdy and very useful. Originally bought one in black at bestbuy and my wife used it all the time so I got on Amazon and found it in pink for her and loves it even more!
5,What a GREAT Product? Great for selfies or live streaming a program on my phone. I am guessing I will find more uses as I get to work with my iPhone Pro Max.
3,It's not really able to balance my Note 10+ easily it  required more bending than expected to hold the phone straight. Probably works better for smaller phones. Overall it does the job but I will probably search for another option in the near future.
5,I use this to mount my iPhone in very tricky spots!It’s so adaptive.I’m buying a 2nd.This has been an indispensable tool to me in my daily life.
5,Does the job as intended with some minor adjustments. Worked well for my galaxy S20 plus.  Highly recommended if you have a pop socket. Good price and quick delivery.
2,I have a pixle 4a(5g) and the weight of it is too much for this to be used as a tripod. I specifically bought this to use in conjunction with my popsocket for zoom meetings and it just does not work in any position. My partner is an engineer and even he said that as a tripod this product is just not good.If you're buying it to wrap the arms around something small (but not too small) and sturdy it's probably a little better. But whatever you're wrapping it around better be goldilocks.It does attach to the popsocket REALLY well though. So there's that.
5,Perfect for the job I wanted it for. It will tip over if you don't adjust the center of gravity but that's easy to deal with.
1,If using as a tripod the phone makes it topple over.
5,I like this stand a lot. Granted you have a PopSocket this really is your best choice. I use mine for FaceTime calls.
5,Love it!
5,I like this so much that I bought 2.  One for work and one for home.
5,Finally! A phone stand that works! My PopSocket fits right in the slot and it’s easily adjustable - taller shorter hang it on things.I love it!
1,This is the most awkward phone holder I've ever seen .I don't even use mine. It tips over etc..
5,easily bendable but holds its shape well and works great for watching youtube videos and taking pictures
5,This stand is very sturdy.  Would recommend for anyone with a popsocket
1,The item itself looks like it’s decent quality but it does not fit the pop socket. It keeps falling off
2,The home will be too heavy in the holder so it will topple over more often than not!
3,It does hold a phone with a popsocket only issue is it is not weighted well enough to hold the phone on the front. Tips over without putting something on its legs.
5,Best thing ever! Buy it you won’t regret it.
5,Very sturdy when my phone is on it!  Fits IPhone 22 MAX perfectly!
5,
5,This is one of my favorite PopSocket accessories. It can be placed anywhere and is very sturdy.
5,I had no idea how great and useful this gadget it is.
3,Overall sturdy; however it's a bit tough to get in the shape I need.  Once in place though it holds the phone securely.
5,Works great with pop socket!
1,worked fine... until it didn't.  After a couple months of use the metal embedded in the mount snapped and is no longer functional.  Does not hold phone upright anymore.
5,Works perfectly with Popsockets. Very sturdy flexible and useful.
5,It’s very sturdy ! Great quality! I love it
5,Great product.
5,use as a tripod or for selfies
5,fun to use
5,👍🏻👍🏻
5,Love it
5,Stable while holding my phone.
5,Works great
5,Very functional. Good quality .
2,Wanted a stand in my desk but even with four legs it found a clumsy way of falling over.  Easy to bend the legs but it was like a giraffes on ice all spread out putting phone nearly on the table.. defeating the purpose.  Sent it back
2,didn't care for this stand.
1,This is misleading. At the top of the ad it says pop socket and mount. The only thing delivered  was the pop socket. Very unhappy with the advertising.
1,I really did you're so freaking cute. But you're not sturdy enough for an expensive larger iPhone. The legs and super bendy so bendy that I couldn't get them all to sit at the same angle for a standing tripod and the phone wobbled and toppled more than it stayed up. Maybe for a mini phone...
2,I wanted to like this but my phone is too heavy and it doesn’t hold up well 😔
1,I needed a stand for my phone and this is perfect. It’s flexible bendable and works only if you already have a pop socket on your phone or have a Pop Socket case as I do.
1,It doesn’t stand up without having to manipulate it just right. It does NOT hold up to the product’s description. Sadly I had really hoped it worked so I could carry it around with me.
1,you have to be a sculptor to use this. can't get it level with my phone actually attached. it tips over. it slides of things. the arm that hold sthbeohine is too long to use in landscape it doesn't allow the phone to be at angle. what can I say. I'd rather have my 15$
1,Don’t waste your money. Buy a phone tripod. This thing doesn’t hold most phones. It will topple backwards/over. The legs are impossible to shape evenly. You spend more time attempting in vain to set this up than you would using it for pictures/videos if it actually worked.
2,Not very stable.
1,doesn’t work
5,I have a VW and I find it hard to find popsocket mounts that actually work in my car. I had the dash mount and it lost its stickiness on the dash so I moved it to the windshield where it fell and broke amd the vent clip never held my phone.This little guy wraps around my stick shift and fits in the cup holder if needed. It works perfectly for what I was needing and it holds my samsung ultra 21 just fine. I also know I can use this to wrap around anything.
1,Not sturdy at all.
2,It works sometimes. It's pretty lightweight so when you put your phone on it it'll tip over in a lot of situations and defeat the purpose completely. I've honestly had better luck propping up my phone on a rock half the time. It's nice when you can wrap it around something but it doesn't even do that too well because the legs are short and stiff. I bring it with me when I travel anyway for the 30% of times that it works well but I wish there was a better option for pop sockets.
5,This little stand holds my pop socket securely and lets me view my phone in vertical orientation. I use it in the kitchen to more-easily read the recipes I store on my phone.
4,This is posable and sturdy (just have to pose it to account for the weight so it doesn’t tip).  It functions as I hoped. However this is a dust magnet. It’s the kind of silicone that attracts every fuzzy hair lint and dust speck. I only had it out of the package an hour and it was already covered. It still serves the purpose I was looking for a desk mount that doesn’t need to be stuck on with adhesive but I do wish the material was different.
5,I use this on my desk to hold my phone while it's charging or while I'm gaming so I can just look over and see that I got a notification or whatever. No complaints with this thing at all it's really handy and super adjustable.
3,This thing is actually really difficult to deal with if you’re just using it to prop up your phone really quick. Maybe if I wanted to wrap it around something it would be easier to deal with but just propping up the phone is annoying on this thing. However it does do the job. But I would not have spent $20 on this if I knew it was that difficult to deal with.
5,Flexible but strong.  Hold phone securely even to a pole.  Love this little invention!
5,Works well on the stroller!
5,WORKHORSE. These pop socket flex mount stands are genius. They are such a joy to work with. It's also a FIDGET. My hands love how they bend Which Ever Way I want them to. and the strength and feel of the perfect materials.  My phone is heavy (redmi note 8 pro) and weight isn't an issue because you can do whatever you want to with the angle of legs and/or neck! SCIENCE
3,The way the mount is in the picture doesn't hold a phone it's top heavy and will tip forward. I'm trying to figure out how to position it so it won't tip over one way or another so far it's at a pretty steep angle away from me. It's also difficult to use when it's in the mount because it's unstable. I think it would be useful if you had something to wrap it around.
5,My ‘71 Beetle doesn’t have a dash on which to suction a holder. This little cutie works just perfect wrapped around the dash handle! I love it!
5,I’m forever calling this thing Gumby… you’re welcome. It takes some time to balance it in certain positions but I love it on my desk when I’m working on my laptop. I’ve learned to bend the back “legs” down if my phone starts to tilt forward & pictured is the way I normally have it. I can put the phone on either side of the “claw” sitting it on the middle part or reversed where it’s free to use for FaceTime selfies etc. I have one of the “arms” bent up for landscape mode so my phone doesn’t tilt to the side since my PopSocket is askew. I hope this helps anyone whose trying to adjust it better. Highly recommend!
5,Primarily purchased as a portable mount and stand it's flexible enough to wrap around various things in my home gym making it perfect for displaying workout videos and timers as needed.
5,I highly recommend this product we got this for the shower so we can listen to music or watch a video while showering super ridged and holds up my 11 pro max and it can easily hold it up in tripod mode I might need to buy a few more of these!
5,I have a pop socket on my phone.  That has made using tripods or selfie sticks almost impossible.  This gadget was the solution.  It is everything they advertised.  I am very pleased.
5,So handy to hold your cellphone
5,I have a popsocket and a habit of propping my phone up on a soft surface.... now that I have this.... oh my... 😍😍😍 life changing!
5,Arrived on time. Works great for a zoom meeting with the doctor
5,This is exactly what I needed for my computer desk so that my phone wasn't on it's side. With the legs bended like it is in the pictures shown here it holds up my iPhone XR with no problems at all. I however do not have the extenstion where the popsocket goes into staying straight up. I have it bended a couple of times to where I like it. I also love the pink color of it.
5,good little thing to use. sturdy and you can put it anywhere
5,It is the greatest product for holding a phone with a PopSocket. It’s sturdy durable I travel with it Bend it like crazy. It’s a solid solution for all your problems.
5,this is kindof handy you have to bend the legs just right for your phone not to tip it over. also I'm glad it isnt fragile bc it was absolutely crushed when it arrived in one of the white "padded" amazon envelopes
5,I really like this it's very flexible i use it lot I would definitely get another one I take a biking
2,Definitely not strong enough to hold my phone (galaxy note 10) in ANY position and I really expected more from popsockets brand. Usually they're stuff is quality despite being overpriced. But in this case it's just severely overpriced.
5,Exactly what I wanted!
4,The stand is brilliant. It does what it is told. It's like a little rubber action man. With this and the expandable pop socket it's a no-brainer. It's like the drink martini it will go anywhere anytime anyplace. My phone feels very secure in this specially when you clamp the pop socket at the back it's sort of locks it.This should've been called the action stand
5,Muy útil producto.
5,J’adore
5,Funciona muy bien.
4,Sympa. Je n'arrive pas a trouver un pied pour mon portable qui soit stable mon Samsung S20 FE est toujours trop lourd et mon pied bascule.Ici je pense enfin avoir trouvé mon bonheur combiné au popgrip que j'ai acheté dans la même marque. Le seul soucis que je rencontre est que mon popgrip est positioné sur la partie du bas de mon portable (plus pratique à mes yeux) mais de ce fait c'est compliqué de le faire tenir horizontale voir impossible du coup... mais verticale il tient parfaitement. Je l'ai testé que en pied classique posé sur table mais pas encore en l' accrochant sur un support. Faudra que je teste pour voir si ça fonctionne mieux pour le mettre horizontale... J'espère que mon commentaire vous aidera 🙂.
3,Cvpas trop stable quand ont met le téléphone un peut déçu
5,I use a Pop Socket on my phone which in itself (unless you remove it) prevents you from using the ‘normal’ type of phone stands. I thought that I would try this and found it at a cheaper price on Amazon than elsewhere. I wondered if it would be gimmicky but it actually works well and makes it so much easier if you need to use your phone for Teams meetings or when using FaceTime. So far I have only used as a free-standing mount. I also have the car mount - which also works well.
2,The product tips easily doesn’t hold the phone steady. It requires a lot of manipulation to move this around. It’s a good idea but it needs more weight to hold the phone even without my case it isn’t steady. Very awkward.
5,This thing is great! I just use it to stand my phone up so I can watch it while laying down. Very sturdy.
5,I have enjoyed using this to take photos without having to remove my case or popsocket! very flexible works well!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Für mich gut geeignet benutze ihn um meine YouTube Videos oder TikTok zu drehen da ich ihn überall hin mit nehmen kann. Er lässt sich super überall anbringen. Das ist mein zweiter meinen ersten habe ich im Urlaub verloren. Der war 1 Jahr alt ich liebe dieses Teil.
3,I bought this to attach it to an upright lamp unfortunately it’s made of a material that doesn’t bend to my requirements.I now use it a stand and it’s adequate.The stand is shipped flat so you bend the legs to the desired shape and pop your phones pop socket into the holder. The stand is not very sturdy because the metal is just a little too bendy which causes the shape of the stand to change when inserting and removing your phone.It’s made from steel covered in a thick silicone rubber that makes it easy to clean.I award three ⭐️⭐️⭐️Happy shopping
5,Best phone holder I have got so far I will not bother to look for another. Easy to use best grip on pop socket easy to move around to stand on any surface 4 legs make it sturdy and it is easly portable. Great flexibility. The 4 legs make it easy to wrap around awkward shape objects or surface areas. Best buy highly recommended.
4,Ich finde es super es ist zusammenfaltbar und kann so auch super mitgenommen werden.Nur das ausbalancieren bis es mit dem Handy die richtige Position hat ohne umzukippenkann etwas dauern aber alles super für einen guten Preis. :)
5,Très pratique.Multi positions robuste et antidérapant.Le téléphone adhère parfaitement à condition d'avoir un Popsocket sur son téléphone.Je suis satisfaite des produits Popsocket car très bonne qualité.Je recommande.
5,Does exactly what you want it to do. Idle for any budding tik tok dancers
5,Good quality
5,Super fait son taf
5,Very nice and versatile tripod! Phone stays put even if the tripod is upside down!
1,Muy mono pero la culpa es mía porque creía que quizás habían variado el peso de la parte que sujete al móvil con las “patas” pero no existe una cosa que se llama gravedad y es por lo tanto un gadget inútil
4,I read a bunch of reviews where people said that it's wobbly & doesn't work. Yes it can be wobbly if you don't get the centre of gravity set correctly. I often bend the PopSocket holder back over the middle circle to get it to sit more stable. I love that it can be folded flat to fit in my knapsack to take wherever I go. It's a great tool when I need an extra pair of hands to hold my phone. Haven't tried wrapping it around something but I'm sure that if you took the time to find the most stable position that it would work great then as well.
4,Muy bueno pero para mi Samsung note 10 + no sirvió porque el teléfono pesa demasiado y le gana el peso y se cae. Sin embargo en otros dispositivos menos grandes si funcionó.
5,A little front heavy with larger phones (S20FE) but you definitely can bend the legs to make it work!The popsocket fits nice and snug I don't feel like my phone is going to turn or fall out.Works awesome to mount your phone up the legs wrap around pretty much anything and are very strong.Definitely recommend!
5,Perfect! Exactly what I needed
5,Really handy little tripod for watching videos recording movies and putting your phone in all sorts of tricky angles
5,Item exactly as described and was shipped very quickly; does exactly what we wanted.
5,Seems to be able to hook on to the popsocket as advertised - very cool!
4,I really like it so far now that I have a pop socket. I am still getting to know it and find out what other functions it might have
2,Llegó en mal estado
