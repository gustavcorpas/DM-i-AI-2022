4,The portability of this speaker made me write this review! You can take this speaker and have your music movie or podcast sound great anywhere! I like the very visible control buttons in contrast to the black color scheme. The sound of this small speaker is awesome and its loud! I mean the clarity is great particularly on vocal and higher frequencies. The bass is not as boomy but what do you expect from a speaker this size? The sound however is well balanced even at louder volume.Overall the speaker is well built and feels really solid! Well worth the investment no wonder it was one if the Tik-tok's top rated bluetooth speakers in this price category. I would highly recommend this product for the price!
5,I use it in my garage all the time. Get the music from my phone and much easier than loading up old CDs. Also use it when just chillin on the patio. Relaxing.
5,They pair instantly and give great sound for the value. Perfect for riding around in your personal golf cart or taking with you on your weekend round. Battery life is what they say it is slightly reduced with a pair
5,I purchases two speakers in different colors. It has been a blast to have them set up in different rooms of the house. I was able to pair them from more than twenty feet and two rooms away! They look great sound better and are WATERPROOF!! I love the carabiner so that I can take it with me on my water adventures too - I have a stand up Paddle board and being able to attach this is great. Super feature for hanging on backpacks hammocks tents etcPacks a great sound!!
4,Product arrived several days early. Bass is not very pronounced at less than 3/4 volume. Charges slow but not substandard. Came with locking crampon and cable (plus for me). Treble is extremely clear even with heavy bass. Great first impression
5,One of my best purchase from Amazon. The sound is clear with great loud volume & it's water resistant. It's my summertime beach company. I highly recommend üíØ
5,We have one of these speakers at my work place and we love it so when I saw it was on sale I snapped it up! My previous bluetooth speaker would only last a couple hours before losing power. This one plays all day without recharging and sounds great too. Highly recommend ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
5,Really great quality speaker with ample enough sound and bass. Is it going to shake the walls of course not but for its size the output is really great! We use it anytime we are outside and it is very light and mobile.
4,Good product What I dislike about it I thought the volume would be louder.I use it for working out and just to listen to music.
4,The sound of this speaker was surprisingly good for the price. I would give it 5 stars if it supported 2 Bluetooth connections.
4,I wish it had a visible display for on/off.
5,I was thrilled with this little speaker. I purchased  this to take on our vacation to the beach. The quality of the sound the range of volume the battery life and the size are all awesome! It also comes with a carabiner clip so you can clip it to a strap.I highly recommend this purchase.
5,Great product good sound
4,It‚Äôs a bit on the lower side for outside but it works good.
4,Good for me when I do yard work and side jobs
4,Cute little speaker for the price probably would of returned if it wasn‚Äôt for the price
5,Arrived on time and after charging works just fine. I wanted a small outside speaker and this fit the bill nicely.
5,Bought this for at work and at full volume it‚Äôs last a whole 10 hr shift without charging I‚Äôve also dropped it a number of times and nothing broke
5,I‚Äôve had this little nugget to take on small trips or get ready. It‚Äôs super cute and super loud!
5,this is perfect little speaker for both inside and out. it‚Äôs basically a wonder boom speaker for 75% less money. i wish i had ordered two. very happy with my purchase
4,Sufficient but not spectacular. It is a small speaker so don‚Äôt expect much. It‚Äôs portable and convenient to carry. Make sure to charge speaker often.
4,I liked it so well I bought more of them. Great price on Prime day!
5,Good portable speaker good size!!!
4,Pens√© que sonaba m√°s fuerte
4,Great sounding speaker pretty loud. However I only bought these speakers to interconnect them and they will not connect. One speaker says M7 and the other says M7 plus the manufacturer has a note on their page that says this is due to an update and to reach out to them. I reached out today will update this review once they respond.Update: it was a little difficult getting in touch with the seller. Amazon reps were very helpful& walked me through how to get over to the seller. I was sent a replacement and the new one interconnects. Great surround sound
4,Really works well for regular use haven‚Äôt experienced any problems with it yet. Really good for the price. Only minor problem is the Uncomfortableness of the on button and all the volume buttons but that‚Äôs really just nit picking. Really good speaker all in all tho.
4,I swear when I first turned the speaker on and paired it it was much louder than itI will go currently.  Seems like it may have synced up to the limited volume control on my tablet and will not go louder. I have tried unpairing and resetting the speaker but doesn't make a difference.  Also though it is in a cylindrical shape there is a "front" where most of the music eminates from right where the control buttons are located.
5,Me gusta mucho el sonido sobre todo la calidad del bajo
5,Connected easily and love how portable it is.  Sound is good also.  I like the way I can also turn the volume up and down from my phone.
5,I love this little speaker it has a great sound. Not sure about the battery life because I‚Äôve been charging it after an hour or two of use. Was considering returning this if I didn‚Äôt like it because the mini Jbl speaker just went on sale right after I bought this but I like it so much I‚Äôm keeping it
4,Have not used it yet but tried it out and so far so good
5,I bought this speaker as a gift for a friend for her office. She has really enjoyed it and she said the sound is perfect. But about 6 weeks after using it it started making a bleeping sound every few seconds. I went back and looked at reviews and seen someone had given it a one star rating for the same reason. I contacted Amazon Customer Service who helped me get in contact with the seller. The seller responded the same day I emailed them and explained that sound was a signal the charge was low. I asked my friend had she charged it and she said no not since she received it which was Christmas! She charged it and it the bleeping has stopped and she is enjoying her music again! So this is also a testimony  of the charge life for the little speaker with a great sound!!  When I am in need for another small speaker again I will definitely purchase this one again!
5,Own 2 Bose but wanted a cheap knock around and this does the trick. üëçüèºüëçüèº
3,Sound volume is sorely lacking.
4,I tried replacing another portable speaker so it could be used at an outdoor movie theater.  However I didn't read the description correctly because there is no radio capability to this model in order to connect to the AM/FM station to tune into the movie.
4,Just I wish it was 360 and more bass and louder
3,I would have added 5 stars for what this speaker can do but it fell short in 2 MAJOR ways.1. the advertised waterproofing is IPX7 when in reality it is IPX6. This is a deal-breaker for me as I needed it for kayaking (which is what I searched for when this was recommended).2. It is NOT a 360 degree speaker (despite the claim and shape) which was also intentional in my purchase.If those two things don't impact you I recommend this little speaker for the price.
5,We use them inside doing yard work and on patio while relaxing.  Battery life has never failed us!  Priced right for purchasing 2 for great surround sound!
5,Perfect for someone on a budget. Great sounds quality however it was much lower sound quality (YouTube) vs. iTunes was very clear loud but still puts out to be so little. Clip is heavy duty and made sturdy. Battery hasn't needed charged yet we used it all day in pool.
3,Could be louder. But still a nice little speaker.
5,I was looking for a speaker to use for listening to audiobooks since the volume on my tablet wasn‚Äôt loud enough.  I tried a bunch of speakers ‚Äî name brand and brands I‚Äôd never heard of.  My only requirements were bluetooth 5.0 and lightweight with good battery life.  This speaker has ended up being the best of all the speakers I tried.  It has better range than any other speakers even the ones rated at 100 ft.  The battery lasts longer than the other small speakers I tried and it connects easily and stays connected reliably.  I have an Anker speaker that I liked better because of the size and buttons but it kept crashing with the library app I was using to listen to audiobooks; it seems like an app problem but it only seems to happen with the Anker speaker.  Considering this and the fact that I got this speaker on sale for half the price of the Anker this speaker is my go to speaker.  I don‚Äôt use it for music and even if I did I‚Äôm not picky about bass etc. ‚Äî I‚Äôm perfectly happy listening to the radio or using my Echo Dot for Pandora so I don‚Äôt know what audiophiles would think about this speaker.  I was hesitant to purchase a brand I had never heard of but so far so good; only time will tell if it has long term reliability.
4,Great little speaker ..
5,I wanted a small speaker to use with my lap top for travel.  This speaker packs easily.  Not heavy.  sound quality is good for my purposes.  I'm now using it with my computer.  Easy to set up and pair with my devices.
3,I was very excited about getting this speaker it was just for me to take to the pool yo listen to my music. After reading some of the  reviews they said the volume was very good I can hardly hear my music. So I‚Äôm disappointed in my purchase
4,We bought this to use on the go. It‚Äôs perfect size and seems to have decent sound. Wish it had more bass to it. Can‚Äôt beat the price for what you get. The battery life is great!
5,Really good sound - I use my desktop for Pandora and USB stick music on my sundeck  Frees up my phone and has enormously better sound quality.  GREAT value!
5,I've noticed a lot of people complaining about things like sound quality and I can't say I really agree. This is no Sony speaker or Sennheiser quality sound system but the audio isn't bad its just.. Mediocre. I haven't noticed any tinny sounds crackling popping etc that would be indicative of a bad speaker or really bad sound quality.All of the music I've played sounds pretty good through it and considering I only paid about 30 dollars I'm impressed. I would say the quality is honestly only slightly worse than JBL but I would hope the quality on a speaker that costs over 100 dollars retail would be better than a 30 dollar speaker. Out of all of the music I tested it with I would say bass and mid heavy music probably fairs the worst but it's still not bad.It's a very sturdy little device easy to connect to and it comes with a really solid carabiner for clipping it to a belt loop or something of the like. I'm looking forward to testing it out more this summer!
4,It's great and chic just wish it was louder
5,This is one of the best speakers I've ever purchased can take it anywhere you want lightweight comfortable did start working after 2 years
4,Wanted this for work and afraid of it being stolen so didn't want to pay too much.  This speaker does not enough bass that I was hoping for.  You get what you pay for.
4,I like everything about the product
4,This speaker is a pretty no frills little speaker. Sounds good and gets pretty LOUD! What else could you want in a budget speaker?
3,Good clear audio. Better indoors a little weak for outdoors
3,It‚Äôs not loud. I had high expectations and I‚Äôm just disappointed.
5,I have a wonderboom which is great.  But my son kept swiping it. So i was looking for options and came upon this speaker.  Great price point for about the same performance.
4,My friends son snagged hers and she was asking my advice on buying a new Bluetooth speaker. I saw this on lightning sale and decided to get it for her birthday and got her feedback on it.Primarily she wanted to use it but listen to audiobooks in her car. She said it sounds great in the car but not that loud and wouldn't use it at a bigger birthday party or anything. She gave the sound quality and 8 out of 10. Battery life is good so far but that's to be expected if that changes I will update my review down the road.
5,I love this speaker. It sounds great. It is perfect to carry on when gardening.
5,Small portable and great sound.
5,Very nice
5,I wanted louder and this portable speaker gave it to me. I‚Äôm able to listen to my audio books while I shower now
5,Love the sound!!!!
5,pequeno satisfecho por lo que pague  lo uso en mi trabajo
5,Battery life great sound quality great very portable and definitely waterproof.  Took it to the beach and it was perfect.  Highly recommend
5,He loves listening to his music in the shower.
4,A coworker has a very similar (physically identical) Bluetooth speaker that sounds amazing and puts out a ton of bass.  I bought this one not realizing it's a different brand than my coworkers.  This one lacks the kind of clarity and bass but makes up for excellent battery life and the ability to sync multiple units together for surround or true stereo playback whereas the coworkers is a bit older and does not support this feature.
5,It‚Äôs great! Decent sounds and the battery lasts forever! Brought it on vacation with us and used it daily and it was great! Only charged it once but only because I couldn‚Äôt believe it was still going strong it wasn‚Äôt dead yet lol
4,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Good sound quality portable decent battery life easy to stream music/ Bluetooth connection. I got it so she and her friends could listen to music while riding the bus for away games.
5,Easy to pair with iPhone. Clear quality sound with convenient portability. Use in the kitchen & any room I‚Äôm working in & also will bring along to the pool & beach! Like this little speaker. Will gift to my grandkids too!
5,Used this thing for hours and days then winter came and I didn‚Äôt use it for 4 months just to turn it on and use it for hours again without even charging it you can probably go a month without charging it and it‚Äôs loud and the sound is clear and crisp can‚Äôt go wrong for the price.
3,Speakers sound great but one problem I'm having is it drops off the sound. Speakers still on but no sound. Restart speakers  sounds is back happens frequently
5,The sound quality is super awesome oh it's not one of those super super dinky ones but it's still sticking small and the sound quality did I mention like genuinely actually good.
3,If they inserted a better tweeter this speaker would be perfect
5,La calidad es buena la duraci√≥n se la bater√≠a es perfecta el sonido quiza no es √±a potencia con lo que me imagine pero suena bastante bien .
5,Bought 2 for our nightstands to listen to our nighttime apps in surround sound so perfect !
2,Brought the speaker portable speaker thinking that it was going to be loud but very disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt although the rain didn‚Äôt interfere at all nor the  length of the speaker time was great. My complaint was that it wasn‚Äôt as loud as I thought.
4,The only thing that I don't like does not have a mic if you want to connect to the cell phone you can not speak through it!
3,The media could not be loaded.
3,Needs improvement.  Not a good sound and expensive for the service.
5,Huge difference having a wireless speaker for my phone. Great sound. I was going to buy a Bose wireless speaker but saw this and read reviews about the next one up. The price was right. I am glad that I bought it. Rock on! lol
3,Not as loud as I thought it would be  but battery life is great last me all day on a full charge
5,Perfect size great sound for audiobooks music etc. Very satisfied!
5,I didn't know what I was missing.These little BlueTooth speakers are marvelous.It takes a little time to understand how to use them because like a lot of items nowadays the documentation is HORRIBLE.But once you figure them out you'll be taking them with you when you're doing chores and projects.And if you like audio books well these puppies can follow you around where ever you go.I purchased two of them and my cell phone switches from one to the other without aggravation....just turn one off and turn the other on.
3,Dicen que dura 24 horas pero no es as√≠ y no dice cuando est√° cargada completamente
5,My wife had purchased this speaker for the size and double pairing is the main reason she selected this speaker.My son has another brand speaker from the best electronics brick and mortar store that she would borrow.  She had bought this speaker so she could have her own to use. The speaker sounds just as good my sons more expensive brand. She was able to buy this cheaper then his and it‚Äôs prettier and sounds better!This came charged so she was able to listen to it immediately. The sound is great the buttons are large and this is the perfect speaker for next to hot tub for splash proof function.  If you are looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker you should consider this speaker.
5,Once you let the speaker batieres charge when you first get them wow do they last! I especially like how you are able to purchase another one and pair both Bluetooth speakers definitely helps with a surround sound effect and could be helpful at parties as well! The sound quality is nice and there is no delay between the speakers they are synced perfectly! Highly recommend
5,This is by far the best!  Its so loud. Second purchase of the same. I bought this for my husband and it got stolen. He's so in love with it  we purchase another one. It has that little hook thingy so you can attach it your backpack or pants belt.
3,Everything about this is average.  Its larger than I like.  Bass is blah.  Sound does go everywhere and it would be perfect for the campsite at dusk.  Far from a goose bump item.
4,Great little speaker. Sound is not amazing but it does the job. Used it for a water float. Wish it were just a little more clear and louder.
5,Thinking abt a second one for stereo sound. The person this was purchased for loves it
5,Todo bien
5,ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
5,Slightly smaller than the tube like speaker.  Great sound and good battery life.
5,I picked this little guy up to go on a 5hr family river float in texas and it got dunked in the water multiple times with no issues at all. I also took it with me on a business trip for my hotel room and did a good job.  This isn't as powerful as some of my patio speakers but I didn't have that expectation due to the size.  Very happy with the waterproof feature and the sound is really good for its size.  It even pulls out some highs and lows that small speakers usually can't do.  I would recommend it to others and would purchase again.
4,Good but I wish it had a next button.... What's the point of a water proof speaker if I keep having to hit next on my not water proof phone
5,This was a gift for out teen daughter. We were all surprised by the sound quality and volume from such a small speaker. It‚Äôs small enough to toss in her backpack when she wants something to play music on that is better and louder than her iPhone.
5,Great sound at an even better price.
5,I wear hearing aids and it is very difficult for me to hear videos on my computer.  My son bought this little speaker for me for my birthday in July and I totally love it!  It is perfect for my use.  I just turn it on and the volume is clear and I can understand everything!  This has been a game changer for me!  No tinniness like another brand we tried first.  I would recommend this speaker highly!
4,Sound quality is fine. It's loud in quiet spaces but in big spaces not so much when it's maxed out. Sound is louder out of the front side than surrounding sides however it's good and clear.
3,La compr√© para un regalo y no dur√≥ dos semanas. Dej√≥ de funcionar y ya
3,I like it‚Äôs size and the buttons are easy to use. The sound is why I returned it. It‚Äôs loud but there‚Äôs no bass so it has a tin can sound.
5,The sound quality and volume are great. It really has good range. It's also cute!
5,Love the product!  Glad I purchased it! Amazing sound and plenty of power!
5,Great little speaker. Sound is good and the battery life always seems to impress me. Love the small size light weight easy to keep in your purse or backpack use mine frequently at work or camping or at the beach.
5,For a small product it is loud I love it!
5,I was pleasantly surprised with this speaker! The reviews were good but I didn‚Äôt expect the sounds quality at this level on such a little guy!It is very portable water resistant loud and super cute!! I got the red one and every time I get a compliment on it.Don‚Äôt over think it go ahead and buy yours!!
5,The only problem with this speaker is it did not come with directions for syncing it.  A quick youtube search and the problem was solved.  I used this speaker today on my golf bag.  Perfect.  Good sound fairly small and it does the job.  It can get much louder than what I need on the course but for what I am using it there is no reason to buy anything more expensive.  I only used it once for about three hours so I don't know how long the battery lasts.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Love it. I was disappointed and was going to return it. My phone could not find it. So I "reset" my phone settings. Figured I must have blocked things at some time. I have a galaxy S9 plus. Once I reset settings back to original settings phone found it right away. Then connected to ipad laptop within seconds. M7 is connection name. Love how simple.  Power and plus minus for volume.  Sound is great. Looking for simple sound boosting and that's what I got. I got a used one also usually a few bucks cheaper... so glad I found this. Worth it to me.
3,Product includes speakers usb charging cable and controls: on/off volume plus/minus previous/next track at minimum.I intended to use it as a PC external speaker because it was said to be PC compatable. However a usb bluetooth device was not included with the product. My Windows 7 could not recognize the speaker. Therefore I returned it w/o experiencing the device in anyway to comment upon its performance.
5,Speaker packs a punch for such a little speaker.
5,Best small Bluetooth speaker in the world.
4,Just received this item...definitely not the quality of sound as the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2's...but these are 1/3 the price!
4,I have been using my two speakers for a few months now. They are easy to pair up and they sound great
5,well this little thing is awesome for the price. it connects real easy with bluetooth.enough loud good looking and  easy to use
5,Purchsed for a kids birthday.  Loves it and uses everyday at basketball court.  Battery life is good and will last 4 hours.  Sound is good for size of speaker.  If you want one for you back porch you may want something bigger and with more Battery life.
5,Some how Amazon thought I wanted return this item‚Ä¶ but NO! I use it as part of my Behavior Management Classroom for background music! It helps to keep my room from being boring!
5,Sound quality is nice crisp clean.
3,It's nowhere near as loud as my JBL Flip but that's to be expected. It's great for the beach because it's loud enough for your group to hear the music but not so loud that it bothers others who may be close by.
5,This was smaller than I was expecting but it definitely makes it more portable. There‚Äôs a mini carabiner to hook to a backpack or something similar if needed. The buttons are quite easy to use. Bluetooth pairing took two seconds. The power button starts and stops the music so you don‚Äôt have to run back to your phone just press and hold the power to turn it off. Well I guess you can figure it out just as easily haha.
5,Great Product Love my Speaker!!!!  Great bass sound.
5,I love this!I get to take it everyday and use it for my virtual meetings.It's also great when I am playing my songs.
5,I like it!
4,I bought this portable speaker and I really like this because it‚Äôs waterproof. you can use it anywhere and easy to carry and travel with it. The best thing about this speaker is you can use it in your bathroom swimming pool without worrying about moisture. You can listen to songs in the kitchen very teeny tiny speaker. I especially like the sound quality of this speaker. I like the price of this speaker also It comes with the USB charging cable.
3,Me parece que suena muy muy bajo no cumpli√≥ con mis expectativas.
5,I love love love this little red speaker. It's perfect for me to listen to music from my phone.
5,these were gifts in a white elephant party and the individuals who received them love them.
5,I bought this for my wife because her other portable speaker died. This is same size and sound as her other speaker.
4,
5,I received this speaker with great package and I excited to use.I connected to my phone easily.It looks not only tiny but also weightless.The sound quality is amazing and I love it.It is portable and worth for what I paid.
5,I love how clear the sound is.... awesome speaker. Very loud too. Very happy with my purchase
5,This is a really great speaker. I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôll so loud but it is and I love it. It‚Äôs great for bike rides or just using it at home amongst friends and family. The battery life is long lasting and I didn‚Äôt have to charge for a really long time. Great product!
5,This little speaker sounds great! I‚Äôve been using this everyday this last week while refinishing our bathroom. I set it on a shelf inside our shower and let it go. It sounds great fills the bathroom and even gets your wife to yell at you about being too loud when you‚Äôre still working at 10PM while the kids are sleeping.... üòÇüòÇ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èEasily paired via Bluetooth and has volume up/down buttons to control the volume from the speaker. While finishing up I accidentally left this IN the shower while showering and it still kept going strong‚Äî no issues with the water rating. Very impressed with this little speaker.
5,I was worried that the volume wasn‚Äôt gonna be good but when I took this speaker on vacation it was definitely loud enough and played music good! Recommend and it‚Äôs easy to use and travel with.
5,Love my new little speaker!!!! I definitely recommend it to my surprise it's loud and it's so convenient to carry around!!! Thinking about buying another one for the future. The sound quality is great it sounds as good as my old beats pill. So if you're not trying too spend too much money and want something with good qualityyou should invest in one of these.
4,Does make sound. Simple/ effective.
5,Fix the packaging. Speaker was getting thrown around through the mail.
5,Bought two and synced them for stereo sound. I use them out doors camping and set them about 12 feet apart. Great stereo seperation and good enjoyable sound at medium volume.
3,Works good until the charging port came out only used for a month
1,The sound quality was good I used it for work and it was loud enough to hear while working. My only issue is that it stopped working after one day of use. I could no longer connect to it. It was no longer discoverable as a Bluetooth device. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the speaker has a small defect. I restarted it and reset it multiple times via the instructions given in small booklet and still haven‚Äôt gotten it to appear as any Bluetooth option under my iPhone or my families smartphones.
3,Decent... that's all it is. Don't be expecting this thing to sound like a surround sound system touching on all levels of lows mids and highs. You will be absolutely/utterly shocked/disappointed. LOL! It's mostly good for the vocals and that's about it. It's not loud enough though. After a certain point (via my iPod Touch) the vocals and other surrounding 'instruments' sound like loud unbalanced racket.Other pointers: It's easy to set up via bluetooth and the battery life is seriously long! Seems like it may already be charged out of the box. I've not submerged this thing in the water either. It just doesn't seem like it would survive. It doesn't seem like it's built for that.Overall depending on what you're looking for taking into consideration the price it's just... decent.
5,LOVE IT!!! We got a UE roll for our pool. But the husband took off with it. So I finally broke down & got this lil guy! And it‚Äôs plenty loud out at the pool! Nice bass too. I really like it to just pack up & go‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs small & Mighty!!!
2,listened to hip hop but to high pitched and chingy
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Sound is loud and amazing probably the best lil speaker there is. Definitely worth the money. Battery life is definitely one for the books it came on Sunday precharged and this is going on 4 days without charging it yet. It is epically great. I give more than 5 stars ü§©
2,Good for office desk audio very low
4,üôÑ
5,Fits in the palm of my hand as you can see. Sound quality is good for such a small gadget. Not bad at all. I wish I would‚Äôve gotten the red one though. The blue isn‚Äôt the shade I like but I‚Äôll keep it!
1,Bought two. One is now not working. Bought both on one order on March 27 2022 now Sep 3 2022 used sporadically. Kept on charge. Bluetooth works. Controls the phones volume controls. But no sound. Reset phone. Disconnected and re-paired. Connected to other devices like IPad and Samsung phone. Controls Bluetooth there but no sound. Tried several times. But blue light comes on and pairs correctly saying audio only on all devices.
5,One of the best Bluetooth speaker I ever bought. Now my sister wants one. Which I‚Äôll be ordering again. Highly recommend
5,Very pleased with this item was looking for a different brand wonder something- recommended to me by a friend. The sound quality is just as good (my friend agrees)as the other product  not sure of battery life yet as I‚Äôve only had it a short time but so far so good
4,phone from the blue tooth speaker would be nice other than it a great speaker for music
3,I guess it‚Äôs loud enough if there are no other louder noises around you. You get what you pay for.
5,Wonderful and waterproof speaker! fund and great price! we tested this speaker under water and it worked ! we tested it several times the bass is really deep for such small speaker!
5,I was looking for a cheaper Bluetooth speaker but was really wanting one that had the sound quality to the expensive JBL speakers. This product delivers. Great for when I‚Äôm at work (loud environment and can still be heard by everyone). Also great poolside or at the beach. Great purchase and worth the money!
5,The battery holds up amazingly well. I use it around the house & feel like I barely have to charge. Easily portable & the attached hook makes it convenient to hang.
3,Save for another month and get a higher quality unit.  Without saying which a similarly priced unit which is smaller and less portable beats this one for sound quality.
1,I mostly listen to classical music and the sound was awful not even close to a UE speaker.  I bought it based on so many glowing reviews but am very disappointed and am returning it.  I guess you get what you pay for.  :-(
2,The weather proof cover fell off the second time I charged it! Materials are very poor quality. Stopped working after 2 hours...
5,Easy to use. Sound quality is decent for the price. Very portable and lightweight. The battery takes awhile to charge but charge lasts up to a week on extended listening. We have two and enjoy them inside and in the backyard.
5,Great little speaker! Battery life is seemingly forever. Sound quality is legit for a little speaker. It‚Äôs durable and waterproof- I‚Äôve used it a few times clipped to my paddle board and it‚Äôs awesome!
3,That sound is like a $15 speaker. Very disappointing
1,When I saw this I thought it had an all around sound not the case. Sounds ONLY displays from the front not all around like I thought. I wouldn‚Äôt buy another one. üòû
5,I‚Äôve only had this product for a couple of days but I already love the sound quality. As for battery life I can‚Äôt say due to the fact that I haven‚Äôt used it long enough to determine battery usage and longevity. But I great appreciate it during this time period. It‚Äôs definitely help with the quarantine situation. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a different place. Continue todo great work. And thanks once again.
5,LOVE IT!
5,Great sound quality! I'm very happy with my purchase!!!
5,Good sound very good sound even if it goes under water good battery. I‚Äôm gonna buy a couple more for family !
3,This is a good speaker.  I‚Äôve been spoiled listening to Bose speakers for years. For poolside a small group not bad. The battery life is better then my Bose speaker.
3,Great speaker but there is no next or back button. I bought it for the shower ended up using it for hikes and out doors
3,Sounds good battery last long time. My cord broke after 2 months of riding bike. I had it clipped to my phone mount but hit few bumps off road it it broke cord but still working. Also doesn't work with my older Moto phone. Newer pixel no prob. I guess uses newer 5.0
5,The sound quality is very good. I connect it to my  TV in my cozy bedroom and it works pretty good. The build quality is much better than my previously broken one.  I can not  tell the exact battery working time but I know I rarely get it charged after I got it. I think the battery time is long and enough before every charging. Recommend it!
5,Great
2,Very quiet and crappy
2,Wow...just purchased two of these for what seemed like a great price...just got through trying them out and was not happy with the quality...they look very similar to the Wonderbooms I also have (which are much pricier)...however the sound quality is so lacking!  They are very tinny trebly (not much base) even when the phone equalizer is adjusted. Not much volume potential either.  Also when paired for simulated stereo the fidelity drift between the 2 speakers is way too annoying!  Guess I got what I paid for...but I wouldn't even pay the lightning deal price for these speakers!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It is a little magic: its surrounding sound is as good as a T-Mobile bought Blast Boom boxWith Blast‚Äôs price I can buy ten of this and place two in each room  so five kids can play their own favorite music piece in the mean time.
5,I love the sound
5,This is a nice little speaker. This is perfect for someone who is hard of hearing.  It has great vibrations. Easy to use. Sets up to Bluetooth easily.
5,This was the perfect buy for the summer time! It‚Äôs a perfect gift too. It doesn‚Äôt play the music blasting loud but perfect still!
5,Muy buena
5,These speakers do the trick. If you by two they easily sync and now you have it in surround sound.
5,Absolutely love this portable speaker. I clip it to my backpack and enjoy riding my escooter while riding in my neighborhood park listening to music. Highly recommend.
5,very satisfied with product
5,Product is exactly as advertised portable and easy to setup and use volume could be higher but otherwise great for the price
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It was ok when it was working but 10 months later sound became very distorted like if speaker diaphragm got damaged
5,Absolutely love this!!!
5,For what I am using it for it works. Comes with cord and puts out plenty of music for its size.
5,Tge sound quality is good. It is light and easy to handle. The battery life is also good.
1,Got the Sanag speaker to play music outside wirelessly but after less than a week it won‚Äôt charge. What a crock. Otherwise decent sound quality.
5,This product was as advertised. The volume gets pretty loud without compromising the sound quality. The size and clip is perfect for clipping on your bike or book bag when out on ride or hike. The battery life lasts all day.
5,There is no 360¬∞ Sound there‚Äôs one speaker in it. Other than that it‚Äôs a great speaker.
5,like the sound & portability!!
3,Everything is great until the bass hits and let me tell you it is straight toot'n. Notjing subtle about it. Unfortunately too late for me too return but perhaps I can save another.
5,Love the sounds and easy connection and pairing. 2 speakers really make a great sound and the battery lasts a legitimate 24 hours of play time.
4,Sound not that loud
5,This product sounds great. It is amazing for the prize and the battery lasts a lot.In love with this mini bluetooth speaker.
5,The sound is phenomenal and crystal clear.  I keep mine in the shower.  I love it!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,This is a powerhouse of a speaker. Small size loud sound
5,Great sound! Portability and long play time. Bought for my husband and loves it!
5,Got this as a gift for my husband to use at work and he loves it! Works perfectly in his forklift!
5,So cute love the speaker. Some songs with bass sound great some a little quieter are not as good but it works. Pretty happy with the purchase
5,it has great sound n it's easy to carry
1,Bought two of these since they were advertised to pair as left and right speakers for a surround effect. They wouldn‚Äôt pair together.
5,I love being able to go from room to room and listen to my music.
4,Small good sound. Didn't have to worry about getting it wet on the kayak.
5,Perfect size and sounds far better than I imagined! I bought the cover and it fits perfect - large enough to hold hook and the charge cord.
1,Did not work at all.
5,Bueno x el precio. No suena como mis parlantes JBL pero tampoco pagu√© como por ellos.
5,I like this small Bluetooth speaker very much. It's loud clear and easy to carry. It fits well with my iPhone and iPad. After I charge it it can be used for a long time. What's more it's still waterproof so I don't have to worry about it being damaged by water splash.
5,This speaker is great! My son wanted a speaker like mine but I didn‚Äôt want to spend a fortune. This was a great alternative. But I really love his better. Cause I can do everything on his speaker. I can change songs the volume off and on pause. Will by more!
5,Small size great sound and waterproof!!!!
5,Love how loud and portable this thing is he gets the job done especially when I‚Äôm campingGround moving sound
5,Sounds incredible for such a small package‚Ä¶..
5,Speaker work great now just have to buy the second one to enjoy music better!
5,works great has good sound. not super loud but i bought for closer areas so works get for mobile speaker
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†It's a cheap junky speaker.
5,My husband likes it and that‚Äôs the best thing could‚Äôve happened.
5,Like the size and shape of the the speaker.  Great at the beach or at home
2,These speakers sounds great and look cool. Super easy to connect to my ipad. I bought 2 of them to connect and now I have a nice mini surround sound in my shop. Mids and highs are nice & crisp... However they're missing bass. Completely... Like non-existent. Wish I didn't miss the return window on these because I'm not happy with the sound. Everything else about them is cool. Battery lasts forever.
5,It‚Äôs perfect for kayaking. Long batter life. Good sound.
5,High quality sound for a small speaker and good value for the price.
5,This thing sounds great and connected with my iPhone no problem. It feels sturdy and I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to let my kids use it. It comes with a carabiner so hooking it to a backpack would be no problem. Honestly it is a great value.
5,Nothing bad to say! Holds a charge nicely. Sound is pretty good!
5,This little speaker is very cute. Lightweighted but could speak loud! Perfect for reading audio books for my kids. Sometimes I use it for bedtime story telling and it could accompany kids to sleep.
5,Me gust√≥ mucho y se oye muy bien üëç
5,The sound is super clear and the little thing has a good bass sound for as small as it is.
5,S√∫per para un ser un altavoz peque√±o la calidad del sonido es impresionante
5,My outdoor terrace Bluetooth sound system. Very happy with the portability and 360 degrees sound.
1,The speaker is just fine for the money.  I gave it a one star rating because it's made in China.
5,Excellent.  Works great in my convertible when I have the top down
5,I like the sound.
1,First day worked great! Next dsy it buzzed on and off during songs I thought maybe it needed to be recharged. But then it just died! Sad because I initially loved it. Guessing mine is defective? Or just poor quality speaker.  So sad.
1,Received this 2.5 months ago sound is good but it turns off and on in between movies and doesn't work.
3,Sonido poco fiel sobre todo los agudos. Se que es un precio bajo pero por pas rese√±as previas esperaba algo mejor.
5,Easy to tote along
5,Perfect for beach
5,Great sound quality for a small speaker. Very portable.
5,Works perfectly fine in shower. Kinda wish it had a skip song button tho.
5,Sounds great the battery is durable and the pice is the best!
2,I purchased a set of two speakers to pair so me and my wife could listen to music at bedtime. The volume is  controlled by the device it‚Äôs attached to. The volume is either too high or too low there‚Äôs no easy setting. Not intended to be used at night. Probably a good outdoor speaker but wasn‚Äôt what I was purchasing it for.
1,I was ecstatic after my purchase of the first of this device! Marvelous sound quality from such a small device and the caribeener clip is so handy for attaching it to a backpack..  Then I found in the manual that was included instructions to match up a second device to create a surround sound effect. I jumped at the chance to purchase the second. It works as well as the first but I am unable to match up the two together. I have followed the instructions to the letter without success. Not sure what is wrong. I believe something is missing in the instructions. I will unpaired my devices and power them down and try again. If that doesn't work I plan to return for a refund. No point in having two when I can only use one at a time.
5,It‚Äôs perfect for on the go!  And the battery life is amazing.
5,This is a really good option to bring into the shower or to steam with
5,Love it!
1,In less than a week and only 3 uses the speaker began to crackle and actually make a screaming noise that wouldn‚Äôt stop even when powered off.
5,This speaker is lightweightI keep it on my belt when working in the garden. The sound is much better than the phone sound.
1,I don't know if it is me or I didn't do something that I should have but this unit makes noise whenever it is on and not being used.  It also loses connection with my laptop which is less then a foot away continuously.  I am not a fan of this brand or unit.
5,Amazing product loud long battery life easy to use
5,Es lo q yo quer√≠a
5,It is used to amplify the sound of computer and the volume is large enough. During this special epidemic I dare not go out to buy. This time it is a good experience.
5,Great volume compared to other similar products.
2,I was most disappointed with the sound quality. I was not expecting it to be the best ever however it is god awful. It is staticky and distorts the sound. The only thing that is good about the sound is that it is extremely loud. I do like the portability of it and the speaker is very light and even comes with a carabiner clip to attach. While this is a fairly cheap speaker compared to others I was expecting a better quality overall.
5,I bought this for my 4 years old son so he can listen toddler stories/musics everywhere in the house. He loves it and carries with him everyday.  It‚Äôs portable and stylish.
5,Love the balance I hear from this portable device! Using during my work under a table... and you feel surrounded by soothing music in the entire room.
5,I love this little gem...great quality great sound.
5,It‚Äôs beyond my expectations!
5,Sound its loud. Battery last for hours.100% recommended
5,We used the speaker on our road trip and it worked great! Even in a car the sound was good. I like that it comes with a carabiner too.
5,Love my new portable Bluetooth speaker.
5,My wife uses while cooking and cleaning.  She loves it!
2,Purchased and it only worked for about 1 month. Sound stated to fade and it went downhill from there. Would not recommend this product.
1,BEWARE - purchased this speaker worked great for about 2 weeks then was unable to recharge speaker.  Port on speaker so poorly made that the provided cord would not clip in.  Metal piece inside machine broken so now it can‚Äôt be charged.  Speaker was not roughly handled for that to happen.
1,Sound quality was non existent. Volume was lacking. Lasted two weeks then charging port failed.
5,Easy to use as I am technology challenged. Don‚Äôt know about the battery life yet as haven‚Äôt used it enough.
5,Very good sound quality for a little speaker.
5,I love it!  I use it instead if a big stereo and hoping to bring it with me to the beach and on my travels.
5,Great quality exquisite outfit and nice portability.
5,Size and sound
5,Loved it!
5,Good product
5,I bought this speaker for my wife and she loves it!  Great powerful deep sound!  Connection to her iphone was seemless.
3,Not loud enough
1,La vida del producto es muy corta en 3 meses se da√±o utiliz√°ndolo una vez por semana muy mala calidad no es recomendable para nadie..
5,Sound quality is good
5,Good
5,Great to use on a golf cart while playing 18.
1,Worst speaker I ever brought  it‚Äôs not even two months it‚Äôs already stop working
5,I recommend  the Sanag M7 speaker. It did meet  with my expectations. One part was missing an adapter.
5,Super fast service. Nice product
1,I am unable to connect with echo dot Bluetooth.  I have spent hours with Amazon tech support with no success.
1,I loved it until it started making a beeping sound randomly throughout the songs.  I see others have had the same issue.  I was unable to find a way to trouble shoot this.
2,Battery doesn‚Äôt last long sound quality is low not very durable save your money
1,I was excited to try out the new speaker once it arrived it wouldn‚Äôt turn on so I charged it For a few hours and that didn‚Äôt seem to work so I left it charging overnight the red charging light was on however the speaker never turned on returning it today
1,No sirve para nada no tiene sonido se escucha mal
2,I paired two and the volume just wasn‚Äôt loud enough. I have one Wonderboom and it was louder then both them together.
1,My speaker keeps making this weird beeping noise whenever it is on.  I thought it my be my computer but it does the same no matter what computer I use.  I bought to enhance the sound on my computer but this has turned out to be a dud.
1,I don't recommend this at all. The sound quality isn't good and it isn't loud. My phone's speaker is louder than this speaker. The only thing is it's portable but so is your phone and it'll play music louder than this speaker can. I've used it twice and both times I was very disappointed with both the sound quality and the fact that I had it on full volume and that I could barely hear it across my bedroom.
2,HELP!!!! I loved this speaker and it worked with my S9 but I had to get a new phone (S21) and now it won't pair...I tried disconnecting it and now it can't find it at all!!!! üò≠
5,Great little portable speaker. Good sound quality.
5,Good quality for the price!!
2,Works well just seems too quiet. Definitely more quiet than the cheap 15$ walmart blackweb bluetooth speaker I was replacing. All treble as well.
5,Great sound quality for the size of the speaker.  Very happy
2,I should've just replaced my wonderboom.  The sound quality on this is what I'd expect from a $30 speaker I guess.
1,El sonido
1,I think mine may be damaged - the volume does not go past half way. The volume is the exact same at half mark on my phone than it is at the full volume mark.When the volume is turned up all the way I could hold this speaker up to my ear and it does not even sound loud.Don‚Äôt waste your money
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Wow amazing speaker I just received and I‚Äôm very impressed
1,Skipped portions of Audible book.
5,Buen sonido
5,Bueno producto le doy 10 üëèüèª
5,Sounds great looks great very happy.
5,I love it.
1,The speaker had high reviews but the sound quality is average at best.  The bass is a disappointment very little.  Is has a monotone to it.  My tablet sounds better.  I would not recommend this one.  I had a JBL that sounded much better.  I should have bought another JBL.
1,So I bought this to fix a problem with my phone which was that certain songs sounded fuzzy. This speaker didn't fix the problem and sounds worse than my phone. It isnt worth the money tbh.
2,I'm disappointed in the quality and volume limit. My old Wonderboom sounds better.
1,Everything about the speaker was good but only after having for a few months the charger no longer charges the speaker. I did try other cords but the defect is in the speaker not the cord!!! No longer snaps into the the speaker!!! Very disappointed!!
1,The product description says it's 10 watts but the box says 5 the literature inside says 5 and it only sounds about twice as loud as my phone speaker. It's a pretty nice little 5-watt speaker but if you're looking for 10 watts you should keep looking.
1,I bought this in January Use it everyday at work didn't abuse it at all. The jack that you plug in to broke inside so I can not charge any more It look like it was made cheaply I only use it less the 4 months. It was a good price but I would not recommend it
2,Sound quality my old jams sounds better.
1,Sound quality is not great and my iphone is louder than the speaker!
1,yup I got my speaker today excited to take it to work..I blue toothed to my phone to here the sound . so sad the speaker is torn unbelievable . Do not buy this speaker or the brand that makes' them
1,FUNCIONO 2 DIAS Y SE DANO
1,Great product for the first two weeks I had it. Now all of a sudden the speak died. It pairs to phone and other electronics but no sound comes from speaker. Very disappointed. I do not recommend buying.
1,My phone sounds louder and the sound was muffled smh. Then when I returned it they only gave me back $20.18 so they stole some money smh. I guess they need it more then I do
2,Already returned because it crackled when connected to all my devices
1,Thing is cheap  Yes we know! Fell apart  and is a total pos! And it makes a weird sound which interrupts your music every 10 seconds! DONT BUY üôÑ
2,I can get as much volume out of my phone as I can with this speaker.
1,The speaker would not pair with my Bluetooth devices. The good news is that Amazon's return process is both easy and convenient.
2,There is no red led light and the speaker won‚Äôt charge after 24 hrs
1,The sound is horrible. As soon as the base kicks in it‚Äôs awful
1,Bought two  couldn‚Äôt paired . Not sure if this a genuine product or not.
1,is there a video how to pair this with your phone?? i cant seem to pair it and it keeps disconnecting. also doesnt come with charging cable its dissapointing
1,Mala calidad del sonido
5,Me gusta mucho
1,I wasn‚Äôt even louder than my phone.
1,Lousy speaker.  Stay far away from this product!
1,Weak Sound Completely made this purchase a bust
1,Horrible sound quality.
1,No Bass.
1,It‚Äôs GARBAGE!!!!
1,Worked great for the money. Too bad it stopped working after 2 months
5,Excellent value. Long lasting battery and surprisingly tough. I highly recommend.
5,I had purchased one a couple of years ago because I am very hard of hearing and it works perfectly!!  I can move it around and don‚Äôt lose Bluetooth capabilities.  I bought this for the bedroom. The reason I needed another one (desperately!)  is because I subscribe to Hulu and their volume is screwy and barely audible. My Amazon Fire Stick connected immediately to this Bluetooth  speaker which makes watching shows on Hulu so much more enjoyable. The sound is crisp and clear and I would not hesitate to buy another if I had to.
5,This product is amazing especially if you get 2. Me and my buddies will link them up when we play disc golf and have 2 people holding 1. They do stop playing if you are about 40+ feet away from the phone so it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs pretty cool. Now for the ONE FLAW. These speakers let you know they are ‚Äú about to die‚Äù by pausing the music and beeping 3 times‚Ä¶ that would be fine except the speakers will continue to play music and do this for upward of an HOUR‚Ä¶. every minute or so‚Ä¶ unbelievably annoying. Still love the speakers they have super battery life overall 10+ hours easily and really are quite water and impact resistant.
5,I bought this for my husband. He loved it. The sound is crisp and clear. Awesome! He noticed that when he went to charge it the insert to put the cord in was not stable. In a couple months it finally broke. No longer able to charge the speaker.  Very disappointed!!!!!!! He loves this speaker. Happy to send this back for one that works.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by this speaker it‚Äôs pretty small in size but the sound is great. I bought it to use in our camp trailer when we go camping just to have a little music but I have been using it around the house and I really like it. The sound is very clear and the speaker doesn‚Äôt sound distorted.
5,my daughter loves this thing and i love that her music isn't so loud in the shower anymore.
1,Once the speaker ran out of battery it was not good. The charger port was broken and this could not charge.  Bummer.
5,Such a great little speaker!! Truly portable and sounds great! I didn't think such a small thing would have enough volume but it does! And for the price range it is a great buy. I definitely recommend it.
5,I bought this during Prime day to replace another cheap Bluetooth speaker that constantly dropped its connection with my devices.  I mostly use it on the golf course and it has served its purpose well.  The speaker connects easily to my device and maintains connection the batter life is strong the sound quality is acceptable.  For a ~$30 speaking I couldn't ask for much more.
3,The speaker works well but it arrived without the power cord. That‚Äôs a major issue and when I click the link to contact the manufacturer there isn‚Äôt a link on the website to reach someone.
5,Great little speaker. My husband loves it! I like the wide short shape. I have a narrow taller one and it falls over. This one is perfect!
5,works perfect for 12 year old daughter
5,use this to have some music while outside in the hot tub. The sound is great portability is great.  Bought during prime day awesome deal for 20 bucks!!!!
5,I take this speaker with me everywhere I go in my house and backyard.  This speaker is exactly what I was hoping for.  It is very easy to connect to my iPhone and the sound quality is wonderful especially considering its size.
5,I wanted a speaker that I could take outside with me when I garden so I could listen to audiobooks.  It works well for this and the carabiner  is really handy if you want to attach is to a belt loop or a backpack.
5,This speaker is awesome! It‚Äôs small but mighty. The sound is amazing crystal clear in fact. Super easy set up and my phone connected right away. Fast delivery and charges fast! Highly recommend.
5,easy to use and transport. I use in with my Jacuzzi. Not worried if it falls in the tub
1,It is obvious that the care taken in the beginning to put out a quality speaker has changed. Now you will receive an unbranded version with cheap parts and the specs are not adding up. Notice all the bad reviews are from the last year. They are randomly cutting corners. You just can't afford to buy from the Chinese.  I bet the blue one is still quality but the black one will be awful. The price says it all. Chinese are always mixing business with manipulative practices and sideways trickery. They think we are fools. We'll see who is the fool.  I have given these cut rate products many chances before but it's just not worth the discounted price. You get what you pay for people. This may be loud and you may think it sounds great. Wait until you hear a quality product. Back to the drawing board. I wish Amazon would include the countries products are made in as a search criteria. I would be happy to buy from South Korea Taiwan or Japan and a few others I would chance but this mass produced garbage is just as they explained in the description that begs for proper English translation. It says this product is mud! Of course I know what you are trying to say but I could be wrong and actually the reviews and the discounted price mean you weren't lying and manipulating at all my bad this is just a bad deal.
5,Battery life is great! I charged it when I first received it and have prob used it 7 times 1-3 hours each and it‚Äôs still going strong. Also I found the sound quality to be top notch & the Bluetooth works a good distance (it was playing a video off my laptop which was a long hallway & set of stairs away).
5,good buy...works as advertised
1,As a speaker quality is fine for general background music -- but wen it comes to pairing this has ALWAYS been hit or miss right out of the box. Can't return it because it was a gift.
1,I got this as a Christmas Present I went to go use it and it was horrible there was no Sound!!Don't Buy!!!!
5,I purchased this Bluetooth speaker expecting it to be just okay or pretty good but one of those you get what you pay for items. But I will say it sounds very nice.Sound Quality-Good mids and highs. The lows are decent but you cant expect something this small and low-powered to be that good especially at this price point. So if you are looking for a Bluetooth speaker to use in the shower or anywhere near water that sounds clear and sharp and pretty loud then this is a good buy.Build Quality-The quality of the product seems very nice I was impressed by the packaging quality too it actually felt like a real retail product you'd find in a store. And the fabric covering around the majority of the speaker feels very sturdy and durable. I would honestly even compare this to the homepod. No it is not going to be that level of quality but its up there.Overall Impressions -I love this thing. I was considering spending 100+ dollars on a name-brand speaker but thought I don't really need them for what I will be using it for so that is why I bought this one and I am fairly certain it is the last one I will need to buy. One thing I wish it had were dedicated prev\next track buttons. Not the biggest deal in the world but would have been nice.
5,Sound quality is excellent. It‚Äôs loud vibrant and easy to use. I like the fact that is not heavy to to big. I kind of wished I got the red model but other than that this speaker is awesome!!
1,It was alright for the first 15 minutes of using this speaker .... I thought it had died on me ... it just gave out on sound ... I tapped the speaker an it ended up working but ended up not working again... I never dropped it once .. was fresh out the box ...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This speaker is very easy to use and have around. My kids and I use it for playing music in the house and other places. It is easy to charge and it good quality. I love the size of the speaker and how portable it can be.
3,El sonido es muy malo y tiene muy poco volumen me siento estafado.Supongo que las personas que pusieron buenos comentarios es porque les regalaron el producto o lo compraron mas barato pero yo pagu√© casi US$25.00 por cada altavoz y me siento estafado.Lo que recomiendo es que no compren estos altavoces.
5,I just purchased this and have only used it briefly. It is great for what I use it for that is to play music using my iPhone. Easy to carry around. We used the speaker when riding on my golf cart when riding my standard poodle around town on Independence Day 2021 and I will be using at work to play music softly. Seems to be a great purchase.
5,I‚Äôm so impressed with this little speaker. Get one! Way better option than some of the more expensive models. I will say it could use a dash more bass but really on the whole it‚Äôs sound is amazing. I used one just one to play music in my back yard for a bbq and it was more than adequate at filling the outdoor space with music. I didn‚Äôt even have it up to full volume. After that I bought two more. Also a great and inexpensive gift! I‚Äôm on a budget so this was a great option for me as opposed to the competing $100-range models. Get one y‚Äôall!! Thank you for making this great little speaker!

5,Super crisp sound quality with just enough bass. Couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with this purchase.
1,Could not pair with my phone. Didn't hold a charge. I returned the item.
5,I have a much bigger Sony speaker and barely use it. Instead I really wish to have a mini portable one that I can carry around so I got this one. It charges quickly and battery lasts for days. It is so tiny and light can sit on the palm;  yet makes big sound I have to pay attention not to push the "+" button too many times the sound quality is good. Consider the price very good value. The carabiner enable easily hang on the treadmill; it will be great to hang it inside the tent in the camping trip.
5,I bought it for carry with me to play tennis. The quality of the quality of the sound is really above my expectation. The sound can be pretty loud. Not so heavy I can put it on my tennis bad. I am planing on bring it beach too when it is open. For the price I am pretty satisfied!!!
5,The speaker is amazing the sound is really good . Though I do wish the battery life was much longer then 10 hours. It‚Äôs pretty light which is good if want to attach it to your waist . It‚Äôs a really good product so far .
4,The sound is okay but not the best bass. For the money it‚Äôs not a bad speaker.
5,TLDR it‚Äôs a good speaker for the price you pay.Connection - easyOverall usability - easyComes out of the box needing a charge. I plug it in and immediately turn it on. Sound is good for the price. I use it in my garage when I‚Äôm working and just around and it fits the bill for me.
5,Cute little speaker nice sounds quality and stable connection so small that I can carry around! And I was amazing it is waterproof we can take hiking or beaches next time. Oh the battery life can play 2 hours or more it‚Äôs enough for me.
5,Super speaker sound. Easy bluetooth connection and range. Would buy again
5,If it was hanging on your daypack you would definitely feel it.
5,I do not like my kids to take my phone and walk around inside and outside while they are listening the music or stories. They will play games sometime without my permission. With this speaker I do not need to worry about it anymore. It is ok for them to carry the speaker. The sound is good enough and the battery as well.
3,Very nice looking and fits in the case I purchased separately well with the charger and hook. While the tone of the sound is superb it only goes as loud as the apparatus you have it playing from. Wish is was louder for the price paid.the "+" changes song the song the "-"button lowers the volume. Quite odd. If I didn't need it for vacation I would return it.
3,Speaker works well. Just with louder bass music not too good. Holds Trimble a lot better.
5,Great little speaker with great sound.
5,I've used this speaker A LOT and I have no complaints. The sound is great and loud the battery lasts a long time it's easy to use it's very durable and the price is low. It's perfect.
5,Actually lasts long than I thought and does well with water so I am happy about that. I wish it had a better way of telling when it's low on battery and also I wish I can use  it while it charged.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The speaker has really great volume. It‚Äôs pretty small but still as I said loud volume. Also when it arrived I used it without charging it lasted about a week
5,Love how convenient it is for trips and travels addition to that the sound quality of the Bluetooth speaker is clearer than any other Bluetooth speakers I‚Äôve bought before and how long the battery lasts when fully charged before it requires to charge again
5,The best sound ever and super slick looking
2,Le falta potencia al sonido
5,Love this ! Made my life so much better . Perfect great sound for yourself or a small group anywhere
5,Volume is not loud enough. Still can't hear over teens and dogs. Otherwise it's good.
5,In a normal bedroom environment I could not believe the great Sound this little speaker has. Compared to the link 10 it is far superior. At normal use 30 to 40% volume the battery lasted me 4 days. This little speaker seems to be true stereo That is left and right with a subwoofer that does its job.
4,El equipo me gust√≥ s√≥lo que quer√≠a que sonara m√°s fuerte.
5,Bought this for vacation. It packs well for a small speaker. The sound is big. We are impressed with it.
5,This thing sounds like an entire amphitheater in the palm of your hand. It's kind of surreal how much sound comes out of something so small.Set up is easy and the strap makes it convenient to tote around to the beach hikes bike rides whatever. All around sound purchase.
5,I‚Äôm obsessed with this speaker! As a freelance personal trainer who trains at the beach and other outdoor environments this is absolutely perfect to provide a motivational atmosphere for my clients through music!!
5,This little speaker is little but mighty.  It packs a punch in terms of volume.  Love how lightweight small and easy to place anywhere in the house.  This little baby will be traveling with me on future vacations.  Definitely worth the investment if you're in the market shopping for one with great quality and volume!
5,Cute speaker with good sound and price
5,Attractive and great sound
5,Like it
5,Great gift for my 14 year old. She loved it
5,I love this speaker. The sound i and size is perfect for what I was looking for
5,this speaker is very small and constructed very well. The sound is amazing for such a tiny speaker. I been using this in my work shop and it does a very good job.
5,Works well and easy to use.  Great sound quality
5,So handy for outdoor cookouts
5,This lil guys has a powerful sound and pairing was so simple?
5,Great
5,Very portable Bluetooth speaker.  I can bring it anywhere and surround myself with music wherever I go.  I also loved that it came with a carabiner for hanging.  It came nicely packaged so it's great for gifting.  Bluetooth range is okay and pairing it with my iPhone was easy.  It's small but it can fill a large room with surprisingly loud and clear music.  The sound quality is decent.  With the price tag what more can you ask for?  The medium frequency is clear and clean and it's a little louder.
5,Great little speaker. Sound quality is good love how light weight it is. No complaints! We‚Äôve had it around the pool and have not had issues with hearing it. Recommend if you‚Äôre looking for compact easy to use and good sound. Haven‚Äôt ran it for long periods yet so can‚Äôt attest to battery life will update if there‚Äôs a problem.
5,I saw that this speaker had a great number of good reviews so I thought I'd give it a go.  The round speaker design itself is somewhat misleading as you would think the sound profile comes from the entire speaker but it actually only comes from one direction. The speaker has to be pointed directly at you in order to get the full benefit of the sound quality rather than an omnidirectional speaker as it is advertised. However the sound itself is solid for a $30 speaker. The highs and lows are clear and the mids tend to get a bit washed out but the soundstage is loud enough and full enough to sound great in the shower out by the pool or camping outdoors. It won't shake the floors but it is well-built and durable and the waterproof design makes it very functional for any scenario.
5,Impressive sound for its size!
1,They sound terrible. Not worth the money
5,Pretty good performance good quality
5,This speaker is a great upgrade to the previous pink sanag speaker I had formerly. I have had no technical difficulties and it connected seamlessly. The sound quality is great I'm even considering getting two.
5,Literally the best blue tooth speaker for such a great price! I strap it in my camera bag during my photography sessions and it‚Äôs perfect! It even comes with a clip to clip on my bag. The sound is great and it‚Äôs soo easy to use and paid unlike some speakers I‚Äôve had in the past. Definitely worth buying!
4,Good sound decent volume  great battery life!! 1 down fall is that the rubber clip that you use to attache carrebeaner to broke off!! Other than that great deal!!
5,Small great sound easy to set up and use!
5,This is my second one bought for surround sound..love that these work when off grid
5,Wonderful
5,Works great good sound quality fast charging battery last longer.
5,I like the sound quality and the portability of the product-easy to carry don't know about the battery life yet but I am satisfied with the product
5,A nice product
5,Portable with big sound.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This one is the best choice has a good price a good sound quality  and the best part is so portable I went for hiking the other day with my friends and we enjoyed the hike because of it. We listened all the way great music. Besides It is not heavy then I can bring wherever I go and it has a long battery.
5,Just turn one on and connect it to your bluetooth and then turn the other one on and that's all it takes -- you will have surround sound anywhere you go.I don't know how long the battery lasts though because it lasts so long that I've never gotten to the point where they were low on battery before I charged them.  This includes 18 holes of golf (about 4 hours) a day at the pool and many baseball games on the back porch.
5,I use it in my shower and it‚Äôs awesome.
1,Too bad I thought it would be useful but I found it was useless. I lost interest and confidence in it and hoped to return the goods and refund the money. qq.2477515087
5,I really liked this portable speaker the sound quality is great for me! I am able to play music and hear it throughout the house no matter where it is. I play it for 2-4 hours a day and don't need to recharge until usually by the third or fourth day.
1,Difficult to operate ridiculous system to change functions no instructions to figure out the rudimentary function controls the user is left to figure what do and which function to implement this item is a piece of junk.
5,Sounds so much better than just my cell phone.  great sound good bass. Such a little thing and it gives this
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I have used it for a week. The small speaker can be held in one hand and is very light. The USB socket is also waterproof with a cover. It's louder than the built-in mic on my external screen and it's really clear!
5,Works beautifully loved the one I was gifted so much ordered one for my dad who said it may be his favorite gift ever. Coming from a man who has everything that‚Äôs an enormous endorsement. Sound rivals Alexa Echodot but a bit better excellent for carrying around when you need portable music while working etc
5,syncs  up easy like any bluetooth  speaker only disapointment is its  micro usb not usb c  and bit too big around to fit well in my thin shoulder bag/purse.  but i guess other bags its fine.  bass is decent for its  size
5,Best purchase I made in awhile ‚Äò
5,Para dormir....relaxing sound...you have the opportunity for the control...after one week the speaker have a distorsi√≥n  de mierdaüëé
5,First of the speaker has a nice punchy bass. I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift and she/he is satisfied with the booming of the speaker and punchy bass.I definitely recommend this
5,Pairs easily and has good sound for it's size. The Carabiner Clip is good quality and large.
5,Works fine. Even came with a little lock to hang from something or your belt buckle
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I was a little skeptical because I‚Äôve never heard of this brand.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The box comes with an instruction manual and a charging cord.  It charges using a micro USB.  It feels solidly built and the ports are covered but a rubber piece making it water resistant.  It feels rugged like it could take a fall and keep kicking.  It is small enough that you could throw it in a back pack or purse.  The has a rubber loop and comes with a carabiner.  The one negative to the rubber loop is that I‚Äôm not sure how well it will hold up over time especially if you are getting the speaker wet.  I could see it drying out like a rubber band and breaking.The sound quality is good.  The bass is lacking a bit but overall it sounds good.  It gets loud without distortion.  You can also link speakers if you have another one to get a more stereo sound.I got this one on sale for $23 and it‚Äôs definitely worth it.  I went back to buy a second one to link them and the price has changed so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get another one.  I don‚Äôt know that I would pay $30.  I might keep an eye on it because I‚Äôd really like to hear the two together.Overall this is decent little speaker and would work well in a smaller area.  I‚Äôve been using it in my bedroom while I work and will probably take it to my office when we go back.
5,For the price it puts out enough to work in a small room. Dont get me wrong. It works great for me. No problems.  If you need something for outside or bigger building rooms no this wont work well.
5,I bought this to replace an old bluetooth speaker I have and I absolutely love it! It charges in about 5 hrs but the charge lasts a very long time before I have to charge again. The pink speaker is the one I bought as pink is my favorite color and I absolutely love it! So cute! Amazing sound quality also and very easy to use!
5,So far I‚Äôm liking this speaker a lot. The sound quality is pretty decent for the price point and it can get pretty loud which I wasn‚Äôt really expecting but I‚Äôm also not complaining about it! It has a nice weight to it it was easy to connect to both my Iphone and my Acer laptop.
5,Good quality for the price
5,Clear sound and loud enough. Light. Portable.
3,Portability and sound are great.  The only drawback is battery life.
5,I‚Äôve been using this speaker for about a month and I just love the sound! Really water proof!
5,Esta muy Bonita
5,Music is life. I am so excited for this. When I‚Äôm in the house getting ready cleaning or whatever it might be I always play music so if I went from room to room that meant my music went away or it had to come with me. So excited that buying multiple and they pair up so I can have in different rooms. Happy!
5,IT'S AMAZING..PERFECT FOR BACKYARD WORK. I can hear it over the lawnmower and the weed wacker.. no more wearing headphones. I LOVE IT.
5,Great buy for >$30 pretty loud not suitable for a party but a good movie night addition
5,Great sound I like this over headphones. Great to use to listen to books and music on the go! Great product! Thanks so much!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I am in love with this speaker !. ‚ù§Ô∏èIt has Amazing sound quality.  I am nervous to see if it's water resistant but over all I am very happy with my purchase . The speaker can get pretty loud  but the sound is very clear ! I highly recommend this speaker ! And I love the color I got (: and it's very easy to use !
5,I really love it!It's beautiful the sound quality is incredible it is easy to carry discreet and powerful.  I recommend it
5,Es muy vuena justo lo q queria me encant√≥
5,I bought this speaker for use at work listening to it right now great sound I am partially deaf so I need more volume than this laptop puts out.  Easy to use no idea on the battery life as I have it plugged into the laptop when I use it.  Happy with it as long as it keeps working I  will write further if it dies. Have a nice day.
5,Si
3,I was hopeful with reviews it would sound decent. It‚Äôs great if you only like treble everything is great with design and everything just missing base
5,It just looks like the JBL speaker. Sounds great as well with good base. Sturdy and can be used in the shower or outdoors. Battery life is okay and can be connected very easily. Overall great investment on a good speaker.
5,Love this little powerhouse!
5,Great clear sound  easy to connect to Bluetooth ! Love it and would buy it again for sure !!!! Delivered quickly. Battery was charged enough to play a few songs straight out of the box . 5 stars
5,Looks like pic good sound long battery easy controls
5,The sound is really clear and the battery lasts a long time. I use it everyday.
5,Love this speaker. Brought it on vacation with me this speaker amazed me with how loud it got for how small it is. I love how it looks so modern too
5,Me encanto el sonido
5,Was surprised at how nice this sounds and the portability is great.
5,It‚Äôs perfect just what I asked for
5,I enjoy listening to music both indoors and outdoors. I wanted something sturdy that I can move inside and outside and not worry about whether it's okay to do so. This was a good price so I decided to go for it. I play my Apple music through these speakers and so far since getting it I've been using it for breakfast and for some meals out in the backyard too. This transmits sound well and pairs well with my phone.
5,I had bought this for someone who works in roofing. They loved the speaker the sound quality on the roof is loud. They loved the speaker.
5,The speaker is sturdy and waterproof.  It has great sound and is easy to use!  Great purchase at a reasonable price!
5,It‚Äôs work good
1,Never thought of this disgusting piece of bluetooth speaker. Not holding enough battery backup. Takes lot of time connecting to bluetooth. Not sure why these disgusting things are pricy. These should be sold at no more than half price. I don't recommend it.
5,Great while showering.  Comes with a clip which is very convenient if you have a rack to just attach/clip it to.
5,Better than expected
3,It's not a bad price for a speaker. You're not going to get the best sound out of it. I like how small it is but if you are going to use it in a small room it has a great sound. The bigger the room the less bass you will have. The battery life is about 3to 4 hours depending on the level of the music. It connects fast as well
5,Cute..yes. It syncs fast with my phone. It has incredible sound holds a charge for a long long time.  I'm lovin it!
4,I like
5,Wow. I've had and have been using these almost continuously for about 2 weeks and just had to re-charge them for the first time. I must've had them playing for at least 60 hours.The "on" "off" "connected" and "dying" tones are actually nice (unlike my previous pair of a different brand which were extremely annoying).These feel hefty in a "good quality" kind of way without being heavy. They look nice and produce good audio.UPDATE: After several months these are my favourite new item this year.
5,I purchased a wonderboom speaker for 120 and it was defective .. had so many challenges.. I returned it and found this one. Wow surpasses my expectations.. love this speaker sound is clear and is pretty loud. The price is a steal!Definitely recommend!!
5,Delivery was fast loving it. Works as described. Small compact speaker it has clear sound and bass sounds fine even at max volume.I'm loving itThank you for creating it and selling it at Amazon
5,These little speakers are amazing. I love that they pair and I can have them in different areas. They have great sound quality and are very durable and well made.
5,Exactly as its described!The sounds out of this is superb considering its size and cost. Super portable and easy to use.Bought it for my parents so they can enjoy some music on the balcony with some wine in the evenings and they love and use it all the time!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The appearance is really good small and portable.I use it to listen to songs and stories.Sound quality and bass are very good.Charging for 3 hours can play for a long time„ÄÇ

It is pretty compacted size with good sound quality I am happy with this speaker with this price. It is very easy and fast to connect to mobile devices with Bluetooth.
5,Like it very much sound quality really good easy to use. Serve my purpose really good I use it when taking shower splash get onto it not any problem. I did not purposely drop it in water to just test it I am not going to :)
5,Sounds really good came quickly! Easy to travel with and actually gives a quality loud sound!! Highly recommend !!
5,Really great sound I cant believe how good it is for a small speaker so far its water proof i use it in a steamy humid environment and it still works. its light and very portable
5,We get so many compliments on this when we're out! Works amazing. Love it. Will buy more.
5,Very handy room to room and out on deck
5,Great sound quality and battery life. Can‚Äôt wait to go to trail.This speaker came with hook and charging cable. Worth the price
5,Used at work to play my own music library. Love it.
4,For the price this works great. IT's very compact and light. The sounds for turning on/off and pairing are also very subtle which is particularly nice as I use this for night time sounds while I sleep.The only minor complains I would have is that it's not 360 sound if you inspect it closely the speakers are only in the front and there're none in the back. This is really not something I care about but just keep that in mind if that's a must for you.The other annoying thing is that while it's plugged in charging you can't use it.Overall a good purchase the colour is very nice too.
1,It's May2022 and it has died; used onMacBook Air. (Got a Bose now and worth the extra money).This red one Didn't connect to my PC!There is no visible on or off light.Nothing to show where the blue tooth is located nor if connected.No instructions for how to pair it with a computer.Spent a Far Too Much Time searching for the item instructions. It did find a MacBook. It did not find my PC.In the description under questions there is a long description about how to contact the seller but doesn't give the email address! This looks good. ButCan't judge a book by it's cover.... Get the waterproof Bose- Great sound!
5,This little speaker pumps a lot more than I was expecting. Being an ironworker I have to climb around up on the steel so the little carabiner is awesome to hook to my harness and have some tunes while I'm working. Battery lasts at least 8 hours no problem.
4,If it had adjustable base it would of gotten a 5
4,Bought for the girls in the house as I seen they seem to be using there phones in the bathroom for shower music.The unit it is definitely water proof as the shower water has no effect on it. Very goodThe unit is easy to pair with. Very goodThe unit sounds good in the bathroom. Very goodThe unit unit does lack in the bass department and outside it's no pro for distance. It's ok but not outstanding.A fried of mine has a unit same size but sounds very good in comparison. All at a cost I guess. His was 3x the price.This unit works for what I intended in the bathroom.Cost to happiness its good. But not a full around take speaker.
4,Speaker came quickly ready to use I immediately and the sound acceptable for what I am needing. Happy with purchase.
4,The product is small and easy carry. The sound quality is pretty good.I only gave it 4 stars because it‚Äôs not waterproof as I thought it would be.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Yooooo pretty good.Just got it today so gotta see how it is! But overall its very cute and light.
4,Very nice and good quality sound for the price. But I would call it fake propaganda. It is not a 360¬∞ sound system. The sound comes out on the front with the bottoms.
4,Great speaker but the strap broke off within a week!Any suggestions
3,When I first got it it was what you would expect. The sound was good! but the boom you would at least hope for was not quite there. From then on it worked well enough in my semi active lifestyle and now at exactly 8 months and 1 day it has started skipping and I am not so hesitant to move on to a new one. I've also tried the Sony equivalent and have the same review so really your getting your vang for your buck.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†La bocina me ha resultado una joya el precio es demasiado accesible para una bocina asi.Primero es f√°cil de usar se carga rapido y la autonom√≠a de la bater√≠a es demasiado buena dura much√≠simas horas mas de un dia sin problemas al conectarse ya lo he conectado a celulares laptops variad y nunca ha fallado.El dise√±o es genial tanto de la caja el empaque como ls propia bocina que parece la parte superior de un micro y lo mas importante SUENA MUY MUY BIEN.Para uso personal o regalo es muy bueno llego sin problemas y por descuido encargue dos bocinas y la devoluci√≥n de la segunda fue muy sencilla asi q por donde se le vea bien
5,Tiene un sonido muy bueno apesar de tu tama√±o peque√±o. Su tama√±o la hace muy pr√°ctica para viajes o entrenamientos.Me fascibo
4,Let me start off by saying that I got my hands on this speaker during the 33% off discount event. At full price there are better options out there so maybe stay tuned for another similar discount on this speaker.For 30 CAD the sound quality and what it offers definitely a sweet spot! I now use it all the time in the shower and have taken it on hikes due to its somewhat rugged and definitely compact design. The added carabiner gives it even more portability. Though definitely don‚Äôt expect UE wonderboom sound quality out of this one!
4,Sound quality is good to my ears. I have other small speakers with 5W power. This speaker is no more powerful than those although advertised as 10W. I am not an expert and I say it just through experience. Maybe I am wrong. I bought it with a good discount so I keep it because it‚Äôs nice and got a nice feeling.
4,Bon produit. Tr√®s satisfait.
5,This is so good the battery lasts forever it‚Äôs great
5,Bonita y se oye bien.
5,Are use this in the shower and it‚Äôs awesome especially for such a little guy. Definitely buy this

1,celulaire mais il ne fonctionne pas bien je m en sert pas
5,Update: received replaced and it works great!Randomly keeps shutting my music off. Everything else works great
5,Se escucha fuerte a pesar de su tama√±o muy practicaPara llevarla con su llavero la puedes colgar en tu bolsa. Y si le dura la pila

5,Una della casse bluetooth migliori con un uscita audio perfetta e comoda da portarsi dietro.A livello di batteria dura tantissimo 22/23 ore circa.In dotazione anche un moschettone per appenderla dove si vuole per esempio zaino.I soldi li vale tutti se cercate una cassa bluetooth economica e con una qualit√† perfetta questa √® quella che fa al caso vostro
3,Delusion! La cassa contrariamente a quanto scritto nella descrizione non √® da 10 watt ma da 5!  per il resto fa il suo dovere rimane una forte delusione...
5,Cassa bluetooth comodissima  considerando l impermeabilit√† √® ottima per qualsiasi tipo di viaggio e situazione .La batteria dura davvero tanto ancora devo caricarla una volta !In dotazione vi √® anche un moschettone molto utile per appenderla .Per la qualit√† che offre il suono il prezzo ci vale tutto direi .
3,non ha un suono bellissimo
1,Ottimo prodotto qualit√† prezzo peccato che dopo 10 giorni la batteria dura solo un ora  per questione di tempistica ( vacanze) non effettuer√≤ il reso lo sconsiglio
3,Was kind of bummed out. I thought they were dual as can both play front he same source.
3,I really enjoy this speaker - the sound is good the battery life is excellent and if it wasn't for the one really bad flaw I'd rate it 4 or even 5 stars.But I've owned three of these speakers and two are now non-functional. The problem is the USB port - it's not secured. The port lies loose in the housing which means every time you plug it in - or unplug it - you're putting strain on where the usb port connects to the circuit board inside. The result is always invariable after a couple months of use - the port snaps clean off the board and you're left with a paperweight. It's a shame because it's a nice speaker and the manufacturer could fix this defect easily.The last remaining speaker I have is permanently plugged in to avoid this from happening.
5,Great sounding speaker battery life is excellent.  Exceeded my expectations.  Great for backyard hike or round of golf.
5,Ce petit speaker et tr√®s bien!  Je le place sur ma paddle board et il ne prend pas de place et il sonne bien
5,So far so good!!!
5,Wow! I wouldn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find a perfect small speaker - I can carry it around waterproof and with good sound quality. You won‚Äôt regret purchasing this!
5,Great product for the price.  Very happy with it.
5,I like the quality and the duration of the battery that is for places outside the house with beaches parks etc.
5,sound and battery life are good .no issues
5,Je suis tr√®s satisfait de la qualit√© versus le prix.
5,Un peu triste je l'avais command√© rouge mais re√ßu noire. Pas grave !
1,Avec les √©l√®ves √† la r√©cr√©ation mais le son est tr√®s faible je ne le recommande pas pour l‚Äôext√©rieur
5,Really good sound and battery life
5,Tried my new speaker this weekend on a river run. Oh course had to have tunes playing. What a sound it had and others could hear it away from me in there canoes and it wasn't even at the max volume. I would highly recommend this speaker.
5,Difficile pour moi de l'√©valuer c'√©tait un cadeau que j'ai offert √† une amie.
5,Sound is awesome
5,The sound quality from this little speaker is amazing.  At first I had trouble connecting it with the Amazon Fire TV but the customer support was very helpful in guiding me through the steps to make it work.
5,Just right for out outdoor activities.
4,Bluetooth work well. I wish it had more bass but the sound is pretty good for a small speaker and the price.

1,The sound is very weak. I do not suggest buying this.
3,I wasn't impressed with this bluetooth speaker and was surprised that the sound quality was poor based on so many glowing reviews.  The round shape is stable on a table but there's only one very directional speaker in the unit and even though the speaker grill is 360 degrees the speaker has to be precisely aimed at the listener for best sound.I returned this unit and purchased a JBL speaker for a few dollars more and am happy I did.  The sound quality is much better and the speaker can more easily hang in the right direction from a carabiner etc. and the carabiner loop is very sturdy and not just a flimsy piece of plastic.Sorry for being critical but I like my new speaker much more!
5,tr√®s bonne appareilbon prix et tr√®s bonne qualit√© sonor
5,Excelente calidad de sonido y volumen se escucha muy bien adem√°s la bater√≠a le dura mucho no la e cargado desde que lleg√≥ y va bien
5,tr√®s satisfait
5,very good
1,I don't like it at all.
5,Bon produit pour le prix
5,More sound than I was expecting from such a little speaker!
5,Purchased a second speaker to augment the sound in a large roomBoth my speakers pair easily with my iPhone 8 iOS 15.5After multiple attempts following instructions to click button twice to pair the speakers and have sound coming from both simultaneously  ..no luck.Perhaps they pair and play at the same time on other devices such as Android ones but not my iPhoneDisappointing.Today by chance it worked. Both are now connected together to my iPhone and they sound good in a large room. Exactly what I expected so now 5 stars.Advice: When trying to pair the two speakers after turning them on press power button twice firmly and hold down a bit each time. They will beep.
5,I am happy with my purchase.
5,Qualit√© prix
1,We really liked this speaker and enjoyed it about a month until one day we tried to plug it in to charge and the female plug inside the speaker just broke off and pushed inside the unit. Now we have no way of charging it! Disappointed.
1,do not buy its not good it always make a weird noise when playing music  i wish i could return it but i throw the box in thrash
2,Dislike: sound.  Some bass lots of distorted noisy highs mids are missing.  Have tried to use it with iTunes (with various EQ's) and YouTube.  Tried different genres of music.  All sound irritatingly tinny.Like: size and price but those doesn't make up for crappy sound.
5,I like it
1,ESIT: This speaker‚Äôs Bluetooth no longer works. Speaker lasted a month won‚Äôt connect to anything and will not broadcast a Bluetooth signal for new devices to see it.!Contacted seller they responded quickly and offered a replacement will see if that works and update again if satisfaction changes.The good;SmallWaterproof (ish) read on..For quiet listening the speaker range is good.The bad:Bluetooth stopped working will not pair with anything after just one month minimal usage.‚ÄúWaterproof‚Äù is false the charge port is under a plastic cap this cap comes loose and water got into the charge port which is a very poor design.There is no low range (bass) while listening and at louder ranges it‚Äôs quite tone/tinny sounding way too much treble.Most disappointing in design the speaker is not multidirectional a small speaker is located in what would be the front of the housing above the buttons. and if blocked or facing away from you the sounds is almost gone won‚Äôt come from other parts of the speaker. Another poor design of this.In my experience with this it‚Äôs not great sound and not a multidirectional speaker which is what most cylindrical speakers are. The reliability is lacking failure after only one month.
2,En d√©pit du fait qu'elle soit waterproof (g√©nial pour la douche) et sa petite taille vraiment top pour l'emporter partout je lui ai trouv√© trop de d√©fauts qui font que je l'ai renvoy√© :- basses pas assez profonde- se d√©connecte de mon pc au bout de 30 secondes si je mets la musique en pause (je n'ai pas eu ce probl√®me avec d'autres enceintes auparavant)- pas possible de changer de piste √† partir de l'enceinte- pas de connection multipointsDommage !
5,Est√° genial esta mini bocina me encant√≥ el sonido que tiene .El sonido es limpio.Lo recomiendo
5,Love it! Sound is great for a little device and it‚Äôs light. Happy!
3,Il a juste arreter de fonctionner tout simplement ! Plus rien n'allume.
5,tres bon
3,This is a 2nd time purchase sound and battery already great. The little hook to hang broke afyer a couple months.But overall pretty good.
5,Sounds terrific.
5,Easy to use Mini and cute!  I can put it in my pocket. Sound quality is good just received it for 2 days don't know about the battery life but so far so good.
5,Waterproof. Good sound. Easy connection
5,I have had this little Bluetooth speaker for a couple years now and honestly I had to write a review. This thing is indestructible. I have left it outside for winters by accident and entire summer. Holds battery life for a long long time and has great sound! Best money spent if looking for easy portable loud speaker that is simple to use!
5,Beau son
5,I have enjoyed this product with no problems. Easy to use sounds great and battery life is excellent!
5,It‚Äôs a great little speaker inside and outsideMine took a swim - it semi floats seems fish like music too
5,sounds great
5,Awesome speaker for the price point!  Easy to take to the beach and seems super durable so far.
3,Easy to setup. Doesn‚Äôt go very loud and a little tin-sounding but for the price it does it‚Äôs job.
3,I do not really recommend this speaker.
3,Le son n'est pas ce √† quoi je m'attendais et la couleur re√ßue n'√©tait pas conforme √† la description et aux photos.
5,Love this little speaker
5,Nothing special but serves the purpose of a inexpensive portable speakerGood size for travel
5,It‚Äôs great works well.
5,Fonctionne super bien et la batterie est super bonne.  !!!!! Bon achat

2,First off..  Just get the Sound core mini or mini 3..  Sound 100 times better..and its actually MINI  compared to this....ok.....So  360 degree sound??  NOPE  only comes from one side.. and Does NOT get very loud..and it says on the product page " it Give you a 24-hour uninterrupted tour of music".?  Then in the discription it says "it gives 18h on medium volume"?  so which one is it?  Neither!  I get barely 10 hours of music on this thing at Medium volume...hard pass...  and Like I said...  Just go with the Soundcore mini...  This thing sounds so bad compared to it..and its cheaper...
1,
1,D√©cevant
4,So far so good. Works good
3,Sort of "you get what you pay for".  I'm using it to clip on my golf bag so it is for background only but if anyone is using this for sound quality...spend a bit more for quality.
5,√Ä date il fonctionne super bie
2,The sound was not as loud as I thought it would be. Ok for indoor music not outside .
5,Musique ext√©rieure de la maison

2,Pour mes classes sur Zoom j'ai besoin d'un speaker. Celui-√ßi a tr√®s bien fonctionn√© par rapport au son et la m√©thode d'utilisation. Il est par contre difficile √† charger puisque le "insert" est tr√®s petit et j'ai pas aim√© √† chaque fois le brancher  j'avais peur de le casser. Finalement c'est ce qui est arriv√©. Il reste un mini bout de quelque chose qui l'obstrue et je ne peux plus m'en servir.... very dissapointing!Mais quand il chargeait √ßa durait longtemps et le son tr√®s bon....oh well.
3,I was really excited to receive this considering the price and reviews were good. I bought it specifically for listening to music while biking and camping.Unfortunately the biggest downer for me was that it is not 360 surround sound like it says it is! The sound only comes out of the front where the buttons are making it difficult to hear if you aren't right next to it. The sound itself is okay but nothing amazing though I'm okay with that considering the price.
4,Comment faire pour connecter 2 speaker en m√™me temps j‚Äôai essay√© plein de fois comme il est indiqu√© mais sans succ√®s
5,Works great in the shower and on the golf course and BBQ.Great value and arrived on time
