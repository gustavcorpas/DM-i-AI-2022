4,Its good but the lends cover doesnt fit...
5,It isn’t brand name but it works just like one!! Seems very durable. Passes the outdoor test for sure!
4,Showed up on time and is good quality.
5,Fits perfectly good price
5,Good quality and it simple works as it should :)
3,I installed this on my Canon EF-S 55-250mm Lens. No amount of tightening would keep it on it would simply fall off when carrying the camera. The lens is 58mm dia. as are the threads on the hood I don't believe it is made for the telephoto lens. I returned the product.
5,I wanted a lens cover this is it
4,I picked the wrong size. It works on my other len.
5,Used on my canon camera
3,It's an okay product I didn't like it because you could see it in the pictures and that was going to be more work when editing.
4,La pieza es insegura cuando se adapta no tiene un agarre sostenible.La tapa protectora del lente pierde también el agarre en su borde original dado el nuevo borde que no tiene enganche para la tapa.
4,nice product
4,Firstly it arrived on time. I was extremely skeptical about ordering a tulip hood at such a low price but needed one in a pinch for a new project. Don’t let the price fool you….extremely pleased with the product for the value. It easily attaches unattached and does it’s job
5,just got it have not tried it but seems like a great value fast shipping
5,Fantastic product! Shipping was fast and easy as well!Just what I needed for my camera.
4,The installation is inside of the lense sometimes it appear in the picture you have to readapt or correct the location.
4,Lens hood fits snuggly on my Canon telephoto lens. Using it has been no trouble.The only issue is that the hood screws in where the lens cap locks in meaning I can either have the lens hood or cover the lens with the lens cap but doing both isn't really possible at the same time.It's not exactly a deal breaker but something for future users to know.
5,Shipped on time and good quality
4,Quedo muy feliz con el producto
4,Works good! Perfect for the need just fits oddly.
2,This cap screws onto the end of ur lens and IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE LENS COVER TO BE PUT ON. It makes it a big hassle to take on and off get one that is reversible
5,Bueno para el precio
5,It did the job nothing to crazy.PROS: it worksCONS: not reversible
5,Like still finding ways to use
3,wrong size for Canon lens
3,The greatest irritant I have is my lens cover doesn’t want to stay on especially when in the bag. I’m less than thrilled that a $10 part may endanger my uv filter and lens!
4,camera!
5,The hood is a perfect fit for the lens. Worth the money.
5,Fits great on my canon DSLR 77d with a 18-55 range 58ø head size. A little over priced but does the trick. Be sure to measure your lens before purchase!
4,Product will be used for photos taken inside
4,Form fit and function…check !
5,Just started off photography and heard so much about this piece and I absolutely love using it.
5,It's sturdy and fits as described 3d. Works as intended.Great value..
5,Fits perfectly
3,I was assuming this would attach like most hoods do to the outside of the lens but this hood screws into the filter threads so you can't use the hood and a filter at the same time.  Hood works fine but I always have filters on my lenses so it is a no-go for me.
3,There’s no instructions on how to put this thing on. It’s okay for the price.. update The consumer of this product reached out to me to rectify whatever issues I was having. I appreciate the good customer service. Thanks for reaching out and your willingness to help
3,You get what you pay for! Barely screws/stays on can’t put the lens cap on it with this on…pretty much all of the reviews are correct. It’ll work if you’re desperate but that’s about it
2,Doesn't tighten onto lens. Seems to do so  but if bumped or pulled it comes off lens..
4,Loving the new look
5,Like the durability and fits all my camera lenses. Good value for the money.
5,Great hood. Does what it’s supposed to do. Doesn’t get stuck in the threads.
4,This is a great hood for the price. It looks and fits great.For the reviewers who complained about it not aligning right when you tighten it down screw it down as far as you can with it lined up how you want it then rotate the lock ring down against the lens to lock it in place.For those who’s lens caps won’t fit my caps are Canon LC-58 and work great with the hood.My only complaint (and why this just got 4 stars) is that I cannot use a filter with this hood. It would be great if I could.All in all for the price it’s a great hood.
5,Really enjoyed using this. It makes a huge difference.
3,If you’re using this for long distance photos outside and you’re not planning to zoom in this should work just fine.If you’re planning on zooming in be mindful you’ll see the hood in your photos(But I’m also an amateur at taking photos)
4,I’m content with what I got. The lens cap defiantly adds a high dollar look to my camera. I love what the lens does and it has defiantly been super useful especially during outdoor sessions.  The only issue I have is when zooming the lens cap is often seen in my images. Though it minimal it’s still definitely noticeable. Overall I’m really glad that I own the lens cap.Ps. My camera is the canon rebel T6i with a 58mm lens I purchased the 59mm lens cap and it fits perfect.
5,I had an outdoor photo shoot for my photo class and it was supposed to be a real sunny day so I ordered this lens hood. Not only was it a real value for money but also very practical. None of my pictures had any lens flare. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Can't believe I have been into amature photography for this long and have never used one of these.  It does make a world of difference when shooting in the bright sunshine.
4,It works well. I only had it for a month or 2 before someone stole my camera bag. Used it on my Canon DSLR & it does make a difference & cut down on glare
1,First off it is difficult to screw on the hood to the lens second once on any little bump just causes the hood to come off. It didn't work for me on either one of my lenses. If you decide to get it good luck otherwise look for something else
4,When you have your lens zoomed out all the way on the edges you can see some black plastic which is cause by this product.
5,Can't beat the price..
5,Excelente producto
4,When I have the lens at 18mm I can see the edge of the mount.
5,For a telephoto used for nature and  moon pics.
4,It works great but it was hard to thread. The other one I have is easier to use.
5,Queda perfecto
5,This is a review for a black piece of plastic that cuts the glare from the sun. It works and is only 6 bucks. Screws on the front of my short and zoom lens perfectly. Make sure you buy two if you have two lenses as screwing this on as you switch gets tiresome really fast. Worth it.
2,It’s a fine hood but if zoomed out you can see it in the corner of my photos.
4,Love it!
4,Fits my canon T8i nicely
5,Fit my cannon camera nicely.
5,I wasn't sure if this was going to fit my camera for the price I paid but it is a perfect fit. If you are looking at this for your camera and it lines up then get it.
3,Lens hood will not allow for a filter to be attached to it so the filter has to be placed on the lens. As long as to don't need to change the filter this isn't a problem (I guess). I also have the edges of the lens hood on the edges of the closeup pictures. I'm not sure if its the hood or the lens. However I never encountered the problem on the lens hood of my 25-135 lens but I did may more for that lens hood.
2,This product would have worked fine except it screws into the inner threads where my ND Filter would go instead around the outside of the lens like a native lens hood. I did figure out how to attach the hood to the ND filter when I screwed the ND filter in first but since it's a variable ND filter the whole lens hood moved with it when it turned and the tulip bits would show up in my shot. Could work in another instance but didn't fit my needs.
1,This attaches by screwing onto the 58mm threaded end of a camera lens. Despite 45 years using SLR cameras I dismissed the screw-on mount as not being a big deal but it is. The included screw on "spacer" ring helps only a little. Unwary users may foul up their manual focusing ring unless adjusting it with care and getting it adjusted to "level out" and properly align to camera's orientation is an awkward mess that may or may not stay where you put it. Leaving the worst part for last: Due to the poor build quality on the end of this lens hood the usually reliably attached lens cover pops off with the most gentle of bumps. I might use this lens hood but the jury is still out and dropped to 1-star when I realized there is no recess for the lens cap to lock into AND adjusting to orient it on the screw mount is nearly impossible. Simply NOT usable!
5,Sturdy and offers protection fro bumps and scrapes to the front of the lens. The lips rotate to any position to help stop sun flare. This shade works well with ND UL and polarizers filters of the same size.
2,Lens cap will not stay latched into this hood as it should item is so cheap it is not worth returning.
5,I have a canon rebel t7 and this works perfect. Comes on and off easy. I just have to remember which way to turn! Great buy!
5,The Tulip Flower lens was everything I expected! Great price fantastic look on the Lens!
5,I used to use products of another brand but their quality is far from as good as yours. Your products are in line with the high-quality products advertised. I am very glad that I have changed brands， I love this stuff. It's great
4,Very nice purchase with this little guy. I was looking for an inexpensive hood and this one worked out just fine. I am an entry level photographer so I am not taking the greatest photos but I do see the difference this hood creates and it's great. It's a great deal and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a similar product.
5,I have been needing one of these for a while and it was exactly what I needed.  Fit perfectly
5,Great product for the money. Fits my camera very well and I’m very happy with the quality!
3,Hood screws into the inside of the lens or filter not over the lens like many lens hoods
5,Might take a few tries to get the fit right after the camera auto-focuses. You'll know if it's not right because you'll be able to see the edges of the lens hood in your pictures. You'll just have to rotate the lens hood until you no longer see it through the eye glass fully zoomed out.
4,Great price.
3,This lens hood fits my Canon 55-250 mm IS STM lens OK but once the lens hood is installed I can no longer attach the lens cap.  This has NOT been my experience with other lens cap models that I have purchased for my other lenses in the past.
4,Great price
4,Easily screws onto the lens however you cannot leave the lens cap on at the same time that was the only disappointing feature
5,Practico
5,Works good the only thing is when your lens is wide open the two long tips of the hood come in the frame. Overall it does what it is supposed to
5,Worked perfect! Happy and it was cheap!
5,I loved that when I take pictures now that I don’t have a glare from the sun
1,Very disappointed mine came broken.
5,A great accessory! And a great price! Fit my lenses perfectly just like described!
2,For an amateur photographer who does plenty of work with my camera and very little budget to spend on accessories I was counting on this product to help me.  Problem is that because it doesn't really fit my camera well -- even though it was listed as compatible --  it doesn't turn properly when the camera focuses.  Often I get tips of the hood in my pix.  I dealt with it because the nature of my work often calls for cropping so I can remove the unwanted spots.  But I don't use this much anymore because I don't find it worth while.  Too bad 😞
5,Muy buen arriculo
5,Will be great for sunlight contr!
5,I use this and keep this on my camera all the time. It makes for great pictures and keep the harsh light out of pictures. Worth it!
5,It has been more than a year since I used it. A great value for money.
5,well made and strong good foe the price to
5,Awesome works just as good as real canon one!!!
5,Does the job well.
4,Takes a little practice to get it on just right. I have a Canon camera and the hood works well when it is on correctly. If it is screwed on crooked it does show in the pictures. Overall it is a very good product for the price.
5,Fits like a charm.  No issues on my camera.
5,Fits great on my camera
5,58MM Tulip Flower Lens Hood "value for money"and "thickness
5,Absolutely amazing lens! Love it!! Great quality and durability. Well worth the $$!
5,a
3,Doesn’t fir on Canon SlR its better to get original Canon brand
3,It gets the job done but it looks tacky and cheap
1,As others have pointed out this just screws onto the lens via the filter screw. Problem is if you do this it is longer than a standard filter so if you add an actual filter you start getting vignetting at the wide end of the lens. Additionally the whole point of the bayonet mounting for a tulip lens hood like this one is to keep the petals of hood aligned with the framing thereby preventing the petals from being in frame when you take a picture.
5,Does a great job fitting the lens and protecting it. Glad I bought it!
5,Does what I bought it for. For the price it’s great.
5,Fits great and works great.
4,This lens cover screws on not just clicks. You need patient enough to line it up just right to get it on well. When it’s on it works very well!
5,Love this tulip hood and love that it didn’t cost too much ! The material is sturdy and I love having this for my camera it’s my first lens hood and I’ll surely be buying a spare (to be safe) and one in a different style :)
1,These don't work. They won't align properly with the threads so the tulip isn't mounted properly. The tightening ring doesn't tighten because it's cheap plastic and it just jumps it's own threads.Worse is that these don't properly allow the lens cap to fasten properly. A tiny bump and it pops off.Total junk. Returning.
1,Not very effective for my use.  Threads instead of clicking on like some others.  It actually showed up in the corners of some images.
5,Bueno
5,Fit perfect
5,There is some minor vignetting when using it with on wide angle shots.  My purpose is to shoot wide angle views of star constellations that I crop anyway so it works beautifully for that and noticeably shades out a nearby street light.
5,great
5,Great lens hood for those afternoon shots. This eliminates lens flare from the bright sun when taking pictures. Works great and stays attached to the lens and is so easy to put on and take off. No issues in using this lens hood.
4,Great for what I need if for and is the perfect size of you don't want any of your view obstructed. Just note that it is not reversible.
5,Fits well priced right does it's job.
5,Great
5,This lens hood fits my Canon SL3 perfectly. It's well constructed and at a fair price!
5,Product was exactly what it stated it was .
5,Easy installation.
5,Just what I needed at a great price.  It worked perfectly for the outdoor pictures I took.  Although sometimes I forgot to move the hood according to where the sun was.....but that is operator error!  I can't wait to practice more outdoor pictures!  Thank you for a great product!
5,Great product for the price
5,Exactly what my husband needed.  Good product!
2,I got this for my canon rebel t7 and this lens cap shows in all of my shots which was disappointing. It also screws all the way down on the lens instead of twisting and clipping on so watch for that.
5,Good value and service.
5,This is a big disappointment. Like my Pastor once said if something is pulling you down. Just Run as fast as you can.
3,The ring that attaches the hood to the camera is very difficult to turn since the material is thin and the ring bends (collapses) when you mount it on the lense. If the ring was more robust it would be a better value.
5,It blocks out glares great!
5,Love it on my canon
5,Great price and the hood works great.
5,Product was easy to attach to my lenses. And very durable and constructed well and reasonably priced. I would recommend this product to others. Should they ever need a product of this type. I am very pleased with my purchase
3,I used the lens hood but the lens cap could not be installed with the hood on. The hood is a screw on vice a twist and lock. It's okay for its use but as I mentioned the lens cap cannot be installed with this hood on.
5,Awesome Tulip fits perfect!Great quality! Easy to put on your camera!
5,I bought this for one of my 58mm lens' perfect fit quality construction only took a few minutes to line up correctly and screw onto lens would definitely buy from seller again
4,Everything what I expected.
5,Works very good.
5,If your even slightly serious about photography u need these
5,Works great for a cheap price. Helps with pictures in the sun on a canon t6i rebel
2,I had a bit of a struggle with this hood and wished that I had purchased a round rubber hood instead. It attached easily but like I said before for a beginner like myself I would have benefited from an easier hood to navigate. I ruined tons of shots using this type of hood.
5,The Tulip Flower Hood Was Delivered Very Early Thank You I Love It And It Fits Perfectly It Also Arrived In Good Condition Well Packaged
2,This product is threaded and must screw into the front of the lens which is very inconvenient. It was rather difficult to get the threads started correctly. The front element of my lens rotates when focusing which changes the orientation of the lens hood resulting in vignetting on wide angle shots.
1,The tulip will screw into the lens but the ring that goes on before that allows you to move it will not fit the Canon Rebel T7
3,Cannot use lens cap with shade installed on lens this is the only problem I found
3,Received hood for Nikon Camera requested replacement. Fit is questionable dont want to strip threading.
5,Great product! I needed these tulips for blocking sunlight which causes blowout in some images. I don't mind the blowout for some scenes but it's not welcomed in others. I use these often and love them!
5,I am a 3rd Generation World travelled photographer with 26 years of GLOBAL PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE.This is a great product inside and outside of the studio.
1,This just screws onto the end of the lens and doesn't use the bayonet attachment on the lens.  If you screw it all the way down it doesn't align squarely with the lens and if you don't screw it all the way down it will spin freely.  Even if you get it aligned squarely with the lens the corners are still visible in the viewing field at the wider viewing angles.  You can't put anything else onto the end of the lens when it's attached including the lens cap.  I returned this item and bought the Canon name-brand lens hood.  I am very happy with my purchase and don't mind that I paid considerably more to have a product that actually works as advertised.
5,Tried them and they work well. Overall I’m happy with them. Hope they’ll last awhile.
5,I received this in two days. Very fast shipping. Product was exactly what it says. Great quality. Doesn't look cheap or flimsy like some of the others I've had in the past. Well worth the price
1,I wish I could have read the review that came out the day after I ordered this thing. It took over two weeks to be delivered and in that time others have pointed out how awful it is. I mistakenly assumed these were all the same. But it does not attach in a way that you can attach anything else including the lens cap. So to use it I would have to leave the lens cap off. Or take it off to put the lens cap on. That sound you hear is this $7 piece of plastic which probably cost 7 cents to make hitting the waste basket.
5,Awesome
4,I found that the lens cover doesn't fit when the hood is used
5,Features two threads the internal thread that fits into the camera lens and an outer thread to lock it in place.
1,I really do not like that there is no thread for your lens cap to fit.So to use this you have to.1 - take your lens cap off.2 - thread the tulip3 - when done for the shoot un-thread the tulip4 - replace lens capI will be returning this. That's just not very convenient.
5,I love it
5,Works as it should good product
5,Excelente
5,Ok
4,I prefer the soft lens hood but it works well.
5,Totally looks cool and works just screw on and your good
4,Very good!
5,Great quality piece. Exactly what I thought it was.
5,Love that it fitted to my camera and can use it perfectly.
5,I am beyond happy with this purchase. Built very well and does the job right! Don't hesitate on this camera addition! Works great on my Canon Rebel T6i
5,Exactly as described. Would recommend!
5,For the price it’s fantastic does the job. It does attach a little weird on EOS lenses but it will screw on and stay.
3,It fits my lense just fine but I am regretting not getting one that flips for storage since my lense cap does not fit.
5,Take photo to the baseball team
3,bad for small mm lens
2,Shows in video of camera pictures and I think I was missing a piece
1,EditI got this for the canon t7 kit lens it’s threads are so poorly made it nearly felt like it would break me lens trying to get them on. I would return them but the packaging I got for them doesn’t have a barcode for ups to scan so I guess I can’t.The company reached out by email and gave me a refund. Although I still don’t like the product I can say they have great customer service.
1,Does not fit on a 58mm lens.  It screws onto the end of the lens and is too small for my Canon 58mm lens. I will be returning it.
3,Quality of the product was fine.  It did not fit the Rebel t7i lenses that we hoped to use them on.
5,Can fit a on Canon Rebel T7
5,Not much to say.  It works
4,Tiny!
3,Works like it should
4,nice fit.not tried as reversed hood so not sure if would work that way or not.
5,Nice hard plastic screw on hood. Works well for my canon t6 factory lens. I have yet to test it on my other lenses.
5,Purchased for my Canon D3500 .  Fits the 70-300mm lens perfectly.
5,Good product. Haven’t used it much but it feels like a quality item
5,Great Lens Hood. Love it. Fast delivery easy to install.
4,for the price it cant be beat fitment was perfect. but the feel of it is somewhat cheap. it gets the job done and I cant complain.
1,It’s cheap and you often get what you pay for. And it’s plastic meaning the thread are super difficult to line up without cross threading it to your lens and it’s fixed and not swivel which is what I thought I was getting but again you get what you pay for.
2,Hard plastic threads and lock ring were hard to thread.  They were not cross-threaded just didn't thread easily.  Other than that it does what I bought it for - protecting the lens.  Also cannot cap the lens while it's mounded.  Rubber flip down hood might be better for me.  No issues with shipping or buyer.
3,Good
1,Did not like this product  you need to make sure leave enough room for cropping out the shadows this product leaves in your photo's
1,Completely worthless!  I wish I would have read the negative reviews better.  Doesn't work.  Doesn't thread properly.  What good is it if you can't put your lens cap on?  Don't waste your time.  Don't waste your money.  Total Junk!
5,Great quality and price
1,Doesn't fit the cannon kit lens or zoom lens. Too long of threads and it always in the shot. Poorly manufactured and not enough of an angle to not show up in shots. Immediately threw this piece of garbage in the recycling.  Don't waste your money pay a little extra for the real deal because this ain't it.
5,Just what I was looking for!
5,It makes no difference
5,Blocks UV Rays
5,Fits onto my lens perfectly and is a strong plastic very durable.
1,Every single hood or filter I have ever bought has no issue placing the cap over it. This hood has no channel carved into it for the lens cover to snap into. I do not know if this is a manufacturing defect in the one I received or if they are all like this. If this is how they are designed it means you have to take off the hood every time you want to attach the cap. What a pain in the...
4,I am really satisfied with tulip flower lens hood
1,This product has a weird way of screwing onto the lens and you cannot put a lens cover on it. I haven't even used it because of this.
1,Unable to reverse the mounting for storage nor can you affix the lens cap while the hood is on. Also the edges of the hood are visible in the photos meaning you'll either need to zoom in to avoid capturing the hood in the photos or you'll need to crop everything in post-edit.
5,Works perfect on Canon s6
5,It fits nicely.  So far it seems to be Ok.  Plastic not quite as thick as I'd hoped but with reasonable use I think I'll be OK.
5,Quick fit
5,Great seller. Will use again. Highly recommended. When I look for camera equipment/accessories  I search this seller first.
2,I bought this for a Cannon SL2.  If you screw it down all the way the cap shows up in the picture.  If you don't screw it down all the way it moves.  I would not recommend it.
3,Product did not fit as expected but seller contacted me and is sending a new one to me.
5,I'm always happy to get what I actually ordered! Very happy with this product!!
1,Read the description thoroughly!  I didn't and later learned that it attaches to the filter threads.  That being the case its very difficult to take on and off.  Which wouldn't be a problem except when its mounted you can no longer put the lens cap on!  Unless you want this hood permanently on your camera and you don't care about exposing your lens to the elements forever then this hood is not for you!
2,Note before buying you CANNOT put the lens cap back on once the hood is put on your lens. If you don't care about that its an ok hood. I unfortunately wanted one to keep on my camera with the lens cap on.
1,My Canon Rebel t7 lens cap will not fit the 58mm Tulip flower lens hood that I purchased through Amazon! I won't utilize a lens hood that doesn't accept a protective lens cap so my time ordering this product was wasted and I'm very disappointed.
5,Its great for its price.
5,Works as advertised. My wife loves the camera accessories.
3,It works but does not accept a lense cap like other hoods.
1,It does not fit canon EOS 90D as stated. It’s way off in sizing also the packaging states “fits Nikon”…
5,Great product
5,Fits the 18-55 mm stock lens for my Canon Rebel Ti3 just fine and as long as I keep the zoom around 30 or higher it's not visible. Not bulky and I like the extra protection for my lens.
5,I have a Canon T1i and a T3i and these work great on all my lenses I am very happy with this product. Very Happy Very Quick Delivery I would shop here again and you can't beat the price
5,Great quality a perfect fit..
4,Sweet
5,Nice product. Very happy with purchase.
3,3 stars
2,Fits fine not expensive but I haven’t tried it out yet.
2,They had a very small depth to the actual tulip part.
1,This lens hood is a waste of money. It just screws on to the end of the lens and doesn't actually work as a lens hood because it spins freely unless you screw it down all the way. It doesn't make use of the bayonet attachment site and is just a general pain to deal with. Take my advice spend a few extra bucks to get one that works.
5,Love Love Love
3,Works well.
3,It is an ok product. Definitely does the job but moves quite a bit. It also for some reason sticks out in my pictures. Either way not bad for the price
5,Well made fits perfect for a t5 cannon
5,Good quality
1,Two problems with this hood:  1) grooves in plastic and it is supposed to screw onto the lens.  It does not. The grooves either are misaligned or not cut properly.  It falls off with a touch regardless "how far" it has gone on (which is not far enough).2) Even if it could be installed the lens cap cannot be used on the lens.  The hood must be removed first.
5,superfast shipping and excellent products! Easy to communicate with and they follow up. I have bought several products from them and they all work well. Thanks.
5,Very good
1,I've also had nothing but bad a bad experience with this hood: doesn't properly fit my Canon kit lens when it should lens cap doesn't fit when attached isn't really practical for anything other with a shorter focal length... You're better off doing a little research and spending a bit more for the real deal.  This was a waste of money and time.
2,Recieving the hood in the packaging I found nothing obscure. However the product was a bit odd since a part wasn't screwed onto the hood right; the hood cannot be put on backwards with the lens cap on top. Bit of a disappointment. I recommend buying Canon's official hood.
5,Great savings!  Great product!
5,FAST SHIPPING and EXCELLENT quality for the price! Thanks for the free micro-fiber cloth too!
5,Love it!
3,Fair quality
5,Just what I needed when I needed it.
1,As others have said this is a waste of money. Once attached you can't even put the lens cap on. Threw it away.
5,Perfect and worked great with my lens.
5,It for canon 80d works fine for mine good quality
5,Good item to have especially on a sunny day. Fits my canon camera well.
5,Like it
5,Great product
5,Great product came in time and works perfectly for me !!
1,Don’t buy you can see the corners of it in your photos. Defeats the purpose. Sad I was hoping this would help me with shooting earlier in the day.
5,Great for the price!
5,Worked great with my 18-55.
5,Recommend
5,A very good product which is built with the highest quality. Very satisfied and would definetly recommend this product to those who are looking for a 58mm camera hood.
5,Great product and fits perfect on my lens
3,Thought it was a better quality!
5,Better than i expected! Totally recommended!
2,Maybe just me but I have a heck of a time screwing it to the lens. This is true both for the polarized and UV filters and whatever lens I'm using. Looking for another one.
5,Love it! Perfect and was exactly what it said it was. Fits perfect
2,NO era de la medida justa del lente de la cámara que describia en la compra del artículo
1,The description said it was compatible with Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS IIIt's not. You thread the lens hood into the lens so when you focus you get the lens hood in your shot.This also happens when your zooming.Also is very ineffective at actually blocking light.
5,Best to have one on your camera
2,Very difficult to attach to the lens. Goes on crooked and damaging the threading on the lens
5,Fast Shipping A+++++
3,not very good
5,Nice Attachment
1,This wont work and even when I try and slowly try and get it to screw on I don't wont to force it and cross thread the threads.
2,Takes a long time to attach compared to reversible hoods.
2,The coating for this hood is more reflective than I would have liked. The coating is better on Alturas dedicated lens hood. I'd expected the same with this hood. This hood also crops your picture when zoomed out fully. I should have purchased the Canon version but for the money I won't return 'em.
5,Excelente producto
5,Perfect fit
5,Good
1,The lens cap doesn't fit for Canon cameras. Also seems to long as I can actually see the lens hood in the corners.
5,Nice For Pictures!
2,One can see the lens cap on pics when used with wide angle.  But works fine when zoomed above that.
5,Camera
1,It shows the edges of the Tulip lens.
5,Fits well does a decent job.
1,False advertisement ! Doesn’t fit the canon 90d
1,I have a Rebel T6i with a 58mm lens and it won't fit. Too small! Very frustrated and I don't know why mine didn't work out like others but definitely was a waste of money for me.
2,Not happy as I pay the price for this
2,You can see the shadow of these hood at picture edges... not good... t5i

5,what I needed
1,not the right lens hood. for the Canon right one was pick up @ Henry Camera shop. right hood was ET-60 Japan.
5,great addition to my camera stuff.
5,Quality product at a very good price. Fast shipping.
5,Fits well
1,Poor construction
1,You got 7$ tulip which leaves black corners on every your picture. Thanks for awesome trash product.
1,It didn't fit onto the 58 mm lens I use. It's the canon EFS 18-55 for reference. Very disappointed.
1,Don't  buy.
1,This lens hood covers part of the camera lens so you're forced to zoom in. I like taking wide photos and having to zoom in limits my ability to.
1,Can be seen in frame! Had to remove it.
1,The size is not right it doesn’t fit on my 18-55 lenses
1,Got what I paid for.
1,Doesnt fit right on my camera
1,Does not fit the lens well. Take some effort to align it correctly.
1,Broke super easy not worth the money
1,It didn't fit to my camera
1,Doesn't fit my Canon lenses
1,Cheap
1,Horrible
1,Doesn’t let you put a Lens cap on
1,Did not fit snug at all.
1,Doesn't fit Rebel T7i 18-55mm lens.
1,Does not fit canon
5,fits correctly just what i ordered. :-)
1,It doesn't work. The view is obscured.
5,Perfect - great value!
5,Perfect!
3,Fits but is not reversible and does not allow for use of a lens cap If left on camera it leaves lens exposed for damage.
5,It fits and works perfectly and looks cool too!
4,It's a gift for Christmas so it hasn't been given yet
3,A lens cap will not fit with this lens hood on.
5,Great
2,Very difficult to thread. It will only thread on with a bit of force and many attempts. Lens caps and filters CANNOT be used with these... personally I will not store or pack my camera without a cap. Could be a lot better but  I suppose that for the price it’s not bad.  If you’re not overly concerned about keeping your lens pristine screw this thing on and never take it off  because putting it back on will be a pain!
3,Sure it's a super cheap hood. But that's what you get: a hood that cannot accept a lens cap nor be reversed. Reversing the hood is kinda stupid IMO but not accepting a lens cap IS a deal breaker. That means you have to screw this thing on and off constantly. Came in an accessory bundle I bought would definitely not buy this thing standalone. Spend the extra coin get a hood that accepts a lens cap.
5,I love it! I have a Canon Rebel T6 and it fix just fine of course you have to make sure doesn't show the corners at the time of your shot but I will recommended.
2,The lid causes vignette on lens unless zoomed in. Im not willing to give up picture quality and angle for protection against a little dew or rain. Im sure there are coverings that get the job done workout the issues so this was a waste.
1,This doesn't screw in well to the lens.  Nor can you have a UV lens protector on when you put this hood on. AND the lens cap won't fit either.  This is a terrible design.  Wasn't even worth trying to send pack.  It is recycled now as it is of no use.
1,I've owned a couple of these lens hoods and they are horrible. Don't waste your money. These hoods are threaded into the lens where filters attach. The threads are fine and strip very easily also same goes for the lock ring. I recommend   58MM Reversible Flower Lens Hood (2013 Update) for Canon EOS Rebel (T5i T4i T3i T3 T2i T1i XT XTi XSi SL1 650D 1100D 550D and More)         instead. It costs 10 cents more and attaches to the outside of the lens like the OEM versions.
5,works great
5,So I recently ordered an entire DSLR kit and the hood that came with it was the wrong size for my lens. Ordered this one and it fits as it should. Have not had a chance to use it but what could go wrong? Its a lens hood you screw it on and it helps block stray light entering the lens. A must have for your bag-o-tricks.
5,Great ! Fits Perfectly
5,perfect for my camera setup( canon eos rebel t7i)0 buyers remorse
5,El precio
2,masomenos
4,I have the hardest time using these.

5,No comment
5,a little hard to get on was only problem
5,Fit my camera well.
5,Good material. Fits nice.
5,Excellent value for the money. It does what it is supposed to do it keep glare away from your Lens. I am very satisfied with it
3,It worth for the price. But if you don’t zoomthe lens and have a wide angle one it is going to show part of it in the picture because it is screwed inside the lens instead of outside like the reversible ones.
5,works great
4,The tulip helps shade the lens when shooting pictures at glare angles to strong lighting. It also adds an extra layer of protection for the lens against incidental damage. The materials it is made with appear to be sturdy and durable.
5,Product operates as expected and fits well...
5,Excelente y muy buena
5,Really good for its price and it’s very useful for taking pictures outside
5,Good price easy to install and durable material.
4,Really good product and value!
1,This acts like a $3 Item.  Falls off never stays on ALL Ridged not the flexible top and ridged bottom like the OEM for Cannon.  I had 3 people try to screw it on my lens.  Didn't work for me.
5,Works perfectly
4,It clicks into place well but it's difficult to seed the lens cap in its Bezel.
5,Se siente muy bien funciona
5,Good fit and does the job!
5,Item as described great quality and shipped fast.
5,Compré el parasol de 58mm y es un excelente producto la calidad del material superó mis expectativas y se adaptó perfectamente al lente 18-55 mm (58mm) de mi Canon T6. Además de dar un aspecto más profesional mis fotos en días soleados ya no tienen "flare" (reflejos de luz)
4,A little hard to screw on end of lens works efficiently cost is worth buying
5,Producto idóneo para proteger la luz hacia la cámara
5,Bon produit facile à installé excellent rapport qualité prix.
5,Does what need it to do
1,Dosen't fit on my canon t1i don't buy
4,as described quick shipping
1,Please don't purchase it
4,I like my purchase
4,bien contetn
2,I have the Rebel T7.  Lens cover will not fit on when the hood is in place.  Never had that happen before.  Can't use it because I need the lens protected.  Buyer beware.  Hate buying when you cannot try it.
1,No ajusta y no queda bien
5,Purchased it to use on my Canon T6i camera and it's various lenses.  This lens hood fit like a glove and works as it should.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
