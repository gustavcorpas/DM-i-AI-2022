5,TL;DR: I was burned by being a cheapskate buying a compatible off-brand now I will only buy Brother ink.Although brother ink is already priced low I was being cheap and bought an off-brand that was supposed to be compatible with my printer. After originally detecting the off-brand my printer stopped detecting it while it was still a full cartridge. So lesson learned don’t be a cheapskate and buy only original brother ink. Unless you wanna take that chance and end up with almost full color and black cartridges that are unusable (unless you’re willing to siphon the ink out of the unusable cartridge -not an easy feat but doable- and put the ink into an empty cartridge)
5,EASY TO REPLACE... GREAT  QUALITY
4,The ink cartridge is never completely used up.
5,OEM ink cartridge. Does what it’s supposed to do
5,It seems that the printer always wants more ink. I swear if I didn’t know better I’d say my neighbor was stealing it when I sleep. No wonder printers are cheap. Besides gasoline I also complain about the price of ink.
5,Good printer. Bad ink! Not factory. Never again.
3,Very easy to install but after printing the first page it was very light in color. I preformed a ink head cleaning and then it worked great. But now my ink level is half way gone. Not worth the money to buy this brand named item
5,I always use this brand because it's a good brand and color.
5,Like it
4,The ink was a little faded during print jobs.
4,print any documents I need.
5,This printer cartridge is very easy to install.
5,The ink arrived on time. The price was okay. It worked as expected. I will purchase again in the future.
4,I'm not sure if it's the amount of ink in these cartridges or my printer but the ink gets out of the cartridges very quickly even though I never print anything other than black and white copies. Even the black ink disappears too fast. I print less than 5 pages per month and most of them are much less than full pages. The red blue and yellow are neve used but the inks goes out of the about every 3 to 4 months. I think this is excessive.
5,Not sure if they really last as they claim.
5,very easy to install Just wish they would last longer
5,It works
5,These are the perfect size for my use and the price is just right
5,Very good items
4,this is a great product overall however it does not live up to the 400-page quantity of available print usages. that number is much less. not sure what it actually is but its not 400 pages.
5,My sons use product for their college work
5,I will reorder this product again.
5,Easy to use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love it
5,excellent print quality
2,My cyan ink cartridge came empty & there is no way to get help. The 800# is a joke I don't have 30+ minutes to toy around with the stupid auto prompts & everything for a $9 cartridge.
4,It's ink. I have to have it so I buy it. There's not much to review. I don't know what sheerness is in terms of ink. The print quality is good and the price is what it is.Made the mistake one time of buying a generic brand ink and was warned when I put it in the printer that it might damage the print head which the generic brand ink did so I now always buy the brand of ink sold by the printer manufacturer.
5,verry good
3,I think it's too expensive for these ink cartridges. What you pay for one ink cartridge if you wait for a sale you can buy a brand-new printer with cartridges? The product worked fine.
5,I don't know if it's a good value but I know that I'm not happy that Brother ink dissipates quickly when not used for periods of time.  It's a function of the printer not the cartridge I believe.  Never experienced that with other brands of printer.
3,There is no way you get 200 pages per this cartridge. I have printed maybe 35 pages and its already low on ink. I get spotted lines (yes I cleaned nozzles) and still get the same crap print quality. Sometimes I get lucky and it prints great. But I can guarantee I wont get 200 pages. I cant return it because the "close" date has already passed.
5,I ran out of black ink as I was working on something  so I ordered  this and got it next day. I was able to complete my work on time.This is a great printer and these ink cartridges are very easy to replace.
2,I've gotten the more expensive brother ink from Amazon and I'd say this isn't the real deal. Cheap ink. Il use it up but definitely won't be getting the cheaper ones anymore. Stick the the real ones. That's why they cost more.
5,Good deal
5,I give 5 star because even though I can buy maybe 2$ cheaper locally because I have get car and drive if I don’t need gas and drive 6 miles then go in store which I then might spend more money for other things I don’t need then drive back home and have drivers remorse on the other stuff I got Sooooo here I have it delivered next day and install which is so easy. This lasts as any other and color is yes Black. Omg it is actually as described in description. So buy it save gas money and other stuff u don’t need.
5,SATISFACTION
4,I opened the box then the first package. The first one had leaked all over inside the packing. Since I am in serious need of black ink I could not return the entire box. Second one I opened was fine and I am praying the rest are fine.
3,I’m a moderate printer - it’s not what I do for my job or or anything but I swear I felt like I had to replace these cartridges so fast. Expensive for the amount of use you get out of them. But maybe that’s an industry problem and not isolated to this brand.
1,3rd time I've purchased the brand of ink for my printer and the 3rd time the ink fails.  After cleaning which also uses up the ink I get a few more pages and a cleaning is required again.  Most of this ink goes to cleaning.  I'm going back to the generic inks.  They last a lot longer with only the initial cleaning.  More bang for less bucks.
5,Have to finish printing 25 forms.
5,Just great for the money
4,have this on a repeating order.
5,I liked that you can get single colors
5,Product works just as expected
5,hope it lasts a long time
5,Very small cartridge
5,I like the product snd the price..i use it for Brother printer
5,No ink =  no printing.  Quick delivery means being able to print the day after I order.  What I print looks professional crisp and clear.
5,Over the past 30 yrs. I have been around all different brands of inkjet printers and have discovered that OEM inkjet cartridges are always the best value in the long run.
4,As with all ink pricey
2,The quality is good but it only lasted one month! I've always purchased a generic brand of ink that has similar quality but lasts for months.  I've very disappointed in this purchase.
4,The product was fairly easy to use.  There's a plastic film that covers the ink port that was annoying to remove for persons with large hands.  Aside from that  this was a great product.
5,The ink works well I used it to print out both a document and pictures and they came out looking good. It was a good price and came quickly. I’m very happy with my purchase.
5,Love these ink cartridges for my small Brother printer.  Excellent print quality.  I have even printed pictures and displayed them in frames.
5,The ink is packed safely and very good about shipping quickly which is alive saver when printing needs to be done quickly..  wish the price could be lower for budget but still will order  as it is needed for labels
5,So easy to install and quality is spot on
5,I ordered from them before and was completely satisficed with the product
1,Ran out of ink when cleaning color heads -Before even printing anything in color with brand new cartridges. What a waste. I paid full price for the proper name brand cartridge.
5,Excellent buy. Nice to be able to buy just the one we needed and at a very reasonable price. Well wrapped and delivered quickly.
5,The price was excellent and arrived promptly. Works as well as ink I ordered from Brother.
5,I received this on Nov 2nd and by Nov 14th I have to order another one. The ink was low when I first installed and then it did not work.
5,Learned to only order Brother Ink for my printer.  Off brands do not fit!
4,I use this for my home computer/printer. For personal a business use.
1,I printed five sheets.  Then got a low ink notice on printer.  Thought it was my printer.  Went to Walmart bought another cartridge.  Installed and it worked.  So cartridge was not full
4,I received my product 2 days after my order (Prime).  Well done Spacebound!
5,Not sure how many pages a single cartridge prints but I can say I it last awhile.  I print a lot of paypal labels in a months time and I usually do not change cartridges maybe every 2.5 month or 3.  One of the reasons I picked this printer b/c of the low cost for ink cartridges.
5,This product was easy to purchase and saved money when only needing to buy one ink cartridge. Printing quality is good!
5,Use regularly.
5,The Brother printer cartridge arrived in a timely manner and the print is exactly as described.
5,Just what I needed!
4,The ink works great.  But it is much higher than using off brand ink.
5,Print quality
3,The product it is fine what baffles me is that you new printers like Brother's are scamming their customers by requiring colored ink when I only wanted to print black and white. The cartridge works no problem.
5,works well
5,Brother printer cartridges are by-far the easiest to replace of any printer I have owned. I am convinced that using genuine printer ink is the way to go. I believe the life and performance of my previous printers was adversely affected by using off-brand inkjet refill cartridges.
5,I bought the black ink cartridge for a "brother" printer model MFC 895DW. I've found that the quality of generic cartridges varies. So I buy the name brand but do resent having to pay such high prices for the cartridges.
5,Good value and good print quality. Good value
2,this black finished so fast so somethings wrong
5,this printer cartridge did what I needed it to do.
5,The ink arrived the very next day after I ordered it. It was very easy to install and was compatible with my printer. Also the quality of the ink was satisfying.
4,I am very happy with the performance of these ink cartridges for my new brother laser printer. Easy to install and prints very nicely.
5,Fit the printer well. Only criticism is the low productivity. Seems like I am buying cartridges every time I turn around and I am not a big print user. Might be worth trying a third party vendor.
5,Genuine Brother cartridges are cheap enough that I use them and won't even hastle with clones. Print quality is awesome.
5,Not much to say could buy locally for sure no different in price except was delivered to my door next day and did not have to go anywhere. Product was good and easily installed.
5,Works well with equipment but colors don't last very long..
5,Great price fast shipping.  Great print quality. No issues
5,Order arrived quickly.  Easy to install.  My printer is set up to order cartridges from Amazon when ink is low.
1,Half the ink was gone after running my printer through 3 cleaning cycles and print test pages.
5,Product works as expected
5,THANKS SO VERY MUCH ....
3,We do not print very many papers I would say less than a 100 pages since we installed the cartridge less than a month ago.  Now it shows low ink again. Apparently this particular cartridge is a waste of money. I would recommend choosing different
5,Great product
5,I love just ordering this and not having to drive to a store. Although sometimes it prints lightly. Not sure if it’s the ink or my printer. I haven’t tried any other inks.
5,Printer
5,Good price and prints well.
5,Good ink buy this.
5,THE ON LINE INFO DIDN'T  STATE THAT THE PRINTER HAS A MULTI PAGE FEED  IT WAS VERY EASY TO SET UP TO WORK AND PROVIDES GOOD PRINTS I HAVE NOT TRIED TO DO PHOTOS
5,as described
5,Use only the Brother cartridges for best results. Prices are very good on Amazon. Very easy to install and no mess installing them.
4,I do not know if they last long enough
5,As described
5,Distinct product works well with my current printer. It always delivers quickly and it's easy to install.
4,Ink for my Brother Printer.
5,It works.
5,This is easy to install.
5,Works. It’s the cartridge right from Brother.
5,This cartridge prints more than the package says. Thanks for the extra dose of ink.🤗🤗
3,The ink doesn't lat very long. Printing 10 pages uses up half the ink cartridge.
3,Be aware that printer "pulls" ink from color cartridges even when printing ONLY in black. Also IF your printer is still under manufacturer warranty using generic ink cartridges will VOID the warranty.
2,I don’t know what happened here... the cartridge was empty in a few days. Half gone after only 10 copies! I got around 100 or less copies even after setting it for lower quality print. It took longer than usual to get I think it traveled from the east coast? Anyway already had to get a replacement. This thing just dried up and went kaput!
5,price could have been better
5,Good quality and long lasting
1,DOES NOT YEILD ANYTHING CLOSE TO 200 SHEETS WORTH OF PRINTS.I printed just over 50 sheets of black prints before my Brothers printer told me that the Black ink cartridge was out of ink.If you must to use this cartridge I recommend buying more than 1 because it will not last very long. You just might find yourself like me - an upset customer writing a bad review because when I needed to print something for work today and I can't.
2,This product should last much longer! I am very upset.  The printer is for personal use when I need to print important documents or letters.  I do not have money to throw away!
5,happy with this ink
5,I got this for my brother printer as replacement. They last long time and they are good equality.
5,Good quality but it would be nice if the price was a little less expensive.
5,Great printer with easy ink replacement makes my life simple... Out!
5,Quick delivery. Product as expected for a reasonable price.
5,Good
5,I use this ink in my Brother MCC-J497DW printer and I am pleased with it.
5,Is ink works as it should
5,I always like this product. Great for my printer.
5,I wish it could print more than 200 pages but that’s what you get when you buy an inexpensive printer. You pay up the wazoo for the ink.
5,Reasonably priced ink cartridge that lasts a good while.  The compact size is great too.
5,Personal use.
5,Product came fast and worked great
4,like the size and function
5,Great price and quick delivery
5,Brother ink is expensive. Have used brand x inks with some problems. This ink is seeming to do the job
1,Do not order this faucet. It does not fit the standard three hole vanity. The sink stopper post is offset so it doesn't align with the holes.
5,Good item and good price for
5,Price is amazing!!!!
3,I bought two refills previously and the ink was weak from the get go. This one is darker than the last but nothing like the original.
1,Didn't get anywhere close to 200 prints before the printer told me the cartridge was out of ink already. I barely bought this like a month prior and I don't really print often. I probably printed about a total of 30 pages of documents (no photos) and 1 print head cleaning and then the cartridge read it was out of ink. How is that possible? Where did the ink all go?My printer is barely about a year old so I know there shouldn't be any real major issues that would contribute to the ink loss.I get more prints out of the compatible cartridges than these genuine Brother cartridges.Very dissapointed at the quality of these genuine Brother Cartridges these days.
5,Like
5,I tried the others that are cheaper and they do not compare and Brothers will not talk to them like telling me how my ink is doing so I will use only Brothers ink...
4,Works for me.
5,Fast shipping. Good price.
5,It was a new brand name printer cartridge.  It works great I really like this printer.
1,I barely used it maybe less than 100 pages and was empty. Take your chances with the generics and save yourself some money this product isn't worth the price
5,This ink arrived a day early and I am SO very happy!  Thanks!
5,Use for my printer
5,This ink came within 1 day of ordering and is exactly as pictured.
5,It does what it suppose to do. fast delivery when u are in the bind.
5,Amazing shipping prints perfectly and got it just in time for college mid-terms.
1,Bought 4 different colored cartridges for a Brother MFC-J497DW printer on October 31 2020.  I've printed somewhere between 10-20 pages at most.  Today I got the dreaded cartridge is low message for the yellow color and all others are less than halfway already.  I had noticed the cartridge levels going down by themselves.  Considering that buying all 4 of these "genuine" cartridges are the price of buying the printer I might as well switch brands.  Not satisfied at all which is a shame since this printer has lasted longer in terms of print quality than other brands I've tried before like Epson.
5,Simple to use and install
5,very satisfied
5,great! I am a college student & my only complaint is the ink finishes out way too fast besides this it is awesome!
5,El cartucho es de muy buena calidad por eso lo compro
3,I am having to replace cartridges every couple of months  even when I dont print in color and have it turned off.
5,Bought for work printer.
1,Does not even come close to 200 pages. Rip off.
5,These work great easy installation!!!!
5,Excellent product and arrived quickly thank
5,As advertised
5,I was out of no and needed it fast thanks Amazon Prime for having everything at my fingertips!
5,2nd time ordering these cartridges as m happy with them
1,Bought this in Feb. and by March cartridge was EMPTY very few prints made.  Almost no ink in cartridge what a rip off.  Stay away from this!
5,Ink is great for general uses.
3,The blue cartridge leaked during shipment and didn’t have any ink
1,Printed 3 pages and the ink is empty!!?? Complete waste of money!!!! What a scam!!! Don't buy!
5,Ink quality is very good.
5,Very good. What to say else.
5,Ran dry within 25 copies junk I returned as defective
5,I love brother and my real brothers lol
2,The product was not suitable but when I made enquires to return it the shipping costs were more than my refund so why return it?  Quite ridiculously disgusting!!
5,Really great!
5,Great product!  Amazon makes ordering everything on here easy and saves time!!!  Can’t find in stores.
4,Great
1,Way higher price than generic brands ink went quicker than others quality does not change big difference. I take it as lack of corporate effort. Sitting on laziness arrogance and effortlessness.
1,I repeatedly tried to get this ink to function but was likely given something that something that a child or evil doer tried to refill or manufacture and then the product that I received was sold to me as an quality product.
5,Good
3,Does not last as long as it claims... Can never get more than a couple of dozen printed pages
5,These printer cartridges are excellant quality.  I placed one in my printer as soon as it was received.
5,Very easy to install and prints a great deal of pages.
1,I’m pretty livid. I’ve purchased several of these cartridges and they all require replacement long before the ink has been used up. But this one specifically I just installed last week after the other one ran out. It’s a brand new cartridge name brand and it’s jammed and can not be read. I use this printer for work and these things are not cheap for how often they have to be replaced. For it to be jammed and unusable after one week is beyond disappointing and an absolute racket. All of these cartridges require replacing before the ink has actually run out so I already have to replace them often anyway. I’m shopping around for new printers because this is ridiculous.
5,N/A
5,HOME AND WORK USE.  RELIABLE INK AND GOOD VALUE
5,Works like all other yellow ink cartridges.
5,So much cheaper than in store and looking for right cartridges.
5,Worthy
5,It runs out quick.  That's it.
5,It work great... Good price.
5,Looks good so far
5,It’s printer ink for a brother printer it does what it’s supposed to.
5,Easy to install excellent print quality.
5,Good price use for home
5,Worked as described
5,Easy to replace.
5,Rooting for you Brother printer at a reasonably good price
5,ok
5,Fast ship and works great!
5,Ease of set up and multifunction use.
2,Just popped this bad boy in yesterday printed a few things and.... its dead.... also yellow which i also replaced yesterday..... only printed word documents just buy  a laser printer
1,I just bought this ink cartridge a month ago and I don't print rarely.The last time  I saw it was full after I print 2 pages.  The next time I started to print the inks was very low.Did they sell me defective inks?I would not buy this again you will waste your money.Bad inks
5,Great item Great Price!
1,I was only printing a few pages for my elementary school child's homework. The ink ran out after a few days. This doesn't feel right.Update: I ordered a new cartridge this morning at the time of arrival I looked at the cartridge. All my others look like they have ink in them at time of arrival this looks half empty if I turn it over it has ink in there but this one is not showing any ink at all.  I am really disappointed but don't have time to send it back because I have to print school work for kid.
5,Shipping was fast and the price for brand name ink was very good.
5,Great product. Price and ease to order
5,Brother ink is great and i find no fault in the ink..
5,Limited use to date but I like buying OEM.
5,Good stuff no issues price is good compared to local retail places.
5,Great printer easy setup
1,Only printed 18 pages (one side only) before showing out of ink.
5,xmnnndxn
5,A little less money. And I couldn't locate these cartridges locally.
1,I usually dont write reviews but I am LIVID that I paid extra for same day delivery and was delivered a cartridge that the printer doesnt recognize! I ordered the same cartridge I order from office depot and it isnt working. I go to settlement today and needed paperwork printed last minute. I am handicap and pray that I can find a place to print for me last minute! BUYERS BEWARE!
5,Was better than expected
5,Excellent buy and convenient to order on Amazon!
5,printer accepted cartridge immediately!
5,Like
5,This fit my printer and so far is working great!!
5,I am completely satisfied with the printing quality of this ink.
5,I like the price but runs out often
1,I bought this months ago to print some address labels. I printed maybe 10 pages of labels and I can't remember more than a dozen or so other pages printed since. Absolutely positively no way I printed more than 50-100 pages of standard dpi period. Today my printer is asking for more ink even though there is some left. The software prevents from printing until ink is gone so now I'm forced to by another cartridge to print a single page. Very very irritating.
5,Great product!
2,I put this in my printer and within 2 days I was getting the "low ink" warning again.  🤔I do an average amount of printing.  Not excessive. The cartridge that came with my printer lasted me almost 2 months.  I guess we'll see how long the low ink warning let's me keep printing.  Very disappointed!!
5,This is the correct ink for my printer
5,😊
5,Good price for these ink. Does it's job.
5,X
1,Had new ink cartridge installed. made less than 10 copies then it was empty. What? didn't even use much of any color. What a rip off. Works well but for not long. Use only black ink now. Ridiculous
1,I have almost 75% black ink in my Brother printer but still can't print text documents without color cartridges. This product is useless alone and should be bundled with color. It doesn't matter what setting I pick I can't print a simple form unless I buy more yellow ink now just so I can print in black. The low rating is because this is the first black ink cartridge I have ever seen that won't let me print something that is black. Apparently Brother's own words it lacks the "quality" to be able to print.
5,got the work done
5,Perfect
5,Great quality and fast shipping. No problems
5,Good quality
5,Is wonderful
5,Just like get in store
5,Came extremely fast! And works great with my printer!
5,Worked as they should. No complaints.
5,ink last quite a while even I’ve been printing color
1,Message low on ink was coming after printing ca 50 ...
5,Solid product
1,Only printed about 20 pages on the same day I received the cartridges and I started getting low ink warnings again. when put in the ink cartridges for the first time the printer showed the cartridges at full but after the 20 page print it depleted all cartridges.  The settings on the printer were not set to high quality to overuse the ink it was set to "quick print" mode to save ink.
5,I like it
5,Ok
5,very good connection with my MacBook
5,Great value
1,Cartridge leaked prior to opening so my hands are covered in black ink and I have paid for a cartridge that is almost empty!  I tried to do the right thing and call customer support at Brother but after 15 minutes of listening to nerve grating music I am simply leaving the negative review BE WARE when ordering from BROTHER as they apparently aren't concerned with customer support and satisfaction.
5,Wirks
5,Easy to use lasts long
5,Printer
5,great
5,Works perfectly with my brother printer.
5,Good value
1,I ordered this printer cartridge knowing that I would need to replace my old one very soon. Today I installed the new printer cartridge and received an error stating that the printer cannot detect the printer cartridge. I was sold a defective cartridge and I cannot exchange it nor return it. I'm pretty much out of luck. Buyer beware!
1,This ink caused me more problems than help. It printed fine at first then ended up clogging my printer. I cleaned it out tries to unclog it and even bought more ink but now my printer isn't reading the black ink. This is has been very frustrating and I have to buy a new printer now to get my work done.
1,This is the second time I have purchased and had a problem with this ink cartridge. In less than a month I receive the “replace ink cartridge” error and cannot print. I rarely use my printer and it is impossible that I would have to replace the ink cartridge in that amount of time.
5,No problems
1,I just put in the C and Y about 2 weeks ago and printed maybe 3 pictures if not 5.  Today I replaced the M and when I printed a picture I noticed lines so I went and decided to do head cleaning....well the M now has less than 1/4 and the C and Y are now empty as printer is telling me to replace.  Can't believe this.
5,Just as expected
5,Great
3,Too pricey
5,Great ink pretty good price willBut again
5,Great ink. Great price
5,Awesome product!! 1+1+1+
1,Popped it in my printer and this is what I got. I homeschool my kids (actual home school) and I use my printer a lot for their lesson plans. With everyone doing the same it's been frustrating keeping ink in supply. This cartridge read empty after my first print. That's absolute theft considering what the cost of the ink cartridges are.
5,Works as it should.
5,perfect
1,The cartridge was only half full when it was installed I had to keep it since I needed to print and was out of ink  Disappointed Amazon
5,Will buy again!
5,Good fit
5,Always work for me
1,While I bought this cartridge several months ago I kept it sealed up and just installed it a week or so ago. Well I had to clean the print head TWICE which used over half the ink. It is already down to a 1/4 full.I purposely bought the Brother cartridge thinking it would provide a perfect match and give me exceptional quality and value. That was definitely not the case. So I guess it's back to the cheaper "knock-off" cartridges!
5,works fine no problems
5,Muy buena calidad
5,Will buy again.
5,I like Brother's product
1,Ink does not last at all.
5,Awesome will buy again
5,Ok
5,Brother delivers great products PERIOD!!
5,Great
5,Excellent value for a great product
1,This ink cartridge arrived with only a small amount of ink in the cartridge.  Barely registers enough on my printer for the printer to work.
5,AWESOME
1,The package arrived on time no issue with that the issue is that the ink is not working properly. When I print something in black it comes out with lines through the words and it's very blurry.
5,Great price and delivery!
5,Work as expected.
1,I purchased this black cartridge and 3 color cartridges all together from amazon. After printing total of 3 pages the ink stopped working.  The cartridges are still full but nothing prints. I had to run to office depot urgently and get genuine ink cartridge
5,Good
1,My cartilage was less than half full. I was hesitant buying and apparently I was right. Never buy this and Amazon should discontinue this product because they are obviously not filling all the way full.
1,why made it automatic delivery every three month without my awareness?  It's very sneaky! I already have three of this item piled up.
1,I used this ink for about 5 standard pages of printing no photos just a typed letter and it has already ran out. Do not buy
1,I had ordered this product before and I always felt that the ink didn't last very long. Since I don't print at home very often I would replace the ink about once a month.After reading some of the comments and feeling curious I  printed a few work documents until the ink ran out. As I stated in the headline I got to page 42.
1,Printed 10 pages and now shows low ink. I feel ripped off. Do not buy
3,Soso
5,As expected
1,The ink I bought did not work in my new printer it is supposed to be original and it did not work.  Now our work is more difficult by not having that ink in good quality.
1,After limited use and a few weeks the cartridge displayed “out of ink”.  This was not worth the money.  Either the cartridges are defective or they are not filling it up with ink.  I may have received 20 printed pages before this condition presented itself.
1,What a scam. I printed like 3 pages and the printer is saying the ink level is down to half. Never again.
1,Beware!! I honestly believe these aren't genuine cartridges. I installed 3 NEW cartridges and had to clean the nozzle heads since they weren't printing anything. After the test page I had 1/4 ink left in 2 NEWLY installed cartridges. The black half. Unreal. I read this is an ongoing issue with other customers. The product is likely not genuine.
1,It said it yield 200 pages but didn't even yield 10 pages.. the hypocrisy. I was extremely disappointed with the fact that I couldn't even print out 10 pages. Very absurb! Not sure if I could get my money back. The saddest part is you can't use another brand.  I wish I could give it 0 stars.
5,Perfect
1,I purchase this ink replacement on March 3 even with the Shutdown not even 200 pages printed my printer is already saying this is almost empty. This is office use for documents only no pictures or photos used. Totally disappointed. the genetic ones last way longer and for way less.
1,No ink.
1,As soon as I installed the cartridge into the printer. the printer indicated that the level of the cartridge was only 3\4 full.  I would it returned it but I had a project that had to be printed.  last time i buy it!!!
1,Waste of money  did not work. fitted well but no ink
1,No me sirvieron las tintas por más que trate salen muy mala la calidad
1,Product came damaged sat on hold with Brother for over 30 minutes and was unable to return
1,I believe I received a bad batch
1,Unfortunately the ink that I  yielded less than 200 pages - probably around 50-75 pages. Not a good value at all I would not recommend.
1,my printer will print in color but black won't work. item is definitely defective.
1,This print cartridge is terrible. It prints as if it’s out of ink already and I just opened it and installed it (yes it’s installed properly and printed fine during the test print).
1,This ink cartridge did not print anything only while blank sheet coming after printing
1,The product review said it would yield approximately 200 pages. I was only able to print 75 pages before it ran out.
1,These ink cartridges ran out so fast.
1,…
1,Easy to install but didn't last. Not sure why a product I just received ran down so quickly. Now product was open and tape shut. Did. It last me week
1,The cartridge was broken when I opened the package. The ink poured of of the cartridge.  Please refund this purchase.
1,I don’t know what happen but this ink comes empty I only print like 30 pagues and it get empty I cannot believe it
1,Doesn't work with brother MFC-J497DW.
1,This cartridge was completely dried up when I opened the package to use it 2 weeks after receiving it.
1,Only lasted for a few prints. Not a happy camper!!!
1,Paper is always jamming and running into issues
1,I bought this thinking it was the LC3011bk ink but got LC103bk ink instead.
1,1/2 way of ink
1,Crappy piece
5,Great no issues.
5,Great quality ink makes very sharp images.
5,Very convieniant.  My printer tells amazon it's hungry and the apropreate  Bother cartrage is sent.
5,Amazing prices on Amazon...
5,Really nice for your phone
1,This is so bad.  So very bad.  It's the ink.  The cartridge simply won't print in black.  The color that is used the most.  I have purchased three.  None of them work.  Works in other colors but those are not needed 90% of the time.  Very very disappointed.  Was told this is a good printer.  It is not.
1,The price of this ink is insane at that price I might as well go to the print shop and have it done by a pro.  Thankfully there are other options on Amazon.
1,say paper jam and stops working BUT there is never a paper jam.
1,If you need a number 3211 or 3213 do not buy this number.
5,the unit I purchased did come with ink cartridges but...they are small-ish so these were obtained to further the usage they last twice or more as long as the 'starter' cartridges.
5,Printer was running out of ink new cartridges easy to buy receive and install
5,It does not last long enough  but it’s good quality
5,I absolutely love brother ink I have it set up to come to my home every couple of weeks the quality of printing is awesome!!!

5,What can I say they are ink cartridges they fit my printer
5,Works great
5,Print good affordable and easy to install. Overall pretty happy with my purchase. xoxo Maia
3,Why is ink soooo expu
4,This product should be cheaper as it consumes ink way too rapidlt
5,I only like Brothers personal products and this works well with my printer and I'm very satisfied.
5,Good find.
2,I don’t know why but it took about two weeks for the cartridge to arrive. Had I known it was going to take that long I would have purchased it somewhere else. I cannot stress enough how much I dislike this Brother printer for so many reasons but the selection of printers was nil when I had to purchase a new printer and of course this thing was available.
5,Great
5,Funciona super!😍
2,I put this cartridge on my printer brand new and after printing once the Yellow level on the display is already down. To make it worse I was printing in black and white! I get that printers are sold cheap to overcharge on ink refills but I wasn't prepared for this type of thing. I will need to keep it because it's needed but I will consider getting a new printer instead. Maybe a laser printer could save me the trouble especially since I mainly print B&W. I get that my case might have been an outlier but it's still disappointing.
5,Like product
5,This is a great value for the money and easy to install. The ink also lasts a while!
5,To avoid printer issues like I have had in the past I will only use Brother brand in my Brother printer..
5,Authentic official Brother printer ink. Excellent quality.
5,Came on time and as described works great easy to install
5,Great price quick arrival.
3,Description says 200 pages worth of ink but I only print on average *maybe* 15 pages per month. This is the 2nd purchase in as many months! Also I have a problem with their pricing.  The product page shows a "one-time purchase of $8.49. The "Subscribe & Save" cost indicates $8.07. HOWEVER as soon as I add it to my ongoing S&V list of items the price bumps up to $8.63 -- MORE than the one-time purchase! Ridiculous! Not playing that game; subscription cancelled.
5,It’s the original so it’s worth it the extra couple bucks to not deal with the problems of fakes.
5,I like that I can always find the right inamazon
5,My Brother MFC-J87DW is almost 10 years old and has never given me a single problem. I'm always willing to pay that little bit more for name branded ink and they have never disappointed yet!
5,Lo sigo comprando!
5,Well worth it and great value

5,I always buy the Brother brand ink cartridges for my printer. This Brother brand black ink cartridge was fine arrived promptly and was as expected. However it cost almost twice what the price of the exact same product at London Drugs or Staples.
5,Finally a printer that satisfies every need without being impossible to figure out.
5,Muy buen cartucho el original a buen precio el envío lo mejor en un día.
