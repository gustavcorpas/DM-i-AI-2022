5,I bought a product similar to this about a year ago when we cut the cable TV cord.  This one works GREAT too!  The reception is better than the previous one and I get lot more channels.  Great for cutting the cord.
5,I like this antenna. Everything arrived correctly. The pictures on signals 60 miles away were great. It does a much better job than the "flat" antenna I had previously. I stream most of my material but this is a great way to get local channels. Especially on game day!
5,I am over 80 miles away from the city and am still able to get excellent reception. Clear images; clear sound.
5,This new version of the antenna is much better - I get a lot more channels now and they come through crystal clear. I also like the kind of cat shape of it - popped it in my window and it looks less like a plastic blob and more like a window decal. It comes with many mounting options too.
5,This antenna is very decorative. It doesn't have the bland look of traditional antennas. It blends in with the decor and is able to pick up channels from miles around with Crystal clear clarity.
5,This is a definite upgrade from the $20 antenna I had installed before. Easy to place long cord and I'm not sure about the range but after running I had 78 channels whereas before I only had 63. There is a noticeable difference between this antenna and my $20 one and this one is the clear winner!
5,Works as designed! Overall good!
5,Love this antenna! Saved me hundreds of my cable bill by being able to get local channels without the cost of having a cable box! I recommend this product 100%..
1,Bought new looked like a refurbished item. Had scuffs and scratches cable looked damaged. Picked up zero channels on two separate tvs. I live in a pretty big town so maybe that’s the issue however we have quite a few local channels and it didn’t even find those.
5,I am very impressed by this product. I am finally able to watch TV from my basement. The antenna has been placed barely above ground and I can see the major channels in HD. I have never seen any signal with other antennas I got 55 channels with this one.
5,Its perfect Antenna with long range i recommended to everybody.
5,Easy to set up and good picture quality
5,great antenna picks up over 100+ channels comes with allKinds of fittings to attach to wall or on tv easy to install light weight easy to hid behind the tv
5,Really worth getting rid of cable.
