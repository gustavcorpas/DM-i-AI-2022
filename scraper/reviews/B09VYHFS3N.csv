5,Build Quality:  The device exceeds my expectations for quality and appearance.  The materials used are excellent and the speakerphone looks great.  I will say I did have an issue with the first unit I received which had an extremely low volume output.  I did receive a replacement which has been working very well.Speaker Sound Quality:The Speaker sounds great and is on par with other high end speakers.  -- Exceeded my expectationsMic Sound Quality  / Noise CancellingI've used this for several hours of recorded video and it does a great job at capturing my voice and cancelling out a lot of noise.  It doesn't pick up distant voices of other people in the room very well however-- I think this is due to the noise cancelling.  Frankly I don't think you can have it both ways (good noise cancelling without having some sort of interference w/ distant talkers) so overall I am happy with performance.  I think for recording speakers nearby or those who speak directly to the speaker it works very well.In Car Speaker Phone Performance:This works exceptionally well for long calls in a semi noisy car.  I highly recommend this for that.USB Cable:The USB Cable is a good length and allow for a reasonable use as a mic/speaker attached to a PC.Bluetooth Performance:I am impressed wit the Bluetooth connectivity and quality.  The range is good and the connection is stable.Carry Case:This does come with a very nice carry case.Final Thought:I really like the diversity of this.  I love using it for excellent voice reproduction as a speaker and for listening to audio on my tablet via bluetooth.  I also highly recommend it for a good quality noise cancelling speakerphone.  I recommend it.
5,The poly  sync speakerphone is awesome. Sound quality is great. Microphone quality is much better than my laptop mic. The microphone recording is great noise cancellation and Echo cancellation is really good.The speaker sounds really nice playing music also. Easily connect to laptop or phone via Bluetooth.It is also a phone charger so it is great practical for carrying around.
5,I liked how it looked and the sound is a lot more crisp than some other speakers I’ve used before. I’d definitely have it for my home office rather than a party that’s the vibe it gives off. Especially with the phone call button.The built in charger was super useful when I was packing for my trip this past week.
5,The sound quality on both ends (speaker & receiver) is great! This was so easy to set up & use. The battery life lasts for so long in between charging.
5,Sound quality is amazing and the fact that it also has a portable charger makes it the best portable speaker in my opinion. Also i love the Bluetooth feature.
5,This little speaker is super loud! The sound is great. It also acts as a charging port so that’s a plus.
5,I received this to test for free and it works great! So clear sounding and very easy to use and also comes with a carry case! Definitely recommend.
5,I love how portable is and great for those conference calls. Decent sounding for playing music! The design is amazing and sleek!
5,Long battery life was really important for me when I was looking for speakerphone for my laptop since I am always on the go. Noise cancellation was also surprisingly good. Overall I would definitely recommend
