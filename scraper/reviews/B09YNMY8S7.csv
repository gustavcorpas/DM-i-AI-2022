4,The screen on this tablet is tough to look at . I'm not sure how to explain it but essentially the screen looks almost like there are two of them one normal and one that's very blue. Together they make this weird almost popping color. It reminds me of when you look at something blue against something red.The tablet is decent and the kids can play whatever apps they want on there. Some more advanced apps they can't play but they don't mind they just download another game and play that instead. They love this thing and use it a lot. The battery life seems to be really good as well.
3,I grabbed this thing for my two-year-old little girl. The apps came preinstalled and I was able to connect and sync with my profile. This was not even difficult to utilize every application worked and never found issues with the software. This came with a USB-C and that is always a plus to use since the majority of all plugs are coming to a universal plug.The speakers are a concern because of their bad acoustics it is compared to "theater mode" if people are familiar with that term. The songs from Cocomelon sounded like they were echoing too much but my little one did not mind. The viewing angles of this screen are only direct as opposed to viewing at all angles the screen will fade. The colors are dull but once again this is a kids' table to use.To keep this in consideration my little one tossed and slammed this little thing and its functions well. As a parent I would teach her and show them how to use electronics with the care and this one is the right budget to teach it with. This is one tough tablet that survived.
4,This is a perfect tablet for my little one.  We only use it if we go out to eat since service is slower in a restaurant and he gets restless in the highchair.  My only cons are that the screen protector included is very flimsy.  I cleaned the screen thoroughly and it still had multiple air bubbles across the entire screen.  Can't seem to find a protector for this specific tablet but I'll keep looking. Also I can't change the date/time. It keeps saying I have to contact the admin and is 9 hours ahead. I'm in EDT.
3,This tablet is definitely durable for kids. However battery life is less than desirable. It advertised that it had apps preloaded such as Netflix Disney etc. nothing was loaded. You can‚Äôt even put Netflix on it. You can‚Äôt download Netflix it‚Äôs not preloaded so we couldn‚Äôt access shows for our daughter. Additionally you can‚Äôt watch items that you‚Äôve downloaded without internet. Which we wanted this for a long road trip for our daughter so it became less than ideal and more hassle than a solution for boredom in a 12+ hour car trip. All in all spend the extra money and definitely shop around but would not recommend this one
5,I like everything about it. My baby is just to young to play the games right now but it‚Äôs a nice tablet. Very educational for toddlers.
3,Wouldn't know until the 27Th of this month
5,Good tablet  works great good battery life no complaints my son loves it.Has games loaded on it too .
3,It could've been a good value for money except it's not play protect certified meaning you're very limited with app downloads
2,Battery life definitely doesnt last as long as it says connected to my home wifi for a bit and now it wont connect to none not even my hotspot sound sounds like really really cheap like $1 head phones and the case already broke.
2,In order to have ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù from screen it needs to be hold in certain angle down from top.
2,For some reason it's not connecting to the wifi.... It's saying limited connection and nothing is wrong with my wifi... it's just the tablet only... I have had this time for a few months now
2,Fully charged battery lasts about 2 hrs.
1,The very cheap rubber protection immediately dislodged the handle resulting in a 45 minute struggle to reconnect it. Worse the Android 11 does not play nice with Google. It's refusing to allow permissions given such as the ability to change the time zone or location. I have removed ALL parental controls from the child's Google account but still download school appa etc. Hoping Amazon takes it back because without permissions it's useless.
1,I literally used this 3 times I keep it put up most of the time because I don‚Äôt want my child attached to it‚Ä¶. I pick it up today charge it up and go to turn on the turn on screen starts then goes black‚Ä¶..my child has never used this without supervision and never more than 30 min at a time.
1,The tablet itself runs kind of slow. But my big issue is that my daughter has only had it less than a week and it is already cracked somehow and not wanting to work well. My daughter had a fire tablet for over a year and it was very durable and never broke. I was very disappointed in the durability of this tablet that is meant for 2-5 year olds. I feel like I wasted my money.
1,Can‚Äôt download Netflix on this tablet tried many different ways but I think they have it blocked. You can download Hulu and Disney plus but my daughters favorite shows are on Netflix üòû
1,Does not work after 1 month of use.
1,The tablet has a password to need to restI need it
1,It doesn't work
1,I ordered this tablet for my granddaughter and it's running extremely slow. I need to know how I return it or a tech person to see what's the problem.
1,Its to slow snails move faster
1,Nothing is good about it
1,It worked 1 day having to call for warranty fix.
1,Mala bater√≠a
4,This tablet comes with software that you can choose to use or not in order to limit the things your kids can do with the apps and for how long. I like that though I only put apps on here that are safe for my kids and will only let them use it under supervision so I haven't tried to use the parental controls yet. It satisfactorily plays Youtube Netflix and Disney. It does have a bit of lag to switch between apps and load things but once it starts streaming it's pretty smooth so no complaints there. My biggest complaint is the screen is kind of dim not very vibrant and lacks contrast. My kids haven't complained so it's definitely not a huge problem but because its main use is as a media player I would like the video to appear better on the screen.It also came with a screen protector that you can choose to put on which I haven't but it's nice that it's included. And it's rubber case seems robust enough even though it's very pliable. The kickstand isn't very sturdy so it's best to set it on a level surface and there are 2 angles that it can adjust to. The kickstand only works in landscape mode. The camera quality is not great but it does give the kids something else to do for fun. It also comes with decent apps like drawing and games.The battery lasts long enough to get through a couple movies so no complaints.. and we can always power it with a cable if we need it to last longer.
4,The bottom line on this product is that it's a basic tablet that works for web browsing and videos has a few programs to facilitate kid safety (locking down most the tablet without a parent pin) and has a thick squishy case for protection.  It's not expensive at all for what you're getting.The included software is largely pretty cheesy but I was able to get into a mode where it would watch downloaded videos paint etc but not access the internet without my pin.  I think that's the best way to provide this to kids as wifi is ubiquitous.  You do need to use your google account and update the device to download software and it's fine for most games and all the streaming services.  I had no problem with Disney+ or HBO Max but primarily I just uploaded MP4 files from ripped Sesame Street DVDs.  You can get several hours of movies on here and not worry about internet access for streaming.The battery life is poor.  If you dim the screen reasonably it will hold up for 3 hours or so which is enough but obviously in a year or two that will diminish.  If you can use this plugged in on the road it's much better.Screen quality is great so is the touch feature.  Colors are bright a toddler can paint on this (with a simple but good app that's included) easily.  The child features are simple: open the tablet's included app set the parental pin and the tablet won't leave that app access the internet etc without the pin.  This app is not great quality but it worked.  You can find alternatives on the Google Play store and my opinion is you're paying for the tablet and the software shouldn't be a major consideration.If you leave the squishy case on here it's going to hold up to drops.  It's not that hard to yank the tablet out.  A child can definitely do that.  And if that case is removed the tablet isn't bezeled or tough or anything... it can definitely break if dropped out of the case.  For the car no problem.This is essentially a disposable short term tablet that can do most tablet things.  If you get this because it looks like a locked on tablet case that will take tough abuse you will probably be disappointed.  If you are trying to save a little money by getting a 'good enough' tablet that will be OK under supervision you will probably not be disappointed.
3,If you're looking for a ready-to-use tablet to give to a younger child without having to worry about setting up a google account or configuring a bunch of parental controls then this is a decent option. Quality wise it's middle of the road though so keep that in mind. The YouTube for kids app lags occasionally as do other apps and the battery doesn't last long when watching videos or playing games.The tablet comes with a screen protector that I'd recommend adding before giving to your child. The case is a bit flimsy so it wouldn't be too hard for a child to pop it out of the case as well. It does its job though and the tablet's display hasn't broken yet even with my niece throwing it onto the ground a few times.The preloaded kiosk app which features children's games and lets you customize the age range for the child works fairly well but my niece was bored with most of the preloaded games and allowed videos within a few days. I'd say most children over 7-8 will want other apps loaded onto the tablet which will require logging in as a parent with your google account.Overall this is an acceptable tablet based on the price point specs and preloaded apps though it frequently lags and doesn't have the best battery life.
3,We have been a family of Fire tablets for a long time now but I thought I would check out a different brand to see if we liked it any better. This tablet isn't a bad tablet but it's not super great either.The Positive: The carrying case is nice. It's easy to hold and protects the tablet pretty well. Setup was simple. I was able to link my Google account and download my favorite apps onto it.The Negative: The sound on it is just awful. It sounds like it's muffled but there's nothing blocking it. This could be remedied by getting a bluetooth speaker setup with it but it's a pain that it would even be needed. The battery life isn't the best. It's not terrible but not as nice as other tablets we have used.If given the choice I would stick with our Fire tablets.
3,This is a decent starter tablet for a child. It's a great alternative to keeping your little ones off of your own more expensive tablet or for keeping them off of your mobile device. It's great that it has the parental features too that way you don't have to worry about your kids accidentally messing up your own mobile device.It wasn't apparent to me that this one had a kickstand on the back at first. It's nice that it has one. The pink rubbery cover is removable which is convenient if you want to wash it off with soap and water (just make sure it's fully dry before you put it back on the tablet).If you take it on a road trip be sure to bring a compatible car charger.
4,I got this tablet for my 7 year old niece. It's a great tablet for educational applications. The screen looks good and the volume in the speakers are decent. The tablet does struggle with heavy apps like YouTube due to low memory but other than that it's good tablet at this price point. You're basically getting what you paid for. It's inexpensive and will keep your kiddos entertained.
4,This is cute tablet for small children starting out. The battery life last at least 4 hours with constant play. The screen quality is not 1080 a little fuzzy but okay for kids. The case is removable and washable. It has a handle and a removable stand. Easy to set up a parental guided account. No you can‚Äôt download Netflix. It also can fit in your purse.
4,This is a pretty decent Android tablet with some impressive hardware specifications. It is very easy to use and operate. The major reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the screen. I would love to see a screen with HD resolution (1920x1080) on this tablet.I sincerely hope that you would find this review helpful.
4,This is a very basic tablet for kids so don't expect a full on adult tablet with the same speed or display quality. It does work with wifi and comes pre-installed with games for my kid. The silicone cover is very sturdy and really helps to protect the tablet.
4,Battery life is not so great. Runs out too quickly. Screen quality okay
4,This is a sweet little tablet for kids. It‚Äôs not the fastest tablet you‚Äôre ever going to see but when you‚Äôre wanting to just play YouTube videos it doesn‚Äôt have to be blistering fast.Connect to Wi-Fi easily it was already up-to-date with the latest version when I got it and the protective case on it is really nice while still giving access to an expansion card slot and charging and volume control etc. The WiFi is pretty slow though so that‚Äôs the biggest drawback.This is a really relatively inexpensive way to let your kids have a tablet and keep them busy at those times that you want them to be able to have a little screen time and you have a little ‚Äúme‚Äù time.
3,Works well my my daughter she only three so it‚Äôs perfect.  The quality not great but for the price you sure can‚Äôt complain.
4,It is an ok tablet for a small child. I do like that it can be locked in child mode or used as a regular tablet.  It is a little slow and I immediately had to put in a memory card.  My daughter likes to play the pre-loaded games and we have also downloaded a couple.  I like rubberized protective case and it has its own kickstand made into it.  Affordable tablet that is great for a toddler but not really for an older child.
3,Works great limits to just the apps I want perfect for limiting kids or employees. It blew the speaker after only a few weeks but the seller has great support and replaced it. However I now am struggling with Bluetooth connections not working will update if I find resolution!
3,This is a cute small tablet. Easy to use. Need to have an account to hook up online access.  But very simple to do.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The size and weight of the tablet is great for my daughter.  It was easy to setup the tablet and parental control. Glad it came with some app in it like drawing helps my daughter with colors and arts. It is a pain to connect to a wireless headphone using Bluetooth.
4,I ordered this NORTH BISON kids tablet for my youngest because he'd been trying to grab his sister's tablet all the time. Now both children have their own tablet.And the feature I like the most in this tablet‚Äî is that it doesn't require an Android account or Wi-Fi to function. I don't want my child to have access to the Internet when he doesn't understand what it is yet or the Online risks. Yes I know about Parental Control feature but I don't trust it.Anyway I used my computer to extract MP4 and MP3 files from our favorite DVDS and CDs. And using a Micro SD card plugged into this tablet Built-in card reader I copied the multimedia files into this tablet for playing. I also added family videos and pictures.This works for us because my child likes to watch the same videos over and over again and this tablet plays them well. In order to make it faster I uninstalled the apps that my son won't be using.I also like that this tablet includes a child-resistant cover made from silicone. The battery lasts a few hours and I think that is definitely a good choice among so many kids tablets.
3,Cute & definitely on the smaller side which is great for smaller hands but the operating system is INCREDIBLY slow.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The tablet so far is not bad everything was easy to install the battery so far seem it last about a good 4 hours while using. It does have kid mode and came with preloaded apps for the kids plus I‚Äôm able to download Netflix and other apps with no problems.
4,Nice tablet for toddler!
4,There is some latency with this tablet. I suppose to be expected for a kid's tablet. One thing I noted was in order to "see" all that the device has to offer you must sign in with Google. You can bypass it and go to the internet where every possible app is loaded (very cool). It's small and easy to tote around with the handle. The battery life seems to run out quickly maybe 2 hours of life in it.
4,I ordered this tablet for my 3 year old who is ROUGH on things. The tablet itself is nice however the case that it comes in is not the greatest. It is very flimsy and the tablet sits very loosely in it. It is way too easy for my daughter to just rip the tablet out of the case. Tablet 5/5 Case 2/5.
4,Easy to set up.  Works well.  Battery life could be better but not horrible.
5,This is a cool little tablet. It's is adorable and my daughter loves it. It is extremely easy to set up and work. I like the ease of it more than the Amazon kindle fire and ipad. Probably because I have an Android cell phone. It comes with a charger and a SCREEN PROTECTOR!!! However there are a few cons. For one the screen protector has quite a lot of bubbles that I cannot get out. It could have been user error but I've put a lot of screen protectors on and I think it's just this type of plastic. Another big one is that it only has 3 gigs of ram. Videos play well but it does take it a little longer to load than I'm use to. Other than that I think it is a nice tablet for a kid. It has a camera and a spot to expand that hard drive so she can take as many pictures as her little heart desires.
4,There are lots of these kid‚Äôs tablets being offered on Amazon right now.  . especially by Chinese companies.  Many / most of them are either the same or very similar. .  .with one exception. . . The case.  This one has a handle on the top.  Some have handles on the sides.  Some do not have handles.This tablet has 32GB of storage.  You can add additional with your own microSD card.  It also offers Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.Overall this tablet works for kids.  But if you‚Äôre expecting an ‚Äúadult‚Äù full-feature tablet. . . This is not it.  You‚Äôre limited on apps.  .. Camera is basic.  . .Battery life is not that great.  But again for kids it‚Äôs ok.This tablet is Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.
5,So based on the other complaints the first thing I did after setting this tablet up was try to install Netflix. It was pleasantly simple - I'm guessing this was recently play protect certified because it says it is and I was able to download and launch Netflix without any problems. Just like installing any other app.As far as setup goes you just set it up with a Google account. It connected to wifi without any problems in fact the very first thing to come up on the screen after I turned it on was a prompt to connect to nearby wifi. It does appear to be 2.4ghz only so if you only have a 5ghz network you will not be able to use it. I have both (most current routers are dual band) so it wasn't a problem.So setup was easy it plays all the apps I could possibly want to use and the specs are pretty good for the price. 3GB RAM and 32gb storage is a steal at this price. The downsides are that the screen is rather low quality although I don't think my toddler niece is going to notice so I don't think it is a big deal. The sound is surprisingly not terrible and the case seems nice but we'll see how long that handle holds up.Overall I would say there are certainly better kids tablets out there but not at this price. A kids Fire tablet costs more than 2 times as much as this and I don't think it is 2x better. This tablet isn't going to wow you but it may just wow your kid and it will definitely successfully entertain them at a minimum without breaking the bank.
3,This is a small 7" tablet that works great for car rides and boredom busting activities I'd give it a higher rating if it was priced fairly. This is no where near the asking price of $70 compared to other tablets I've used. There are apps but it's a bit tempermental and glitchy when we try to download them. The camera is a basic point and show low res camera the overall tablet works great for just "toy stuff" and basic tablet play but they really overpriced it when it comes to quality. This is a decent tablet if priced according to it's quality.
5,Cute little tablet and case combo. Comes in nice with a good charge. operates very well for children and able to connect to wifi quickly. Have not had any issues. Does good so far with all apps.
5,Great for kids any age. Got my 4 and 6 year old one and they love it. I love that it already has a few learning apps on it. Love that it comes with a case and screen protector. I was very surprised at the quality of the screen. The words are easy to see and read. It works like a tablet you would spend 150 dollars on.
5,I love the fact that this came with a protector and it has a soft case with handle on it. This is great for toddlers and young kids. So much to do on it. I would like to say the tablet is faster than I thought it would be. Works great and parental controls are available !
5,I was looking for a tablet that was just a starter and essential for kids. This one was perfect it has just the right amount of apps and I love how this one already had the case and it's an ideal size.Highly recommend it and very inexpensive as well.
5,This tablet is definitely worth the price my daughter loves it. I used it for a few minutes and it is a little slow/laggy but I expected that with how inexpensive it is so I‚Äôm not going to take off a star for that.It does exactly what I needed it to do for my daughter to be able to use it and play games on it. She‚Äôs happy with it so I‚Äôm happy with it definitely recommend!
5,This makes me feel so comfortable with my little one being online. Most days she just loves watching programs via YouTube. I am able to control content and put safeguards in place. The screen size is perfect. The comfort grip handle is good for her little hands. This is a perfect transition from them constantly using your phone to having a gadget all there own.
5,They just love this thing and all the games and all that.  I like how I can setup the parental things for time limits etc.  A good value and it seems rugged enough to deal with how kids would use it if you get me.
5,Loads fast expandable good sound quality good camera battery longevity easy set up and kid permissions. Compact and protected. My little takes it everywhere
5,This is a great Android based tablet for kids.  I love the padded case that goes around it and it even has a  cute handle.  It has the play store so you can choose what apps to add onto it. It also comes with a screen protector which I highly recommend you put on right away.  There are both forward facing and back cameras. Comes ready to go right out of the box.
5,So far so good. Really like it
5,First of all I know the case withstands accidents since I dropped it within minutes of opening it. Not a scratch! I really like the parental controls and that apps are categorized. It connected easily to Wi-Fi and brought up pages and apps quickly. This is a great first tablet.
5,This tablet is such a great kids tablet for the money. It comes already charged and set up with tons of games and website links. The case is sturdy and has a good amount of flexibility for protection. It also has a pop out stand that folds up easily when not in use. The battery is lasting a long time from when I first turned it on. It's a good size and even includes a screen protector.
5,Got this as a gift for one of my many grandchildren - screen size speed and memory are quite adequate for children 's uses.
3,Kids Tablet 7-inch Android 11.0 Tablet for Kids 3GB RAM 32GB ROM Toddler Tablet with Bluetooth WiFi GMS Parental Control Dual Camera Shockproof Case Educational Games PurpleThe kid's tablet comes attractively packaged in a heavy-duty retail box that is made well enough I would consider it gift-worthy. Inside the box you'll find the tablet itself nestled in a foam cocoon with the purple rubber case already around the tablet. Directly underneath that it comes with a screen protector an instruction booklet a USB to USBC charging cable and a very short USB adapter cable which seems to be a USBC male to USB-A female connector which may be in there to help you transfer files easier from a dissimilar device. I'm going to put this on to charge while I take a look at the instruction booklet. The charge port is on the top of the tablet right near where the power button is located.The fold-out multicolor instruction booklet seems to be all about the parental control system that is pre-installed on the tablet and doesn't talk anything about the tablet itself.There are also no instructions about how to install a screen protector. If you've never put one on yourself there are a lot of YouTube demonstrations out there to help you along. Basically you'll need a microfiber towel or some type of towel with zero lint to clean off the screen first and you'll need a credit card or a similar piece of flexible plastic to smooth out any bubbles you get in the protector cover. If you get a bubble just work it toward the edge with the credit card until you smooth it out. Don't be surprised if you have an area that doesn't want to smooth out properly immediately sometimes they need to sit there for a few hours before they are 100%Putting the soft rubbery case back on was easy after putting the screen protector on as the case is quite flexible and soft. The carrying handle on top of the case is somewhat of a poor design. The handle has two small tabs that pop into cutouts on the case to anchor it and I managed to pull the top handle off of it twice while messing with putting the case back on so I'm pretty sure that my grandkid is going to have that pulled off in a matter of moments. Even with the handle removed it's a nice soft case for kids to hold on to but not an easy carry.Turning on the tablet it flashes on the start screen that it is Android go edition. I'm not certain what difference the go edition is I'll have to do a little bit of research into that.Looking at the ‚Äú About tablet" section in the settings it states that it is Android version 11. Unlike some tablets it didn't immediately send you through a setup program this comes complete and is already set up‚Äì you need only to log into your wireless network and put your Google ID information into the Play store. Looking at the available wireless connection the only Wi-Fi it shows available is a 2G band on my router and doesn't show the 5G at all. You might want to keep this in mind as it appears this will not function on 5G networks. Interestingly enough there was already a saved Wi-Fi in the system- I can only guess that is the manufacturer testing in-house before it left. Once I logged into my home Wi-Fi. I checked to see if there were any system updates and the unit had already performed an automatic update check showing that there were no updates available at this time.To add your own apps to this you will have to log in with your current Google password or open a new Google account.Setting up my Google ID the tablet seems to be a bit on the slow side. Installing kid's games seem to take quite a long time even though it wasn't a large download/install. I'm not certain if it's because the tablet is a bit on the slow side or because it's only using my 2G network and I'm used to 5G network speeds on my phone and tablet.Trying out one of the kid's games I installed the simple game seems to run smoothly and the sound is okay even if it's a bit on the tinny side.Trying something simple like playing a video on YouTube I'm not certain if it's YouTube being annoying or if it's the way the ads are set up on this page. The default setting for the size of the video makes it about a third of the screen but you can expand the video to full screen. While I was trying to play the video YouTube crashed repeatedly and would not open again. I had to restart the tablet to proceed.Even after a fresh restart YouTube seemed very buggy and cranky. Even using Google Chrome to surf the internet was slow and in some cases control buttons were unresponsive or very slow to respond.In conclusion this would be an okay tablet for a small kid but using it from an adult's position while setting it up I found it to be annoying and troublesome when it slowed down and occasionally froze.
5,Great value for the money nice size picture quality excellent
5,Just add email and Wi-Fi and you are all set! Comes with two charge cords one big one small. Great buy for toddlers only as there isn‚Äôt much space to on it!
5,My daughter loved this tablet. It came with kid friendly apps preloaded which were very user friendly. The battery life is also very good on it. It was fully charged when I took it out of the box. Ready to use and not waste time charging was a great plus. The holder is excellent to protect it from unwanted damage when it may fall.
2,Our tablet does not connect easily to the internet.  It‚Äôs become a big hassle.Our tablet also has not allowed us to set up parental controls and cannot go beyond that step.Many apps that are supposed to be preloaded are non existent.Ultimately I am disappointed with the tablet because it will not allow me to add parental controls.  I want to let my daughter utilize the tablet but I absolutely cannot allow her to without parental controls.
5,Downloads apps fast. Quick and easy setup. Small and cute. Comes with case. Great for kids
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This tablet is good for kids my lil cousin loves it. battery life is goodthe price is even better.
5,I got this for my daughter to use for school and it works great. The battery life is decent. She‚Äôs been thru so many tablets and I‚Äôm glad this one has a protective cover.
5,This is well made and sturdy for little ones. The tablet works great and I love the parent controls. Easy for little hands to grasp and hold onto the handle when carrying.
5,Update: it's now the end of September and I had to order another of these because the first one broke. I did not realize this was the same manufacturer at the time of purchase or I wouldn't have bought it. That said all of the original issues have been remedied. These tablets even took a design overhaul. Setup was about 4 minutes on this one vs they're older model that took almost 20. The battery life is also much better on this one.Original: Very slow. Not great picture quality. Battery doesn't last at all.That said it charges in a *decent* amount of time works good enough for little kids and is easy to use. Not my favorite but I've also had worse for more money.
5,Bought for my daughter and she loves it. As a parent I find this tablet to be safe and secure for her. It keeps her in kid mode and I'm able to download other apps for her. I love the way the tablet is setup and the processor is fast and amazing
5,This tablet is amazing it has all the features that an android tablet it‚Äôs great and it‚Äôs compact and even has a little stand on the back!
5,I ordered this for my 2 year old daughter. It's the perfect size and it comes with a lot of games already preloaded in it. There are parental controls which is always a great feature to have. The storage is 32GB but it can be upgraded with an SD card. The handled case is perfect for my daughter and it's very durable so it will handle a lot of throwing around.
5,This tablet is nice and durable! It has taken many tumbles already and hasn't been harmed at all. It's reasonably fast for the price and has enough storage space to get enough apps to keep him/her busy for hours on those long drives. Nice tablet for the price!! I'll be buying more of these as gifts. 10/10
5,We have been using the children's tablet which includes children's apps and is capable of downloading further apps.  The children's app has games videos and other valuable assets for learning.  This tablet is a standard android and is capable of downloading common apps available on the app store.  The battery lasts over 6 hours of active play.  It is not draining quickly and charges quickly. The screen quality is good and easy to see.  The size of the screen is not overly large but is still easy to see and use.  I can see the images at any angle which is not the case with all children's ipads.  So far it is working well.
5,Nice kids tablet. It was easy to set up and start using. So far so good. Battery life has been okay and it charges up it a decent amount of time.
5,My 8 year old daughter loves it. Can get right into the Google play store and download whatever apps she wants. Working out well for the current 8 hour road trip. Charges fast and works well with our hot spot.
5,My niece really love this and it works perfectly
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Will glitch a lot and are extremely very sensitive. Even with a screen protector the inner screen cracked with a slight fall on a carpet surface. Battery life is the worst. Even Onn tablets from Walmart are better than these.
1,This tablet is awful the sound is weird. It sounds echoed and the videos are so pixelated. It takes a long time for things to load also.
2,So this tablet from the outside looks awesome and is very well protected. The size is nice and it also comes with parental controls that are fairly simple.I have had multiple overheating issues with this from day one. With the screen on high the device overheats and slows down the device significantly. I have to set it to 60%-75% brightness to work properly. The other issue is the battery life which pretty bad. Its decent for a short car trip but wont last more than 2 hours. Also the screen clarity is not great at all but for kids it is not terrible.Overall I just dont love it but my kids like to still use it in the car.
5,Nice tabletHas YouTube already installedStays charge a good amount of timeLove the colorVery easy to set upPicture quality is amazingPerfect tablet for price
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†What I liked about the 7 inch kids tablet is the stylish and sturdy design and the screen quality is good it‚Äôs easy to use and very easy to setup and the battery life is fantastic it‚Äôs a good value for your money and it makes a great gift for all occasions it‚Äôs a good addition to your computer accessories
1,We opened the tablet and it powered with no issues. We were able to connect to our home Wi-Fi and downloaded some games. We put the item back in the box to be used by little ones in the family. We couldn't get the unit to boot back into the operating system when we went to use it again. We tried leaving it on the charger and searching for technical fixes however the unit appears to be non-functional. It never did reboot again.The unit itself has a cute case that seems durable. We thought it was decent when we first opened it given the price though with initial use it functioned maybe a little slow best we could tell taking into account the short period of time we were able to test during setup. There is a technical issue with our unit so a more indepth review of the functions is not possible but overall operational durability is a concern.
5,I have bought many Fire Tablets for my kids (Fire 7 8 HD 10HD & even the latest 10HD) over the years & I'm a subscriber to Amazon Kids+ .. Amazon tablets are known for their value & content but you're still restricted to Amazon App Store and their platform which in fairness to them it's actually very good .. Also I didn't get this tablet to replace any of them but then again I can probably retire my older Fire 7 & even the HD 8 (2018 version).  With that said here are some of my observation:>> Screen >> The  1024x600 HD Touch Screen is nothing to write home about but it's adequate for watching videos and even drawing. Its an IPS type which is fairly typical for this price range but as compared to my Fire HD8 the colors are a little washed out and it's not as bright which becomes an issue when outside with sun glaring at it.>> Storage >> The 32 GB of storage is not a lot but sufficient enough to install the many apps that you want to download for your toddler/kids .. for this price-point many offer only 16 GB storage which is really not enough.  Luckily this little one also has a a microSD card slot which serves as a good backup to store all your kids' movies cartoons and videos for after-all when you're out and about you can't take your Internet with you .. well you can but it's expensive.  Anyway I was able to install a 64 GB and once I format it on the device it was readily recognized by the tablet and ready to go.  In contrast I have had so much problem doing the same on all of my Fire Tablets with some working for sometime and then it just stopped working but with this one it has been consistent (so far).>> Memory >> In contrast to many kid's tablet where they come with only 1 or 2 GB of RAM this one comes with 3 GB and believe me that 1-2 GB makes a big difference.  With more memory apps load faster and run smoother.  Out of the box only 861 MB of 3 GB memory is used so the rest would be there to run your apps but of course there is a limit to how many apps you would be able to run at the same time.>> Battery Life >> Battery life is another big plus here.  This tablet comes with only 3000mAh/3.7V Li-ion battery but I was surprised to see that it lasted much longer than my Fire HD8.  Perhaps its' because it has a lower resolution and maybe a weaker processor but by the time I finished playing with it and watching videos on it for 4 hours it still had more than 50% left on the battery.>> Parental Control >> This is perhaps the one thing that sets this apart from the rest of the kid's tablets out there.  I was surprised to see that for an inexpensive tablet this has very good parental control features and not just the ones that is built into Android 11. The tablet comes with dual mode normal mode and kids mode). Kids Mode has tools that allows you to monitor how the tablet is used & keeps tabs on which apps your kids are using & for how long.  In this kids mode you can block apps filter content and even block purchases (in case you have a credit card on file which I don't).  Also another plus is that in this Kid's mode the content is ad-free .. or at least the ones that comes with the tablet.>> Content >> As mentioned there are games and apps made for kids that are Ad free which is pre-installed on this tablet and you can purchase more using their IWAWA portal which has many other kids‚Äô content though some come with Ads and or in-app purchase.  with the Parent Dashboard you can track your kids‚Äô activities and limit their screen time & interestingly you can set up different accounts for multiple children and monitor them separately and the content can be unique for each of them.  Of course you can find this same feature also with Amazon Fire Tablets as well.>> Sound >> Unfortunately the sound is one area that this tablet really lacks.  It has a mono-speaker that is located in the back of the unit and when you sit it down you barely can hear anything.>> The case >> Also another negative as it's a very cheap and can easily tear.  My son pulled the handles and they came right off .. though I was able to put it back with some difficulty.With all said and done I still recommend this tablet for small kids over all other tablets in this price point which lack many features of this one such as dual mode 3 GB RAM Android 11 Go Edition the parental control & lastly the content.  This is a good value cute tablet that your little one will enjoy playing with.
1,In the world of budget tablets I believe it‚Äôs only fair to compare this against the Kindle Fire. If I do that though this tablet is just a poor-quality pretender of a tablet. It‚Äôs slow the screen is horrible (low resolution and hurts the eyes) the camera is absolute garbage the battery life is poor and even the case is poor quality (too soft and easy to pull off tablet). A fair price for this ‚Äútoy‚Äù tablet would be around $25-$35 depending if it‚Äôs on sale. For the current price of almost $70 you would be SO MUCH better off getting the Amazon Fire 8‚Äù HD tablet with case for kids for the current price of $70 ‚Äì it‚Äôs better in absolutely every detail. If the price is higher when you look you will see sales on Fire devices during Prime Days or leading up to Black Friday and all the way through Christmas. The only benefit this tablet has in comparison to a Fire tablet is access to Google‚Äôs Play Store. If that‚Äôs your draw to this tablet I would still look elsewhere. This tablet‚Äôs quality is really the worst I‚Äôve ever seen.
1,It‚Äôs good but for some apparent reason it keeps getting disconnected from the Wi-Fi which can be very frustrating trying to reconnect multiple times
1,This kids tablet in blue came in yesterday and i started the set up process and everything was fine until we tried to use the wawa apps. It refuses to recognize that its connected to our internet. I double and triple checked it i powered the tablet off and back on again. No change. I turned off my home wifi and powered that back on and still nothing so at this point i have given up.
5,I brought this for my son`s classmate and he loves it it is not that expensive as ipad but still can do almost everything as ipad. but only cost 1/5 of it.
5,Buen producto para ni√±@s
3,In the pictures it says that it has games downloaded on it (it did not) and I could download Netflix (I cannot). After about 30 minutes of my son playing it the screen started to glitch. (He hadn‚Äôt even got out of his bed) I had to adjust the screen brightness for it to stop. It also has a very cheap battery in it. When we got it I charged it to 100% after about 2 hours of my son playing in it it was on 1%. Wouldn‚Äôt buy ever again. I‚Äôm only dealing with it because my son is too excited about it. (He‚Äôs 3)
