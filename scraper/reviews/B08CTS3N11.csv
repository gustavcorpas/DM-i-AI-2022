4,I don't ever do reviews but I was really interested in this product. I was more so buying it for temperature monitoring because I'm trying to conceive right now and I suck at bbt and remembering to do it first thing.The temperature isn't much off its not as accurate as my bbt thermometer and I use it more so as an alarm to wake up before my other alarms to take my bbt accurately. If that doesn't work I then fall back on my deep sleep temp time.What I was surprised about was the monitoring my blood pressure and heart rate and the accuracy.I'll have stressful times throughout the day and or nightmares at night and im able to specifically see when a spike happens and its really cool. I think if you're looking for a watch that takes a pretty accurate monitoring of your vitals you should get it. For the price its pretty great.Picture is at 1:30 a client at my work was making me mad and I was venting to my boss.
3,Caveat: my remarks are for the bracelet and RunMiFit in combination. Most functions like the sleep monitor function must work with the app to be useful.I purchased this Fitness Tracker for one reason - to monitor my sleep while I am participating in a CBT-I program to resolve my insomnia. I wasn't able to accurately recall wakeful periods to be accurate in my sleep journal so I bought this device. Initially I thought it was amazingly accurate on my wake cycles and even logged when I dozed off without realizing it during the late night phase of Sleep Compression. However after a week’s use I find that it it mostly misses short awake periods of 10 or 15 minutes. These shorter awake periods are important for CBT-I so I am now less impressed with its results but remain impressed by the technology. It gets right the start and end times of sleep but misses wakeful periods in-between. Since it never reports REM sleep I lack confidence in the marked “deep” and “light” sleep.It also seems to do all that other non-sleep stuff such as step counting heart rate blood pressure temperature notifications from phone etc. etc  but I didn't buy it for that.  I bought it for easy sleep monitoring and it isn’t as accurate or useful in that capability as I initially thought.Negatives:- If you don’t wear it all of the time it discharges quicker than if wearing it - it spends energy blinking LEDs trying to find my skin and I'm not there except when I put it on while sleeping. I shut it down using the device’s menu and turn it own (by plugging into a USB for a few minutes).- As noted above it it misses short awake periods say 10 minutes.- There is a bug in the runmufit app’s presentation of REM sleep. It simply doesn’t work. The only time that the app has displayed REM sleep was one time during periods when I was actually awake. Total time asleep is generally accurate. Awake periods mid-sleep are usually missed.The runmufit app is necessary to achieve the full value of the device. It is installed via the Google Store website which I vastly prefer over installing a vendor supplied backdoor installed app. Runmifit is on the Google app store but some other similar devices are not there.
4,I like it’s water proof and you can program certain features. It’s hard to shut off to charge and it’s hard to charge as you have to pull the watch band off to charge. You cannot just plug it into any USB either. It’s akward to get it to fit. Switching between modes is also very touchy and you have to go through them in order each time to get to what you want. Nice overall though and works good so far
4,It works great if you are going to use it primary as step tracker. I use it as watch step tracker and to monitor calls email texts. Blood pressure pulse and sleep tracker function are not reliable and totally off readings.I use it all the time - walking swimming cooking etc. so it is extremely durable. The battery lasts a week or more. i lost my first one so I bought another one. Overall good purchase.
3,Had this just 12 hrs so I'm still learning.  I was looking to for something along the lines of my Polar branded fitness watch this isn't it.  Software has access to your Google Account....big no for me.  Software isn't compatible with my Windows 10 well at least none of the emulators are so I can't even try it.  Sleep monitoring was way off.  Never achieved REM according to the monitor and during my workout it showed I was in a deep sleep.  Heart rate way off.  Showed 48 while my Polar with chest strap was showing 135 and I got a 130 doing a manual count.  BP was close to my cuff readings on 6 different tries so that's not so bad.  Body temp was right on every time.  Overall I rate this a 3 as it's passable for a pedometer watchand thermometer.  I wouldn't rely on this for much else but hey it was only $20.
3,This is a great item for general info but it isn't reliable .We have 2 oximeters we know are accurate and coincide with our doctors equipment  with that said  this item does not read your O2 or your Pulse Rate correctly .It does have a nice phone app interface with lots of info  however  I have sleep Apnea and my husband monitors me as I sleep  when I skip my breaths in my sleep  this unit registers my sleep under deep sleep ........ I literally wasn't breathing so I guess that's a pretty deep sleep  ehh ? ....The unit has potential ... I like the watch feature and long lasting between recharging .it simply plugs into a USB to charge ...Its a great item because it has potential but don't bank ur life on its readings  they're not accurate .
3,This watch is amazing except it won't charge! The sleep tracker isn't the most accurate as it will have me down as in a light sleep even though I'm awake but sitting still at night so that's understandable. The temperature is completely off my daughter came up as 96* but actually had a 102 fever. I didnt get it for temperature though so I really dont care that it was wrong. I have compared the blood pressure heart rate and O2 to the cuff and oximeter I have that I know are accurate and the watch was ACCURATE! I have a serious heart condition so being able to continuously monitor those things is amazing.If only the watch would charge!!!
4,Two things I don't like: the step counter counts some moves as steps when they're not just because your arms are moving and the flashing light if it is on but not being worn. I wanted to use it for the water reminder and not necessarily wear it unless I'm doing something but that little flashing light is so annoying! Those two things are the only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5. Other than that it's great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             At first glance this product does everything as advertised!  Now can it last?  For 25$ and what it does is amazing!  It’s very accurate only a few 10’ths off on tempature so I’m guessing all the other measurements are similar.  There is a small piece of film that protects the sensor on delivery so make sure you remove that for best results.  It’s not to bulky and easy wear and pair with your smartphone.  You can change the face and settings from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  I check my temperature every day on a machine at work and compare it to this watch and it’s close enough to trust the measurements.  If you take it off you will need to re connect to your phone and wait a few minutes for it to reset accurate readings.  I would not wear it if I was swimming but you can wear in shower it says.  Time will tell if it holds up to my clumsiness.  I wear on the inside of my wrist but you don’t need it to tight to get good readings.  I will come back in six months with follow up.  The lady that sent it to me sent a a little cartoon booklet as well from China about her online business she sounds very sweet and the cartoon was adorable!  11-25-21Follow up after almost a years worth of me beating it up I would add a screen protector but even with all the knicks and scratches it still reads well.  The strap did tear and had to repair bought a second one just in case and can replace straps.  I would say temp is off by half a degree to almost 1 full degree if it’s reading under 97.  Other than that battery still goes at least 7 days without charge.  Highly recommend for the price point.  Although I would say the sleep monitor and steps are a little off but still at this price point close enough for me.10-1-22 so now that I’ve had it over a yr I will say the strap does not last but I would still trust all of the readings.  You need to sync up with the app so you can add the outside temp as well on one of the home screens.  Also turn off raise to wake to extend your battery.  I tried sport mode when I started biking and it works okay.  It calculates calories and steps during workout time.  During the time I had to quarantine from Covid this little watch helped me monitor my blood oxygen and temperature while I had an ice pack on.  Really helpful.Sam M.
5,Just as Samsung kills their Health App body sensor connectivity with their latest software I ran across this neat device. It was nearly charged when it arrived but I ran into one glitch: scanning the code for the app on the enclosed document. My Security software flagged the downloaded "com.ptkmr.ttca.m51" as dangerous and uninstalled and quarantined it. I installed Runmefit from Google Playstore  and it's evaluated as trustworthy and no suspicious activity has been detected. Quickly got connected and I was able to configure and use the tracker in short order. I love it.I plugged into a USB port to charge and it was done in no time. And the battery is still fully charged after a couple of days. It's kept a running log of measurements and results are what I expected. Not verified against a standard but matches my usual measurements. Although the pedometer doesn't count steps correctly. It doesn't match my phone but I haven't tried counting to verify what the correct count should be. I noticed that the watch does get it wrong when I'm mowing on a tractor - it counts steps that may be terrain features. Not really important to me but I'll check that feature one of these days when I'm hiking a known distance.It certainly has a lot of features for such an inexpensive device and is easy to use. I'm very pleased with it.
3,pretty accurate on heart rate and blood pressure as long as you read indoors.  Impossible to see outdoors.  To faint even in the shade and too small a face. Great for indoors only.
3,BP gives inaccurate readings difficult to charge and other values are not accurate. I mainly use it for step tracking and it does ok at this. The app is ok but more than once it has lost the config and I had to reprogram.
4,The product is similar in design to the cheap model I bought from an online ad a few years ago. This one seems to be modern with a more advanced profile. It takes the readings I'm primarily concerned with measuring after my daily work out regimen. Such as heart rate and blood pressure. It offers many more measurements which to tell you the truth I haven't explored. But it does a good job in measuring the vitals that I'm interested in seeing. I would certainly recommend this tracker to a friend. One other point about battery life my previous tracker had to be recharged daily with this one I can go for a week before needing to recharge it. Hope that helps.
4,Still trying to figure it out
5,Really impressed with this tracker. Initially I was skeptical to buy but so glad I did. It tracks records etc like Fitbit. Steps accuracy seem a bit off to me but not by too much.
3,I can’t find replacement bands. Bought watch for my wife and she would like to be able to have different color choices.
5,Was looking for tracker that simply gv me time steps and reminded me to drink water. Sleep and sleep quality and other tracking was a bonus.  I didn't want email or take calls from it.  So this was a value I decided yo try... works well now and will be testing it out when I return to wk.
5,Love everything about it!! Would definitely buy again
5,I bought this to track my steps and mileage and it works well for that. I like the blood pressure heart rate and temp features and that I could customize the face with  my own photo. It took a little time to figure things out because I’m not one for using manuals but it’s pretty intuitive.
3,This product does not record every step. I wanted something that registers every step or it is not accurate
4,not sure about the accuracy yet but like the looks & functions it offers
4,Seems to work quite well. Still need to download the app for more testing.
4,The number of features on this tracker is amazing for the price.  The battery life is about 4 days which isn't too bad.  Easy to charge.  When I went to the doctor recently I checked the accuracy of the blood pressure blood oxygen and heart rate.  (because I'm a nerd?)  Only the heart rate was very accurate.  the other two were low by about 15%.  I just take that into account now.  The band is very comfortable and fits very large to very small wrists.  I would recommend this highly for casual tracking.
3,I like but I do not have confidence it always gives accurate readings. Easy to charge once you get the band apart.
3,I bought this tracker so that I could monitor my steps and my blood pressure. After my walk I checked my blood pressure with the tracker and my blood pressure monitor. the tracker reading was very low.
5,I like the product for two days then some how it disconnected from my phone. And now no matter what I do it won't reconnect so using my phone with the devise is useless. I will not repurchase.UPDATE: Still not connecting to the app on my phone. Have tried Uninstaller the app tried to pair it again and again. ABSOLUTELY nothing. I'm so disappointed.ANOTHER UPDATE: I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS WATCH I CANT EVEN CHANGE THE TIME NOW THAT IT WONT CONNECT TO MY PHONE. NOW IM GOING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE BUT DEFINITELY NOT THIS ONE. DONT BUY THIS.
5,I was looking for something that would not cost an arm & leg this watch does the job amazingly
5,While I have not synced all functions with my phone; I am pleased with the product and the accuracy of this device.  I am on my second Fitbit (Charge 4) which does not monitor BP.  I bought this to monitor BP only;  however it does everything the Fitbit does at a more affordable price.  Excellent product as a replacement for other Smartwatches.  My spouse likes it so much he just purchased one!
5,This is perfect my eye sight is not.
4,This is replacing a previous tracker and this one adds additional features.  That's good if you can trust the measurements and I know the Blood Pressure is wrong (on the low side).  Not sure about the O2 measurement.  Steps and sleep seems to be correct but I'm not trusting it for BP readings.
3,I like to track how far I walk on my morning walks. I had a "generic" pedometer in the around $25 class. I am pleased with it but the plastic securing the wristband finally broke. It pairs with the JYouPro app. I was able to view distance walked and or number of steps taken by hour day and month. I set "goals" of steps per hour or miles per month. I got this pedometer as a replacement the old one still works with duct tape. The new pedometer seems nice it even measures somehow blood pressure and body temp. But I don't like the Runmifit app it pairs with since it doesn't show (as far as I can tell) steps by hour actual time in motion and miles per month like the JYouPro app. I will probably try to find another pedometer that pairs with JYouPro.
5,This watch once set up and synched to a smart phone is intuitive easy to use and allows for fast and easy tracking of several health vitals - temperature pulse blood pressure oxygen saturation - all available with a finger slide on the watch face. The time updates automatically. Also tracks steps and miles and fitness activity. There are some features I have not figured out yet but I like this watch’s “easy to read in the dark” display and how fast and easy it is to check your own vital signs. For under $25 I am very pleased with this watch because I did not need a 20 page book to try to understand how to access the primary features. Highly recommend for the less tech savvy as long as they have someone to set it up and synch it for them.
5,I just got out of the hospital after having pneumonia. My current watch only monitored steps and heart rate. I needed one with blood pressure temp and O2.My husband has had this watch with the black band for quite some time. We checked his watch results with the hospital monitors and it was pretty spot on.I feel safer and look at that oxygen level! I'm doing pretty good!
4,As nice as the watch is the blood pressure feature is completely off and I got this watch for this feature mostly. Makes me wonder if the other features are off to. Maybe the numbers will adjust over time with wearing it?
5,its great for the price! i will say my temp is not 95 and my heart rate is in the 60s not 50s but the sleep tracker is great
4,Works well and the mobile app is easy to use
2,Needs recharging every second day.  It is very difficult to get one side of the band off to recharge.  Definitely get what you pay for here.
4,I’m a dumb American and don’t know the metric system! Lol the distance is measured in Kilometers and the body temperature in measured in Celsius. Other than that it’s pretty accurate as far as step counting. Also the text message feature is pretty cool it alerts you and shows you the message. Also shows you your caller id You just can’t respond or anything else. Oh and you can use it to control the shutter on your camera. I have an iPhone for reference.
4,I like it all around it's a nice watch
2,The biometric data is absurd. The tracker and mobile app indicate that I was in REM sleep while driving to work.  Average body temperature 94°  heart rate does not elevate during exercise.I kept the tracker because it was inexpensive enough to keep for a wrist watch.  As long as I occasionally sync with the app it maintains perfect time shows the date and the unexpected feature of mobile alerts (texts and notifications on your phone ) has been very useful - Gives your wrist a little vibrate and displays part of the message.As a fitness device?  Not really.
5,I like that you can put your own picture in the background. It seems nicer than my current tracker that was twice as expensive.  Also as good as my last fit it that was 10 times as expensive. I wish there were some walking/running challenges on the app.
5,I purchased this for my son who has been asking for one and he loves it.
2,The sleep timing is not accurate. I know for a fact I slept for 6 hours but it will say I slept for 10.
4,I bought this in September and it quit working totally in February. I did not ever get it wet or abuse it in any way. Although out of return window and seller feedback window they sent me a replacement. So very happy with the service - thanks!Seems to be fairly accurate as far as I can tell with the BP readings. Your BP will fluctuate from one minute to the next depending on things like moving around talking etc so it may not be exactly what stand alone BP monitor reads but close enough to see that it seems to work.
4,It seems to do what I want it to but I have a problem seeing things close up and the text is very small.
5,Works well with my phone. Seems to work great. Blood pressure is not very accurate but it is in the ball park
5,Great fitness tracker for the money
2,It's not accurate at all! It recorded I slept when I didn't it recorded I didn't sleep when I did pressure and heart beat were totally wrong. I wanted it to work because I saw many great reviews here. But it didn't work with me.
2,Lots of good features but readings need to be at least in the ballpark.  Easy to set up and charge.  Blood pressure readings were totally inaccurate compared to regular cuff reading.  Sleep readings were close to accurate as well as heart rate readings.  Temperature does not translate to Fahrenheit.  Steps were totally incorrect......reading almost double what Fitbit reads.  Strap is not comfortable.
5,There are several things to know about this before you buy.  1) you need to change the settings do the display only comes on when you touch it.  Otherwise your battery will need to be charged daily.  2) the step count is way different than Google fit or many other fitness trackers.  I get double the step count on this tracker than I have on any past trackers.  It might make you feel like you did more but it is misleading.  Other than that it works well.
2,when measuring blood pressure watch gives a number far below the number I got at the doctor's office
2,Could not get it to take a charge.  Returned for refund
5,I am absolutely impressed! Got WAY more than I expected for the price! User friendly had no trouble setting it up charged it first like it says ... Well I am very HAPPY I went ahead and bought my kids one to.. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this for ur whole family!!
4,It's about 33% off measuring my walk; BP is on low side pulse is close as well as O2.  I think it's sleep monitoring is as close as you can get with a wrist monitor.  I'm not going to test it's water resistant capabilities.  All factors considered it's worth what I paid.
4,Had terrible time getting watch setup
3,I bought this tracker because it takes temperature and blood pressure and heart rate.  All of those things seem to be on point.  However the step count seems to be way off.  I run with a group and we always check our trackers to see if they sync up and they always do when checking my other tracker ( I still wear it). But this tracker will show almost double the steps. Also I have not been able to get the band off to charge.  I have had several people try it but we cannot get it off. Oh and it did not track my sleep at all.
4,Seems to be accurate.  Just received so time will tell. Easy app.
5,I bought this as I needed to replace another one that lasted years.  This worked for 5 months and will not connect to App.  Will purchase another brand as this one is difficult to deal with and it is outside of the return time.
3,I only gave it three stars because it's not very accurate on temp heart rate sleep etc. It did count steps good tho. I don't like I can't track my progress from day to day you can but it's not very easy to read. It doesn't always stay connected to the app even if the app is still open like it's supposed to be so text messages and phone calls aren't coming through on it. I just think for the price this one is more low quality and it's just better to buy the few more dollar higher ones.
1,The watch is fine but the app sucks. I like the watch and all the features. Unfortunately you have to use the Runmifit app and that makes the watch pretty much useless. It never did sync to my Google Fit all the way so I only had some of the information I wanted. This app resets everyday so if it doesn't give all information to Google fit it's just gone.If you just want to know how many steps you take or need water reminders or reminders to get active this is perfect for you. If you want to be able to sync to your other fitness apps and keep track of progress don't buy this.
