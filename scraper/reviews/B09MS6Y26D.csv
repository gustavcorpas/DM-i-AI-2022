5,Charging my phone at night has never been an issue with me. I have a cord next to the bed.  But the watch was another issue. It would sit on my dresser across the room and my earbuds would charge on my nightstand during the day with a different cord. So I would have two wires on the night stand one Apple Cord and one USB-C cord And the phone charger across the room.So you get the picture three different cubes three different wires at two locations. Now with one unit I charge all three at once on my night stand. The watch portion is great because it acts as a stand. All I have to do is reach out and touch the night stand and the watch lights up revealing the time. Great when traveling for many reasons but the night stand is very convenient when away from home and you wake up looking around for a clock.And speaking of travel everything in one package one cube and one wire. Slight down side at first. There are three led lights on the back of the unit. They will light when a corresponding charging surface is in use. And I think when a full charge was detected the corresponding light may flash (for whatever reason).  Anyway simple fix.  One and a half inch of black tape over the lights cured the issue.Going to buy a second unit for my wife who has the same gadgets I do.Update: since the ear buds case does not need to be charged everyday you simply fold the end used for charging the earbuds under and the space on the table is reduced by 1/3 and looks a lot cleaner
5,My new go-to travel adapter and it saves substantially on the number of cables in my bag. I was concerned at first about durability but the system feels well built and was not damaged after a bit of rough use on my last trip. The airpods charging side is a standard qi charger which can work with any wireless charging headphones (I am using Galaxy Buds) and the phone charging side has a magsafe-like magnet which aligns the phone and holds it in place for better charging.I like to pair it with this Anker power adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSMK849/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to charge my phone watch headphones (on this wireless charger) two laptops and portable power bank with just one cable.
5,I have an iPhone Airpods and and apple watch and have bought various stands and chargers to easily charge and organize my devices on my nightstand and this is by far one of the best. It charges pretty quickly it doesn't take up too much space and the best part is the easiness in traveling with it. As a guy that travels a lot this definitely comes in handy as it's a lot easier than traveling with a bunch of different cables for each of my devices.In conclusion this is an amazing product and it is exactly what you are looking for if looking for a travel-friendly easy to use and efficient charging station for all of your apple devices
5,I ordered one of these for my wife and as soon as we traveled together I was envious b/c she had one charging cord and I had 3 or 4 of them so when I went on my next trip I ordered one for myself.  It charges quickly and efficiently.  It takes up very little space b/c it folds up which is another great reason for travel.  You do need to make sure your phone is sitting correctly in order for it to charge.  Overall super awesome and practical for more than just travel use.  Great for the office or an extra charging spot!
5,I haven’t been using it for very long but so far it seems to work as described. The charger squares seem to be a little bigger than in the pictures but that’s not really a problem for me. It still folds up very compactly and I think it’s going to be great for all the traveling I do for work. I’m excited there’s a product like this on the market!
5,I bought this product to replace a bulky charging stand that I would lug around on travel trips for business and personal... this easily folds up and has a small footprint! on top of that it now only takes one USB-C chord to power it instead of 3 so it saves space now too! I would suggest to invest in a USB-C to USB-C power block and new chord which should speed up the charging (look into Anker).
5,I’ve bought a lot of chargers for apple products. Most of them seem to have a real problem with being able to charge the watch. I’ve only really found success with the original Apple Watch charger. This 3-n-1 actually charges my phone my watch and my AirPods at the same time and much quicker than my other wireless charger for my phone.I bought this for travel and not having to bring a bunch of chargers and such but I might just use it as my bedside charger as well. The magnets for the phone part makes it so I don’t get up in the morning and realize I was just a tiny bit off with the placement of my phone and it didn’t charge overnight. The charging indicators are a bit bright for the nightstand though. I might have to put some tape over that but I really like this charger. It’s a keeper!
4,This charger set came in an attractive package and timely delivery. I was impressed with the quality. All three items charged without a case. The iPhone will not charge with my Spigen and card slot cover on so I do need to remove it before charging. Otherwise handy item and compact great for traveling.
5,Really great product. Very compact and folds into sections of 3 so that is also convenient suppose you only need 1 of the 3 charger. Feels solid and not cheap like others. There’s also nice light indicator of that product is charging and what is not. Overall 5 stars.
5,This is a life saver for me I don’t need to pack all three chargers every day when going to the office this is perfect and it does not take too much space. Just put it in my mini bag with one cube and that’s it off I go. I bought one for my boss he is the one that travels the most. It comes in handy it charges perfect.
4,The portability the convenience and only needing 1 cable was what sold me on this. I’m not at home a lot and wanted something compact easy to carry and use. Tested it with my iPhone 13 and my series 7 watch. It did take a while to charge my phone but seemed to do fine. My watch is a different story. It got really hot and didn’t really add any charge to it after an hour. I really want to love this charger but I wouldn’t dare chance my watch with it again.
5,Pretty cool so far. Going on vacation and pretty excited to not have to take 3 different chargers with me to keep my devices charged. Kind of excited to take it I’ve only used at home for now.
5,This is what has been missing in my life! With business travel back again remembering to pack all the cords is just one more task on my getting out of the house list. Between my phone watch and AirPods it has gotten out of control. Enter this 3 n 1 portable wireless charge. One plug and done! And it stays in my luggage so it is never forgotten. Recommend for any business traveler.
5,Got this charger as a gift to my boyfriend who travels for work. He has only it on one trip so far but thinks it’s the greatest. He used to have to unplug all of his home chargers and bring the whole charging station and multiple cord but this 3-n-1 charger has eliminated all of that. He was bragging to all of his coworkers about it and they all agreed that it made traveling so much easier
5,I got this for an upcoming trip to Italy.  this will take the place of 3 power cords so I can take it on the plane & use it in hotels at night.  A much more efficient option for travel.  It seems well made & very convenient.  I will report back after use for 3 weeks of travel but I think it fits the bill.
5,I would definitely recommend this charging pad especially if you have an iPhone Watch and AirPods! Definitely worth the money. Came quickly and was easy to set up. I bought one for my self and husband. I also think it could make a nice gift. Will be using it at home and when traveling to cut down on how many chargers I’ll have to bring.
4,We used it for traveling.  Found it very useful for charging two phones and a watch. Very compact for packing
5,I bought this for my husband since he travels so much and never brings the charger for his apple watch. He loves it. He uses it at home as his charging station as well.
5,This is about the fourth or fifth 3 in 1 wireless charger and by far this is the easiest for travel. With other ones they either don't fold up flat or you have to take them apart to flatten them so they are compact. With this one 1 2 3 and it's folded flat and compact. When I placed all three units on the charger each one registered being charged immediately. I haven't found heat to be an issue as I read in some other reviews but I will report back if that issue arises. Otherwise this is coming with me to Hawaii next trip. Aloha :-)
5,This product has a quality look and feel. Good instructions and performs as promised. Includes power adaptor (which you would expect)--but some vendors of comparable type products do not provide one!
5,I use iPhone 13 pro max apple watch SE and AirPods pro and carrying around all the chargers was a nightmare! I wanted to buy one that apple sells but thank God I searched on Amazon for it. Except for a bit of overheating when you are using all 3 chargers it works just great as it can be and I didn't need to carry all the cords tangled up. Additionally it comes with a C-type cord and adapter so I can also charge my iPad! so amazing!
5,This charger is perfect for anyone who travels often. it is light and very compact. The magnetic aspects are perfect for holding the phone in place on a table at a viewing angle.
4,if you carry all apple products- watch pods and phone- and you travel- this is the right product.
5,While this works well for every day home use I bought this for travel. It is great to charge all my devices in one place with one foldable charger and one cable. Much easier to deal with and less likely to forget pieces/parts of charging devices behind when packing up to return home.
5,This product is very convenient!  Easy to pack and use!  Highly recommend!
5,I absolutely love this product. I hated having 3 different cords on my nightstand for my phone watch AirPods. This makes charging so easy and less cluttered. I love that it's so compact and folds up easy to travel with. I am buying one for everyone in my family!.
5,I bought this product before for a vacation. And after using it in vacation I bought another one to use everyday. It saves lot of space less wire easy to use. Best travel charger ever.
5,This was a gift for my dad and he absolutely loved it works perfect for travelling and keeping all the electronics organized
5,I bought this product for traveling and it works wonders. I just keep it in its original box so everything has a place and it's good to go.
5,Went on a trip and wanted a charger that would cover all my devices in one. This product was super compact easy to use and did the job. When I got back I ended up setting it up at my bedside! Great product!
5,Its great to be able to charge your phone watch & ear pods at the same time with one device.  This is going to be great for travel.  my husband & I should be able to share it. It will be great not to have wires everywhere. It will be nice when there are not many plugs available.
5,This is the exact tool that I’ve been looking for for some time. It’s a one stop shop for all my Apple devices. No longer do I have to pack multiple cords.
5,very compact and easy to travel with or just throw in your packback.  Only one wire needed
5,This charger is the perfect three in one for anytime anywhere and folds into any pocket. The charging is as good as the original chargers for these items. The phone charger is very well magnetized and charges quickly holding the phone in place no matter the position or if you are using the phone at the time.  Packaging is as if it were a 500 dollar item and more secure that would ever be needed.... this is the one to get...RTOPS.... nice  work!!!
5,I love that I can say goodbye to all the cords I have to travel with. It works as expected with all my iPhone products. Happy with this purchase!
5,I have had a number of different chargers for my iPhone and Apple Watch and this one is the best. Great for traveling as well as using every night on the nightstand. Five stars all the way.
5,Love it ! Super thin  portable. Love being able to charge everything at work !
5,I already had a charging deck for all my devices but it was a pain to pack when traveling so this was the perfect device for me!
5,You only need to bring one charger to charge phone watch and AirPods. 3 lights indicate which item is being charged. I was impressed with how fast it charged all 3 devices at the same time. I’m Very impressed!!
5,Fantastic for travel saves so much space!
5,I wanted a charging that would work well for travel and limit the number of cords that I would need. This charger fits the bill. Compact design that can charge multiple phones and a watch at once.
5,One plug and one cord. No more tangled cords every I want to charge.
5,I love this all in one. It eliminates three different cables and it's very compact. Great for traveling as I don't have to make sure I have the right cables for my iPhone Apple Watch and Air Pods. I definitely recommend it.
5,Wow! Saw it on TikTok and decided to try it. When we travel someone ALWAYS forgets a charging cable or adapter and then we’re sharing. No More!! Each family member gets one of these and even if they don’t have all the devices (like my son) it’s so easy to pack and set up and worse case scenic act as a backup. Great value for money. I’m getting as gifts for my ladies’ group.
5,Bought it to travel with and found it was so amazing to save space with packing plus got to leave so many cords behind!
5,This is exactly what I was looking for! Simple compact and charges my phone watch and iPods all at the same time. I’m so excited to have this for any time I travel.
5,Great gift!  Doesn’t have to be for traveling I got this for my teenage son for his room it’s a huge hit!
4,Great value for the price! Easy to use while traveling or in the office as it is compact and easy to take on the go! A highly recommended purchase!
5,Quality product. Well designed with great features. Charges wirelessly with compatible mobile phone smartwatch and earbuds at the same time. Folds up easy for travel.
5,I bought this charger mainly for travel. It will charge my iPhone hubby’s iPhone and my Apple Watch all at once. One cord one charger three devices. Hubby and I both have magnet mounts on our phone cases. This is the only charger I have found that will charge them without removing the case. It’s a bit tricky to position them on the charger but it works. This is a great value for the money!
5,Perfect for charging all your products. Can be used anywhere. Stationary at home or traveling. Love that this is compact and easy to use.
5,Works great. If it had a extra plug for an older device or something else that needs to be plugged in it would be perfect
5,Worth the $ I was hesitant for $30 that it might not charge fast but it does. And it is super compact which is great for travel so I can 3 things and only need 1 cord. If you travel often or hate extension cords with extra plugs this product is for you.
5,this product was great for charging all my items and easy to use.
5,Charger pads seem to work well with all three devices. I have had one night where I my phone didn’t charge because it wasn’t in the middle of the pad my fault I guess. Travelled with the charger and it was easy to use and better than taking 3 separate chargers for each device.
5,I bought 2 chargers mainly for travel. It will charge my iPhone airpods and my Apple Watch all at once. One cord one charger three devices. I have found that will charge them without removing the case. This is a great value for the money! Love it and makes my life easier 3 devices in one charger.
5,None of the other flat chargers would charge my phone with the cover on it.  I needed a charger for my new watch and don’t want to have multiple chargers plugged in.  We like this so much we plan to purchase one for the motorhome and another for our travel bag.
5,I love that it is small to fit in my purse it is weightless and it’s easy to open and close.I also like that when you put your phone to charge it directs your phone so its charges correctly
5,This is the coolest travel charge pad!! It folds and takes hardly no room only need to bring 1 cord with me vs 3 (1 for phone 1 for wallet and 1 for AirPods).I really want to use it all the time not just traveling.
4,A little more expensive than I would've like but super compact for travel and storage. Everything works great as expected. Would recommend.
5,I love how I don’t have to bring multiple chargers now when I travel. Comes with usb-c line and plug. Worth having.
5,I have an iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods Pro and for traveling this charger is a game changer. No more having to pack 3 individual chargers and cords. It charges quickly and takes up so little space in my carry on. Folds up nice and compact. Wish I would have had one years ago!
5,I wish I would have purchased this sooner. This is lightweight and packs a punch. It works with my iPhone and my husband’s Samsung charging at the same and my Apple Watch. It cuts down on all the wires and plugs into the wall and it folds up conveniently. Great for travel. I recommend this product.
5,Great to charge up everything at once
5,Love the ease of use small travel size and reliability of product.
5,Easy to use!
5,I recently found out you can charge two iPhones at the same time using the AirPod charging section.
5,Eliminates all the cords Charges all of my electronics at once so happy with this product!
5,It closes up conveniently - nice for travel and nice for on a bedside table. Not bulky!
5,Tired of taking so many chargers everywhere. This charged everything great. It did take time to get my phone to get in the right spot because I don't want to take off my cover. Perfect size delivered with packaging very organized and easy start up.
4,very convenient great product!
5,Bought 3 of these for myself and my two daughters.  We all do a lot of traveling and this is so convenient to have all three charges in one small charger without a bunch of cords.  Excited to give it to them for their birthday.  Works with my phone with a cover on and my Apple Watch.
5,This has made it so easy to charge my devices without having power cords going all across the table. One charging device and it’s capable of putting the power back into 3 of my devices that are used on a daily basis. Very efficient and easy to use. I love it !  I’m going to buy a second one to have in a different room.
5,Product helps leave all the wires and chargers at home when you travel. Makes more space in my bag with the compact folding design.
5,A little pricey but ultimately worth it. Super convenient to travel with.
4,This is the best for easy compact chargerSimple to set up and folds very small
5,Fast charging and less clutter! Definitely getting another one.
5,I like how compact this is. Great Product.
5,This is an excellent and a must have product. Saw this with a colleague at work and ordered it immediately. Light weight folds neatly great value and includes the power adaptor and the only cord you need. Available in two colors. Love it. Good buy to carrying three different chargers.
5,This product is compact and easy to throw in my purse. It’s cool to have the ability to charge three devices at the same time. Great for kids too because the little blue light signals the electronic is still charging.
5,I have been so pleased with this charging station. I do not have to travel for work but I use it as my bedside multi device charger. Excellent magnetic strength. We’ll see how it holds up when I do travel for vacation but so far would recommend this especially given its fraction of the cost compared to the day Apple version.
5,This is the best compact 3 in one charger EVER.  I use it at home all the time - although originally bought it for travel.  Love love this product!
5,Love the simplicity and ease of use for this combo iPhone Apple Watch and Airpod travel charger!  It comes with a fast charging adapter and cord too
5,I travel constantly for work. I’ve been packing a large bulky charging center until I found this. Small yet mighty!  It fits my watch AirPods and phone perfectly and charges simultaneously. Amazing!
5,Great for traveling. Instead of taking so many charges just take this one and plug all three at once. Charges fairly quickly as well. No issues as of yet.
5,Works great
5,We bought two of these for a trip. We didn’t want to deal with packing a bunch of cords and we didn’t want to take our bulky bedside charging stands. This was a perfect option. Very compact and easy to use.
5,I just plugged it in and tried all 3 devices.  Worked like a charm! It folds up as advertised and is much easier to pack than my other 3 in 1 that has a stand.
4,Easy to set up and use
5,Works well and very compact and easy to use!
5,I found this 3 in 1 charger on Amazon. When traveling we usually have to bring the apple watch AirPods and iphone chargers. Then strategically take turns using the chargers to ensure all devices have a full charge. This product eliminates that. It’s compact great for traveling or for just eliminating all those cords by your bedside.
4,Perfect and fast. Easy to use foldable packable and it charges fast compared to other ones that I’ve used.
5,Its looks good in my desk and  i like that this stick in my desk  and can adapt the charging mode for my phone and airpod.
5,This charger is perfect for home use and traveling. I’ve bought three more for gifts for my family. They love them
5,This is the perfect charger for traveling to reduce cords and clutter! Highly recommend!
5,One device one cable to charge three devices at once. If you're traveling it cuts down on the number of charging cables you need to bring. Recommended.
5,Super easy to use and a great travel item especially so you don’t have to carry around multiple cables. This is my second one and I love it.
5,I take it to work and it wonderful.
4,We have two of these one white and one black. 90% of the time it charges when you place the item on the pad. The other times you have to fidget with it a little to get to land so it charges. Not that big of a deal at all but you can't necessarily just drop it off without making sure that it starts to charge.It doesn't seem to overheat my devices like some cheap chargers can do which really messes up your battery.Very rarely it starts to charge but for some reason stops. But only very rarely. Hence the 4 stars vs 5 stars. I would still buy it again for sure.
5,Great for travel. Fast charge of phone
5,Definitely love this charger easily fits in a purse backpack anywhere! Makes traveling with multiple devices so much easier
5,Folds flat and fits well for travel. happy with it so far!
5,It's fantastic! It's a safe space and convenient. Highly recommend it.
5,Convenient for at home or travel use. Love how it folds up when not in use.
5,Wireless charger 3 in 1 is extremely convenient for me as a constant traveler. I would highly recommend this product. 10/10!!
4,I needed a portable solution that I could use for travel worked well with the MagSafe iPhone cases allowed me to charge my phone watch and earbuds at the same time and didn't come with a steep price tag like the Apple charger.  This product checked all the boxes for me.  I've been using it for about 2 months now and it's been great.  My only complaint is the watch charger - it doesn't "click" to an upright position so it will sometimes fall backward a little bit and lose its connection with the watch forcing you to reset it.  However if you lay the watch flat there are no issues.  If they could address this in a future release it would be an easy 5 stars.
5,Impressed with how compact it really is!  Really like that the watch portion pops up for displaying the time!
5,Folds compactly and charges well. The blue LED indicator light blinks when the device isn’t seated properly and isn’t charging.
5,This charger is perfect for travel. It is small befits in my handbag and it just needs one cord to charge iPhone I watch and air pods. It’s actually good for home and office as well
5,Works great. Amazing idea.
5,Works terrific.  Gonna buy more for Christmas.  Great gift for the traveler.
5,Really beautiful design  works very well . I love this Wireless Charger
5,the product is small and easy to travel with
5,Easy to use no additional Apple Watch wire to repurpose. It just works and it’s easy to take on the go.
5,Absolutely love it! Doesn’t take up too much space and I love how it looks
5,Great for travel foldable doesn't take up a lot of space
3,The air pods side does not charge anymore and I need it replaced have not had it that long HELP
5,Nice product and works as expected. Easy to use and small enough to take when traveling !
5,
5,This is the second charger I have purchased. I wish you could charge more than one phone at a time but other than that I love it. It folds up for travel which is awesome.
5,I’m already going to Oder another one for my desk at work. It’s so nice to not be tethered to a cord.
5,Very nice product would recommend it to anyone and everyone with a smart phone
5,Super convenient for travel!
5,Nothing I dislike at this point but I will say that I love the convenience of putting all my apple products in one place. Getting rid of all the cords is a very wonderful thing.
5,Small and compact. Easy to use and great for travel. I ordered 2. One for my use and one for my husband.
5,So perfect for travel and work. 10/10!
5,Great charger and super compact
5,This charger is so light and easy to use. Bought it for travel and it's perfect!
5,Perfect for quick charges and small spaces
3,Convenient in travel size but half the time my watch is not fully charged even if sitting overnight on charger.  Does a quick full charge for phone and my earbuds (not Apples as my generation is defunct on this charger).  See how it does when I travel with it next month
5,Didn’t dis like anything works well with apple devices see description for compatibility phones and accessories
3,Was a great thing till the watch part stopped charging.
4,Great option for travel as it folds nicely. The only down side is that apple watch very slow charger.
5,I love this
4,This product works well with all my Apple products except my Apple Watch 7. It randomly charges it to anywhere between 70-90%. Unfortunately sometimes that’s not enough to last the whole day. It works with all other Apple products I tried including  iPhones AirPods even older watches. I highly recommend it unless you want to use it with the latest Watch.
5,I love this product purchased it for my son to take to college and it's just small enough and doesn't take much space on his desk.
5,Only one cord and easy to travel with
4,I give it a 4 even though its great in terms of money use and traveling I find myself a bit disappointed at how fast it can actually charge especially when you charge all accessories at once. It's more a luxury than a necessity. If I need a quick charge because it dead and I need more juice I find myself plugging in instead of wirelessly charging. But over all its a solid product and I love the fact that it already includes the adapter for the apple watch.
5,Simple to use. Just one brick charges all three; phone watch and AirPods. Nice and compact.
5,I found a similar product on TikTok and I was like Amazon gotta have it and more trustworthy than other websites so I bought it since I travel a lot and didn’t want to buy the Apple version for three times the price for only the phone and watch charger. I’ve had this charger for almost couple of months now and I love it. My only regret is not buying it sooner as I always seem to forgot one of my chargers for either my AirPods iPhone or Apple Watch. You gotta use their adapter or 18W (or higher like 24W if you have one) adapter to get the three chargers to work at the same time and to work fast. This product simplified my life with one cable and one foldable nice looking wireless charging. Definitely a great value for great quality!
5,I love how lightweight this is and the fact that it’s foldable will make it wonderful for traveling. It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.
5,This thing is as advertised. Compact magnetic charger for a phone watch & airpods. Setup is less than a minute just to plug it in. Highly recommend! The only hiccup in the process was it was delivered to the wrong address so I had to hunt it down...lol! I'll probably get 3 more of these for the rest of the family!
5,The charger is compact light and effective.  Great portable charger
5,It is exactly what I was looking for.  My travels will be easier because I don't even have to carry all the chargers.I’m so happy!
5,Great item for charging. I would buy this again
5,Very easy to pack for travel. Takes up very little room. One charger for three items is super convenient.
5,Super easy to travel with. Easy use
5,This charger is perfect for travel because it folds up (stays together magnetically) and takes up very little space. It charges my iPhone 13 pro max Apple Watch series 7 and my AirPods 3rd gen with no issues. It’s a way better price and value compared to apples duo charger as well. It can be hard finding a travel friendly charger that charges all 3 apple devices simultaneously and doesn’t break the bank. This one fits the bill. I searched for weeks before deciding on this one and I’m very glad I did. MagSafe was an absolute must for me as well. It magnetizes easily and quickly with no issues. I’m a big fan of the fact that it came with its own power brick too. It uses usb c to usb c which is great because that’s the same type as my iPad Air. Overall happy and glad I made the right choice with this purchase!
4,Compared to other premium chargers this is very cheap and good.I like it better because it’s portable and can we easily carried around. It is very portable. I carry this is to office all the time.It is cheap I don’t know how long this item would work.I have extended warranty with my credit card if this works for two years I will be happy.
5,Very professionally packaged and compact
4,This product is super easy to use and convenient. The one issue I have is that no matter how I put my airpods pro case on it the blue light blinks. It still charges thankfully but the flicker the corner of my eye is annoying. I’d still recommend this product.
5,Very satisfied with compact light and easy-to-use features.
4,This charging setup was a good value. Far better than the official Apple charger as it’s much more affordable and gives you an additional charging pad for headphones or another qi-enabled device.
5,This charger works very well is easy to use and is great for traveling.
3,Not hood
5,It works well and is pretty slim and portable.It’s straightforward to setup also.
3,The concept design and ease of use make this a good product. Unfortunately the watch charging portion makes this a poor option.
5,I'm so glad I bought this! The charger folds up into a neat little square with just the USB-C cable for power; typically on a trip I would need to bring several cables and extra wall plugs in case the hotel didn't have USB ports then try to find where to plug everything in which can be a challenge when I travel with my husband. This simplified my packing and did a great job charging all my tech. It's not the fastest charger but perfect if you charge at night. I will definitely be taking this with me on every trip!
5,I've been looking for a single device to charge our iPhones Apple Watches and AirPods while traveling as we take several vacations per year. I stumbled across this on Amazon and it was instantly a must-purchase. Given that a single OEM charger runs $25 easily getting a compact easy and lightweight device to pack when traveling for a little over $30 was a bargain!When the charger arrived it was packaged very nicely and securely which was surprising given the price point. It sets up in seconds and works wonderfully. Be sure to put the correct devices on the correct charging pads; they are all clearly marked; for best results. I ended up purchasing a second charger for my devices as this is my new go-to charger for all our trips.
5,This product is compact and great for traveling. Definitely recommend
5,These are awesome for traveling so compact and easy to use!
5,Great product! Awesome for traveling and charges all our devices super fast!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is perfect for home and/or traveling.  I like how it folds and is easy to pack.  The only thing I don’t like about it is that the blue lights are so bright that it’s like having a nightlight so I usually cover it with a towel.  Also I have to remove my phone from the case as it doesn’t want to charge with it on.
5,I travel a lot and am a very light packer so it is very important for me to have a compact charging station for all my gadgets before I hit the sack. THIS IS IT! Just one USB-C plug into this device to charge all 3 gadgets simultaneously – keeps things very neat organized and charged. The feature of folding the charging station into a triangle as a phone stand to watch a video while charging was a nice touch. I have used this multiple times on a cross country ski trip as well as a part of my remote desk/office stations – highly recommend!
5,This charger is EXCELLENT.  Cut down on your cords and clutter for up to three of your devices!  Love how it folds into an even more compact "triangle" if only charging one or two items.  Flat and open - awesome to be able to charge 3 items.  The whit color looks as if this was made by Apple OEM.  Charging is quick but not too quick to make my phone get hot.  Great value for the money and the compact design is excellent for traveling.  Would highly recommend!
5,Compact and portable for travel.
5,I’ve used this for charging my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods works great! The iPhone and AirPods use the same wireless charing method which means you can charge 2 iPhones one on each side of you would like. It doesn’t get more compact than this. The only downsize I can possibly see is that the side intended for the AirPods has a slightly slower charging speed and no magnets for MagSafe  however that is more nit picking at this point and the pros outweighs the cons. I’ve charged my iPhone Apple Watch and my wife’s iPhone when traveling overnight and they are always fully charged in the morning. Highly recommend especially for its value. It’s my new bedside table charge station.
5,I purchased this wireless charger because it seemed to be a good solution to the problem of needing to charge multiple devices at once but not always having enough electrical outlets. It also eliminates the need for three separate chargers and the clutter of cords associated with them. The device is compact when folded measuring approximately 3 ¼ x 3 ¼ x 1. It is light weight and very well made.  It seems to be designed for Apple products but it works fine with my Samsung S7. My phone and the charger get only slightly warm while charging and the charger shuts off automatically as soon as the phone is fully charged. It’s a good deal for the price. I am very satisfied so far.
4,Works as advertised. Nice that it comes with usb-c to usb-a cable and 18w charger. The watch charger for my version 7 is not as fast as the apple fast charger but is good for travel purposes.
5,Easy to use as 123
5,Standing it up & using 2/3 charging pads (phone & watch) isn't super feasible with the weight of the phone but nbd. Works great for what it is and I love how compact it is for traveling.
5,The charger works with my Samsung S21+ (also with an S9+) and headphones (Earfun Free I don't have AirPods) at the same time and charges about as quickly as a normal fast charger. It works well while flat and the pop out for the watch makes it much easier to charge watches.However it doesn't stay sturdy enough while in the magnetized triangle shape to charge a device. I even tried propping up against multiple sturdy objects and it really won't charge a phone standing up from any angle I've tried.Overall a great charger especially if you're happy charging 3 things at once in the flat orientation as the main way to use this device. I will definitely be using this all the time to charge my phones and headphones at the same time.
5,As someone who travels for work I’m always in search of the “best” charging system for all my Apple gizmos.  I’ve had split cables (for my watch and phone) stand chargers for my watch phone and AirPods etc. so when I saw this one I knew I had to give it a try.  Works perfectly; folds down when not in use or when you just need to charge your phone and holds your phone at a view angle when on an airplane.  I’ve already had a few people ask me where I got it so they could get their own.
1,I bought this three in one charging pad hoping to get rid of the many cords I have for my apple products. I placed the airbuds and apple watch on their designated pads and they began to charge .. when I placed my new iphone on the designatred pad ... the iphone screen initially illuminated with the green charge bar and read 87% charged .. So I new it connected. Then after about five seconds the blue light on the charging pad  started to blink. I left the iphone on the charger and turned it on .. the iphone showed that it was not charging. So once again  I lifted the iphone up off the pad and then replaced it back onto the designated pad  ... once again the phone green charge bar illuminated  and read 87% charged.However as before after about 5 seconds the pads blue light began to blink ... This time I left my iphone on the charging pad for an hour and a half to see if it was a simple malfunction with the blue light .. After that time period when I turned the iphone back on it indicated that the power had actually dropped to 84%. I can't imagine leaving this on all night to wake up to a dead phone in the morning. The design of this 3 in 1 iis great but the function is very bad. More importanly when I went to the home screen of this company I could not find any customer support. I do not recommend buying this product and caution anyone from buying from any company with no easy way to discuss this matter. I thus am sending the product back.
4,It is what I expected..worked how I wanted but I think if you close it up when in use it may stop charging. I did not test that out.
5,This is a great charging device and has freed up room on my nightstand I love the magnetic phone charging. No more will the phone not charge because it was off just so the wireless charger. Charged my series 5 watch with no issues. Also charged my airpods as well in the silicone case. It is also clearly labeled as to what charges where. One of my favorite things about this is unlike many of these charging devices this also comes with the appropriate power adapter.  In addition there are lights that indicate when it is charging.  Because it is also magnetic you can set it as a triangle and charge the phone and watch on its side. Great addition to my travel chargers & cables!!!
4,It’s a cool design and it charges fast and easy
5,I bought 2 of these for my wife and I. We love it as we can charge our phone airpods and watch at the same time. We have not experience any issues it works great! We are looking forward to traveling with it to replace all the cords we used to take.The only dislike we had is that at night when you place your devices to charge a blue light turns on to let you know its charging and its pretty bright. Not a huge problem and have covered it up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a great little charging pad that does exactly what it promises. In my video you can see it activating the wireless charging feature for my iPhone 11 pro max. Unfortunately this is the only device I have right now to test with so I couldn't show the phone itself on the device. I can say however that both the phone and the airpods charging pads charged my phone. After a few days use now my phone seems to go from 20-60% battery pretty quickly under 30 minutes in fact. I've seen it take around an hour to fully charge the battery from 20%. For the price you really can't go wrong.
4,Convince
5,Very simple set up and easy to use.  Works as stated.  Only downside is that it has trouble charging through some cases. Overall great charger.
5,This product is just what I have been looking for.  As somebody who travels frequently it's a hassle to pack so many charging cords and accessories (iphone ear pods Apple Watch...).  This 3 in 1 charger solves all of that for me.  It folds up easily so it's compact enough to travel and you only need one cord with it.  I thought I would only use it for travel but I enjoy it so much I plug it in when I'm at home now too!
5,It’s a great compact piece for charging my iPhone 13Pro Apple Watch Series 7 and AirPods Pro. I carry it for my travels and it’s such a relief. Love it!
5,To put it simply this charging station gets the job done! Very easy to place devices on and the magnets are strong. My only complaint is that the light indicator is VERY bright. We put ours in a drawer so that we can charge the devices without seeing the light. Other than that I would highly recommend it!
5,I really like the compact size.  A simple and elegant charging solution for my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods.  Small can fit in pocket.  Excellent 3-in-1 solution.  One plug and cord versus the multiples I used to pack.  The phone charging pad is magnetic and works MagSafe iPhones. I like how the magnets hold the unit together when folded.  It won’t come open when you toss it in your bag.  An affordable and convenient solution.
2,The unit lasted approximately four months before it decided to stop charging my phone. RTOPS does not respond to messages. Amazon through Woot directly sells this unit and have told me it has a two year warranty. They told me to contact RTOPS for warranty information. RTOPS does not respond to inquiries. Their direct storefront has no purchasable items. It appears this seller is out of business. As such Amazon should bear the responsibility for the warranties especially when not indicating there would be no manufacturer support. Buyer beware.
5,Very easy to use. Simple to use and extremely convenient for charging iphone airpods at the same time. Take it with us every time we travel. Very sleek looking. Great product.
5,This is such a wonderful product!  I'm so glad I made this purchase.  It is small easy to store and carry and it charges everything:  my Apple phone watch and pods.  You won't be sorry if you make the purchase.
5,I was looking for a way to streamline my charging cable situation as I had a Qi charger for my iPhone but still needed a separate cable for my Apple Watch. This totally fit the bill. It keeps my nightstand tidy and charges my devices quickly. I'm looking forward to taking it on a trip next week as it will take up minimal space in my carry-on.
5,This product is very versatile. It served its purpose while traveling its very compact works well. The phone charging would get a little hot sometimes and its not something to keep on your night stand because I found the blue light from the devices being connected although helpful to tell that the devices were indeed connected its very annoying and too bright to sleep with.
5,I bought this as a substitute for all the bulky 3 in 1 apple chargers and am really satisfied with it. It is really compact and lightweight and easily charges my iPhone 12 Airpods Pro in a heavy-duty case and my apple watch. Great product and think it's a must for travel but honestly you can bring it everywhere you go.  I am going to buy a second one for my wife...
5,This product does a great job of saving space with the all the power you need when get to where you are going. I like that I can charge all devices at once with the clutter of multiple plugs and chords. Would like to be able to turn off the power light for sleeping at night but I can look past that minor detail.
5,This charging station works perfectly well with my iPhone 13 Pro AirPods 3rd generation and Apple Watch. I find this item itself one of the best for travel and portability. I love that is easy to put your devices on and they charge quickly. Make my life easier! I no longer have a bunch of charging cables hanging around. I recommend this product!
2,I love the idea and it is very convenient. But too many issues.1.  The magnets that are in the ends to hold it in a triangle shape are not strong enough.  It pulls apart and falls which is very irritating.2.  The blue LED’s that come on when charging are very bright and will light up half the hotel room all night.Meh.
5,This wireless charger is great! I can charge my iPhone watch and ear pods at the same time. I really like the fact that it only needs one power cord to charge all three. This make it good for travel or decluttering my desk. It also folds into a triangle so that you can use it as a stand for your phone. This is handy for facetime or watching movies. I definitely recommend it if you use apple products.
5,I love my new wireless 3-in-1 charger. It’s great to be able to charge my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods Pro at the same time on my nightstand. The device is compact enough to travel with as well. Looking forward to taking it on my next trip and leaving all my extra wires at home!!
5,This saves me from carrying three separate cables for charging. As long as it holds up it will be so convenient. The one downside is that it’s a little clumsy to charge without a nice clear table top sometimes.
5,So far the charger has worked as intended. The charger has done a great job at charging my phone and watch at the same time. However when attempting to charge the phone + watch + airpods it seems that the charger has a difficult time keeping a connection with the airpods. Taking the case off of the airpods helps with this somewhat. Overall pretty solid charger so far.
5,I love that it folds up and doesn’t take up much space when traveling. Very convenient and easy to keep in my carry on bag to use at airports because only one plug is needed. This would be a great gift for any apple user!
5,I actually really enjoy this product! I just used it on vacation and liked the simplicity of only one cord for charging three items. It folds nicely also.  Sometimes my watch doesn’t get charged but it could honestly be my error not having it on correctly.  I would purchase this item again.
5,I bought this for traveling and it has saved my backside time and again. It’s really easy to use and compact so it’s easy to transport
3,I got this thinking it would be great to charge my iPhone 13  apple 7 Watch and air pod pros while at work or when I’m away.  But also thought it meant you could charge it up and use it as a wireless charger when I’m back country or hiking just in case.  Sadly it needs a power source such as a usb plug in or an outlet.  But still compact and great for traveling or at work.
5,I travel a lot and was carrying a ton of cords. This reduced my needs for almost all of them. It’s compact and works great
5,My daughter traveled to Europe with this item and it served her very well for the nearly 2 weeks she was there. It took up very little room in her bag and charged all three of her devices. It seems durable and I am happy with the price.
5,Worked out perfectly for me. I travel with a personal iPhone and a business iPhone. I also have an Apple watch. This was just what I needed for charging all three without carrying multiple chargers.
5,This is a great product and it is very compact. Wireless charging is fast as described. It can still be used in folded position which is cool. Takes up less space on a dest etc if all three are not needed at the same time. Also I tried charging my Samsung Buds Pro on this and voila it works! I wish it supported other watch brands than Apple watch but I knew it before I bought it so can't complain!
5,The product is really good I can use for my iPhone AppleWatch and AirPods all at the same time. At night I use like a triangle to use less space and activate nightstand mode on the watch. Lastly I like the fact that I can charge my iPhone and still hold it in my hand as the product is not big.
5,I just got this product today.  I'm already excited to use it on my next trip.  I used to carry separate charging cables for my watch and phone.  Now I just need one.  I may even purchase Air Pods now I charge them all on one device.  5 STAR!!!
5,Excellent charger for travels. I really recommend it. The best purchase I ever done.
5,The charging pad looks great and works great. A little finicky with the watch charging part but as long as you pay attention when setting it down charges without an issue. Appreciate that this model of multi-charger doesn't require you to go buy an extra watch charging cable but rather integrates it in.
5,This product did not work as advertised! That's why it was returned!
5,I do like the fact that I have a 3 in 1 set that handles all my charging needs & it charges fast it was delivered quickly & I’m very happy with it
5,Works great with all my devices keeps my desktop neat and orderly
5,Does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Charged iPhone 7 or later iWatch and AirPods Pro. Very convenient and space saver with only 1 cable to power it. You won’t regret it!
2,Everything about this works just fine and according to the description however it is not fast at all. The phone and the watch charge very slowly. The description makes it sound like this would charge as fast as if you had a lightning cable and just plugged it in individually. It’s not true. So if you have time it’s perfect if you don’t look elsewhereUpdate:  less and less happy with this. Slower and slower charge. Beginning to think it’s junk
5,It is a great all-in-one compact charging station that replaces all of the cables and adapters that I used to travel with.  Great space saver in my laptop bag and quickly setup makes it a great buy.
5,Working great! Can charge 3 items at once so I don’t need to pack so many items when I traveling. And you don’t need your original Apple Watch cable for this one so you can keep your original one for backup.
5,This is a great charger for traveling.  I charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max Airpods Pro and Apple watch 7 with this charger every time I travel.  The charger is light and easily fits into a small pocket in my laptop bag.
3,Stopped working after a couple weeks. It’ll charge my watch and AirPods for a while then just stop. The phone charger would never get my iPhone X up to a full charge. It would stop at 95%
5,This device eliminated all my cables while I travel. Makes my life easier and lighter.
5,This is an amazing product. I do a lot of overnight stays for work and hate taking 3 different types of cords. So simple and works great.
3,Overall this charging pad works great and it’s durable. My phone and watch fully charge every night. HOWEVER when you put your phone on it a super bright blue light lights up. Add in a watch and now you have 2 super bright lights. AirPods - 3 fright lights. I can’t sleep with it!! I had to put duct tape over the lights!!!
3,Phone doesn't stand up against charger like in the pictures. I even took my case off and still doesn't stand up.
5,I travel frequently for business and grew tired of carrying the iPhone charger Apple watch charger and Airpods charger. I was so happy to find something that checks all these boxes that's easy to use and simple to pack.
5,This is a great charger to use by your bed in your office or on the go. It folds up and it’s very compact and lightweight and provides fast wireless charging for your phones wireless earbuds and an Apple Watch.
3,Will be trying a return/exchange once I am back from the trip I bought it for. Charges the iPods Pro just fine.
5,This is a solid product it does not feel cheap or flimsy. Works great for charging my Apple Watch and iPhone at the same time and eliminates having  to travel with the various cords.
5,So awesome for traveling!  Works great very easy and so compact.  Love it.
5,Perfect for traveling - now only need one cord and plug to charge phone watch and AirPods. SO much easier especially when making multiple stops.  Highly recommend!
2,The concept is amazing- but neither my watch nor my phone would get a full charge even plugged in all night. My watch would maybe get up to 90 percent at best.
5,This is the best! It folds to be put away easily and charges fast.
5,I like how it folds up and is very store-able.
5,This wireless charger is a great choice to charge multiple devices at the same time. Highly recommend!!
2,The phone charger is too slow. I do not use it as my primary charger for that reason. I intended to but was disappointed with the charging speed/time.
5,It’s exactly what I needed. I charge all 3 my phone my watch and my air pods! So easy just fold it up and move on!!
5,This item is so easy to throw in a bag and go. Don’t need to worry about having a bulky charger while traveling. Love it!
5,No need to bring a bag full of chargers.It was so nice to have a compact all in one charger we left all the extra cords home.
5,This item will work great for my traveling which I do often. No more additional cables for my favorite three items. if you travel often this is a win-win.
5,I like to be able to charge all my devices at one time. The blue light lets me when when the are charging.
5,Very convenient and easy to use for traveling
2,Recently noticed my iPhone gets really hot during charging. Unfortunately the window to return has passed. Won’t be using this item in future but love the idea.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It met my expectations excellent  very practical to take on trips and the price was very good  it automatically turns off when charging my IPhone XMax .
5,this is a great purchase. The only thing that is a little annoying ise LIGHT BUT OVERALL IT WAS GREAT
5,You really get what you pay for an amazing product of good quality and reliability. Have been using it continuously since my purchase and it hasn't disappointed me so far.
5,Product works great and is very easy to throw into a travel bag and bring with you everywhere you go.
2,I purchased two.  Once still works great and one lasted about 6 days and no longer charges phone.
5,I simply took it out of the package and plugged it in! I just lay my phone on it while I’m doing stuff and it’s charging!
5,Bought this so we didn’t have to travel with as many chargers and it was great! Compact and efficient.
5,This is a great product that makes charging so easy without being bulky like other charging banks.
5,This is the only charger for travel purposes. By far the Best designed charger.Packaging rivals apple packaging and the units craftsmanship is superior.
5,Just what I was looking for to charge my watch phone and air pods. Easy to travel works fine very discreet and cute looking.
5,Great for travel
5,It’s fast charging and very lightEasy to use  it’s not like the other one that will be broken in a month that’s why I waited so long to see it.
5,Plug and play. Worked out of the box and the packaging was quality too. I know it doesn’t matter but I liked it.
5,Great product. Great value. Easy to use. Just plug it in and it’s ready to go.
2,Pretty expensive for an item that doesn’t work. The Apple Watch and AirPods charging section works fine. The phone section doesn’t. I’ve updated software to newest version used a case and no case and it still doesn’t work. I put it on the charger and made sure it showed charging after about 20-seconds the light turned off and it was no longer charging my phone (without anything being touched or bumped).Pretty disappointed I’ve used some cheap wireless chargers that never have had an issue even through my case and mounting magnet (that is setup for wireless charging). I was hoping to declutter my nightstand. I guess it’s back to the drawing board.
5,Easy to use and super compact for traveling.  Reduces the need for multiple cords.
5,I love the sleek look  not bulky . Will definitely be packing this when I travel .
5,It’s helpful that The charging station lights up when your items charging
5,Works great charges phone Watch and AirPods quickly and folds small when not in use.
5,This is a great product! I recommend it for anyone who needs a wireless charger and it’s excellent for traveling.
5,This wireless charger is great for my phone and earbuds. It is very lightweight and can fold up nicely.
5,Purchased 2 of these devices and they work properly. They are easy to use. So far so good.
5,This works perfect. Super compact for traveling. Happy with my purchase.
5,This is a great compact charger for my devices
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like the product because it’s easy to use no hassle on how to use it.
5,I love how compact it is for traveling. Great price and set up was easy!
5,It appears to work fine and worked well for charging a new iPhone.
5,Does everything that is says. Works very well.
1,This product folds up for travel means fewer cords . . .  but I plugged in my Apple XR phone and my Apple watch for overnight charging about 8 hours.  The watch charged completely.  The phone charged only 85% and the back was HOT to the touch.  I should have been skeptical when I was offered an Amazon gift card for a review (positive or negative it said). -- and I am not taking them up on the offer -- just want to give an honest review.  So sorry this product isn't up to standards -- I really wanted it to work!  I hope the company perfects it and makes it satisfactory in the future.  The design is brilliant.
5,Love it
5,Easy to use and fits in a back pack. Great for travel.
5,Love this. Packaging was great compact simple.  Great product.
5,Love that is compact. Great for traveling and charges great.
5,Good and easy to use for traveling as you just need to carry just one charger for your Apple watch phone & airpods.
5,Excellent product. Fast charger and great for travel.
5,Easy to use and compact
5,Good quality for the price.
5,Perfect for traveling.
1,So bummed!! This charger seemed perfect to charge all my devices and my job has me traveling a ton so the foldable compact size was a big selling point for me. Got it opened it and nothing!!  No power to the base.  Unplug/replug numerous times nothing! Thanks for the faulty charger!  Unfortunately I’d say stay away!
1,The idea is fantastic and the pricing was what originally caught my eye.  However the very first time I travelled with it the watch charger broke.  Not sure why all wires inside seem to be intact.  The magnetic chargers on the sides seem to work fine but I really need all three parts to function.
1,This charger initially charged all three devices. Then it wouldn't charge the iWatch and then the iPhone even overnight. I bought it to take on vacation and wanted to test it out before the trip. This charger was useless before the vacation began. I'm very dissatisfied.
2,Does not hold its triangle shape even with nothing charging.  Iphone does not stay "attached" like in the pictures and immediately collapses the triangle shape- unlike the pictures.  If it were not for that it may be worth it- returning for something different since if it only works as a flat surface there are better options.
1,Seems well built. Ok for charging an iPhone or Airpods. Takes entirely way too long to charge an Apple Watch even when there are no other devices charging. Retuned due to this.
1,It literally fried my Apple Watch battery! My watch was working perfectly fine before using this charger. When I took it off the charger it was so hot that I thought I got a burn. I was hoping that it would turn on and charge once it cooled down but no! It’s dead! Done! Have to go to Apple and get a new watch under Apple Care.
1,I can’t use this charger because of how slow it is. 4.5 hours to charge my Apple Watch! All night to charge my iPhone. Not cool
1,When browsing through the photos it shows that this is compatible with AirPod 2 headphones. However in their lengthy description it states that there’s two versions of AirPod 2 headphones and these only work for the ones with wireless charging. I checked the model number on my AirPod 2 headphones and there’s no distinction between wireless charging capability and no wireless charging capability so this isn’t a useful charging pad for me.
1,I finally stopped using this product after finding my phone and watch repeatedly failed to charge. I bought a similar product from a different retailer and it works much better.
2,watch flashes on and off all night on charger as if the charging is intermitted.
1,I saw a video of this charger on Tik tok and was impressed. Bought it and it was a disappointment. It worked well for a week. I wrote them a good review like they requested and then it stopped charging my watch.
1,I’ve had it for a little over a month and the watch charger no longer works appropriately
1,Received this at the end of July and it has already quit working.  Waste of money.
1,Phone charge portion just stopped working.
1,My phone does not hold a full charge when charging with this item
1,Horrible
1,I sent this back as the USB-C port that connects to the center panel gets extremely hot. It exceeds the safety net of the 104° F protection claimed on the listing. The portability and versatility of this form factor is attractive but you absolutely get what you paid for and in this case it's extremely difficult to get the proper R&D to produce a product that imitates a product that sells for 4x more (Apple Magsafe Duo).
1,Cheap. Stops working after a few uses. Don’t waste your money.
1,Such an amazing idea. I was really hoping this would work because it would be so great for traveling. Got to my first destination only to find my Apple Watch dead after the first night of my trip and I didn’t bring a backup charger. Tested various different outlets and other charging blocks and cables besides the one it comes with. Charged my phone fine but the watch would not charge on this device. Returning.
1,I purchased 3 and one will not charge the phone. I just reached out to customer service. Very cool unit but must have a bad connection
1,It didn't work
1,Bought this item in March and was completely broken by July.
1,The charging dock looked used and had some marks on it which are visible due to the white color of the dock. Also certain items keep getting disconnected from charging after reaching about 95% of the charge especially apple watch.
1,The idea is great but it worked inconsistently from the onset and now stopped working. Do not buy
1,if you don't put in perfectly on the charger it won't charge.  It stinks
1,After a little while I was used to it stopped working entirely and couldn't return.
1,This product never worked!
1,Device does not charge anything. Impossible to use
1,Took it traveling and stopped working so now you are stuck with no charger
1,The middle charger for the watch is completely DOA. If it worked it would’ve been a neat little charging station. Oh well returning it.
1,Simple…the watch of charger doesn’t work
1,I used this just once before it just stopped! It worked very sporadically after that. A great concept but DO NOT BUY. It doesn’t work.
1,Concept of product and compact design was great. Unfortunately not a good product if does not work. Stopped working on my third trip.
1,The product is good but the lights will bored you . I had to out a cover to block the sun in my room.
3,This charger worked great for my iPhone 12 Apple Watch 4 and AirPods 3. However it does not properly charge my new Apple Watch 7. As other reviewers have stated it seems to randomly charge the Watch 7 to somewhere between 75 and 95 percent. It’s difficult if impossible to reach a 100% charge. The Watch 7 doesn’t seem to recognize it consistently. Of course my watch has no issues with the included Apple puck.
5,This three in one charger works so well. Didn’t think it would work but it did!
5,It’s very light and small great for traveling!!! I would definitely recommend it to a friend!
5,Perfect size for trips!
5,This product is very convenient. I work 12 hour shifts so pulling this out of my pocket to charge my devices is awesome. Great for on the go! I love it.
1,I got mine and my phone doesn’t charge so it basically works just for my watch and airbuds.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love this product
5,This 3 in1 charger is portable and great for travel. It is compact and easy to use. It has light indicators for each charging pad to tell you it is charging and your device stays in place with the magnet-like mechanism. Would definitely recommend.
5,This product is very good. It is amazing when I use it to charge my phone. It also has a nice appearance and my phone can be charged well with this product. The light which can indicate the charging status is also very good. It can charge phone watch and AirPods at the same time which is very nice.
2,Mine just happened not to work…return was easy
1,I love the design. It’s bootlegged though. The one thing that is terrible about this particular design is the blue light indicating it’s charging. Super bright and doesn’t turn off. But all that doesn’t matter because it only lasted 4 months before it stopped charging all together.
5,Cuts down on cables then traveling and can use daily for my phone watch and AirPods. No problems charging all at once.
5,Useful all in one charger if you use iPhone/AirPods/Apple Watch. The material is so soft an high quality. It’s foldable to be carried easily and good for travelers since you need only one unit for charging all your devices. If you use an iPhone case it may cause the phone (mini and mid size iPhone 12/13) not sticking to the the charger completely slowing down charging. For Pro Max ones shouldn’t be an issue. It seems the iPhone charger part is not a fast charger. But overall if you use it for overnight charging your devices it shouldn’t be a problem.
5,Instead of having a tangle of wires I have just one item that charges my phone watch and earbuds. I bought it for travel but it has replaced my usual chargers next to the bed since it takes up just one USB and charges everything in a compact area. I brought it with me to New Orleans on vacation last week and used it in the hotel which was perfect. Just plug into a USB or bring an adapter just in case. I then went to my sister's and using my charger next to the bed made it easier to charge and took up much less space. Now everyone wants one like mine. I love how the middle pops up to hold your watch so you can see it charging if you need to but it folds up into literally nothing. This is one of my favorite things on Amazon! (and no I don't get any money from them. Just a happy customer)
5,I’m loving this charger. I got it for vacation. It charges quite fast was well. YOU CAN’T GO WRONG! So do yourself a favor and pick this charger.
5,Sleek perfect for travel and works great.
5,Very useful for home or traveling.  The charger folds for extra convenience.  Eliminates the need for carrying multiple cables.  I already have purchased two and will purchase others as gifts.
5,Looks beautiful. Very easy to use. Convenient and quick charging for watch and phone without having to plug anything extra in. The magnets are powerful so no worrying about your device falling off.
5,This item comes good quality and the price is much better compared to Apple and other big company product.
5,This is an all in one combination for my electronics. I love it. The charge strength is quick.  Especially for iPods and watch.
3,Very handy but not a fast charger
4,This charger charges very slowly. 6-7 hrs only gets me 90% on the phone.Some days it’s hard to get it to recognize the phone is there for charging. Got to take it off then back on or slide it all around to get the charger to start charging.Over all works just obnoxious and a bit slow.
5,This makes traveling so much more convenient now. It charges all three of my devices (iPhone watch and AirPods) without the hassle of bringing 3 separate charges.
5,I love that I can charge all three of my devices causes less clutter in the room
5,This product is very convenient. I love it. I have tried multiple chargers and I must say this one tops all of them. It don’t take of a lot space and it is easy to travel with.
5,This charger is perfect for on the go. It folds up nice and slim and the fact that it’s 3 in 1 makes it easy take anywhere.  The watch sat very nicely on the charger. The magnet has a strong hold. It also folds into a triangle for you to prop up your phone to watch it while charging. Would def recommend.
5,As a family we travel a lot and it is such a pain to travel with all the cords to charge our devices.  With this product all I have to grab is this compact charger and I can charge all of my devices.  We started off with 2 to see how well they worked and we will buying 2 more in the next couple of weeks before we take our next family vacation.  Great product!
5,This is a most have because it is very easy to use and it is a good size for all 3 devices.
5,One location for my phone watch and airpods?  Yes please.  One cord and is magsafe compatible.  I am thinking of buying this for my entire team.  Totally worth it.  Eliminates two bricks and two cords.
5,I’ve used a ton of these wireless chargers but they all have draw backs except for this one! The charger pads have MagSafe integrated and the watch charger is built in not a separate part. The unit works will all three (AirPods phone and watch) at the same time with the included block. This thing also folds so you can use less space or it as a charging stand. It’s small even when expanded but also fold super small for travel.
5,This is exactly what I need. For the longest time I was looking for an affordable wireless charger that charges multiple devices at once and this is it. On top of that it charges super quick!
5,Product is compact and great for travel! Does charge two devices at the same time--my iPhone and EarPods.  I don't have an Apple watch so I cannot speak to a third device. Does come with its charging cable!  Instuctions are in a very tiny font and could be easier to follow but once figured out works very well!
5,Overall nice product nice finish
5,Wonderful charger. Works great. Very handy
5,Very small and portable can charge my Samsung phone and earbud at the same time and reasonable speed without any problem.Only small issue is when in triangular stand status it is not strong enough to support a heavy phone but no big deal as charging flat on the table is always preferable to me.
4,This is USB 2.0 to USB C not USB C to USB C.I tested a Samsung S21 Ultra and a iPhone 12 Pro Max on this product. With my Samsung at 39% battery it took 1 hr 46 mins to charge to 100% - which is fine. It charges at the same rate as my 3 year old Samsung wireless fast charger.
5,It's an amazing product nice design and works really good you drop on it your phone and air pods and apple watch all at the same time and plus it has like a little stand for you phone great product really happy with it
5,Great product Very convenient product specially when traveling.
5,So easy to use with my iPhone 12 Pro and watch. Works great and easy to carry especially when traveling.
5,What's to say about this charger? It does what it says it does and it's nice and compact and great for travel.  Will charge your Apple Watch iPhone and earbuds simultaneously.Bit overpriced though for what you get.
5,So far so good. Working well with iPhone 12 I watch and ear Pods. One wire.
5,I bought this product for travel and is great
