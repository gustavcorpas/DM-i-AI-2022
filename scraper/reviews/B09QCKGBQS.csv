5,This is a great deal but even better they work!!!
5,They are cords. They don’t have any effect on charging power (that comes from your power source/brick) these do their jobs and are cheaper than other options I found
5,Needed 4 cords and this fit the bill. They work great and as expected.
5,Works well in the car withh the Mac and in the kitchen!
5,They work like a charm perfect length and super nice charging cables
5,Checking the market for a few alternatives for original lighting cable I would need some that are also long enough because my wall outlet is far from the bed.The package is quite simple and the cable are not wrapped which I found this the first time as wondering is new or not. Except the downside  being not wrapped well so may not be a good choice for gifting. The product itself are quite nice similar design as the original one but got a decent length upgrade this cable extend to almost 2 meter which make my phone quite reachable to charge on bed.For about a week use now everything look good no issues of the charging and no sign of disconnected from charging durability will be determined later but I do not think it will break so fast.For this prices with 3 cable shipped that is quite a good alternative for my iOS device.
5,Good value for the money. Charge is my phone what more can I ask

3,Great price.  Cord a good length.  Only problem is my ancient ipad refuses to charge with anything except a Apple produced cord and so it refuses to charge if I try to use one of these.
3,Doesn’t work as it should.
