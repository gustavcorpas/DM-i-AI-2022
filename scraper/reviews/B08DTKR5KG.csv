5,I love it.
5,Not only is these thing super sturdy and very adhesive! I was about to remove and replace off of my jelly case for a better grip without compromising how well it sticks the second time!
5,I like that it can be re-positioned if needed. Stays put. Easy to use one handed
5,This popsocket is cute strong and versatile. It's great for just holding in my hand as well as giving me something to spin and pop when I need to fiddle with something. Plus the design is cute. I like that I can switch out to a different design if I want to.
5,This works as you'd expect and is really cute. The colors could work with a lot of things and I really like how it pairs with my Otterbox "Statement Series for XR" case. My phone is red and most of the back of my case is clear with a black faux leather bottom. This looks great without being too matchy matchy. (Yes I am still rocking the iPhone XR...)
4,I like how i can change the top but it was kinda hard to attach at first i thought it was broken but i guess i had to pinch and twist then it locks in
4,I really like this product. It helps keep my phone secure when I am using it.  I am much less likely to drop the phone.  It makes using it for reading games and research easier to manage. The only thing I am not sure about is that it really sticks to the case I have for my phone which is very smooth.  I have tried to remove and reset it but I cannot get it off.
5,I love this pop socket with the black background and small wild flowers. It’s so feminine and pretty. I’m happy with my choice!The adhesion seems very strong and sturdy too.I always buy pop sockets. I’m not a huge fan of the newer style where you can change out the design. My last one kept popping off on it’s own. Hopefully this one is better.I buy these because I feel like they help with gripping my phone and typing. :)
3,My pop socket arrived as just the top of the pop socket not the base.  There was no way for me to attach this to my device.  The listing says it was supposed to include the full pop socket unit so I contacted the seller which redirected me to the pop socket website.  Their customer service was so helpful and they provided me with a discount code for a free pop socket base shipping included.  I am thankful for the helpful pop socket customer service team but I wish my product had arrived correctly the first time when I ordered it.
5,I was worried about the quality of the print when I originally ordered but the print is so pretty and is actually great quality. Very happy this one!
