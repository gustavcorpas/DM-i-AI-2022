5,I am very pleased with this HP product. Since this is my first I didn't know what to expect from such a lightweight desktop unit. The quick response time to power up shut down and access my other wireless devices does not compare to my previous tower desktop/monitor/plug-in speakers. Setup was average not too difficult for seniors of my age and experience. The screen resolution is phenomenal and the speaker volume is exceptional. All in all this works very well for my personal and business use.
4,I bought this same model off the shelf at Office Depot for my wife last fall.  It had a CD drive and I was disappointed when this unit doesn't.  A remote CD drive suffices however.  I dislike the fact that there are no USB ports on the front of the unit.  I use flash drives regularly and I had to run a USB extension from the back of the unit.  I also hate all of the junk that is and was preloaded on the unit.  I'm still trying to get rit of most of it.  Frankly I yearn for the days of Windows 7 when you could have a computer that did exactly what you wanted it to do  nothing more nothing less.I finally gave up on this unit.  It started having problems a couple of days after the return window expired.  The screen would go black at random and you had to reboot the unit to get the screen back.  HP customer service was absolutely NO help.  There were so many ad popups that I finally parked this thing and went back to another unit.
5,This all in one was fabulous right out of the box!  It was easy to install and is fast and easy to use.
4,It doesnt have touch screen so if you thinking it comes with that it is not. Fairly good investment for daily use.
4,I use it for work very useful fast and effective!
3,Was super excited to get the computer only to have it come with a broken power cord. Now have to wait until Monday to get a replacement. Will update once I can actually turn the damn thing on but for now this sucks
5,- Definitely got the job done
4,Perfect for home use
5,Using this computer for basic daily purposes speed and quality is great. I don't use it for gaming or streaming but it may work well for those too. Very nice computer.
5,The quality of sound could be improved; however I plan to buy headphones which should resolve this issue. I would definitely buy this product again. I am smiling as I write this review. The product was delivered on time as scheduled.
5,Was up and working within an hour after receiving my delivery.
3,Pops ups every 3 seconds on the lower right corner. These are very annoying saying I have 3 viruses when I have anti-virus software running constantly.  It's really annoying. Otherwise it's a great computer.
5,Thanks works wonderfully!
5,What I was looking for.
5,easy set up quality picture
3,Microsoft is aware that Win 11 a  has memory leak in File Explorer. Once they fix this  I'd say 5 stars. If not I'll have to return it. Windows has a history of memory leaks on several builds. I expected more.
5,This saves me a lot of space on my computer stand.
5,I like the fact that it freed up space on my desk.
5,Great computer
1,Ugh. I was so excited to get this desktop all-in-one for my office. Right out of the box the display is very dark on the left side. Back it goes.
1,So frustrated I purchased 7 of these to upgrade my sales teams PC’s and they are not 27 inch screens… they are more like 21 inch. Very difficult as I needed these for grand opening of our new office. False advertising. 21 to 27 inch screen is a HUGE DIFFERENCE!
5,right out of the box works great.  very easy to install and loaded up was very easy
2,I don't normally write reviews but I've literally had this computer for 2 hours and the wifi isn't connecting anymore.
5,work well.
5,Perfect
