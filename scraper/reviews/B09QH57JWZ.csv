5,I can’t live without my Apple Watch!  I have had the series 3 watch for several years.  The only reason I upgraded is that I made the mistake of putting it in my cooler on a hot day and then proceeding to drop it on the asphalt.  So I bought the series 7 the same day because I live this watch!As a Rad Tech I use it while working to not miss calls from doctors or radiologists.  No need to carry my phone!  The important calls are right on my wrist and I can politely excuse myself to step out and talk to whomever I need to.The only downside to the watch is the battery life.  I have to charge it every single day.  With the old watch I could go a couple days without charging.  I like to sleep with it on because I like the silent alarm and vibrating for calls at night.  I am a hospital worker and it is convenient for not waking my husband.  So I have to remember to charge it when I get home from work so that I can wear it to bed.
