5,I've had this for a bit over a month and it works.  Not much else to day.  It's a cable.
5,I needed a longer power cable for an Asus router’s power supply. This did the trick with no issues.
5,The cable that came with my laptop was a bit too short for my use.This one seems to be adequate for the power drawn  and long enough for me.
5,I bought it in place of the original power cord with Chinese format plug. And it works pretty well meaning I don’t need to spend at least another 15 dollars on the whole power charge set. Saved a lot of money.
5,Very heavy duty cord. The length added more room for me to take it further in the room.
5,Thought my charger broke turns out this new cord fixed it! Awesome.
5,Gave me the extra length I needed to let my laptop stay plugged in . I hated it unplugging every time I moved my table
5,Pull out your old cord and plug this in for a new one. I purchased because I moved from Sweden to USA.
4,It's alright
5,Good one
5,Bought this because my laptop cable got shredded... This is much better than the original cable
5,Cord is very durable and strong!
4,The cord get the job done but strain relief near either end could use improvement.Also the cord could be more flexible which would make it easier to pack.
5,It suited my needs perfectly.  I needed a power cable for the adapter to use my European laptop while being in the Unites States.
5,Now I can use my laptop in the conference room at work. Just the length I needed to reach the outlet on the wall.
5,Heavier and better quality than the original on my laptop cord.
5,I have a stationary gaming laptop that I use this 3 ft. cable for.  Feels solid and has great rating for amps (even though no regular laptop will draw 13 amps but probably 2 or so).  I bought for easier cable management.  Works great!  However I cannot comment to durability throwing it in a bag and lugging it around and such as I don't do that.  But it does feel really solid and well built.
5,Great value!  This cable fits the hp chargers that I have at school.  Our district has given each student a chromebook and charger for school use.  I have many in the library for student checkout.  Sometimes the cable doesn't get returned but the charger does.  I searched for a replacement cable and was very happy when I came across this one because it fits perfectly and is inexpensive.
5,Exactly the cable I needed as I needed to switch from a European to a US plug for my laptop charger. With this I was able to avoid buying a whole new charger.
5,Works well with my laptop. If you have a pupper or a bunny prepare to replace chewed cords!
5,My husband came over from Australia to the US and didn’t want to either use a converter for all his chargers or spend $100 for a new MSI charger. This cable converted the laptop’s charger to use the US wall plugs for way cheaper than a full replacement. Works perfectly!
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Its a power cord so there is not a lot to write about it.  It fits into a Dell laptop power adapter.  The quality seems to be good.
5,This just what I was looking for. I have an old HP laptop with windows XP on it. There was some photos and movies I wanted to retrieve off of it.  I lost this part of the cord and wanted to get one to replace it. It works great.
5,My 11 year old dog decided to chew up the cord to my HP Laptop (not sure if he got zapped in the process?!)Fortunately I found this power cord for a reasonable price on Amazon. As per other reviewers it is a bit more “heavy duty” than my original cord and worked great. I decided to wrap some bubble wrap around my new cord just in case my silly dog tries it again!
4,Arrived on time. Fit the Dell power supply just fine. Seems to function fine. The only issue is the stiffness of the cord. Does not lie flat on the floor. I have not been able to straighten out the bends in the cable. The original cord had a rather flat form factor and was much more flexible. It may present a greater tripping hazard.
5,Product was exactly what I needed to connect power supply to outlet.
5,I was searching a replacement cable for my projector which cable is broken. This one is tight enough. The material is good also.
5,So I got a pretty power hungry mini PC that has a external power brick that the barrel end is only 10 inches and the outlet cable it came with was a measley 6 inches and the cable got warm.  I didn't really need 10' but at the time it was cheaper than even the 3' but this allows me to pretty much put the PC wherever I want.  This cord must also be higher quality because it doesn't get hot like the 6" one the PC came with.  I would buy it again but probably not so long 10' is a little overkil.  I keep most of it coiled up but if I ever need it longer say I'm out of outlets on a power strip I could string this out to the next closest wall outlet.  And like I said the PC is really power hungry and this doesn't get warm at all.
5,I nothing special. It did what it was meant to do
5,The StarTech power cord is durable and it is the right length.  The cord that came with laptop started to malfunction year after I purchased it due to the lack of durability.
5,Good quality cable along with fast shipping!!
5,Startech products are often somewhat more expensive than the competition but in my experience it's usually worth it. Don't want to risk equipment to cheap power cables go with these.
4,It does what it’s supposed to although the cable is a bit stiff.
5,This cord is very durable. I was immediately impressed with how strong this is.
5,I had a sonic cleaner and I misplaced mine before even got to use the darn thing if he asked me what’s going on I bought this sonic cleaner and I still haven’t used it but the cord fits so Amazon is not going to post my review until I say something nice or something like that I don’t know it’s a Amazon what are you gonna do?
5,So far my computer is working like normal and I'm satisfied with the plug.
5,I had a UK purchased Dell laptop. This power cord enabled it to work in the US without an adapter.
5,I had concerns buying an aftermarket electrical cord but my concerns were baseless. Cord performs and fits well even better than original OEM.
5,Working good with my Asus charger
5,Cord worked
5,Good Value for money
5,Bought this to replace the short 3 ft cord on my Dell Inspiron laptop adapter. This works perfectly.
5,Quickly delivered good quality cable.
5,It's a wire. It works. What else can I say? Do you need one of these? If so this will definitely serve its purpose. Though it is a bit stiff. (Not a lot. Kind of in the middle.) So if you're looking for one of those really flexible rope-like wires look elsewhere and at a much higher price point.
5,Needed a new A/C cord for an old Gateway laptop power-brick that had become worn and cracked over time. Ordered this one and found a heavy duty well made replacement that worked exactly as needed. I  can't make any comment on durability of it since I've just received it but my expectations are that it should do well. Would buy again and recommend.
5,I plugged in one endI plugged in the other endThat's pretty much itThank You
4,Works just like the original cord for my computer that got lost.
5,Cable is just like the original.  I thought I was going to have to throw the USB hub away for lack of a power cord.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  The packaging was very good protecting the product from damage.  The package arrived in a very timely manner. Looking forward to doing business again. Thank You!
4,The item itself is good...the purpose for what it was intended not good at all. Battery still won't charge.
5,Not bad long enough. It's what I need. I hope it can be used for a long time.
5,Wow! I couldn't believe the good quality of this cord! The original cord the computer had was about a foot long skinnier and less durable. It was the reason why the computer was constantly shutting off. The original power brick and the cord were faulty from the start. I am so glad I chose to buy this! It's worth every penny for it's durability quality and length!!
5,Needed a longer cord for my laptop to make it easier to use on the couch while plugged in without tripping over the power cord and brick.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It is slightly thicker cord than the manufacturer provided cord; however that's really not an issue for me.  the plug fit perfectly in my laptop's power brick and it supplies power without any issues.  Not much else to say.
5,Perfect. Order now.
5,Very beefy cable. as of writing I've had it for 3 years with the daily abuse that a laptop charger gets.
4,I found that it was the battery connection at the other end of the entire cord. It was a Great value for my money. Thanks Amazon!
5,A puppy chewed holes in my prior laptop power cord so I needed to replace it. I only needed a portion of the cord so I found this product. Really great price and the cord is a lot longer than the original I had. This one is 10 feet so it makes it so much easier for me charging my computer The cord is very sturdy came securely packaged and arrived on time. I'm very happy with this purchase. Great value for money.
5,easy Install
5,I used for my laptop MSI GF75 thin. It fitted perfectly.
5,I bought it mainly for its length (got the 10 ft wire) but this wire seems far better than the one that came with the laptop.
5,It's a power cord. It's not sticky or flimsy and it fits my power supply so I have no complaints.
5,This is great and came in time
5,Nice cord pretty thick. But only downside is it came completely lathered in some kind of scented oil that is stuck in my room
4,Bought this because my old cord was just too short.  This new cord is clearly 10 feet long and that helps a lot where I need to plug in.My only gripe about the cord is that it's not thinner.  It's a good beefy cord and seems sturdy but when carried with my laptop seems to over-do it a bit.  Not so bad but a thinner cord might be lighter which would be nice since I'm carrying it in my backpack.Otherwise no complaints.  The seller sent it very quickly so if you order it you'll probably get it days before they say you will.  It's a good cord from a great seller.  Enjoy.
4,Came quickly...fit perfectly.
5,Order was grey
5,It's a sturdy cord. I had no problems using it it is thicker than my original cord and about a foot or two longer. I'm using it on an old Dell laptop.
5,Required a replacement after my MSI laptop power cable given way. The product fit the well as a replacement. The cable thickness is decent. Nice quality.
5,This power cord worked entirely well with my Lenovo g510 Charger. Thanks
4,There are those days where I need my laptop to be on power all days and this cord works as expected Startech is a solid vendor and their CSR's are the best!
5,Nice replacement for the power cord for my adjustable desk
4,Good build quality. Heavy duty. Snugly fits my laptop power adapter.Would buy again.
5,As described. Better than expected
5,It was easy to install and worked right away no problems.
5,We just moved from Europe and my wife had to use a converter every time she was working on her laptop... not anymore! Figured i could just replace the power cord and that should do the trick and voilá it works like a charm. It's even longer than the factory cable with the EU head so its a double win.
4,it did the job.
5,Yea its a power cord.
5,It just like the original
5,Works pretty well. Been using it for a decent amount of time now.
5,Just as expected
5,Perfect. This cord was cheap came on time seems to be of good quality and it works. Def recommend it.
5,So far so good no complaints.
5,Worked fine costs not much. Worth the price.
4,The cable itself was actually 10'3" from end to end (not counting the prongs or 3pin plug) which was nice. The only thing that could make is better is if they sold a cable this length but with the 3pin segment at a 90° angle; that would've worked a little better for a wall mounted TV like I used this for. But otherwise a flawless cable!
5,works well.well made it is
5,Works as it should
5,Good cable not much to write
5,I work with several laptops at work and plugging them in or switching them around is always a pain because of where the outlet and UPS are located. I started looking for this (having used a similar extension plug for workstations) and it has been an arm and back saver. I have it plugged in and run up to a hanging hook. I just pull out the power brick for the right laptop and plug it in. No leaning over and shoving an arm between the wall and desk or crawling under the desk. I have not found a laptop brick that doesn't work with it.
5,Good product
5,Works well
5,Exactly what I wanted and it works. I'm very pleased.
5,Worked exactly like the original which I found 2 months after I ordered this one.
5,Looks brand new and it works!
5,Also called a 'mickey mouse' cord (look at the end with the three circles - mickey mouse!) these are used for both laptops and mITX pizo-power boxes.  I have used a half-dozen of these and they are what you see: a cord that transfers power.  Neither the best nor the worst I have ever used they are a good balance between price and quality if you need a mickey mouse cord.
5,It's a power cord how much can I say? Has a male end which fits in the wall female end which fit my computer is 6 feet long as described and power goes through it.
4,Good product
5,I had no idea I could find this on here bit with prime and a fair price I was tickled. Due to a tv given to me with no cord I now paid less than $6 to add a tv to our home!
5,It works.  It feels/looks sturdy.  I don't think durability can be judged quite yet.
5,It's a replacement laptop-style power cord.  Very well built and durable.  I plugged it in and it worked.  What more could you want?
5,Very pleased with this replacement item after my new dog chewed the old one!
5,Item arrived and performed as described. Good quality price and fast delivery made this purchase an overall good deal. I recommend this product and seller.
5,High quality just buy it!
5,Good
5,Worked to replace one from a Dell Power supply which was fraying.
5,Purchased as an auxiliary cord for my Bestek Portable charger universal adapter travel converter when using it at home and don't need the bulky adapter (the cord it came with ends in an EU plug and needs an adapter for either the UK (the trip I bought it for) or the US (home). So far so good.
5,it worked for the power brick i needed it to.
5,Works perfectly
5,Good cable. Plenty long. Does the job.
5,Works as intended. I lost my previous cable and had to buy a replacement. No problems
5,Brought this to fit my Dell Inspiron 15 laptop. Plug arrived in a secure package brand new plugged it in and it works great.
4,This cord worked perfectly. I used it for an older satellite receiver.
5,Worked a treat with my Toshiba laptop. Can't fault it. Good build quality did exactly what it was meant to do.
1,Just as others have said not only does this cord break within a week-2mos of purchase it is extremely unsafe.  Within 3 days of using it the black insulation had broken at both ends where it connects to the plug and the box. We figured if we were very careful when uplugging it it'd be ok for awhile.  Yesterday (less than 2 mos after purchase) my daughter was using the computer and noticed a hot electrical smell.  We quickly traced the source to the plug and unplugged it.  It was warm but not yet hot to the touch.  My husband examined it and the inner insulation had also broken so bare wires were showing.  It also hadn't charged the computer.  I shudder to think what might have happened if we'd plugged it in to charge overnight and gone to bed.  It very likely could have caused a fire.  Definitely not worth the cheap price.
5,Great! The cord looks just like how it does in the photos and saved me from spending $75 on a new charger.
5,I have been buying Star Tech parts and accessories and have always been pleased with them. Although this is a simple item it replaces a cord that is three times its length and my power supply no longer takes up excessive space in my laptop bag.
5,Excellent product it's super long which is great compared to the stock cord that came with my original AC adaptor.
5,Good product. came on time works great
5,Computer use
5,quality product!  Thank you!
3,This thing could supply power to the space station as heavy as it is. Very bulky for a laptop power supply which is what I purchased it for. Not kidding this could possibly be rated for 14A...
5,This works perfect for my latitude 5470
5,Good quality aparently.
5,Very durable and sturdy. and every long
5,Fits good. Long length
4,does the job.
5,Better quality than expected very thick wire
5,Great cord. This is a replace for an Acer Laptop and i think you can use it for Dell Laptops also. It is nothing much I can say about the product. What you see is what you get. It comes in a easy opening packaging a plastic zip lock bag.I love that is easy open packaging.
5,Higher quality than any OEM cable I've ever gotten with a device.
3,This cord is fatter than the cord to my vacuum cleaner - why? Am I powering a bandsaw with it? Am I using it outdoors or in a machine shop? No: It's described as a laptop cord and as such it could be made flat instead of circular in cross-section. It appears to be the kind of cord that is stuffed with kraft paper to maintain the circular shape.
5,Fast and accurate.
4,was the perfect replacement
5,Very good
5,This product fits my HP laptop with no issues.
5,It does what it needs to do: carry electricity from here to there - exactly 10 feet!
5,Works just fine for my adapter for my laptop.
5,Good
5,Love may be a strong word in this case it's a power cord to replace the one I lost but it works well so I am happy with the purchase.
4,The product is very good. But you need to consider whether it is too short for your need before buying this 3-feet model.
5,This cord is just wonderful. It transports electricity from one end to the other and because it's made of rubber instead of metal you don't get shocked. Genius!
5,Order shipped fast and was exactly as described.
5,Handy so I don't have to haul my entire charger home from work every day.
5,Excellent. Stfong cable
5,I bought this to use with my laptop when it is not at my desk.  (current cord is wound through desk grommets and behind other equip - too cumbersome to take in and out).  Cord is high quality heavy cable.
5,Excellent!
5,Good quality
5,no issues works great and is actually a little heavier than the original.
5,I replaced the 3-slot cord on my Dell laptop power supply with this which solved my distance issue from the outlet to the couch. Dell should sell these on its website.PS not all Dell power bricks use this type of cord - compared the connector to your own.
4,The cord is thicker than I though but worth its price.
5,I bought this cable for my LG PA75U LED Smart projector because I wanted to have a spare. Have been using it for a month and haven't had any issues. Works great!
5,This cord is exactly what I needed.  My dog had chewed up my old cord and I was worried that it may be difficult to find a replacement at a reasonable price. It works perfectly and was an amazing price.
5,I bought this for an Intel NUC and well it's a power cord. It plugs in to the NUC power supply and the wall... not much else to say.
5,just what I needed.
5,great and total compatibility
5,Works great!
5,A GREAT VALUE!
5,Exactly what I needed.  Works perfectly.
5,Long and strong
5,Perfect!
5,Works well.
5,Good reliable quality.
4,It's a power cord!Both sides fit in their corresponding counterparts and the length is correct.Thats all you can say about it.
4,What more is needed to say other then yes it works no there is not a problem with it.  It was made well.
5,Works as advertised!
5,Fast delivery 36" long cable and both plugs work just fine.  Appears to be well-made no problems with using.
1,This product was inexpensive and arrived quickly; however it only charges my laptop about 40% of the time. The laptop cannot be in use otherwise it will not charge. The other 60% of the time the box makes audible noises and heats up without providing any power to my battery at all.
5,Great product!
5,The AC cord was broken on my laptop computer -- so instead of buying an entire new AC adapter ($50+) I got this. It works great and is even longer than my old one.
5,good
5,Exactly what I needed. Fast and easy!
5,Sturdy and good quality
5,It's a plug!My plug is Hispanic.
5,Works as expected! When you need it you really need it!
5,The cords are up to the expectation. I think its the best deal I can get for this types of product
5,What's to say it's a standard power cord I plugged it in and it works.  tra la la la la
5,I like this cord better than the original equipment.  It is longer which is much more useful.  Cannot beat the price!
5,Great.  Exactly what was advertised.  Much cheaper than local stores.
5,A nice short cord for packing especially when you know you'll have a desk with an outlet right there.  Very convenient.
5,I always wanted a six foot cord. great price.
5,Perfect In Every Way It Fit Fine!Right item on time at a reasonable price how can you beat that!
5,good quality. also work for old lcds that need the mouse ear cord. nice quality. need to fill this space because of 20 wds requirement
4,Fits fine long enough to get the job done.
5,Works and goods length
5,Looks good feels sturdy and handles the current for a laptop or anything less. Why anyone needs nine more words escapes logic.
5,As advertised.
5,Fast shipment and good quality product.
5,Good quality product.
5,Shipped fast and durable as hell.
5,Works.
5,It looks and feels very sturdy and was a great and cheap replacement for my Acer Travelmate laptop's power cord which stopped working.Strongly recommended.
5,Works great
5,It's a cable srsly.
5,Perfect replacement cord.
5,Great
5,Good fit.
5,It works.
5,This cable worked perfectly! Don't waste your money on a more expensive cable that will do exactly the same thing.
5,All ways reliable
5,Excellent
1,I thought I would take a risk and go for it after some of the sub par reviews. All three of my cords broke after about two weeks (unplugging and plugging in often with laptop use). Totally worthless. One of them became extremely hot in a specific part of the cord as if the wires were crossed. I got three more cords from a local electronics shop for the same price - we'll see if they're higher quality.
5,Sturdier and longer than I expected. Exceeded my expectations.
1,So this product is what it seems to be: it fits the specifications listed by its sellers. However it broke within two weeks of purchasing it. I thought although many of the reviews said it was poor quality that it couldn't be TOO bad. I thought everyone else was just being whiny and it'd probably work fine. Nope. Now I'm stranded without a functioning charger for my computer. Hoorah.
1,Good!!!
1,The cable length was great but the prongs were not even the same length and it hasn't even been a full month since I received it and the cable has already torn at the base of the cord.
1,The cable worked fine for 1-2 months but then fell apart at the connections despite using it only at home with minimal wear and tear. Soon after the interior wires were visible. Very unsafe! Shortly after this the cable broke completely. The quality is just not good.
5,Good quality
1,The power cord wire burnt out all by itself within three weeks. I had bought two of these and they both had the same fate. Therefore it is not a one off thing they are of poor quality. Put your money in something more durable.
5,Earthed US plug Laptop Computer adapter feed with Mickey mouse female connector decent length
1,Don't buy it. I've bought this cord on August but it breaks within two month. I didn't do anything special just for daily usage but one day when I plug it in there is no power any more.
1,I'm very disappointed. It stopped working after 3 weeks.This is a cheap product but not reliable. I came back to adaptors.
5,Just arrived from Europe. A lot cheaper than adapters.
1,Look elsewhere don't buy. It can be dangerous. Lower quality materials used which are prone to breakage with light nominal temperature use.
5,Had a customer who lost part of their laptop power cord (this part obviously) and needed it replaced.  I found this one and got it.  It worked perfectly with the Gateway laptop and all is well.  Cheap insurance if you are prone to losing parts of your power solution for your laptop.  These also work for some of the USFF units out there that have this plug in place of a regular one and the occasional switch power cord.
1,The cable worked fine for a few days but then got hot near the plug and stopped working. I had to buy another one.
5,This was just what I needed.  The power cord for my laptop was not working.  I thought I was going to have to replace the whole thing and get it directly from HP.  However I found this and decided to try it.  It works great.  I did not have to rplace the whole thing just the section that was not working.  I would definitely recommend this product.
5,It's black. It's 6 ft. long. It's round. It has a North American male plug on one end and a C5 female power connector on the other end. IT'S A CABLE.
5,Bought this for a Toshiba laptop power supply. Works great.
5,Works perfict
5,Its a cord. Cheap and it works. What more can I say.
5,Item as described
5,The cable has nice quality100% worth to buy
5,Works perfectly fine! Highly recommend it.
5,very well made
5,Cheap fix for separated cord
5,It works handles real strangulation force as well.
5,Ok
1,The cable is too long and does not look very sturdy.
5,It's cheap it works it looks like a quality cord so no complaints.
5,Very good product and in great condition
5,I like it the connection is a HP cord for my laptop and it is a extra cord thank you very much loving it
5,As expected
5,Works for my HP laptop. Long enough twice as long as my previous power cord.
5,Fits perfectly built better than OEM cord and way cheaper than buying complete adapter. You can't go wrong with this !
5,Saved an old laptop - confirmed works flawlessly with old HP and Acer laptops - should work with anything it fits
5,I bought this to replace a laptop cord that I had been using for 6 mos that had bit the dust.  This cord is MUCH better quality than the one I replaced.  I expect no problems with it.
5,Works with my charger. My laptop can be charged again!
5,This standard replacement cord for my son's window dell pc is a great product.  It fits good and works very well. Yes is a good item to purchase.
5,Todo igual a lo que decía la publicación
5,Curó mi diabetes me quitó lo feo reparó mi relación con mis padres hizo volver a mi ex y me ayudó a encontrar a Dios.Mentira es un cable.
5,Me gustó que el cable es de un calibre mayor a lo que imaginé ya no pude encontrar el cable en ninguna tienda por lo cual esta opción fue la mejor.
5,Creo que no hay mucho que decir es solo un cable electrico funciona bien. Yo lo ocupa para mi laptop y no me ha dado problemas
5,Me di cuenta de que mi labtop no cargaba la bateria pensé en que tenía que reemplazarla sin embargo me percate que este cable estaba dañado es una marca genérica con un empaque poco atractivo pero la funcionalidad y la calidad es indiscutible.La bateria carga correctamente.
5,Tenía necesidad de un cable. Encontrarlo en Amazon y pedirlo me llevó dos minutos. Era justo lo que yo necesitaba a muy buen precio. Gracias.

5,El cable lo compré para sustituir el que tenía que ya presentaba falso contacto y no se podía conectar mi cargador.
5,Un cable muy grueso y de terminales mas gruesas que el original que reemplazó por desgaste este no tiene cara de que se vaya a dañar nunca y entra muy sólido en la tele no deja espacio para que la conexión haga juego.
5,Muy buen cable de poder. Cumple perfectamente con lo esperado. Muy resistente y con la longitud perfecta.
5,Pues bastante bien  tenía mis dudas ya que es bastante económico pero superó mis expectativas
5,Hasta ahora se ve de buena calidad. Es de buen calibre y el aislante se siente resistente y a la vez flexible.

5,Excelente reemplazo para un cable que se dañó. Mucho más largo que el original de mi laptop y más flexible
3,Buen cable pero excesivamente grueso para doblar y guardarlo.
5,Lo compre para reemplazar el cable del cargador de mi laptop y le hizo perfectamente.
5,Fue un poco difícil de colocarlo en el adaptador las primeras ocasiones y por alguna razón tardaba en pasar la carga después de unos días de uso no tuve problemas.
