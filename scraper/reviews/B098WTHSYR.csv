4,I really love the backlighting of this keyboard.  I purchased one for home and then went back and purchased another for my office a week later.  I tend to wear off the letters on a normal keyboard.  I purchased this in the hope that if I wore of the lettering the backlighting would still be there to show me the letter.  However as you may be able to see the the letter "E" in the picture the black is actually wearing off!  When that goes I'll be in the same situation of not seeing the letters on the keys.  Lol.  The backlighting is quite appealing when working in low light conditions...Not sure how long I'll be able to use it...and the search will be back on to find another.  Hate to waste perfectly working keyboards like that.
5,I love the keyboard! No latency issues for me. Battery life ok so far. Lasts at least a few days. I haven't run it dead yet i just plug it in once or twice a week (USB type C). Feels high quality and it's compact enough to take on the go. The mouse is ok. Still using original AA for mouse (almost 2 months.) Works great just wish it had more buttons. The center push button behind the mouse wheel is a nice feature. It changes mouse pointer speed. Can be very handy. For the price you can't beat it!! Backlight brightness adjustment and color selection is pretty sweet.
4,Keyboard is comfortable and heavy enough to not feel cheap. I really like it.The mouse is another thing. Battery life is fine fit is fine. It is just glitchy. It has a tendency to go to sleep then you must wake it up by left clicking and sometimes that takes a few seconds. An eternity when using the computer. It takes some getting used to.
4,Everything works as stated though they don’t make it clear that the mouse is a conventional optic mouse that needs its own battery.  The keyboard is nice enough though the backspace key and the space bar for some reason I feel like I have to make a point of hitting more deliberately they don’t quite flow with my typing style or something like that.  The charge lasts me about a week perhaps but the first indication I usually have that it’s getting low is random keys double striking or more.  Like I’ll type “M” and it will produce“NM” instead no matter how many times I hit just the “M” key or I’ll hit “0” and it will send a flood of them to the screen until I stop it by hitting backspace stuff like that.  Plugging it in to charge it solves the problem and it will allow typing while charging.  There are a bunch of colors and you can vary the brightness too so that’s nice in the dark.  I sometimes type while my wife is sleeping in the same room (I’m a remote worker) the keypad and the mouse are both perfectly silent better than any “quiet” units I’ve tried before.  The keypad is reminiscent of old “chicket” style keyboards but does feel better than those.  Happy with it overall.
4,Such a good keyboard! The lights are really bright and makes it easy to see the letters on the keys love all the different color options. It’s very think and sleek looking. Heavy and sturdy doesn’t feel cheap at all. The rechargeable battery is awesome I was going through batteries like crazy with my old Dell wireless keyboard. Definitely worth the money!
4,The support was excellent. It looks like my original keyboard had a short on the top letters row and most most of the keys (except for T and Y) in that row would not work after 2 weeks of usage. I have reported this to Geemai and they were very responsive with a few troubleshooting questions. After that they sent me a replacement and it working great Thanks Geemai Support.
4,This product is great the only thing I would like to see and the reason for a 4-STAR vs a 5-STAR is I would like to see an adjustable height so that the keyboard is elevated for easier typing.
5,I’ve had this keyboard/mouse combo for about 10 weeks and use it for work. It’s been great! Only problem I’ve had is I noticed my favorite color was gone. I plugged it in and voila! It was back again. It just needed to be charged. I charge it about once a week. The mouse uses a battery and I haven’t had to replace it yet. I always leave it on because I forget to turn it off. I prefer not to have to charge my mouse so I’m glad it’s battery operated. I like the quietness of the keyboard and the backlight of the keyboard so I can see when I’m working at night. You do have to press a key to get the backlight to start working and that keystroke counts so make it a good one. I would recommend and I would buy again.
4,Standard color changing keyboard and mouse. No connection issues. Keyboard looses its charge within 24hrs (unless you flip it over and turn it off every time — never remember to do that). So the wireless keyboard stays plugged in to a charger.
4,The keyboard is excellent but the charge doesn’t last too long. I use this for my job which is around 8-9hrs and this only last a day or two at most. It’s very quiet which I love and the different light choices are very Nice! The mouse on the other has is terrible… I use three screen monitors at work and for some reason this mouse has a hard time with that. I had to buy a separate mouse. I would buy this for the keyboard though it’s easy to use and heavy duty which gives it a very nice look to it.
5,The backlight is perfect for working at night. I have three computers at home and this is my favorite keypad and mouse I have bought two more.
4,The keyboard is great. It's at a great angle but cannot be adjusted with feet on the back. The mouse isnt as responsive as it could be. I have to click multiple times for it to be recognized by the computer.
5,The keyboard is durable and well built. Keep it charged and it’s great. I was skeptical about the mouse but it has been quiet smooth and functional
5,I love how small and quiet the keys are however I have noticed if the keyboard or mouse is too close to my monitor (that sits on a metal and glass monitor riser) the keyboard will not work. I punch the buttons but nothing happens until I move the keyboard away from my monitor a bit then it works perfectly. Same with the mouse. Thank you.
5,it works great and when the battery gets low it lets you know by dimming the keyboard
5,I was a little hesitant to buy this keyboard when I found out it was rechargeable. I wasn't really sure how I was going to know when it was time to recharge and I was afraid it would die on me mid-day. I was thrilled to find out that as it's losing its charge the backlight color also starts to change so I always know when it's time to plug it in. It's also VERY sturdy but light enough that I can take it with me if I travel which is a huge bonus. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!
4,Functions as it should no complaints. I do wish I could lengthen the timeout for the keyboard l Iights but that is a minor annoyance easy to cope with. Overall I am happy with this product and am likely to purchase it again.
5,LOVE IT
5,So far no dislike's  had this for 2 weeks and have charged it once.  It keeps up with my typing so there is no lag and was plug and play.  This is the one to buy dont go cheap like i did at first.
3,The keyboard is great- the battery doesn't last too long but that's okay with me because it never leaves my desk so I can keep a charger right there. I have long nails and I need a low profile keyboard. This one is not quite as flat as I would like. My iClever is flatter and is a little easier to press the keys. (this would not affect someone who does not have long nails) It is slightly heavier and better quality than the iClever though and I like the backlight. It looks nice.The mouse on the other hand... does not really work. Is not responsive to movement which is a huge annoyance and I cannot get my work done with it at all.  I use this with 3 monitors so that may be a factor? Not sure.. I have to use a completely different mouse which takes up my ports and defeats the whole purpose of the wireless receiver connecting to both.
5,Needed a keyboard where the letters don’t wear off from usage. Was told to get a backlit one. Ordered two of these for our work computers. AMAZING! The battery life on the keyboard lasts all week we recharge them Friday after work. They are fully charged in a few hours. And the mouse that comes with it is made well and is very responsive. We love the product the seller advertised as it was. No issues at all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. By the way the backlit feature is a life saver in low light.
5,Works as designed! It’s a keyboard!!!!
5,The keys are kinda crowded so not the best for gaming. But it looks very cool and slim. Feel like I have to recharge it every single week which seems a bit frequent to me.
4,I purchased this 2 months ago the battery lasted a 40 hour work week and now it last 20 hours of working after only two months! Other then the battery life I love it just need a stronger battery in the keyboard!
4,like the keyboard alot im use to a bigger keyboard so i cant game on this one. but feels good looks good seems to be quality. battery good. the mouse button sticks so i feel like that is trash. but the key board is worth it by itself.
4,I found the keyboard for the price excellant. I have no complaints except that I have limited sight from cancer and I would have appreciated larger images on the keyboard other than that it is excellent. Easy to setup and works and does what I want. Would I recommend it YES. I have had other wireless keyboards with bluetooth and none work like this one. I have one bluetooth keyboard I have yet to make work.
4,I use it for work. The spacing is good between the letters and the light up of the keyboard is really cool. Tried plugging the wireless mouse USB into my docking station for my work laptop and it wouldn't register the mouse but plugged in versions it will so I don't think that the wireless receiver is compatible with dell docking stations. Not sure how it functions for games because I am not a child and don't waste my time on that stuff but assume it would be decent considering the quiet type feature and light up keyboard allowing you to be able to use it in the dark. Great battery life so far.
5,Only negative is I need two of these...one for home and one for office so I don't have to worry about taking it with me when I travel back n fourth.
5,I am in love with this keyboard!! The size is perfect the keys are soft and quiet the light is beautiful the battery lasts forever and the mouse is quiet too. I have gotten so many compliments on this keyboard at work. It’s so pretty! I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a new keyboard. It’s not too heavy either. It’s got just the right amount of everything to make it a great keyboard. Thanks! :-)
3,The mouse works well and we enjoy the feel of the keyboard.  The issue is that the battery doesn't last for more than a few days with less than normal use and the first time I charged it it took a couple of days and the charging light let me know when it as full.I'm now charging it for the second time and when the keyboard backlighting turns off it turns off the charging light for some reason. I turn the backlight on and the charging light comes back on so I don't know if it stops charging when turned off or it still charges but now doesn't display. It's been charging for at least 2-3 days and the indicator is still red.
4,Works well I just occasionally have issues with the mouse. Which is nbd for me I use a gaming mouse for gaming and this mouse for work. The keyboard is fantastic I prefer low profile to type more efficiently and this works great. Not one issue with it connecting or any latency. I just wish it would charge faster lol
3,Came well packed and works however very flat you have to click the mouse to get it to work and the keyboard. lighting is good I'll say that but has NO NUM LOCK key very disappointed in that unless this ol granny just can't find it. It works though so that's good.  Probably wouldn't buy it again but someone else might like the flatness. We don't game so can not speak to that. Will keep it because we can still use it but would not buy again.
5,I like this keyboard but the color and lettering started to wear off right away and now is gone on many keys.  Very disappointed
4,I just got this backlit keyboard and mouse combo and so far so good!Several backlit colors to choose fromSweet little soft touch mouse.
5,So far I really love this product! The keyboard is so sleek and classy it is thin and easy to move around. Super easy to use. I also love the mouse it is completely silent so that is a major plus! Haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery life but the keyboard is rechargeable and the mouse takes one singular AA battery. Love the color change too super nice! The piece that makes it wireless is located inside the mouse it took me a minute to find it. It also comes with a USB to USBC adapter as well. I recommend this product!
5,Got this for my wife and she loves it
3,Ordered this combo Aug 11 today is Sept 23rd and mouse crapped out on me today. Changed battery and still nothing. Sent email so we'll see if get a replacement. Keyboard still works great thank goodness! But for having this only a little over a month I'm not impressed.
3,Love the different colors. I love that it’s quiet. I love that it’s slim. I hate the battery life! 2-8 hour shifts and it’s dead. I don’t even use it the whole time. It needs to have a battery back up. I will be looking for another keyboard cuz I can’t have mine die during my shift.
5,I love it!!! The keyboard a beautiful turquoise lit keyboard! The mouse is great as well! After a min or two of not using the keyboard turns the light off to save power and when you start typing it comes back on! Fast! Slim! Cute! I just love it all so much! Definitely worth the money!
4,I like the size of the keyboard does not take up a lot of desk space. The backlites are great and the keyboard is very smooth. I found the instructions on how to setup the board a little lacking but as a novice was able to finally figure out what I needed to due to get it up and operating correctly. Would recommend that all purchasers plug in board and charge before use takes about two hours to charge. Remove receiver from mouse and install in pc or laptop turn on keyboard switch which is on back of keyboard(not front). Should be good to go.
4,This is a nice little keyboard.  The keys are quiet.  Colors are bright.  It's a heavy and stable keyboard.  I've used it for a week and the battery is still on it's first charge.
4,I can't really give an opinion on the features as this is a gift. It did arrive quickly and looks well made.
5,It’s exactly what I expected. Ultra slim and light weight and quite while typing. Battery life is great.
5,Work and gaming
5,Love the silent typing and ease of use overall!
3,The keyboard is working great however I wouldn’t say it’s 100% “silent”. Not really.One really annoying part is the keyboard’s light stays on for a 1 minute as soon as you touch any key.I just find this as a faulty design. This can get really annoying and also it drains the battery really fast!
5,Easy to use and love the keyboard light!
5,I love this set! I was really worried about battery life when I ordered these because I work 10-12 hours 6 days per week on my computer but I’m only having to charge the keyboard like once per week (if that)! Plus when it does need to be charged I can plug it in and continue working! It’s absolutely perfect! Mouse is great too haven’t had to change the batteries yet and it’s very smooth and precise love them both!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really like how quiet both this keyboard and the mouse are. A few days in and this one has become my go-to board for my main desktop for video editing playing games and writing.All of the keys that I've typed with on this board give about the same low volume although the spacebar is a bit louder. It's really only noticeable when I'm typing quickly. Pressing on the keys feels nice and I get the impression from it that this is a sturdy board. The mouse has also been virtually silent with low dull left and right clicks.The key lights which are decently bright have also been great for when I'm working in low light or darkness (my preference). I have my bed right next to my computer desk and chair so this keyboard is great to just take to bed and stream a movie or something at night with wireless controls.The only minor inconvenience I've noticed is I wish that the underside of the keyboard had a slot to keep the USB C adapter. I'm a little worried I'll lose that tiny thing but I don't really see myself using it anyway.The board and mouse are great and I see myself getting a lot of use out of them!
5,Easy to connect and seems to work well so far.
3,Love the lights quiet keys. However I have to charge it everyday. Also after about 2 months some of the black coating is coming off the keys. I can hardly see the letter E anymore. Tried to do an exchange but it was too late.
4,So aside from the crack on the keyboard which it came with I'm pretty happy with this keyboard. I haven't used the mouse yet since I have one I am used to already and like more because it has back and forward buttons on the side. But the keyboard does indeed let you choose between a handful of colors and it's pretty bright too. I haven't had to charge it since the one time I did when I got it and I've had it for a couple of weeks. It's range leaves a bit to be desired though and that's a point off for its ease of use. Plus the ding on the side but it does what I need it to and it's nice to be able to type in the dark while in bed.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Bought this for work. And while the clicks on both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly silent you can see from the video that it takes a few clicks for the mouse to “wake up.” While the keyboard I can just type and it wakes up right away.Also because my computer only had one port for the HDMI — which I was already using to connect the docking station for my 2-screens setup — I had to purchase a USB C female to USB A male adapter to be able to connect the mouse and keyboard. I learned that the receiver has to be connected directly to the laptop and not the docking station. Hope this helps!
5,was delivered a day early everything works as described. all colors work on backlit keyboard and mouse is very responsive with really quiet clicks. Ive had this for little over a month now and waited to write a review to make sure all continues to work. the mouse i have only put 1 battery in it so far and i use that everyday for hours while gaming and still going strong. the keyboard i use less often than the keyboard on my laptop but do use it when i am casting my laptop to my TV screen. The keyboard works flawlessly quiet keys and has a nice feel. i highly recommend this wireless keyboard and mouse combo to anyone looking for a great buy at a great price!
5,I have had this keyboard and mouse for over a year.  I have been working remotely so I have used this keyboard a lot since I've had it. The construction very durable and the keys work great. The mouse has silent clicking which I like. The charge for the keyboard lasts a long time with heavy use I would say I need to charge it once a week.
5,🐳
4,Great weight. Solid feel and construction with virtually no flex at all.Illuminated keys with adjustable colors and brightness look good.Great typing feel. Love the chiclet style keys. Even though the keyboard overall is a little more on the compact side it still is easy to type on with intuitive feel for the keys.While there is no adjustable tilt/height it comes at a great angle.Very happy with this purchase.
5,Honestly I love this keyboard. It maintains it's power for awhile and there is no lag. The mouse is very smooth and I love the light up feature. I use it all the time and I'm glad I got it.
5,I love this product. I use it for my home office setup. I am not generally comfortable typing on mechanical keyboards and rather love smaller laptop-style keys. The key travel is very good on this keyboard and the backlighting is as bright as one could need. I also love the fact that you can use just one receiver for both the keyboard and the mouse. The mouse is silent and has no clicking noise but you can feel the click so it is fine. I also liked the fact that they included a usb a to usb c dongle because my laptop has only usb c ports. The charge lasts a long time. I have only charged it once during the past week and although I only work like 3 hours a day on this setup it has held up pretty good till now.
5,I’ve had it for a few weeks now and I love it. Keys are quiet and frame is metal so it feels and looks expensive! Great find for the price. You can charge it and use it or you can charge it and battery lasts for over a week without charge. I use it 8-9 hrs a day daily for work. Mouse is super super quiet and very responsive. Real review not getting a discount for my feedback I just love this keyboard. The set up was less then 2 minutes I did charge it for a few hrs before use just to make sure it was fully charged. I’ve had it for over 3 weeks now and have charged it once after initial charge. Keys are easy to read and it notifies you (blinking light) when battery is low. Keep in mind you can use it while it’s getting charged as well.
3,Works good with the keyboard only. Seems like the keyboard becomes very unresponsive when you are using both the keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth. Use one or the other and it works fine.
5,I really like this keyboard. The backlit board extends my working hours helping me to work longer without the normal eye strain I get late into the night. I am sorely disappointed in the mouse. it has no substance (too light in weight) to it so I'm constantly over-swiping the mouse. Ergonomically it fits my typing style and all of the keys are very much within reach. The biggest thing for me is to remember to turn off my desk lamp. I included a pic of the keyboard with the desk light on and one with it off. There clearly is a better view with the light off. The wireless keyboard does not stay lit all the time. if no activity for a length of time it turns off the backlit feature.
1,DOUBLE UPDATE: I would like to reiterate what a PITA this charging issue is. This keyboard needs to be recharged every few days and for MANY hours each time. I started my workday today knowing that it was low on power so plugged it in for 2 hours while I was in meetings that wouldn't require it's use. I then proceeded to use it from about 10am until it just quit on me now at 5pm. That's right. 2 hours of charge time for 7 hours of work time. For a keyboard.UPDATE: So I've had this thing for all of a few days and am now completely regretting the purchase. The mouse is powered by a single AA battery which in my experience can last for many months. Battery powered keyboards I've used in the past were usually powered by 2 AAA's and lasted 6 months no problem. Well this keyboard has an internal rechargeable battery that I fully charged before use which lasted all of 4 days! WTF. Literally stopped working mid typing. I had to plug the damn thing in to recharge it which basically just makes it a wired keyboard. Not happy with this at all. Unfortunately I threw out the packaging so I can't return it which I TOTALLY would.I bought this keyboard/mouse setup for work. I'm in tech sales and as a result frequently talk on calls with people and type notes at the same time. I hate the idea of the person on the other end of the line hearing my tippy tapping away at my keyboard. I finally decided to buy a quiet mouse/keyboard to hopefully prevent this.Well this keyboard is certainly quiet-ER than my old keyboard but still makes a pretty decent amount of noise. It really just sounds slightly muffled? Like the normal keyboard is a guy playing a trumpet and this "quiet" keyboard is the same guy playing a trumpet with a silencer on it. You can still clearly hear that he's playing the trumpet just slightly quieter and a bit different sounding. I don't have much to compare it to so maybe it's absolutely the quietest keyboard on the market but it's not quiet enough to solve my problem.The mouse on the other hand is very quiet. I had another "quiet" mouse before and this new one blows it out of the water. So if that's what you're looking for this is a great fit!I also feel like it's *slightly* smaller than a full-sized keyboard? Maybe I'm just not used to the form factor but I find myself frequently positioning my fingers on the wrong keys. Could just be me.
4,Good keyboard for typing like that it’s silent
4,Great feel of the keyboard and the mouse...The variation of colors for the keyboard are awesome.  I work often at night with minimal light in the room and also during the day with low natural light and the keyboard color variations helps a lot.  I've run the keyboard for hours per day and have not had to charge it for the couple weeks I've had the keyboard.Con:  Mouse will not wake up quickly or easily.  You have to click to activate instead of just moving it.  The problem is you don't know what your clicking on until it's done which messes up what you have going onscreen.
3,The keyboard itself is pretty basic which I just needed for work. Only a few days after I started using it I noticed the mouse didn’t always catch what I clicked on. I thought it was my laptop but I tried another mouse and it’s not my laptop. The other mouse worked fine and faster. It’s a hassle to return but I might.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 i love this keyboard so much the buttons are satisfying to the touch the backlights are bright and dimmable the controls are wonderful and it has awesome battery life and slim enough to fit in my backpack! I absolutely love that it has a numeric pad also!
5,I use this keyboard and mouse every day! I even travel with it several times a week. It has held up well over the last few months.
3,I kind of sorta like this keyboard.  It has quick response when typing has a really nice feel to it.  The one drawback is that the backlight while bright and adjustable doesn't stay on long enough when not typing.  I received one wherein the light when out after 10 sec. of not typing.  They replaced it with one wherein the light goes out after 1min 30 sec.  I was told via email that the backlight should stay on for 3 min. after typing.  I decided to keep the second keyboard and just deal with the short light period.  Other than that adjustable feet would be nice to change the typing angle.I am amending my review to say that the backlight issue is getting annoying.  The light goes out too quickly when not typing.  It needs to stay on for at least 5 min between uses not 30 sec - 1 min.
5,Absolutely love this keyboard and mouse. It is super quiet so I am able to work while I am on the phone with someone and they are none the wiser. The mouse is smooth and accurate no delays or hesitations. I am in love with the various color changes the keyboard has. My husband is envious of my new keyboard and mouse he now wants his own.
5,I like this keyboard and mouse set a lot. The keyboard is heavier than it looks doesn't feel flimsy at all. I like how the keys feel and how the colored backlight can bet set to turn on as soon as you start typing. The light turns itself off after a short wait which helps save battery. The first charge cycle on the keyboard lasted 3 weeks (it uses a USB C charger cable). The mouse takes a AA battery.
5,Ultra light touch is a major factor to me as a hand arthritis person and a commodity broker on the keyboard 5-6 hours aa day I have gone thru 5-6 different ones in the past 2 years and this is the best by far.
3,Purchased May 9 2022 via Amazon and was going good and would always light up when I hit the keys. loved it...Then June 15 2022 it stopped working and ONLY the mouse works.  What gives??  Customer service is nonexistent and I will take another one from the seller...AT NO COST TO ME. I selected this keyboard so that I could use it without turning on the overhead lights when I get a hair-brained idea in the middle of the night...nothing.  Please assist.  Thanks
5,I bought this keyboard wanting a backlit key board for working in the morning with minimal light. The keyboard design and response to key insert have really impressed me over the last couple of days. The software in the keyboard is amazing changing colors from blue to green then yellow when the battery is dying and both the mouse and keyboard go on sleep mode on their own when not interacting with them. I forget to turn off the mouse and keyboard sometimes when I finish my shift and it still has battery the next day. A really good guy actually was just telling my brother how much I love this keyboard.
5,I work from home and this keyboard and mouse better than my job.
3,Purchased this item for the backlit keyboard and the fact that the mouse & keyboard would use the same USB c adaptor... big mistake!!The mouse I received is truly junk!You have to constantly wake the mouse up then it will jump all over the screen.Provided you could even use the mouse long enough you can't recharge the mouse the same as the keyboard.Given all the issues that I have encountered this combo was a poor purchase that I will be returning.
4,Great keyboard nice design and weight. I just wish the mouse has the back and forward buttons
4,I bought this keyboard because I wanted something smaller and wireless I could move as I need too. I really like the keyboard it is comfortable to type on and was wasy to get used too. As far as the mouse goes I'm not overly fond if at at this point because it will disconnect and I have to turn it of and on if there is any down time between uses. That may be a user/settings issue but I've not had time to play with any settings.
5,I use this mainly for work I have to remote access machines that don't always have a traditional user interface and this just needs a USB port to work don't have to install software or anything. It's very light the backlighting is bright without being too much and I can jump between machines just by plugging the adapter in to my laptop then the machine then my xbox if i want. Good purchase.
5,I REALLY like this keyboard! It's exactly what I was looking for - slim sturdy fast and responsive. It has some weight to it which I really like and the keys are very satisfying to type on. I can type incredibly fast on it and I haven't seen any lag in either the keyboard or the mouse. The mouse is a little on the small side but it is really comfortable and well-contoured so it works great for me. I really like that they are both so responsive and that I only have to use one dongle/receiver! Also if anyone else has trouble finding it the receiver is actually garaged in the bottom of the mouse and you can "wake" the mouse back up by clicking it as opposed to just moving it around. Overall I'm extremely pleased with this combo and so glad to have upgraded my home work station!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The keyboard looks really sleek with a metal frame and curved edges. Because of this the keyboard feels substantially weighty unlike my old plastic Dell keyboard. The keys are really quiet even as I (purposely) mash on them to make noise. I took a video to compare the sound of this keyboard and mouse to my old keyboard and it barely makes a sound (the mouse is SILENT). This is AMAZING since I sometimes work at night and don’t want to wake my roommate up.The keys have a really nice tactical feedback and springs right back up when pressed – I hate mushy keys so this keyboard feels perfect for someone who needs a membrane keyboard without compromising on the tactical feedback.The keyboard is Bluetooth with a rechargeable USB-C port. In my photos I was still charging it since I was too excited to wait. It comes with the recharging wire that’s USB-C to USB + an adapter for USB to USB-C if you need a USB-C to USB-C connection.The height of the keyboard is about 2cm and it’s fixed.Love it – will buy again for Christmas gifts for friends and family.
5,I use a laptop PC but do no gaming.  It is a straight keyboard with a nice feel of the keys. It is responsive.  I can set it on my lap or on a different height table to type.  The mouse is very sensitive which I like.  A mouse pad is not necessary.  Charging the keypad is via an included C- cord.  The charge lasts a very long time. It has an on/off switch. The mouse requires 1 AA battery not included.  I do recommend it.
5,I just received it yesterday and got it hooked up. I had one of the bulkier button wireless key boards that were very noisy. This in comparison is much easier to type at a decent speed with and it's so much more quiet. Not to mention the mouse is practically silent. No connection lag or issues at all and I love the color options! My only concern will be the battery life so we will see!
4,This keyboard holds battery throughout the whole work day and I love that it’s rechargeable! All my other keyboards have had batteries but I can just plug this one in each night. I also love that I get to pick a color to match my mood each day! I wish the 10-key was slightly larger as it is smaller than what I’m used to but once I adjust there shouldn’t be issues there either.
5,Better than it looks... This Product Rocks... Actually excited to see how awesome it is... It Is Good It Is...Very sleek look and has a good weight to it...Loving it
5,I initially had a few problems with the mouse's range but I worked with the seller to get a replacement and now it works great! The mouse works from across the room and the keyboard is overall fantastic!
2,I really liked this keyboard/mouse set at first - easy to type on and more quiet than the typical keyboard (not "silent" but better than average).  I bought two sets (one for work and one for home).  Within a couple months the mouse in both sets died - new batteries didn't help - they just connected sporadically and then not at all.  About a week later one of the keyboards will only connect if I have it plugged in constantly (defeating the purpose of wireless) and the second keyboard won't respond at all.  I also had to charge the keyboards every couple days.  Very frustrated.  I wasted money and now have to find another option.
5,I use this on a Xbox series x for web browsing. The keyboard is not heavy but has a nice weight to it so it doesn’t feel cheap at all. The color options for the backlight is great. Battery life is great I have only charged it once and have been using it for a couple weeks without having to charge again. The mouse is great as well I don’t have a mouse pad and it’s still smooth and accurate.  I recommend it.
5,Easily sets up quiet and the keyboard lighting is a major plus.
5,I really like this keyboard and mouse. Both are quite and it's exactly what I was looking for. I bought it for work but I may have to just bring it home when I start school or buy another one. I work on a laptop so it's great. I love that it lights up too.  Battery life is great also. Definitely perfect for me.
5,This keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. It's sleak reliable and looks great. My wife works at night a lot and doesn't like to turn on the light. The backlight feature is an absolute must. The mouse works flawlessly and stays connected with no lag. We use this everday in our home office and the battery life is amazing. I've had it over a month and plugged it in once to charge during that time. Highly recommend.
5,I am very happy with this product. It's very convenient for me that the USB receiver operates both devices so my laptop has one USB port free at all times for my other peripherals. It is plug-and-play. At first the mouse felt sort of "light duty" and simplistic but I've come to prefer it to my fancy logitech mouse. It operates very smoothly and the click is very soft-sounding or nearly silent. The keyboard is full sized without being bulky. The backlight on the keys is bright. Each device needs to "wake up" if you haven't been using it for a while--in other words you need to press a key or click the mouse to reactivate it. Some people might find this annoying but it probably saves the batteries.
5,I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review. This is a really nice keyboard / mouse combo.Pros:-The keyboard is sleek low profile and just as big as it needs to be. No wasted space.- 7 different light colors to choose from for the back light.- The mouse is totally quiet- no "clicking" noise when pressing the mouse buttons.- The keyboard battery charges fast and lasts a long time.Cons:- I wish the lights were brighter.- There should be a timer for the back light on the keyboard. The light doesn't stay on long enough for my personal preference.This is a great wireless keyboard / mouse package and I would definitely recommend! I would purchase again for myself if/when the opportunity arises.
5,The keyboard has a nice feel and just enough spring for proper feedback. The various colors for backlighting are an extra touch. The mouse is the quietest and ergonomically a perfect fit. The setup was easy without issue.
5,this Keyboard is is really nice I love all the colors to can pick from and I all the Function keys work with my desktop I charged once when I got it last week and use it for 8hrs a day while i am working.
5,I wish I was this satisfied with all my amazon purchases! If you're like me you look at 100 different options before buying. Let me save you some time- THIS is the one you want! Instantly worked. A little weight to it so it doesn't feel cheap. whisper quiet. So SO good!
4,I had been looking for a backlit keyboard and mouse primarily for work and was looking for scissor keys. I took a leap and bought this keyboard and mouse. The keyboard did not disappoint. The mouse has at times cut out.  Very easy to set up. Worth the price!
5,Overall great product well lit and ergonomical.  The only drawback is even with turning off the keyboard after it’s charged the lithium battery life could be better and I would have preferred one that I could just replace the batteries like the mouse since it barely lasted over a day and half of typing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have this keyboard and mouse combo for everyday use. I work remotely and use it every day.Battery life is great I have been using the keyboard for approximately two weeks but I also turn it off when not in use.Both the keyboard and the mouse are super quiet and I personally love the keyboard light since I tend to work late.The mouse has a super comfortable grip.
3,Two keys often did not register but I fixed them. One of the rubber pieces was cut under a key so I used super glue. The other key had a little plastic knub getting in the way (very small) so I filed that away and that seemed to fix the problem. They need to test these better before shipping.Good mouse no issue. Keyboard is not loud. Lights stay on 90 seconds. Battery on keyboard lasted a month or so working my 9-5 job; mouse is still going. USB plug is strangely sharp.
5,I’m not sure about the gaming part but I use it for work 9+ hours a day charge stays good & no lag. It’s quiet and so is the mouse. Would buy again! Just wish mouse was rechargeable too.
3,like the key board not the mouse
4,Slender design. Made from good quality materials keys are light and responsive. Love the ability to change colors and brightness. Was pleasantly surprised when after a short time of inactivity keys went dark then a few seconds after the power shut off to conserve battery.The mouse not so much. Cheap feel kind of sketchy on performance. Not rechargeable
5,Nice color of back light.  Nice feel of keys.  Battery life of keyboard outstanding (still on first charge).  Had to search for mouse USB receiver in the mouse but it was there.  Not a gamer so rating on 'For Gaming' in N/A
5,The face value is good this style is not wrong and the black color is very simpleAtmospheric with colorful light effects visual bliss whenIt is also the first time that I see the appearance of my eyes and then I give a good comment and use itFeel not wrong press the key lightly the key plate elastic foot easy to use is not expensive throughJi Shi Hui
4,I think this product is great.  I love how you can change the colors and the recharge life is extremely good more than 7 days of constant use recharge on the weekends.
5,I was looking for a keyboard that I could run to during the night and not have to turn a light on to see the keys. This is genius! I like it so much I am going to buy another one for my office!
5,Its exactly what I was looking for; silent keys and mouse with great backlight and sleek light weight design. It seemed too good to be true but I have been using it for a month now and am very happy with this keyboard. It comes with a charger for the keyboard so you don't have to rely on batteries.The only issue I have is that it is at a slant which started to bother my wrists. I needed a wrist support pad and something to lift up the front of the keyboard so its level
2,UPDATE (see original review below)  I have been using this every day for about a week now and the spacebar (in fact all the keys on the bottom row) is "sticky" every time I press it it gets stuck for a while. Sometimes I have to flick the keyboard from the bottom to get it to pop back up. I took a couple of stars off because it's super annoying.Most important thing to know is that the mouse is NOT rechargeable. I must have been confused by the multiple listings I looked at because this listing didn't say anywhere that the mouse would be rechargeable and I just assumed. Anyway I picked this one because I really wanted the full sized keyboard and the backlit feature was a nice plus.The keyboard is great good feedback on the keys almost a mechanical feel. The backlighting is great and the different colors all look sharp. The mouse while not rechargeable (seriously why would this not be rechargeable) has good response and the clicks are extremely silent. Adjustable DPI so you can get the sensitivity just right. It has a decent amount of weight to it (more than I expected from the pictures) and it glides nicely on a mouse pad.All around this is a great combo I just took one star off because of the mouse not being rechargeable which may have been petty but whatever.
5,Best keyboard I have used. So smooth and quite perfect tilt also and the colors are great.
5,I ordered this for my WFH setup. I was looking for a silent keyboard and this fit the bill. Set up is easy and I haven't had to charge it yet even with daily use so the battery certainly holds up. The only thing I ever really have a problem with is there is an occasional delay between what I'm typing and it coming out on the screen but it's just for work so not a huge deal to me might not be the best keyboard for gaming though even though the issue isn't prevalent. Overall very happy with the purchase.
5,I'm really glad the USB-C converter is included. Works great and feels nice to type on. Also FYI in the instructions I don't think it said this but the USB plug is inside the mouse. You have to plug that into the converter for it to work.
5,I like to work in a dark room with just the keyboard and monitor.  Having the backlit monitor is a big plus.  The keys have a nice feel to them.  I've been using it for several days and haven't had to charge the keyboard's battery.  I also like that I can change the color of the backlighting.  While not silent the keys are pretty quiet.  One downside is the backlight turns off pretty quickly if you're not using the key.
5,I use this for work.  Fluorescent lights give me headaches but typing in a darker room = typos.  This keyboard is AWESOME!!  I love that the backlight goes out - to save the battery - but then immediately lights back up upon touching any key!  I haven’t used any other color except blue which I love!  Also the keyboard has silent keys and a silent mouse = being on a conference call = still being able to work!!!!Definitely a good purchase!
5,As the days became shorter and darkness is earlier I found a backlit keyboard was needed to replace my old keyboard.  When shopping I found most backlit keyboards were for gaming which I didn't need.  This one is not a gaming one but certainly meets my need for a lighted wireless keyboard and mouse.  I am well pleased with it and found the keyboard to be responsive and liked the options of colors and on and off.The mouse is smooth operating and very responsive.  I wish I had bought it sooner.
5,I am very happy with both the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has a nice touch.  The backlit keys and cool and useful.  I like that the keyboard is heavy and stays put.  The mouse is silent and comfortable too. Note that if you don't have a USB-C plug on your computer you will need a USB-C mail to USB male adapter.  They are many available and cheap.  I recommend this set and may get another one for my office!
5,Great
5,Using the keyboard and mouse for work. Nice and quiet. Responsive. I love the purple illumination but there are many colors to choose from. Also the key letter/numbers light up instead of just lighting around the keys. I had some trouble finding the USB to plug into my laptop but finally located it right under the mouse on off switch. Seems to work well. I am not sure about the battery life as I have just received the product charged it fully once and have only been using it for about 20 minutes. The keyboard is smaller than a standard size.
5,After envying my husband's backlit keyboard on his laptop I searched for a comparable product that could accompany my unlit keyboard and came across this item. I absolutely LOVE the versatility mobility and the "bonus" ergonomic mouse that came with it. Although I am a wiz on the keyboard without lighting I genuinely appreciate the brightness of the light—especially in low-light situations. Without reservation I would highly recommend this combo! (I just might purchase another for a backup! It's worth it!)
5,I love the ease of installation and the multiple features the keyboard has like changing the board color. The board is comfortable and is easy to use the only thing I have an issue with is the lack of feedback from the soft depression of the mouse keys. The buttons seems stiff and there is little to no "click" after pressing. Maybe just my opinion but it's filling the busy environment I have and is stylish. Overall good purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Quieter than regular keyboard but not silent. Love that it is customizable keys are short but not like a laptop short; I have fake nails and have no issues. Love it! I work from home and hate when customers can hear it; they still can still hear it I think it’s just how I type. The mouse is silent I don’t use it since I had another but now I have an extra. Love that it uses the same usb though.
5,Does exactly what I need.  Great combo. Keyboard has a nice solid feel and lights up as needed when I need to see it better.
5,This keyboard does it all.Lights up...Light weight...Silent...Easy to work with...I love love love it!!!!!!Mouse is the perfect size and love the way the sides light up.Great job on this product!!!!!!!
5,GREAT VALUE! DEPENDABLE!Very happy with this keyboard. Most importantly it is dependable good size and functions flawlessly. The background colors are great ! The only thing I would change is the length of time the keyboard is lit would be nice to be able to adjust the amount of time it’s lit up (goes dark too quickly). Otherwise I’m very happy with it. I recommend it.
5,This is a great product that I will recommend to purchase. Mouse and keyboard is very easy to use and fits comfortable in my hands. As a bonus this product is very affordable.
5,I got a new laptop for Christmas and wanted to upgrade my wireless keyboard and mouse. Did some research and came across this one. What really caught my eye was the back-lit keyboard and awesome reviews. The keyboard and mouse are super quiet while typing and clicking. What a huge difference from what I had before. Also the look is sleek and classy. I love it!
3,We got a new computer and my husband is picky about his keyboards so he didn’t like the one that came with the computer so we got this one. His take on this purchase and I quote haha “the keyboard is good but the mouse is trash”. We went to Walmart got an 8$ mouse that we paired with it now all is good.
5,Works great
5,Keyboard was compatible with my computer and worked well. Nice product will purchase again in the future.
4,The backlights work well. Compatible with HP.
5,I like this keyboard and mouse combo. It’s sturdy and sleek. Battery lasts pretty long even when you have the backlight on consistently.
5,Excellent Keyboard. My favorite part is the excellent key feedback with a good bounce to the keys while still maintaining quietness. No complaints.
3,Lightweight with several backlight options. I like the design I charge regularly so I can’t speak to battery life. However the “a” button has not worked right since I received the keyboard. Often have to press it 2-3 times to get it to register. This is deeply disruptive and aggravating as I use the keyboard mainly for work purposes. I prefer the wireless mouse I had previously so I have not used the one included in the combo.
5,Very happy w my purchase of this slim and almost silent keyboard.  Backlighting is excellent with multiple colors and brightness to choose from.
5,Lasted the whole week at work. Still haven't had to charge.  I will update if things go wrong
5,This keyboard mouse combo works great.  Keys have a nice tactile response with several nice backlight options.  Battery life seems long.  I charge it once a week overnight and have never run out of power.  Mouse works well but keyboard is a real standout and is worth the price all by itself!
2,Various cap keys do not have the correct character assignments. Most importantly the @ key is incorrectly assigned. I had to use my other keyboard to type this. Contacted by company and they explained issues regarding production of the product and offered a refund for the product.
5,I bought this keyboard/mouse combo to use with my 2016 MacBook Pro for use with an external monitor fore editing photos. It hooked up flawlessly in a matter of seconds. Silent keyboard keys and the multi-color backlight keys lets me work with less light which I like when adjusting photos. Great price and fast shipping
5,The keyboard is so smooth and easy to use love the backlighting of the keys for when I work at night.  You can also chose any color of backlighting.  The mouse is super quiet no loud clicking noise.  Love it.  So far so good and I definietly recommend this product.
5,The main reason I got this is that how my home desk is set up I have very low lighting. I have two keyboards (work and personal) my personal basically is tucked under the top of the desk.  The lit keys are great! So much easier to see what I am doing now.  Very simple to get hooked up and running.
5,A very good shopping experience!They are well packaged and delivered very fast. The keyboard has a backlight and can be charged by USB. It is silent design basically no sound will not disturb others.  It make the typing fun !  The size of the mouse is very hand-feeling and very easy to use. If you are planning to buy a wireless keyboard and mouse you should not miss this product.
5,I really am glad I got the two in one because I enjoy having a small highlighted keyboard. I enjoy it being wireless. I would recommend this key board and mouse because it is the perfect fit for any computer. If you like to type I would recommend this keyboard as well.
5,Good produt for the price nice and sturdy keyboard with the backlight white light is not fully white but its fine
5,We've had this keyboard/mouse combo for over 2 weeks. Comfortable quiet and long lasting battery life. Initially charged still haven't had to recharge it. My only negative would be if they could either have an app pop-up on the screen or LED indicator for keyboard battery life. Other than that....Incredible!
2,This is tiny very uncomfortable to even try to use.  Doesn't look like any 'full size keyboard' that I have ever seen.  I would have to drive 3 towns over to find a ups store to return it to or pay 11.99 for them to come get it.  Nope.  So it's useless and in its box under my bed.
4,Ok
5,It was hard to find a keyboard with a backlight so I'm glad I finally found this!! I really like how sleek this keyboard is and the keys aren't loud like a lot of others. It's also cool that the backlight changes colors.
5,The keyboard has a battery saver on it and the keys are lightweight to the touch when typing. I have not had to charge the keyboard yet and i've had this set for over a week. This purchase delivered exactly what I was looking for and turned out to be better than I expected!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I must admit I've researched the products in this type of devices before I purchased this item.  I was not disappointed . Ergonomically both the mouse and the keyboard are comfortable even for long periods of use. A great advantage no lag when connected with Bluetooth. It going smoothly when I play game It’s wonderful! Overall very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Wireless Keyboard Mouse Comb works really well with windows as well as Macbook and I believe it is the number 1 in its ranking I just plugged it in and it works amazing the touch well is superb!!!I recommend it !!!!
5,
5,No issues connecting colors are great.  my new go to keyboard.  I like that the lights on the keyboard turn off when not in use to save battery life.  I've been using this for a week 8+ hours a day & still haven't had to recharge!
3,I love everything about this EXCEPT that the keys are already rubbing off. I started using it on Dec 28. Apparently  I use N O and T a lot. At this rate I will have to replace it at 2 months.
5,Bought this for my mom for Christmas since she just got a new laptop.  She loves it!!  Easy set up and the backlighting makes it easier to see the keys.  Definitely happy with this purchase!
5,This was a gift for my husband. He loves the look and feel of it. It's very smooth to use.
5,I really wanted a thin and quiet keyboard that was also backlit for work. This pack was perfect! My old mouse was getting worn out so the fact that this came with both was great. Really happy with this purchase.
5,Really good keyboard no noise when Typing and mouse also good
5,This keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever bought. But I don’t like how when I put it in my backpack some of the keys fall off.
5,I very much like the keyboard and mouse. The key board is slightly narrower than my last one and easier to travel with and the quiet mouse is great. The mouse is not rechargeable but that’s ok.
5,Fantastic keyboard and mouse combo! All pieces are of high quality and the backlighting functionality is great.  This is my go-to key board and I would highly recommend!
5,Perfect addition to my home office. Great battery life.
2,Really frustrated with this model.  The backlit keyboard lights goes off after brief period of inactivity.  Similarly the mouse after brief inactivity seems to delay registering movements upon first moving.
2,This keyboard is silent and has good battery life. The USB-C charger is nice - a lot of accessories still haven't adopted this. However it stopped working just as the 90 day warrany expired. I had it for just over 3 months.
5,Slim comfortable. Long battery life. Looks great
2,Battery life doesn't last I have to plug in the court isn't long so it's not that not that functional and when I type it glitches and I have to type over overgained or plugged it into the charger
5,Great product. Works as it should.
5,Happy to find a wireless keyboard and mouse combo that only needs 1 receiver. Gone are the days of cluttered cable management! Happy with the back light lots of colors to choose from.
3,It was a beautiful keyboard however I couldn't use it because it didn't come with the wireless receiver. I had to send it back and was afraid to order another one!
5,it works as advertised..i love it.
5,Just what I was looking for in a keyboard and mouse. It is quiet ergonomic and it keeps its charge for days. I have been searching for one like this for my office. The keyboard has 7 different colors love it. Thank you.
3,The lag time on the mouse made this not a good choice for me.  The keyboard worked great but not so much on the mouse!
5,Works Awesome. Plug and play. If you don't like flat laptop keys its not for you. However it's EXACTLY what I wanted and needed.
5,Huge fan of thinner keyboards and have to have the backlight. Works great and feels great to type on it isn't loud.
5,Excellent keyboard/mouse combo!  I love the backlight and it wasn’t too expensive. It’s super quiet too so my fiancé isn’t kept awake by obnoxious clacking sounds. I would recommend to my friends.
5,good feel works well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this keyboard and mouse. They are so quiet and quick and I love the lights on the keyboard. My favorite thing has to be that the keyboard and mouse both fall asleep
5,Works well with MAC computers
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 We loved the wireless keyboard and Mouse Combo plus it saved a USB port by combining the receiver in one unit. the keyboard works perfectly even from 10-15 meter distance.
5,Quiet keyboard love the lights. My cats have found all kinds of shortcuts on it but they won’t share the secrets with me
5,I was looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse for a while. Really love the keyboard backlight and quite features. It’s easy to setup and easy to use. Really love this product. I should have gotten this sooner.
5,works great with my Windows device a keeps battery level good. i use for work from home so it gets used alot and response is great
5,Great keyboard - as mentioned on the subject line striking the keys makes very little sound.  Slowing down is virtually silent.  Highly recommend.
1,I bought two of these keyboard sets one for home and another for work. I love the look and feel but the battery life is horrible. I have to charge the keyboard daily. It dies about 5 hours into my workday so I have to make sure and keep the charger out and on my desk (I was hoping for a truly cordless experience).Update: I bought this keyboard and had it delivered July 20 2022. Today August 30 2022 it died and no longer charges. Pretty inconvenient since it's my keyboard at work. My home keyboard still works but it gets much less use.I would NOT recommend buying this product.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse combo. Works great no glitches in very fast. The color as a little brightness to my day!
2,I bought this set 6 month ago. Keyboard is still working fine but mouse started to act up about a month ago. Keys on keyboard are losing the black color and the light starts to shine through.I would not recommend for someone using it as their work set as it is not ment for full time use.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I’ve tried 3 and they’re all the same. Battery life is terrible. You’re lucky if it lasts an hour when it’s lit up. Connection is terrible. I have a laptop connected to the TV so I wanted to sit on the couch and use it. Doesn’t work from 8 feet away. I have 2 other brands that don’t light up that work perfectly from that distance. GARBAGE. Sent them all back.
2,I setup the keyboard on April 28 2022. Today is June 21 2022 and the letters EDTDCN have begun to wear off. The E is the worst. It now looks like the B.
5,I use this keyboard over 8 hours 5 days a week. No ghost keys mouse keeps up. I highly recommend.
5,Great keyboard and mouse. Excellent quality. Battery life is amazing. Perfect for us in our home office.
5,keyboard lights up 6 different colors and it's the perfect size for me. Wireless mouse and keyboard combo. I am very happy with this keyboard.
1,The keyboard itself is fine - it plugs in when it needs to charge.The mouse however that comes with this keyboard is THE WORST. I've had it since June and it's already used up 10 batteries (one at a time). I have never been in the habit of switching off the power on my mouse but should because I'm not sure what else will help this one. AND the worst part is the company will not respond to complaints or issue a refund or a replacement. STAY AWAY.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I can't wait to open it. The keyboard and mouse are great the connection is fast and the keyboard backlight is great. This purchase is very successful.
5,Bought as a gift recipient loves it.Ability to choose colors is nice.Considering getting one for myself.
1,While the keyboard feels sturdy and well made it does not function smoothly. The mouse did not function well it was all over the page the keyboard types letters that it isn't supposed to doubles and triples letters so typing quickly makes for having to go back and correct ... a royal pain! I used it for 3 days with my logitech mouse which fixed the mouse issue but not the typing issue. I have other keyboards which cost MUCH less that function MUCH better but do not have the backlit feature. I am returning this and will try another brand of backlit keyboard. I do NOT recommend this product.I HAVE 2X NOW TRIED TO UPDATE REVIEW! HOPE IT STICKS THIS TIME! -  I received an email from the seller offering me $30  to REMOVE MY UNFAVORABLE REVIEW! As I depend largely on reviews from others I want to trust that they are honest and real- life experiences so I can make an informed choice about the items I cant actually SEE SMELL & FEEL!  A seller who is willing to offer me HUSH MONEY is extremely offensive and smacks of dishonesty. Keep your Hush Money my review stays as it is a poor product and even poorer business practices from this seller!
5,Was looking for a silent keyboard for when I work at home. hardly makes any noise
5,Good except the keyboard light times out after about 30 seconds if not used
5,I am enjoying my new wireless keyboard and mouse.  My desktop is now much less cluttered.
5,This keyboard is well made with solid building. Backlight made it easier to use at nighttime. Nice product.
5,i’m very happy with the function and look at the keyboard. Easy to set up
5,Not just for gaming. The backlit keyboard looks nice in the office
5,Great keyboard mouse combo Great price and support was phenomenal!!!
5,The lighted background is great. Types so smooth. Feels high quality.
5,This wireless keyboard  and mouse worked flawlessly.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Designed well- the keyboard is very sleek but the ergonomics is good. Played games for hours without getting my hands sore
5,I like the backlight on the keyboard.
5,Full size quite and adjustable color backlights.
1,Nice to have a keyboard/mouse combo that uses one port on my laptop.While I would not call it truly a silent keyboard if I use a light touch... the sound does not pick up on my speakerphone... which is what I needed to occur.Have had it for a bit over a month... and have gotten in the habit of plugging into the usb to recharge at the end of the week so I am good to go with no worry on the battery life.update: 4 months -  While it still works... keys that are frequently touched (E S D N L O space  shift  enter) have lost their black coloring and showing white. Do not have long nails so it is not from scratching the keys.  Have only cleaned with compressed air and barely damp cloth (water). I have no believe that this will not continue.  What started as a 5* review... has changed to 2.UPDATE @ 7months - Keys continue to lose coloring... Very dissapointed. Rating changed from a 3 to a 2 to a 1.
5,Great product very quiet keys
5,Works great meets expectations.
2,I like the colors and the keyboard is nice and quiet. It connected me easily with the usb stick and many of the functions work with my MacBook. Unfortunately the charging cable that came with it was completely busted- I have others but none of them are very long so I can’t  use it while it’s charging.
2,Only the keyboard is rechargeable.  What is the point of buying a keyboard and mouse combo if they do not operate the same?  The keyboard is nice. It's a slim design so that it taking some time to adjust to but the mouse is on the small size and very basic.  I strongly dislike the mouse.  For me it was more important to have a rechargeable mouse and that is the one that takes batteries.
5,Great value for the money.
1,The mouse gets sluggish and stops after ten minutes. You have to turn off/on to get it back. Keyboard randomly pastes text without you doing anything. NOTE reviews where key letters rub off after a few months and then instead of being able to see them you just have light blobs. I'm sending back less than 12 hours after I unboxed it and turned it on (only reason not sooner is because we turned in a few hours after setting it up!).
5,well lit user friendly
1,Like that the keyboard lights up. Hate the mouse and the keyboard WILL NOT charge. I returned the first one and the replacement doesn’t charge either. Colossal waste of $. I’m going to try getting another replacement but do not recommend.
1,It's not supposed to come with a battery but it did.  Nice but it came with a battery because it was USED.  No dongle and dirty.  Don't buy from this person/
1,The keyboard misses letters typed sometimes takes 3 or 4 hits on the same key to get a letter. Mouse lets its connection loose and the cursor floats all over the page. Only had it 4 months and I'm going to throw it away and buy a Logitech.
1,Very disappointed with the quality of the product. Keyboard seems nice and the backlight is also visually appealing but the mouse kicked the bucket within the first 2 weeks. I changed batteries & even switched out mousepads/surfaces multiple times. I use it for work M-F 8-5…. So it’s hardly operator error. I’ve ordered similar products from other buyers that have lasted 2+ years. Would not recommend.
1,Won't allow a refund? It quick working about a month after buying it..
1,The keyboard is nice and quiet but the battery doesn’t last more that 2 days. I haven’t been able to get the scroll on the mouse to work so I am still using another Bluetooth mouse.
1,No lights turned on at all never got a charge never worked and came with no usb to connect it to my laptop. Really needed a great keyboard for work this was just a huge waste of my time and now I have to return it and order another. .  Total Garbage!!
1,I have been too busy to assess and return within time limit.  My loss.  Product is really poor.  Keys work or do not work on their own schedule.  Makes product very difficult to use.  i have purchase a replacement and i have high hopes for that.
1,Fully charged the keyboard - put battery in the mouse - plugged in the dongle. A large number of the keys on the right side of the keyboard don't function. This is absolutely unacceptable as well as frustrating. Do not waste your money!!!
1,After just a few months of having this keyboard the lights have stopped working. I bought this because i work in the dark sometimes and I need a lighted keyboard now within 6 months I have to buy another keyboard
1,The battery only lasts a couple of hours and requires to be plugged into the charger to function.
1,I’ve been using this keyboard for 3 days and the keys have already stopped working and are all messed up. For example when I type the backspace button it types the letter 4. The mouse is also sticky and has a hard time keeping up. The keyboard and mouse are both very quiet and the backlight on the keyboard is pretty cool but besides that they’re awful. Save your money.
1,Not satisfied. They don't stay connected to my MacBook Pro 16.Buy something else.
1,Color nice at first but trash!
1,I received this keyboard combo from this company-- it never worked from day one even after I charged it.  It was useless.  So I asked for a refund and never received any of my money back.
1,Too bad such a nice-looking keyboard cannot simply hold a charge. I ordered one of these two weeks ago and it would not recharge. The replacement arrived but has the very same issue. Pure junk.
1,Could not get it to work out of the box
1,Keyboard would not charge and never worked. To be fair I never contacted the seller to give an opportunity to correct. Just returned it.
1,Would Not Work!! light were on but nothing  very frustrating
1,My buttons are wearing off after barely a month of use. So sad
1,This mouse and keyboard turn on but they don't work on my MacBook pro.
5,Very satisfied. Easy to use keys are responsive but not overly sensitive to accidental touch. Lights up well and I enjoy the various color choices. Highly recommended.
5,The keyboard is very lightweight well-functional and sleek looking. The keys are super easy to type on. Love the keyboard. The mouse on the other hand not so great.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I originally purchased the grey option. After the first charge it started acting up. But i really liked the mouse and backlit keys that are easy to press. Along with the weight of the keyboard it feels solid and was really helpful in getting work done. The keyboard is MUCH better than my simple logitech keyboard.However  i saw the return as my opportunity to purchase the black model instead and it also comes with a mouse pad.When the black model arrived i could tell they keyboard was slightly different and they offer a completely differently designed mouse.The mouse that comes with the black model feels flimsy lightweight and isn't stable where it meets the table or mouse pad surface. When clicking the mouse buttons the mouse often tips forward or moves backward under my finger press weight.The grey model has a large stable and weighty mouse that resembles my logitech mouse. Both of those mice work great and are very stable to operate.I only gave 3 stars because of this product discrepancy.I would vote the black option a 1 as they mouse works with the keyboard  so you can't switch it out.However the grey model receives 4 stars.I am hoping the first one i purchased was just defective.
5,Worked as intended would recommend!
1,It started typing random letters instead of what I was pushing (instead of a slash /  it typed the letters bn) and certain buttons would shut off my computer.
2,I love the way this keyboard looks and I love the backlight feature. My issue with it is for some reason the volume up and mute keys seems to be switched so the volume up key is the mute key and the mute key is the volume up key. In the photos of this keyboard they appear to be placed correctly but for some reason they do not perform the right functions. Not sure if it's my laptop or if its the keyboard that is defective.
5,I ordered this keyboard to use with my new laptop. This is a great option if you need both a keyboard and a mouse as it connects both components with only one USB input. The mouse is powered by a single AA battery and the keyboard is powered by a USB-C internal battery. A USB-C cord is included. The set also includes a USB to USBC converter just in case you have a newer laptop. This was a good option for me because I don’t have traditional USB inputs in my laptop and I would’ve had to of located a similar piece. It’s honestly not some thing I even thought of when I chose this keyboard so I was happy to see that need was already accommodated. Connectivity feels just as though it’s part of my computer there is no lag. For those of us who type a lot I can’t claim the feel is just like my MacBook but it still feels pretty good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It's a very beautiful keyboard that I came across so far. Very easy to use and the back light feature enables to work even when it is dark. Mouse works well and working with it is super fun as you don't need to scroll and move it too many times unlike some of the others I have encountered till now. Connecting and using is quite simple as you just need to plug in the USB dongle and on the switch on keyboard and mouse and you are ready to browse and work. It comes with a USB to USBC adapter too. I don't find any drawbacks with the product and would highly recommend if you are looking for awesome wireless keyboard.
5,Great setup easy to configure
5,Super easy to set up. The mouse is really comfortable and has a silent click which I really like.
5,Very quiet as it said it would be. Love the lights. Easy to use great product I would buy again.
5,Tengo muy poca luz en mi escritorio y este teclado y el maus me han resuelto el no tener qu encender la luz para molestar a los demas. me encanta
5,This keyboard is great. It is quiet I wouldn't say silent but definitely quieter than an average keyboard. The mouse that comes with it is completely silent.I have had no problems with this keyboard so far. I much prefer this style of keyboard with spacing between the keys. The keyboard is nice and heavy so it does not slide around while typing or if you bump it.The backlights work wonderfully and the colors look great. The only thing to note with the backlight is that you can see dim spots in between lights it is not a deal breaker though.
5,Honestly I really love this keyboard and mouse set. It's perfect for me because I like to do my work late at night and don't want to disturb other people with my loud clicking. And this mouse is literally has silent clicking. It's actually so satisfying to use. The keyboard is also really quiet and perfect for me.
5,I don't always write reviews unless the product is really good or really bad. This one is really good. I spilled juice on my last keyboard so the keyboard cover on this one makes me very happy. Plus I seem to be typing better. The cover on the keys feel so much more comfortable to type on.  The mouse is flatter than standard ones but I don't mind it at all. The scroll wheel is bevelled to it's more precise. The keyboard is backlit and there's a button for it instead of having to turn it upside down to switch it on and off. To me. it's worth every penny. And it's reasonably priced!!
5,This backlit keyboard/mouse combo is great. It is lightweight and ergonomically comfortable on a desk. There are seven different color schemes included in the backlit feature...from bright to dim. It is a quiet keyboard -- no loud key clicks to wake the baby or the spouse. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like it and how easy it is to operate. I was also pleased with the price.
5,The keyboard is very solid and sturdy. Narrower than the one I had which is better for me as I have a narrow desk. Great clean design. The keys have an indent - I like the feel of it. The most important thing is that it is quiet - very quiet(!) when I type. The light is a fun add on. Highly recommended!
4,I was under the impression the entire combo was rechargeable but this is not true for the mouse which requires a AA battery (lost a star). It's also a shame there are no lights on the mouse but this was not an advertised feature. The keyboard in the image looks silver but it's actually more of a charcoal grey (which I liked more since I wanted black but the mouse in the black combo is a different design). I sent mine back due to the non-rechargeable mouse.
5,I did some research before purchasing this particular wireless keyboard & mouse combo as an addition to a new PC for my wife.  Prices vary considerably across the spectrum for these but this particular product stood out for several reasons.  One the price was very good.  Two the keyboard is backlit one of the features I was looking for.  The package arrived within a couple days from me ordering it and operates as advertised.
4,At first the pairing instructions that came in the box did not work so I required support and different instructions from Geemai to pair keyboard and mouse to my laptop but now both are working great.If keyboard isn’t connecting with pairing device or laptop try pushing Esc and K.If mouse is turned ON has batteries and is still not pairing with device or laptop 1. Plug in pairing device to laptop 2.  Bring mouse close to pairing device within 15 seconds while holding down the Middle and Right click button (I think).  Or just email support they were super helpful.
5,I really like this keyboard and mouse for a lot of reasons first it's just the right size it has a great touch and feel when typing on it. I did have to get a replacement this is the second one the first one the battery was not so great but that does happen. the replacement has been amazing the battery lasts a super long time on a single charge. The customer service I received from the company was top notch replacement without question and follow up afterwards. So I updated it to the five stars and I highly recommended keyboard and mouse. I also love the fact that it fits in my soft laptop case.
5,The product of wireless mouse and keyboard in overall is very good to use and is compatible. The keyboard could be charged from computer itself. The keyboard looks compact and does not slide unnecessarily which makes typing fast and efficient. The mouse on the other land works on any surface. A mouse pad is not inevitable while using the mouse. In overall this product is good and efficient at a low price. I highly recommend to buy for those looking for wireless mouse and keyboard.
5,I bought this to replace my Seenda b/t. I love my Seenda and will be using it with my laptops and iPad. However it stopped working on my desktop which does not have native b/t - and MS started hating on the adapter for this and my Sanwa trackball. (btw those products are awesome too...not their fault that MS is Cthulhu.) This keyboard is super comfy and backlit. I have seen reviews from people who have issues with migraines and don't like the brightness of some of the backlighting. Some of it is very bright; if you are prone to migraines this may not work for you.
5,Use this for my laptop at home and have had a hard time finding a setup that didnt have lag. This has none and for the price Im super happy with this keyboard.
5,This keyboard is pretty good. I wish the mouse was chargeable; it's powered by AA batteries. They won't power on unless they the receiver is plugged in.The keyboard is able to charge via USB-C which is awesome!The mouse is very quiet one of the quietest I've ever heard.The keyboard can be quiet if you type slow and carful but it's about as loud as an apple keyboard when typing normal.Overall great mouse and I love the fact that you can change the color of the LED's.
5,I love that I can change the colors. It helps when working from home .
5,Right out of the package this keyboard and mouse felt sturdy. Great quality heavy feel to it. Did not realize when I ordered it was a metal faced keyboard so that was a pleasant surprise. LED backlit buttons make it look that much better. Awesome!
5,More than I expected I really like it.
5,Wireless Key Board Holds the Charge. When I ordered this keyboard mouse combo. I thought I just wanted the keyboard but it turns the mouse was the sweet part of the deal. Smooth functional and accurate. I like how the keyboard lights up after dark and can be connected to up to 3 computers.
4,Great keyboard but the mouse could be more accurate! Overall great product!
5,You don't know what you are missing until you start using a keyboard with backlit keys! I often use my computer first thing in the morning in low lighting situations. Because I'm a poor typist and don't have the layout memorized I'd have to lean down close to the keyboard to see the letters. Not now! I can see the entire keyboard clearly thanks to the evenly lit easy to see blue back-lighting of this wireless keyboard/mouse combo. Great key feel all the usual shortcut keys in a compact easy to charge package. The mouse is well designed has a niche to store the dongle when traveling and has a comfortable ergonomic feel. All in all a great combo at a great price. Treat yourself to the convenience of a backlit keyboard you'll be happy you did!
5,I have a MAC for 2014 is old computer my keyboard and mouse is no working anymoreEvery time I use is really hard time to connect  is wasted my time now I try buy the new one is easy to connect to my keyboard and Mose do home work easy butter than before this keyboard is so beautiful changed colors play the games feel cool is old Mac but change new keyboard feel brand new haha so nice to take
4,I like the fact that both keyboard and mouse only use one USB slot. The mouse is like many others and offer no extra functions. The keyboard is nice with the lite blue backlighting coming from under the keys. It would be nice if the key groups were separated so they would be easier to find. Also there is no shortcut key for the calculator.
5,We use this keyboard in an observatory where the tower computer is located 25 feet away with a wall separating it.  This keyboard and mouse have performed flawlessly and without ANY stuttering or hesitation and we couldn't be happier with their performance even on bitter cold nights.  The illuminated keyboard is a must for our application (working in the dark) and the multi-color choice and illumination levels are perfect for our needs.  We love this set and are thrilled with the purchase.  The price was extremely reasonable for the high quality.  Granted the inability to charge the mouse seems silly but having it battery powered is really not a problem.
5,This is a great keyboard for the price.  I needed to get one to get away from the laptop.  The feel is very responsive and quiet.  No click/clack unless you strike hard.  Would buy again in a heartbeat!
5,Bought thus keyboard and mouse combo. It is much more than I expected. Keyboard is quiet and very very comfortable to use better than any one i experienced in bestbuy. Perfect angle and mouse comes with usb c coverter. Great deal! Thanks.
5,keys have a nice feel to them
5,The keyboard and mouse are very responsive specifically the keyboard feels good. It have several colors of lights but I turned it off. They work perfect with surface pro. It really works this price
5,Great keyboard the backlite is great and so many colors to choose from.  Battery lasts a long time and the quality of the mouse and keyboard exceeded my expectations.  Great combo for the price.
4,Batteries on Keyboard we're DOA
5,Very ergonomic for me and the battery seems to stay charged sufficiently
5,Installed batteries and it works like a charm. Works perfectly. Very inexpensive but it looks like a high quality keyboard. love the backlit function and the really silent keys. I will buy another one for my son.
5,My staff loves the light up colors
5,This is a great wireless keyboard and mouse combo. It's difficult finding a good quality wireless keyboard that has backlighting - that's why I was so happy to come across this one. Out of the package the keyboard was some weight to it which I interpret as being good quality. The keyboard is great and so easy to use. I love the click sounds and love the email button to help me quickly send off emails. And while I wasn't looking for a new mouse I found that I love this mouse more than my current Logitech one. The mouse is super quiet and is full sized. An added plus is that it just uses one usb and comes with the converter so I can switch from my work PC to my personal Mac. 10/10 recommend!
1,Returned. Not as  described. Touch wrong and slow.
5,Wonderful back-lit keyboard option
3,A reasonably priced set with nice battery saver features.
5,Th keyboard is very sturdy and solid. The bump on bottom that I assume houses the battery pack and maybe even additional weight has so much weight it sits flat and solid no matter what. Feels very high quality and they keys feel nice and are pretty quiet. The mouse is just ok. It's a plastic wireless mouse with the right buttons and scroll wheel but it's nothing special at all.
5,Love this keyboard !! It does not disappoint!
5,I was surprised at the quality. Keyboard feels great and is quiet. Mouse is also very quiet. Good build quality as well.
5,First it’s much heavier than my prior keyboard which is nice so it doesn’t slide around on my desk.  It’s the first lighted keyboard I’ve ever used and it’s a great feature in the evenings!  Now I won’t go back to unlit ever.  I didn’t know what I was missing.  I’m using it with my laptop and have had zero issue.  Also it’s super quiet.
5,The backlight has great quality bold vibrant colors I love the way the keys flow silent and smooth
5,I bought this because I needed more USB ports and it was easier to have mouse/keyboard connected to one Bluetooth port. It works well
1,Gave it a full charge for 14 hours.  Even after that the light only comes on for about 1/2 second then goes out and can't be turned back on.  Yes I read and followed the instructions.  The only reason I bought this was for the light.  Returning for a refund.
4,This is the perfect keyboard I was in search of. I have a smaller desk so it doesn’t crowd and working at night/in darker environments isn’t an issue with the backlight. The mouse doesn’t operate as swiftly/quickly as I hoped so I use my old one. But overall the set is perfect for traveling light.
5,This mouse / keyboard combo is exactly what I need in my theater room.  I can finally search and type without having to turn the lights on between movies whether on Youtube Netflix or Amazon Prime...
5,I was looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse set for my computer. I prefer a slim quiet and with lots of shortcuts function built in keyboard because I don't want to wake my kids up while they are still sleeping. I currently have a wired keyboard from dell and an old logitech mouse. The quietness level for the two keyboard is almost the same. But this one is wireless and rechargeable. Also it has 7 different backlit colors that I can change based on my mood; if I don't need it I can just turn it off. For mouse there is no click sound at all! It's so quiet. Right now I've been using it for couple days and I'm really happy with it.
5,easy to use and great combo keyboard plus mousethe mouse click is smooth and no noisethe charge holds good for a long timebacklit technology is very good to work during darker days and also in nights
5,Rechargeable keyboard and mouse takes one AA battery. Love it it really helps when my office lighting gets dim I like to use natural light as much as possible. I highly recommend because it’s very affordable durable and extremely easy to get up and running.
5,Great! Love it!!!
