4,It‚Äôs overall agree camera the only thing that‚Äôs wrong with that is once you have deleted everything off the pictures or the main screen then you have to reset everything back up that was the only thing I didn‚Äôt like accidentally deleted it and then I had to reset everything back up because the camera was post and I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it and get back into instead I deleted the picture screen
5,I like mostly everything that no one would suspect is a camera. It has a few minor things I don't like example i cannot go forward in a video but overall is a great choice for so many high end products.
5,The instructions are "unique " as I assume they were translated into English. If the red fails to come on do the reset while it's still plugged in. And don't waste your time on a cheap SD card  I tried to use a no-name card and it was a mistake. I bought a San Disk as recommended and it worked right away. The picture is good and the app is surprisingly fast. I give it 5 stars.
4,Camera‚Äôs set up even with the manual was a little tricky but manageable. I got this for couple months away from home.The most  reason to choose this camera  doesn‚Äôt need battery change for life .Simple and good enough screen-view from away. Hopefully it will work along.Good buy so far.
4,I bought this to be able to check on a loved ones safety it fits into the eoom without causing any doubt or taising any questions.It was easy to use and the viewing quality was good which for me is what was important. An absolute Must buy.
5,Great product. Would never guess it‚Äôs a camera. So believable and gives good range on camera view. You purchased two may get one more
4,I haven't tried all the different features yet but the 24 hour recording and "alert" recording both work well. Very to easy to connect while away to see what's happening. So far the only issue I've noticed is the push notification isn't working for me. So it still records when the device detects motion but it doesn't notify me about the motion.
5,In beginning I didn't expect much from this camera according to the price. But I was very surprised from the quality when I installed. Was easy instalation. The quality of camera is very good. I'm very satisfied with it. I may buy another one for different location.
5,Everything works great with no problems or hassles super simple to set up. Just download the app and setup the whole process takes less than 5 mins.Disclaimer: I‚Äôve only used the live stream/record function I have not tried recording to a memory card. So I can only speak speak for the live stream option.
5,I wanted a simple little camera that I could use to check in on our dogs when we were not home. This is perfect. We can watch our pups from our phone. The picture quality is GREAT super clear picture. It is clear though you can't see anything in the dark you will need to leave lights on to view at night which is fine with us. I will definitely be getting more of these.
5,Great quality for price love it
4,Needed to learn why some things mysteriously vanish in my home so I ordered an (inexpensive) GooSpy USB/WIFI camera and got it the next day. Set up took only a few minutes and it was really simple. The camera has a great clear image and linked to my home WIFI easily. It can also be relocated around the house as needed. I can sleep better knowing my valuables are protected and who the magician is while I'm away.
5,I bought it for my home. It took only 2-3 minutes to install on my phone and then working very well. Very much responsive. Sends notification in seconds when capture any movement. I like it.
5,I like the quality picture and sound
5,Nice little nanny cam. Easy setup easy to configure great customer service. I would recommend
5,This spy cam is very handy and the app is easy to use. I was able to set it all up in just minutes. I recommend highly!
5,This spy cam is just awesome easy to setup and great quality.
5,Good quality and easy to set up.
5,Better than I expected. Easy setup great picture quality wide angle of view works great. If you don't want to pay for cloud storage this is the ticket. No one will ever know that it's a camera. You cannot see the lens at all even if you pick it up and look real close. I'm thinking about ordering a few more to put in other rooms.
5,Great product
5,Arrived on time and works as it should.
5,I bought this product thinking that it would be a simple charger-camera gimmick but after seeing the resolution quality this thing is amazing! It's also really easy to set up!
5,Camera is very well hidden!  "Trust but verify"  This product will give you peace of mind.  Is easy to set up and effective!
5,This Camera is so well hidden that no one will know it‚Äôs there they would think it‚Äôs a charger. The best thing I like is you can watch everything from your phone. quality is good for what I‚Äôm paying for. Very easy to set up and connect.
5,Set up instructions and app are very easy to install and the camera work perfectly
4,My apologies my previous review was meant for the Arebi HDVCAM.That said the GooSpy USB cam is pretty good. AND it has ADJUSTABLE sound.  Video quality is pretty good.
5,I like my product & would recommend
5,Very easy to set up. User friendly. Good quality.
5,I love this product because it is small and has great video quality.  Also it can charge your cell phoneWhat more can you ask forBest product i have purchased on Amazon
5,Can't ask for anything more. Great product
4,Very easy to set up! Works like a charm... thank you
5,Es aceptable el funcionamiento y de facil instalaci√≥n y uso.
5,Fast shipping. Easy to install
5,Exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. Nice clear recording and audio.  Very discreet and unnoticeable. Worth the buy. Loving it so far.
5,Great product easy to use and good value
5,The app at first was a little tough to figure out but if your read the instructions and follow the steps you'll get it all figured out. Once I understand how everything works it was a breese. Picture quality is great üëç and app is user friendly.
5,This product is very easy to start and use. It has the quality of a popular camera and any other device on your mind. Trust me you will be so impressed that you will spread the word like me. Make the purchase and put It to use to protect your family business belonings etc.
5,Super fast to install and have a great video quality
5,This is a great camera which is small simple and can be used as a phone charger.  I actually connect the USB port to my Nest Home camera which watch over the living room area and this is by the door to watch over my ragdoll kittens.There are several ways to connect the camera.  2 simplest ways are you either just plug in to wall outlet and add it to the HomeEye app and it is there.  Really simple.  Or just add it to your home network and open the app again it is there.However the best part of the camera is the clarity of the pictures and recordings and I believe the camera has wide angle lens I would say it may be 130 degrees because the coverage is very wide so I can see everything that kittens are moving to.Great product!  Definitely recommended!
5,Very satisfied with the Goo spy camera. I have tried the same product from other manufacturers and Goo is a much better choice.
5,Bought 2 previous cams with no audio. This works great. Does the job!
5,So far so good thumbs up for me. Seems to do the job
5,I would highly recommend this product
5,Works and looks as described
5,Nifty mini spy camera. It has great quality video and audio. The SD memory slot is good for extended recording. The only issue I had was my outlets were all to low to the floor so the furniture got in the way.
3,Not the easiest to set as it took multiple time disconnects easy and have to go through the process again. Pictures are good. Not able to adjust camera so if using a low plug in you get the mid section now a person Not face.
2,I want a hidden camera to record all day and download the recorded video on SD card remotely this camera works as advertised. Setting up is quite easy if you used this wifi camera before live view and record and download recorded video--user record or all day record by the camera--called "replay" at the front page can be downloaded to phone. The recorded video on SD card can even play and seek without downloading to phone first wonderful. The front plate is reflective Unless one shine a bright torch light to it no one can see theres a camera at the front plate.But I will be returing this cause it has one major issue--video is noisy blocky and laggy fps is a mere 15 frame per second. I guess its because the bitrate is really low 1Mbit/s or ~125KByte/s. A 5 minutes video is about 40MByte/s great for remote downloading but very bad for picture quality. I have a hard time recognising face under room lighting with about 150 lux. If I can't see face clearly under room lighting it totally defeat the purpose of proving a person stealing.I won't mind paying 100 or even 200 dollars for a camera that equal to smart phone 1080p picture quality. I could understand portable hidden cam with low fps low bitrate and low PQ with its limited power supply/battery. Yet with constant power from the wall this still has lousy PQ. No comments on motion sensing I guess it work cause I keep getting "alarm" notification when I first powering it until I turn it off thru the app.A good camera module is not expensive the triple camera in latest iphone cost less than $100 mid range Android single camera module is than $20. Why can't this manufacturer use these module? By doubling the cost Its still less than $100 total.
5,For the price is has good quality and I like that it comes with an app
5,Product did it's job as described and this thing saved my marriage catching a cheating person on the spot with proof while I am at work. Very stealthily affordable & sleek design highly recommended.
5,Camera captures audio & video. Works well in regular and dim lighting. Happy with my purchase!
5,Easy app to install has reply saving live streaming and more.Pleased overall
3,Great Idea but was unable to set it up remotely easy return process.
5,I love this!! I‚Äôve been looking for a device like this one!! It‚Äôs perfect!
5,Easy to use so clear I‚Äôm impressed üëçüèæüôåüèø
5,Just got it and set up pretty easily. It asks you to download an app to work with the cam. Overall pretty good quality and easy to use. üëç
5,I set this up in my garage because someone kept breaking in and stealing stuff and would always disable the camera they could see. I left this plugged in above the workbench with a USB cable coming out and no one suspected a thing. This camera not only caught them breaking in but also caught them destroying the other one. I'm almost afraid to let this secret out because I want to keep these all to myself!
4,It worked great for the first 5 months. Now doesn‚Äôt send alerts when motion is activated and when I playback video it cuts me out of app. Poor quality for only 5 months of use.
5,Charger with a security camera. Can you believe? I couldn't. But I gave it a try and guess what? It was a surprise. I got it delivered next day.I use it at the front door to see the movement.Sensitivity is very good with a good quality of image pics.It has an app as well so I can be connected from anywhere.It is small plus a charger so one can hardly notice that it is a camera as well.I recommend this product. *****
5,Easy to get it up and running. The only draw lights has to be on but you have audio in the dark.
5,Nice clarity of the video and good quality with wide angle coverage. Would recommend this for a handy concealable webcam. It served the purpose of catching the stealing act by the maid.
5,The camera is really discrete looks like a real charger on first look. Since it‚Äôs directly connected to an outlet you don‚Äôt have to worry about the battery being low and with that being said it doesn‚Äôt run on batteries so you once you unplug it it will turn off. The video quality is superb and very clear and it also has a wide angle camera.
5,Works better than expected. Absolutely worth the cost. Easy to set up. Live view in no time. The best part is no hassle with a bunch of wires just plug it in a convenient wall plug and you are ready to set it up. Once you do you will be impressed with the video quality for such a small device. Totally recommend.
5,I bought this camera to keep a eye on things at home when I am not there. I did have to deal with an exwife that went out of bounds in the past and this would‚Äôve been perfect for me to see what she was really up to. It‚Äôs a great piece of equipment to help validate what things are happening when you‚Äôre not able to watch.
5,As a working couple we need something to monitor our baby. It automatically detects the old video/recording as soon as the memory of my SD card max out...good quality as well..still need some improvement in motion detection. Also First time setup the WiFi configuraton is bit difficult.
5,This camera is INCREDIBLE. Really good quality and large capture area stupid easy to set up and you cannot. Tell. At. All. That it is a camera. Oh and the charger works great haha. I have absolutely no complaints at all.
5,High Def picture great motion detection all in a small unnoticeable charger brick.  Would definitely suggest.  Wifi connected just fine the first try.
5,Great little security camera. I use it by the front door to see all who enter and exit and to keep track of the dog. The device does seem to heat up quickly but is only warm to the touch. The motion detection is sensitive enough to pick up anyone walking past. The picture quality is rather decent while there is enough light in the room.
5,Nice product it‚Äôs value for money.
5,Very good picture and easy set up.Thanks for great product üëçüëçüëçüëç
5,Looks real adaptor & works as adaptor too.Easy to use & worth for money.Only negative thing is you can plug wherever you have plug points.
5,It was great design. The camera just look like a normal charger using as like as normal charger. In fact that was a security camera perfect hidden. It was protecting and monitoring home security.
5,The package was delivered very quickly. I was surprised how small and how easily hidden it looks like a charger.  Along with other wires in the house it's barely noticeable.  It took me few minutes to set it up. I am using it simply to monitor via phone while away from home and it serves this purpose really well. Glad to find this product.
5,It Is awesome. Very discreet and easy setup. Would recommend this to anyone.
5,Exelente calidad de margen se puede colocar con facilidad la micro SD y lo m√°s importante que cumple con lo prometido.Recominendo a perfeccion.
5,It looks clearness . I use this on my garage wall it helps me to check do I close the garage door. Don‚Äôt need to charge and no more in a mess wire.
5,Great for nanny cam or to keep a eye on your things.  Easy to use great video quality!
5,Easy to set up can't even tell Its a camera.  Motion detection spot on with event recording couldn't ask for a better hidden camera. Fast shipping at great price. Highly recommend. A+++
5,Very good image for the size of the camera. the lens is slightly visible at certain angles but to the naked eye nobody would ever be able to tell! Use a larger sd card because it will fill up the memory quite fast. overall great product have bought 3 more since.
1,This thing is a complete piece of junk.  Many 5-star reviews were clearly left by the manufacturer (as you can guess from the broken English).  Instructions provided are lacking at best and just plain wrong at worst.  When the instructions talk about a switch they mean to poke the reset button with the provided pin in the hole on the side (one hole is a light the other is the reset button).  Note: there is a plastic film that should be removed from the lens.  Saam who reviewed this product did not remove the plastic film which is why his pictures were blurry.I was finally able to connect using the app and connecting to the Wi-Fi.  Once inside the app most of the settings don‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs not even clear what they mean.  None of the motion detection settings would turn on or save.I was able to briefly connect for a few seconds of video but then the device kept dropping offline.  I WAS able to successfully update the date/time and I DID get it to record some video (which was just okay)‚Ä¶
5,It looks like an ordinary charger but it is actually a hidden camera which cannot be found and the picture is very clear. The charging speed is also very fast. Value for money.
5,Very good invisibility. Good to use at living room. Can‚Äôt figure out it was a camera . I downloaded the app to watch the camera
1,To be fair the picture is clear when it actually connects. We wanted to use this to take on vacation so we could keep and eye on our room while we're out. It won't connect to wifi no matter how many times we go thru the steps. It only connects to the app when we're right next to the camera itself. We were offered a $20 gift card for a good review. If it worked right I would give it the review it deserves without the $20.
1,Instructions to set up are clear but the actual set up is problematic. Once set up picture was clear but camera disconnected after 3 days. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,I'm not sure how these cameras were given good reviews but they are terrible at night they have some mich noise static in themand half the time the motion detection works. App is good but definitely need SD cards because it doesn't alert you enough for motion
1,I thought this camera would be so simple that it must work. No need to hook it up to wifi simply let it record on the installed micro card. Wrong you must connect it using wifi to program it to use the micro card. After several hours and vision going blurred trying to read the tiny print it never worked.I wish Amazon would stop offering junk as cameras to purchase only to send them back. Raise your standards Amazon and have more satisfied customers and stop all these ridiculous trips to return junk.
1,Forget about the sound in the captured videos.The phone app (Android12) seems to support push notifications but in the reality there are no notifications at all. All necessary permissions are granted to the app though.
1,Can't set up
5,I can charge my device and monitor my location from home discretely.  Setting up is a little confusing but just follow the booklet instruction and  you're good to go.  It also record motion detection on my SD card for a later time when i don't have access to my phone. very satisfied
5,This camera was good value for money. It was easy to set up and the picture quality is excellent.
4,The camera works well and detects motion as advertised. Picture quality could be a bit better and would be great if it worked at night. The fact that you can easily add a micro SD card and that it functions as a real USB charger is a plus. I would recommend this at a reasonable price.
5,So far no issues.  easy to setup.works as intended  no complains.
5,Wow. Camera is just as avertized.  Awesome picture quality. Follow the instructions for easy set-up.  Shipping was only two days from CA to NY.
5,This is the clearest picture I‚Äôve ever seen on a spy camera. The directions were great this was the easiest camera I‚Äôve set up. I will be buying more soon. Thank you for a really great camera
4,Amazon provided a replacement within 24 hours which I was able to setup very easily. The device seems to work and manually record well but I cannot seem to get the motion detection notifications to work. I‚Äôve checked all settings on the app and my iphone and no luck. Maybe it will work better for you. I DO RECOMMENDOLD REVIEW: I charged it for over 12 hrs and the red light would still not come on to start the setup process even after hitting the reset button multiple times. The USB port worked fine the entire time.
5,
5,The camera had a better picture quality than I expected. Great product for the price
5,I needed a hidden  nanny camera. This camera is perfect. Just plug into a wall outlet like a charger and just follow the prompts on the app and you are good to go. As far as the camera the quality is good wide angle. The usb plug works as a charger. They camera is very well hidden. You have to really look to see a camera.
5,It is very small and not noticeable.
5,it's so easy to use and I can put it anywhere. I love to have little cameras especially ones that are motion sensor and I get the alerts sent straight to my phone
1,Not able to verify file APK Security issue3rd Party Software didn't work.Memory SD Card very hard to remove  stuck
5,This is a great hidden camera because it literally looks like a normal charger port. You can use it on any outlet it‚Äôs very convenient. The camera quality on the app is great and clear. It was easy to install using the instructions provided. Recommend buying this product!
5,Fast shipping. Good communication with the seller. Easy to install the camera clear HD video with motion detection. My favorite future is the USB port that allows you to charge your devices at the same time! I recommend.
5,The camera takes good photos and the connection ability is awesome. I can watch stuff real time. Great for when you have house sitters or need to check up on pets.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Buen√≠simo üëè
5,Easy to hide with a mirror face so the camera is not easily seen.
4,Is a great hidden camera easy to use/install plush you can actually use the charging port to charge your device
4,This little camera is better than all the other cameras I have tried. It was a little confusing to setup but once I had 1 completed it was super easy to add more to the software. Picture quality is good compared to other inexpensive devices. I would recommend this device if you are looking for an inexpensive way to keep track of what is happening while you are away. I bought 2 and would buy again if the need is there. And I would like to mention that their support is ok. Responded quickly to my first request but did not respond to my second request which was ok because I figured it out myself.
5,I like it I like it  it can hidden looks like changes no one will be think it is camera
4,Pretty fun and bad-a. H e double hockey sticks I'm coo
5,I like the fact that this camera can be hidden in plain sight. It took me a little bit to set it up but that could be more on me than the instructions. The instructions are very detailed and even gives you troubleshooting tips that may occur during setup.If you're looking for a camera that can hide in plain sight this is one that I would recommend
5,easy install  can use SD card for storage access easy
5,Since I have a camera it is much more convenient. In the past the baby was sleeping in the room. When I was cooking I had to run upstairs and downstairs to see if the baby woke up. Now I can directly observe the baby's movements on the mobile phone.  .
5,Everything about this product is very good
