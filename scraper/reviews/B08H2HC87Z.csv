5,The only difficult part was simply opening a Dell laptop containing small size 0 phillips screws and popping out the underneath plastic panel.  Once removed the ram was easy to located and replace.  One other comment about Dell laptops that even if you shutdown the computer it will power back on if you open the screen.  You have to pop the battery connector prior to replacing ram.  I would suggest you watch youtube videos on how to replace ram in dell laptops.  Having the additional ram is great for heavy ram usages with virtualization and software development.  I stress tested the ram and no issues on my Dell 16 5625 ryzen model.  Note that Dell always understates the actual maximum ram that you can expand on their web site but in fact this Dell model can be expanded to 64gb.
5,Bought this kit to upgrade from the 16GB (2x 8GB) pre-installed RAM set that came with my HP Omen 15.Was initially shopping for a 32GB kit when I found this 64GB option at a price point more attractive than I expected for it's capacity so I did some research and actually almost didn't end up buying it. There's conflicting information online as to if the Ryzen 5600H can support greater than 32GB RAM. Most sources seem to suggest that you'd need a 5800H to support up to 64GBs of RAM but I also saw that some vendors were selling laptops with a 5600H CPU and 64GB of RAM preinstalled so I decided to give this a shot.Another important factor was that my particular laptop's BIOS doesn't have an option for XMP/DOCP so it was important to find a set like this that runs at 3200Mhz STOCK not just support for those speeds overclocked. You may want to look into this for your system as well.Anyways I took the chance since this kit seemed to check all the boxes and--sure enough it works great! Ran some memory diagnostics and found zero errors. So far I've had absolutely no issues post-installation.Very pleased with this kit for the price I paid ($160) and would recommend it to others if it meets your needs.
5,I had a bad experience with a previous memory upgrade so I was prepared to spend more to purchase the exact name-brand of memory that came with my mini-PC system. The vendor said this G.Skill brand should also work and it was much cheaper. The lower price concerned me because I thought it might mean the memory modules were not as well-built or reliable but I took a chance and ordered them. To say I'm pleased with the results is putting it mildly. I've had my system running non-stop since I installed the new memory modules almost two nights ago and I haven't had one hiccup. The previous memory modules I had purchased which were more expensive crashed every few minutes and eventually rendered my Windows installation unusable.These memory modules are a bargain and they are as reliable as they come. Highly recommended!
5,Great value. Works in a 12th Gen Intel Nuc Extreme.  Install was quirky. Had to install on module boot the computer to let it find the RAM then add the 2nd module.  After that no issues.
5,G.Skill does it again! Easy to install run a expected & provide that extra boost of memory needed in high-end gaming machines. Nit-picking to find flaws i.e. latency @ 22 vs price point but industry-wide it was the better price & you know you can count on the quality of G.Skill so it's a wash.G.Skill for the win!
5,I tested this as soon as I got it. I left it overnight and it passed multiple passes. I got it for my new NUC server. I got it so I can run multiple VM's without issue but I haven't set it up for VM's yet and I'm just running a bunch of docker containers. When I look in Influx it says I've never gone over 5% usage. I gotta install ESXi those week and really put these to work.
5,My recently-purchased Lenovo portable workstation came with 32GB of memory which just wasn't enough for the number of virtual machines I often have running concurrently. This memory met the specs required of my workstation and was very attractively priced. Lenovo makes installing memory very easy and this popped in with no issues. I've been using it for nearly a month and have had no problems.While my workstation may be somewhat over-provisioned now with 96GB of RAM it's (as they say) better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it!
5,Fully compatible and functional with my Inspiron 7620 laptop. After trying an equivalent Kingston Fury Impact product and getting the incompatible memory flashing light pattern I was resigned to the idea that I would be stuck with getting the more expensive Crucial memory as they guaranteed compatibility. I figured I'd give it one more try with another brand and went with the G.SKILL RipJaws Series 64GB (2 x 32GB) 260-Pin SO-DIMM PC4-25600 DDR4 3200Mhz CL22-22-22-52 model and that worked with the machine starting up immediately after installation. Readings in both the BIOS and Task Manager showed it's functioning with the full 64GB at the advertised 3200Mhz without needing XMP which my laptop doesn't have. Still gotta see how much of a performance impact the new RAM has but for now I'm completely satisfied. I'd definitely recommend G.SKILL brand memory to any Dell user who's tried other brands that haven't worked because of compatibility issues.
5,Good value. Dual ranked x16
5,Works 100% as expected. I was very skeptical about buying this module. The logo/branding looks shady AF. GSkill should really get a better one designed. I would help move their inventory. The module is priced way below other modules of similar spec and hence I considered buying it. Had it been just 10% cheaper no way would I have considered it!
5,The set worked perfectly on my Dell XPS 9510.
4,I got it for my Framework laptop. It fits and gives me 64 GB (the max). It was the cheapest 64 GB pair.
5,Upgraded from 8gb to 64gb and I am beyond happy. Preliminary tests before installation were right on and all is well.
5,After I installed this 64 GB (32 x 2) RAM on my DELL XPS 15 9500 performance is striking fast opening apps also my virtual machines are now lighting fast in launching and multitasking apps. I upgraded from 16 GB RAM and what a difference!! I simply love it and regret it not to have done this upgrade before (I really didnt know this was a massive improvement in performance)
5,Does what it’s supposed to do.  Fast speed.  Upgraded the ram in my mini pc from 32 to 64gb.
5,I wanted to max out the RAM option on my boutique notebook. The RAM I ordered was a perfect fit a perfect price point and it is allowing my computer to do the huge resource things I need it to do without sweating. Perfect. Thank you
5,I bought this for a custom computer build.  I made an Adobe workstation for my girlfriend who works online from home using Adobe apps.  Her previous notebook was a Ryzen 5 with 32GB of RAM.  We found out the hard way that AMD is picky about RAM.  Some of the best rated RAM in the world would not run stable on her notebook because of the AMD processor.  I love AMD but you have to be very careful about choosing RAM.  I was happy to find this 64GB kit for a good price and used it to build a Ryzen 9 workstation.  It is recognized right away (no BIOS tweaking needed) and it runs at full speed at default settings.  Windows Memory Diagnostics ran twice with no problems detected.  Not much else to say.  This will run Adobe apps just fine I am sure.  She doesn't know I built it yet (surprise)
5,I've been using G.Skill ram for years and have not been let down once! They really do make great memory. I have used their ram mainly in ASUS built systems. This time for a couple of ASUS laptops. I bought a set of 16Gbx2 for the first G17 upgrading from 8Gb and the difference in loading time was huge! Running Windows 11 I was glad I did get 32Gb because almost 20Gb of it was being used while gaming. So for the newer G17 I have coming I went with the 32Gbx2 sticks and am just gonna max it out. Very impressed with the ram so far and as always..lots of speed with G.Skill.
5,Smooth and easy installation resulting in smooth operations of any program thrown at it.Compatible and recognized by my MSI gf66 Kitana laptop. I couldn't be happier using it for high end work and gaming.
4,Worst Online Shopping Experience Ever. Still waiting for the refund. Great product but arrived giving problems running. The bad experience was with the returned with Amazon that never updated the returned causing longer periods for processing return...
5,I use my XPS 17 for work which for some workloads was using all 16GB of RAM that my laptop shipped with. As these match the specs of the original RAM (speed timings voltage) I assumed they would work great and indeed they did. The RAM is running stable and perfectly in the 9710 model of the XPS 17.If you're looking for a good upgrade for your laptop you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with these.
5,It was easy to install and now my laptop have more memory and it’s running faster now. Worth the money for it.
5,Not much to dislike decent price and it is what it claims.  I've always had quality items from G. Skill
5,Upgraded from 8+8 to these 32+32 and they work perfectly in my 2021 Dell XPS 9510 which is a model notorious for being picky about RAM.  That they were way cheaper than Crucial or other brands was just a plus.
5,Very good value for the money.  i dont really need 64gb ram but it's hard to resist to get 64gb for the current price.  installed in my nuc12dcmi9 kit and everything works perfectly.  just a bit sad that the price came down a bit shortly after i received my order!
5,Nice upgrade for my new MSI laptop
5,Great high performance ram allowing me to run hundreds of chrome tabs pycharm and multiple wsl2 and Rdp without slowdown
5,I have been using Crucial Vengeance and Ballistix for quite a while. I just purchased a new Legion 5 and moved the 32GB Vengeance from the old computer to this (DDR4-3200). It ran well but with the new GF3070 + Ryzen7-5800 and 32GB I expected more. I decided to try the Gskill 32GB compliment and what a difference. Timings were a bit quicker than the Vengeance but nit the Ballistix still it was noticeably quicker responding to commands execution of Photoshop Illustrator Audition etc. So much so that after testing back and forth for a whole day I purchased the 64GB kit and never looked back. This is lightning fast with all applications regardless of system load. I have never been happier. The stability is beyond rock solid - something that Crucial cannot boast and the ability to throw endless work at this machine now never seems to slow it down at all. I am not a gamer but a content professional who uses this for a living. I can't recommend this RAM highly enough - just buy it - you won't regret it.
5,Confirmed that 64GB is working in Lenovo Legion 5i Pro (model 16ITH6H with an Intel i7-11800H). No issues installing them. Windows 11 booted up  without any issues.Tested for about a month before writing the review.
5,Works great! Bios recognized it immediately with no issues! Thanks for delivering quality with a great price!
5,VERY good value for money. No compatibility trouble with my Intel hardware
5,Replaced the RAM from my ASUS Scar 15 AMD Advantage laptop with fast 64GB RAM. I've been running a touch over 6 weeks with no problems so far. Install was fairly easy just please please open the case gently as the LED ribbons can be broken easily if not careful.
5,MAKE THE JOB. OUTSTAND.
5,Just got been looking at them for a while and with the recent price drop decided to buy them; they work great and was easy to install just plug and play; I'm using an eluktronics matrix rp 15 with the ryzen 7 4800hs
5,These modules works perfectly with ThinkPad P73 Mobile Workstations.Please notice that after installing the memory module the very next boot may take quite bit longer while it is detecting the new memory the screen may stay black but after that it will boot normally.These modules are PCI Gen 4 still work on  system with PCI gen3 but may not reach their full speed.On P73 they run at 2555 Mhz.My P73 was originally configured with 32GB  adding  these two 32 GB sticks makes a total of 96GB which makes Windows 11 really fly.
5,Exactly what I needed to upgrade my laptop. My laptop does not allow support XMP despite it being a high end laptop (Lenovo Legion 7) so I needed to get SO-DIMM that was JEDEC. It runs at the advertised speed of 3200mhz. Very happy.
5,It's worked flawlessly for me so far. Make sure that this is the right kind of RAM; this is intended for laptops. Very cheap and easy to install though you might need a special screwdriver to be able to get into your laptop.
5,Great price (when I bought) and works great in my Dell Latitude 5520.  I don't game just wanted Max Memory for doing business tasks. No issues at all.
5,Tested on the following1. NUC7 - Works but ram feels very warm to touch without any load - removed and no longer using.2. NUC8 - Works fine and run cool without any load.3. Thinkpad P52 - Works fine and run cool without load.Update -4. Thinkpad P50 - Works fine with 2 DIMMs but when I put in 4 pieces it doesn't recognise more than 64Gb.5. NUC 5 - works greatFYI just because it works doesn't mean it's compatible or recommended or stable. Will update if any issue.Update - After after 1 year it's still been working great. I run VMware ESXi on my NUC so having 64GB of ram on a tiny NUC is just great.I have read some reviews that gave this a 1 star because "they replace 16GB dimm with this 32GB dimm and only 1 slot works" etc . Please ignore those review . It has nothing to do the ram but instead this is due to the system and bios limtation.
5,Replace the 16 gig kit and replaced with these. 64 gigs now i my Lenovo Legion 7 laptop...
5,Easy to install just opened the back panel of my laptop and used the release switches. I haven't had any Ram issues since upgrading as the 64GB lets me run anything comfortably even when I'm using up to 50 tabs at once.
5,Works at the indicated speeds in a Lenovo legion 5i pro. Excellent price and easy install.
4,so far so good Two months everything is working like a charm
5,No complaints. Does what its suppose to doesn't cause issues. Passed memory tests. Not sure what else One could ask for.
5,Installed in MSI G65 with rtx3060. System struggled to play COD. After Ram upgrade no issues. Gameplay smooth and other apps loaded better as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Memory upgrade went smooth.  The memory speed matched my CPU of 3.2 GHz perfectly.  A+ recommendation for this memory upgrade!
3,I bought these to replace my 16g factory RAM in my new Eluktronics laptop. When I swapped the pairs of sticks my laptop refused to boot. I plugged the old RAM back in booted no problem. 1 of each and no problem booting. Tried the new pair again for good measure no dice.I'll be keeping the one working stick since it's still a massive upgrade but I feel scammed because I'm only getting half my money's worth.
5,It’s not much to it… plug and play on a razer 15 advanced 2021
5,64GB installed and working great even though legion 5 suggests a max of 32GB
5,Snapped right into place and worked great from jump.
5,It is random access memory.
5,Worked flawlessly right after installation. No need to configure
4,If you want a lot of capacity at a reasonable price I think it's a good choice.
5,compre de 64gb trabajan a 1.2V y la instale en mi laptop MSI GE76 y funciona perfectamente. 100% recomendado.
5,Installed in an Asus Strix Laptop "G17 model". Recognized all of it not just the 32G that the Amazon Asus has listed it's a mistake. It's capable of using all 64G of memory /Win
5,I put this memory to max out (64MB) my GE76 Raider 11UE I bought at Costco.  Ran at 3200 MHz after I put it in and turned my laptop on no manual configuration needed.
5,It is work fine with my miniforum HM90.
5,Hi quality kick a$$ ram for an unbelievably low price.  “Seacrest out.”
5,For anyone who was wondering this RAM is plug and play for the 2020 15" Razer Blade Advanced it will boot up and work right away no need to change anything in the BIOS although it will run at a slightly lower speed than its capable of without a BIO update and flash to enable XMP (i never figured out how to do this or if its was possible). It's a massive upgrade over the stock 16 GB
5,Bought it for AsRock Box 4x4 4800U had some reservations as it not listed as compatible.Worked like a charm - run through the memtest86 for 24 hours - no errors.Quite fast for laptop memory as well.Definitely going to buy G.Skill again for my future projects.
5,Funciona perfectamente en mi Asus ROG Ryzen 9
5,Great price. Plug and play on a Razor Blade 17 Pro 2021.
5,3200MT/s1.2V
5,Ram went into my Asus strix no problems.  Also worked in my older g752vt.
5,Works perfectly
5,Installed this 64GB DDR4 Kit on my brand new 2022 Hp ENVY 17.3' Intel 12th Generation Core i7 1260p laptop that came with 12GB DDR4 preinstalled.Just letting others know out there that it works perfectly with my system with the system specs above.Speedier and definitely recommended upgrade !Note*:I bought this kit from another company.You do not always have to buy everything from amazon !!! lol
1,memtester under Linux failed this memory immediately. Do not buy this memory.
5,After going through the $100 more Crucial Ballistix and Kingston Fury RAM modules only to get the "unsupported memory" flashing on the indicator light (2 amber followed by 5 white flashes) I finally stumbled across a Reddit thread that pointed me here. It works beautifully and according to the BIOS is running at 3200 MHz. I haven't confirmed or benchmarked. Just happy it works. On BIOS version 1.4.1 right now. BUY IT! WORTH IT!
4,Bought for XPS 9510.  3200Mhz! @ 1.2V.  Easy install and no issues so far.
5,Fast and easy install on the Legion 7 after you get the cover open. Recommend to use some thin tool like iFixIt to pry the cover as it’s pretty tight if it’s brand new. As for the card great read and write speeds. Very happy with it’s value and price after a few months
5,Recognized by the system on boot and a nice little boost in performance
5,It is as easy as using 2 fingers to slightly push the tabs in opposing directions to release the installed ram sliding that out of your way all you have to do next is to insert your new RIPJAWS 3200MHz RAM 1 module at a time into the LTK8 RAM socket with index finger and thumb on the corners to be able to push both side in to the bottom of the socket then carefully guide it down until it clicks in place on each side of the RAM module. Do this for each of your DDR4 G.Skill RAM modules you will be installing. Do this in a clean environment using only manufacturer suggestions on how to install RAM. Also I suggest to do a proper cooling system cleaning while you have it open taking the manufacturer's suggestions and tips as your guide for this task.
5,I would buy again.
5,Just bought a new MSI Leopard GP66 Laptop that came with 16GB (2x8 GB) RAM.  Bought these to replace the RAM.  They have the same timings as the RAM that came with the laptop and the laptop recognized the RAM with no problems running at 3200 MHz.  Highly recommend!
5,According to multiple forums the Dell XPS 9710 is known to be picky regarding RAM chips. I purchased these specifically after others attested to their compatibility. So far so good everything is checking out. I don't game or have time enough to care about benchmarks (if I had time sure I would run them through many) but the speed is reporting correctly and Dell's built-in hardware health utilities all check out.
5,Installed in my brand new MSI GE76 Raider I bought at Costco. Installed with no issues no need to access Bios absolutely plug and play. Running 64 GB at 3200 Mhz. Machine is flying. Added Samsung 1Tb SSD. Excellent product. See how long is gives service.
5,Dell told me the Inspiron 1706 2-in-1 memory capacity is 16G at most but suggested I can try larger as there is no document to definitely stated it cannot.I got these two and expanded it to 64G att DDR4. Great!
5,Dell Inspiron 15 5510 (2021 model) Core i7-11390HDespite the Dell docs saying 32 GB max for this system the Intel spec & Crucial site both report 64 GB max.  The memory upgrade worked fine. Removed 2x 8GB SODIMMs and installed this 2x 32GB kit.  Windows 11 (Pro) reports 64GB available.
5,There's no doubt that the G.Skill RipJaws Series 64GB (2 x 32GB) 260-Pin SO-DIMM PC4-25600 DDR4 3200 is a quality built memory module that performs beyond expectations it also works flawlessly with the Asus TUF A15 FA506IV Ryzen 9 4900H.
5,I have always trusted G.Skill based on other peoples reviews.  I found that it was all true.  I have 2 other sets of RAM for a desktop made by G.Skill and have had them for over two years without issue.  Feeling that brand loyalty I order these two 32gb sticks on a whim hoping that it runs at full speed 3200mhz and also without errors I was not disappointed.  Opening the laptop was a very tight fit and had brackets which had to be popped for the RAM.  I disconnected the battery which may or may not be required and replaced the stock 3200mhz RAM for this kit.  In total it took me a bit longer than the average person to do it to be careful.  I added a graphene memory pad made by icepc to it and resealed the bracket on top of it.  It runs extremely smoothly whereas before even 16gb ran slower.  My other desktop uses 64GB and is mainly used for gaming and music production and it has improved in these areas and likewise saw improvement from 32gb to 64gb RAM.  CPU-Z is the utility I used to measure RAM speed.  And system information on Windows 10 to display the amount of RAM.Thank you for reading and thank you G.Skill for using high quality Hynix chips for reliability.  My RAM had been just recently manufactured so this is all new stock.Edit: I also happen to own a set of G.Skill 16GBx2 for the Acer Aspire 5 Slim at 2400mhz and it works flawless and I chose it over other brands because it was cheaper than the equivalent by Crucial as well as based on previously aforementioned desktop performance. For the money it cannot be beat.  To clarify I went on a chance for the Lenovo Legion timings rather than knowing the quality of the brand and haven't had a single malfunction of any computer process.  I haven't ran any stress testing components but I render music and it sounds exactly the same so I would know by now.  I run game servers once in a while and all of these components were required from stock configuration.
5,used it for my framework laptop had no issues quick memtest ran fine
4,I can’t really fault the product for a compatibility issue that’s really due to a finicky computer.
5,I upgraded from the factory 16GB RAM configuration in an Inspiron 16 model 7610. The other brands were more expensive so I decided to give these a try. They work as advertised at the 3200 speed and I haven't had any problems.  The software development environment My software development environment often pushes close to 32GB so 64GB was necessary for my use to be safe and future proof. I don't do much gaming so can't comment on performance for that purpose but works great for development.
5,true 3200mhz installed msi delta 15 all good no bios needed
5,4x the capacity and half the CAS latency of my old memory and rock solid performance self configuredjust installed ran bios and saved new memory size XMP autoconfigured in my LG Ultra PC.No issues with memory.
5,used on alienware M15 r1 with no issues overclocked it pretty heavy and its working fine
5,Bought for my Area 51 m2. Originally had 16gb because dell gouges memory. Read a bunch of reviews saying that Dell won't support the 3200mhz because it's not Dell ram and well that's true it's currently running at 2933 but what they don't tell you is that the option in the bios is bugged or disabled in a recent update so my Dell 3200mhz 16gb ram that came with it was only running at 2933 mhz as well. Dell does make good hardware. Just wish they didn't nickle and dime you on the upgrades. One final thought. I've always bought gskill for my after market ram choice. Never had a single module fail me. One of my customs has been running 10 years with gskill and my m17x r3 is running gskill ~9 years. Always been good ram.
5,Good fast ram. Got to 3.2GHz automatically on the latest NUC Pro. All 64GB is usable and with PassMark tests I got significant improvement after playing with power settings. From 9000 to 14000!!! I bet it's not due to the RAM itself but rather extended TDP. Who cares this pair fits into my beast NUC Pro and works perfectly fine on an overclocked device in a fanless enclosure
5,There nothing to dislike about this product. It deliver as it says it is. 64gb is overkill but it better to have than not to have. Loving this
4,It just works the first time i installed in my Lenovo Legion pro laptop 64GB is the way to go. It felt very responsive on any task that i do. Great product as always
5,This works without any issue. I upgraded my RAM on my Alienware Ryzen Edition R5 to 64GB RAM. Work perfectly without no instability issues. Highly recommend.
5,Fantastic and works 100% well. Renowned GSkill performance that's right up there. Upgraded my Legion 7 2021 Notebook with these dual sticks and never went back. Works like a charm. Great value for the money esp when Amazon has the occasional price drops.
2,After opening the package the items was not seal is that suppose to be the case? Are they new RAMs or used product kind of doubting here. Tested that it works fine for now
