5,Good price
5,The is the only ink I can use in my HP printer. Works well.
5,I recommend staying with HP's ink and prefer to get the XL ones just because it lasts longer. I trust Amazon's to be fresh. It is a good buy when compared to store prices. Using Non-HP ink on HP papers produces very BAD pictures! HP ink shows better detail.
4,HP used to make a very good XL ink cartridge. However not have I not been getting as many copies the last black one I ordered leaked all over my great aunt’s antique leather top desk. So I am not impressed with HP lately.
5,works fine
2,Unless you use genuine HP ink cartridges. This is absurd. How much money do these folks need to make?? The printer we bought was over $300 and you know each of these ink cartridges are way over priced. During challenging times I had to buy repurposed cartridges to save money. I had to do this again and a flag message came up saying the ink cartridge wasn’t genuine HP & the printer shut down until I bought one. This happened after the last update.
5,I don’t like the high price of these cartridges but print quality is much better than generic cartridges and last a long time.
4,other than the package was damage the cartridge worked well.
5,All I can say is that I have simply never had a problem with genuine HP ink.  No damaged cartridges.  No leaks.  No streaks.  No drying out.I've been tempted to try the off brands to save money but from what I can tell it's a crap shoot as to whether you'll get a high quality cartridge with high quality ink that won't give you problems at some point.  I'd rather stick with what has always worked reliably for me.The XL cartridges do last a long time too.  .  I have 3 HP printers in my home network (one for each floor so we're not having to run upstairs or downstairs to print) and I keep a stash of ink cartridges so I never run out.  Works for me.
4,Like there's a choice?  When you purchase a printer you're literally locked in to using a specific ink cartridge so I'm not sure exactly what there is to review here....  It works it puts letters on the page.
5,Best HP ink replacement. My HP printer will not accept replacement cartridges other than authentic HP cartridges but you get what you pay for. These extended life cartridges are the way to go if you do a lot of printing.
5,Just what you get with other companies. Perfect.
3,Ordered HP ink and received it but in a dirty sticky dented HP box -- cartridge is OK but box is gross
5,Exactly what was expected and on time
5,i like the quality
5,This is the real deal - last refurbished from other vendors and about destroyed my printer (and my patience) never again!
4,I only bought original HP ink for now. No issues with this one but it would be better if they lowered price because this is ink is for an older printer model.
5,Amazon has the best price for HP ink unless you are part of HP's auto refill.  I don't copy enough to auto order so this works best for me.
5,when you print as much as I do the costs add up
5,As cheap as Costco. And delivered to your house fast
5,Great price. I buy all the time
5,The XL cartridge lasts a long time and is worth the extra cost
5,The XL size in ink is great price is reasonable and easy to get from Amazon
4,Just what I wanted
5,Absolutely love the XL cartridges so rewarding to not have to buy ink all the time!!!!
5,None
5,Awesome Product!!!
5,Automatic reorder for my printer.
5,The XL's run out of ink a lot faster than they used to with my "everyday" printing.  I think HP has cut the amount of ink in the XL's.  That's really too bad.
5,I was able to buy the HP 952XL high capacity ink cartridge for my HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 printer delivered to my home at a reasonable price.
5,Hp dont like the cheaper carts.
5,Exactly as shown works as expected
5,I have purchased this product many times and have always found it performing as expected and lasting as long as promised.
5,The more the shelf life the better...
4,Gotta have ink to print. This ink works fine. Wish they did not gouge us so much on the price. We all know it does not take $30+ to make one of these!
5,works great
5,I bought them for my printer in Argentina and it turns out that they can only be used in printers in Canada and USA.
3,Too expensive. It's the first time I've tried the xl size. If I notice a significant improvement in longevity (I only use my printer for personal use do not print more than once or twice a week) I might give it 4 stars. Ink is too expensive period. Always feel like HP has me over a barrel I am at their mercy. I don't like feeling taken advantage of and hp makes me feel that.
5,Fast delivery and was the correct cartridge for my printer.
5,Great ink! I always buy XL. It lasts forever with normal usage.
5,Great product.
5,I always try to have these ink cartridges on hand so be able to replace the old the day they go bad.
5,The HP cartridges always deliver as promised.  The cartridge is easy to install and functioned without any issues.
5,I won’t buy the cheap ink refills. The colors aren’t the same and sometimes you have an inky mess. HP ink is dependably good quality. Never a problem!
1,Not only is HP ink a rip-off they just sent a software update to printers WITHOUT NOTIFICATION during this pandemic while everyone is working from home disabling third-party printer ink.  No notice whatsoever.  So they disable the third-party cartridges and you go to print and nothing happens.GOOD customer service would have been some notification by HP if they were planning to do this.  I have been a long time customer of HP - over 30 years - and this tactic has left a bad taste in my mouth for HP.  As soon as this is all over I will be switching.Shame on HP for doing this while people are trying to get through this pandemic.
5,Excellent product. Would always recommend the XL version of the ink cartridge as you are not saving going with non-xl version.
5,OEM ink cartridge. Works as expected. Way cool that my printer can order its own ink.
5,what to say about Ink... put cartridge in and ink comes out on the paper! Yeah!
5,Needed this to complete a set of three color XL type carts for my new printer. It worked great and was just what I needed.
5,Used for daily and professional purposes.
5,Good quality for money
5,Sharp and good wuality
5,Genuine HP ink. Works perfectly in my HP OfficeJet Pro 8740 ink jet printer.
5,I use an HP printer and I am often wanting the sharpest graphics that I can get. This ink does that for me.
5,Good ink
5,Good product  good price
2,Do not buy these if you are from outside the US. HP has region locks on their inks.
5,Great Ink last a very long time. This is the reason why I continue to buy HP!
5,Cartridges are always what gets you.  But you gotta have them.

2,Ridiculously expensive HP ink that their machines require you to use. Google it you can reprogram that however if you want to take the time. I've heard they're newer machines may have eased up on that requirement at least I hope.
5,nice
3,Too expensive
3,Pricing is outrageous!
1,The manufacturer's package arrived open.  Who knows how much ink was used out of it before it was mailed to me?  I returned it.
3,Good
1,What was ordered was an HP 951XL.  An HP 952XL was delivered and is not interchangeable with an HP 951XL.  How do I exchange considering that I opened the HP Packaging before I found out that it would not fit the printer.  The other HP 951 XL's were fine as was the HP 950XL.
1,I received a message today from my HP printer that one of these cartridges is damaged.  The message also said to turn off the printer to prevent further damage.  I now need to replace all of them in order to have a printer that works
1,Defective. My printer (OfficeJet Pro 8725) will not recognize this cartridge. The Yellow of this same cart (952XL) worked fine. Now I have to deal with returning it AND I'm out of Magenta so printing is an absolute hassle.
1,DEFECTIVE..NEED REPLACEMENT AND CREDIT PLSALL FOUR ORDERED AT SAME TIME WERE PRIMED AND REPLACED...AND NOT PRINTING WELL
1,Received fake cartridge no 3d laser seal Printer rejected the cartridge.
2,Not happy with HP
1,not compatible with hp officejet pro 8710 incompatibility error. 954XL is the correct
5,Good price for value
5,You have to understand that HP is not in the printer business.  They are in the INK business.....the OVERPRICED ink business.
5,Exact replacement they fit
5,It allowed me to print again
5,Best price
5,Works as intended
5,As described
3,Printer will not accept non-HP cartridges.  I will switch to Epson when cartridges run out.  Will NOT repurchase.
5,Great Quality Long Lasting
5,Works and prints as expected.  The price of HP ink in general and these in particular is much to high for the few grams of ink received.
5,Does what it is supposed to do. It is a good product.
5,Great product
5,Perfect
5,👍🏼
3,Produces great pictures but very expensive for the number of pages printed.
5,Ease of installation. lasted proper amount of time
5,Excellent
5,For some reason my printer refuses to accept any aftermarket cartridge. Without the genuine HP cartridge my printer would have been thrown into the landfill which almost occurred had it not been for an astute technician at an aftermarket repair shop. But it's purring right along!
5,long life ink
5,As advertised!
5,Price is good and I did not have to make a trip to the store!
5,Works fine
