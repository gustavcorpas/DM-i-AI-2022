5,This just popped up the other day in one of those random Facebook ads and after reading several reviews I decided to give it a try. Recovering any one of the dozens of photo albums I lost when an external HD suddenly quit about 10 years ago would easily be worth more than $25. Even with all the good reviews I was still pretty skeptical but it was worth a shot.It arrived a couple hours ago and after watching the mini-tutorial vid here I hit the power switch and almost immediately I saw scores of albums I had long ago resigned myself to having lost forever.The only negative so far is a lack of instructions. It's so easy to set up that the video was enough but a quick start guide would be nice.Few purchases are as worth the price as this great little gizmo. It would be a bargain at twice the price.
5,I needed to retrieve some old family photos and data on an old IBM Thinkpad laptop (Windows 98 SE).  The Thinkpad powered up and but I couldn't get the CD drive or the USB port to work.  The Windows 98 OS was apparently corrupt and/or the drivers were damaged or missing.  I removed the IBM Travelstar IDE hard disk and plugged it into this adapter attached to my Windows 10 desktop computer and it showed up immediately on File Explorer.  I ran my virus software to clean the Travelstar (it was infected with a worm) and downloaded nearly 20 Gb of files in a couple of hours.  My computer said it was downloading at around 6 Gbps over a USB 3 port.This adapter is compact well built and functioned perfectly for my data recovery project.
5,Plugged SSD drive into the SATA port and plugged the USB into a 3.0 USB port. Cloned my Laptop HDD and replaced it with the newly imaged SSD. This device worked perfectly and it’s also plug and play.
5,I wanted an inexpensive way to way to pull data off old hard drives.  I was able to pull the files I needed off of old 3.5" SATA drives that had been in an old PC directly to my Mac.  I'm not really using it full-time for additional storage but it did do exactly what I needed it to and it was easy to use.
5,My PC died and would no longer boot up.  I had 37GB of photos plus tons of documents that were not backed up (shame on me).  I thought they were lost forever then I found this product and decided to give it a try.  I removed the old hard drive and plugged it into the Little Triangle and connected it to a notebook.  It was immediately recognized as a drive and I was able to retrieve everything easily.  I copied all the files to an external USB drive which is now my backup and then copied from the USB drive to my new computer.  Everything worked flawlessly and I am so glad I decided to purchase this.  Just an amazing product and so simple to use.
5,This adapter worked perfectly for transferring data from an old external hard drive where the enclosure wasn’t working. I needed an IDE connection and had to have the 4 pin power adapter which isn’t included on most of these cables.I’m generally pretty wary of some of the brands on here but I really wanted that sweet data so I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.
5,Worked with various drive I had to reformat and instructions were clear.
5,Just be aware that when word gets out that you own this people start asking to borrow it.  Apparently everyone out there has old hard drives laying around just like you.
5,Not hard to use set up and understand worth every penny
5,I needed to get some info off a very old EIDE drive. I plugged the drive in and used the power adapter that was supplied. Plugged in a new external to my computer plugged the converters USB in to the computer and everything went fine. Perfect right out of the box.
5,I like it I can save and restaure my data in other computer after the first crash.Thank you.
5,Have used a few times and works great
4,For me it works good on SATA drives but on IDE drives it does not work. My computer is a Windows 10 PC and it will only recognize the device but not the IDE drives at all.I tried this product on a Windows XP Pro computer at no avail.The IDE drives I'm trying to read are all good but I can't read them.For now only 4 stars until I can read IDE drives.
5,Quick easy pretty much self-explanatory.  Solid material not flimsy.  Really good value & price.  I saw the same type of product on social media add that was of much poorer quality & they wanted twice as much.  I found this on Amazon when the place I was trying to buy it from asked for an alternate mailing address.I am pleased with this purchase.
5,It's just plug and play. No difficult configuration required
5,I was able to recover files from my old drive and transfer to new solid state drive
5,Works as described.
3,Way better than having to swap out drives using enclosures but the power cord is way to short to be able to place the unit where it would be easy to manipulate it! Other than that is works as promised although it is disconcerting to handle a drive that has been properly disconnected to the computer as because disconnecting doesn't stop the drive from spinning so you have this gyro stabilizing your hand as you take the drive out of the unit.
5,It works wonderfully and very easy to use
5,This device makes photo and data transfer a breeze. My transfer speed from drive to drive is 57 Mb/s. The transfer over the USB 3.0 was 78 Mb/s
4,I am giving it 4 out 5 because there are no instructions (aside from the obvious how to plug it in picture).While it's a pretty simple device and works well I ran into trouble with the older IDE drives. I got this to go through many of my old hard drives between 1998 and 2014 in particular the 3.5 inch IDE ones which are a touch trickier than the others because they require an additional power input (which is included). The 12V adapter has maybe a 3' cable which means if you run off a surge protector on the floor or something you might have trouble reaching the device if you're trying to set it up flat on a desk. The extra power connector to the drive is a tight fit but it works fine.Here's the kicker though: every time I plugged it into a USB 3.0 slot and powered it up the drive would be detected then it would disable and freeze up my machine and I would have to hard reset. I tried this with multiple jumper settings and reboots and still had the same problem on an old 80 GB Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 from 2004. On a whim I decided to slow down my USB 3 port by plugging in a USB 2.0 hub and plugging into that. Presto! The drive works perfectly good (well good enough to grab all the old photos and stuff off of at least). Anyway I haven't tried with a USB 2.0 port because they are all inaccessible on this machine but at least if I slow a 3.0 down to 2.0 I get this thing to work perfectly. Hope this helps somebody.
3,It could be more versatile than it is. Doesn’t run all hard drives. Even though they connect
5,Works well.
5,Worked perfect out of the box.  Was able to salvage my portable WD sata drive after the power unit died.  Transfer speeds were average of 39mb per second. However I was copying onto another (solid state) usb drive.  You also have to factor in my mid range Dell tower.  In conclusion it worked extremely well for my needs.  The best advice is to always back up.  I should know better but got lazy.
5,This adapter works great for almost every Hard drive.  It is so handy I bought two.  There are a couple things to remember after I used this on over 20 hard drives.You must turn the power on to the hard drive before plugging in the USB cable (about 15 to 20 sec).  This gives the hard drive time to power up.  With newer SATA hard drives and solid state drives this is not as important.  It is essential with older IDE drives.There are adapters for connecting solid state drives to the USB port.  This is not one of them.  The power MUST be turned on to work.If the hard drive is really old (like from 1995 or older) this may not work.  Not because the adapter is not working but because the hard drive cannot send its info to your computer.There are two other hard drives that this did not immediately work on.  One was an early model SATA drive that needed a power plug like the older IDE drives take.  The power cable on this device was too short to reach the plug.  I was able to get a power cord extension which allowed me to power up the drive.  The other drive was an ancient Maxtor 1.8 GB drive.  The plug was recessed so far into the drive that the adapter would not engage to the drive.  This is the only drive I have seen like this.
4,Device allowed me to retrieve my data from an old IDE drives.
4,It did what it was supposed to no problems
5,Very good quality materials and I was able to use it on all my different drives from my laptops and desktops I've owned for the past 20 years. This is a must have tool...
5,Instructions could use a little work but it works great.
5,I love that I recover all my old pictures and files off the old hard drives from my past computers.
5,Easy to use does what it's supposed to.5 Stars for quality price shipping.
5,Very cool. Was able to get old info off three different types of old drives.
5,I had  differnet  IDE/SATA Hard Drive Adapter that would not work on a couple hard drives I have. I used this USB 3.0 to IDE/SATA Hard Drive Adapter External Converter and I couldn't belive it was able to access all my data I thought I'd lost.
5,I had purchased another unit similar that only did SATA connected drives it worked 1 time and when I switched disk drives it crashed. I then purchased this little gem and was so happy that not only would it work on my SATA drives but my older drives that I had saved from computers from way bake in the late 8o's. Like others have said the cords are short but I think the manufacture was only intending this to be a tool for disk recovery not for every day hot swapping hard drives. To do that would be better to use a hot swap case that is more steady and shielded but if you are like me and just want to recover some old photos and files on an old drive that came out of a outdated computer  or a bookcase hard drive that the controller failed this is a great tool to use.
5,This device works as advertised and I am very pleased with it.
5,I don't have anything bad to say about this to be honest. It works exactly as intended.The 3 way box design is a little odd to be fair but it keeps the tool from having a case of spaghetti wires and I can see the appeal in that very much for storage. However if you have all 3 ports being utilized it does take up a very large space. Thankfully in my experience this wasn't very often the case but I'm sure there are people out there that will have this scenario.That's basically it. Other than that it's a fantastic little tool for 40 or 44 pin IDE drives. That's really all I'd imagine people would buy this for. The modern SATA attachment slot is nice but there are better industry standard adapters for that if going through drives quickly.
5,Very fast easy to hook up and use. Power wire from box to hard drive doesn't like to stay plugged in but still workable. I bought this to rescue a crashed hard drive from my main laptop and it worked out great but I found out I would not support 2 disk at one time may have just been the configuration of my disks.This will allow me to recover lost files for not only my other crashed PCs but for my friends and make a little money on the side as well as help them out a bit.
2,Purchased with high expectations based upon previous reviews. The unit appears to be well built. Despite numerous attempts it failed to engage any disks I attached to it. I tried a newer SSD several SATA units and an older 3.5 IDE drive and none of them would work. I uninstalled/re-installed drivers on three computers (one with Win 10 and two with WIN 11) and the problem persisted. My SSD disk was recognized by one of the Win11 laptops but it dropped off when I tried to access the drive. When I connected it to the WIN10 machine it forced a restart but still failed to work. I'm not convinced the problem is with the unit since a lot of folks had no problem based on the reviews. However I don't have the tech background to dig deeper into the problem so I'm going to return the unit and look for another solution.
5,Allowed me to retrieve the files from my hard drive from my dead computer.
4,I have been saving all of my hard drives from my old computers for the last 20 years and this fit all but 2 of them. It did not recognize the two hard drives and a third was legit dead.Not the fastest data transfer. I suggest having a task that is not at your computer as this is a resource needy operation for every hard drive.Other than that did the job great.
5,Worked better than I even dreamed!
4,I'm so pleased I was able to recover documents/photos from my old Sony desktop computer.I also recovered data from a different desktop computer-that computer was much newer than my old Sony and it worked instantly.The old Sony desktop took a few times as it requires more power to spin the drive.  Thankfully windows 10 found the drive and I successfully transferred the documents... And here I was thinking I would be charged millions from the people at Geek Squad to recover the drive... Thankfully this product did the trick!Would be 5 stars but the older drive took some effort with using a jumper.
4,When my laptop died with all of my files on the hard drive I needed a way to get the info onto another device. This was recommended to me by a friend. The old hard drive was already out of my old laptop.  I needed a nephew whois computer savvy to set it up for me. He attached my old hard drive to this device.  What I was surprised to hear was that I didn't have to download everything to my new laptop.  I simply plug this whole thing into my new laptop anduse it as a "thumb drive" when I need info that was on my old laptop.
5,Works as advertised
4,I plugged in the power cube of the first one I received and smoke instantly began pouring out. No hassles about getting a replacement. I could not get it to work at first on a 3.5" 40 GB drive from a PC that recently died but it worked fine on a 2.5" drive I had laying around. Eventually I connected the 3.5" drive to the power supply out of an old PC to power it and set the jumpers for it to be the master drive and was able to read and recover the information on the drive. If none of that scares you this is a handy device at a reasonable price. If that sounds like more work than you are comfortable with you might want to look at other options. But for me it works fine and I'd recommend it to other hobbyists. I would suggest using an external power supply (it turns out I don't even use the 12 volt wall cube after all) on 3.5" drives.
5,If you are in IT or looking to transfer data from a drive to another computer this is indispensable. Works with lots of different drive types from desktop to laptop HDD and SSD. Small easy to use. Great product.
3,Good but doesn't always work disconnects and reconnects to attached devices  and it friend the new hard drive i was testing out to see if this thing worked not sure if its the devices fault or if the new hard drive was had a defective circuit board. I have tried he IDE side works fine it was the sata connector that disconnects and reconnects devices I did not try the 3rd connector type as I have no use for it
5,I got this to copy files from old desktop and laptop drives as well as wipe them before disposal and so far it has worked great. I was also able to connect an old SATA DVD-RW in order to copy some old discs since I no longer have an internal drive and the USB one I ordered wouldn't read anything.
3,Not easy to use
5,Read all my old hard drives. Very satisfied.
4,I needed to pull out some digital photos from my dad's old hard drive for him but the problem was that he already threw out his old computer and also that his hard drive was too old to be compatible with my computer or his new computer. This thing resolved the issue. It worked just like a USB driver when I plugged his hard drive into the thing and plugged a USB cable into my computer. The only disappointment is that it needs its own power source. It is not powered by the USB cable connected to my computer.
5,I have tried several times to use this item for data transfer from old IDE drives to current computer.  After trying several times I have given up.  Drive powers up and spins but doesn't show up as a drive or usb device.  Waited too long to try out.  Out of luck.  Be careful.  There are docks for IDE HDD rated better by users and only slightly more expensive.Update/Correction:  After doing additional research with these antique drives I realized the pin configuration hoops we used to jump through.  Checked found and removed a pin and restarted.  Drive immediately found.  Don't know if it will work well but changing rating to 5 until I test it.  I had no instruction sheet with it.  Would have helped.Final note (7/10):  This device works well for recovering files from IDE drives - with exceptions. In trying to connect to a Maxtor HDD manufactured in 1997 (72004RP) the case design interferes with and prevents connection due what seems to be an oversized platter enclosure on the drive.  Although probably rare an IDE pin extension (M/F) would solve the problem.  No such connector was provided.  I'm reducing rating to 4 (would otherwise be 4.5 - 5.0).  If you have no such drives you will not be affected
5,Worked as advertised. Instructions could have been written better.
3,I have tried this on a couple drives so far and I have found a couple drives that the pins just don't line up properly. The drives that have connected do work properly
5,Sadly I haven't been able to get it to to work with any hard drive. I have an external hard drive with a piece that connects to some hard drives and that seems to work just fine however this product simply does not read any hard drive I connect to.I think I may have gotten a faulty product as I know the the hard drives I tested them on were working.I'm willing to change the review to 5 stars if someone can give me some insight on how to possibly get it to work.EDIT:I managed to get it to work by trying different USB ports on my computer and after a few USB device malfunction errors I was finally was able to get it to read one of my drives that I needed data off desperately.I'm not sure if my computer was the issue as I did try another computer which made me believe the product may have been faulty now I just think that since there are many different hard drives some with wear/damage and many different design variables that combined make the success simply a hit or miss.
5,I use this since now I use a portable for repair other's computers. I don't have anymore a desktop with many connections on it to put as many disk I need to repair or backup.
2,Product only works when running through a USB 2.0 multiport device.  And when it works it’s dog slow.
5,Worked on all of my old hard drives that weren't completely dead - both SATA and PATA/IDE.  Used it to connect them to a linux machine so that I could get data off and then wipe drives before recycling them.  For PATA/IDE drives it has power connector so you don't need to hook it up to a computer power supply.
5,Used it to copy my laptop hdd to a new one. Recognized the hdd with no problems and was able to recover my hdd data. I would highly recommend.
3,You have to be careful with this adapter when connecting a 3.5" hard drive. Although the connector is keyed it's possible to misalign the connector with the drive's socket in which case the drive won't work. With care you can get the two aligned and the adapter works as expected.
5,This product allowed me to access several old drives I had laying around. Formatting plays a part in what you'll be able to see. My Windows computer read a couple of them but I had to go back to a really old Mac in order to read a couple others. One I even found unreadable and likely damaged.This gizmo was easy to use. A little more length on the power cord would have been helpful but whatever.
3,NO useful instructions provided either with the unit or on line. Did find a number of useful blogs/vlogs.
5,I needed to rescue my father in law's hard drive when his PC crapped the bed. I ordered this and plugged in the sata III TB drive. It fired right up and I got lucky as I was able to get in and pull all his tens of thousands of photos and documents. This device made a man happy to rescue pictures he took of his grand kids that he thought were lost. Ill be grabbing him an external back up drive for his new PC to prevent this.
5,I needed to retrieve some pictures from a 17-year-old laptop drive.  Two attempts on two computers failed.  I figured that the drive was dead.  Next I tried an old 3.5 drive that had also apparently "died."  I wasn't able to retrieve my files using a new computer but I was successful using and old computer with USB 2.0 (ASUS P6T motherboard).  Maybe this confirms what another reviewer posted that the converter might work better for with USB 2.0 for a 3.5 IDE HDD.
5,I'm glad I took a chance on this.  Should have had one a while ago.  It would have made switching hard drives so much easier.  I would have been able to save some files I lost during the switch.
5,Great value for the price!
4,I had to recover some data and this did the trick. Now it's a permanent part of my repair kit bag. It was easy to use I was worried the old IDE drives wouldn't work on windows 10 but it worked just fine.
3,USB 3.x is too fast for this adapter. I was using it to image an old hard drive to SSD. It worked fine after I moved the adapter to a USB 2 port. USB 3 speeds were too much for the internal buffers I guess.
5,This is great little product if your looking to jazz up your drives on your desk. Nothing is more boring when everything on your desk all looks the same because its the only color offered. That's what makes this so great its a different look and your not paying up charges for it's colored. The light is quite bright but not to distracting when working with the lights off. It works just as hard as any other brand and case very durable. I would know I've dropped mine more than once already. The only downside is it would be great if came in a variety colors for those looking for  colors other than blue.
5,This is a very good product/no extra decoration.You simply select the connector you need insert the drive and then plug the USB cable into your computer to see the drive.When I put in the new SSD I use it to set up the new drive and clone the drive.We have more than a dozen commuters in our houses and home offices and over the past few years this stuff has come into quite a lot of use.It has been working perfectly in all respects.I will not hesitate to buy again and recommend it to friends.
5,I have owned one of these adapters since 2018. This is the best external hard drive adapter I have ever used. The built-in power delivery is great it never drops a drive. If you are upgrading a hard drive to an SSD or copying files from old IDE drives this is the adapter you want.
4,Great for hooking up all types of drives. Just must be careful as it’s not in a case so don’t want to bend the pins.
5,Product worked. Easy setup. Instructions could be improved.
5,Lets me use all those old IDE hard drives I have lying around
4,When updating laptop hard drive it is nice to keep old hard drive if you run into problems with new drive.  The transparent case makes it easy to verify if you have correct drive to get you back on line
5,Works great on windows 10 right out of the box. No additional drivers needed. I had this plugged in and transferring data in seconds. Some other reviewers said they had issues with drivers but I cannot see how.The power over usb runs one drive just fine. I do not know if you need the additional power supply if doing more then one drive or maybe a less power efficient drive perhaps.
3,It may look intuitive but a manual is still needed. Works with most HD. Some wouldn't be read.
5,Easy to use.Some HD's have cases which interfere with this case.The case easily dis-assembles to remove interference.
5,This is great. I had a stack of different hard drives I collected as I kept old ones just in case whenever I upgraded to larger drives or removed them as I threw out old computers. I have been sifting to old drives finding old pictures and other gems. I have not come across a drive that this adapter would not work with and I am talking about decades old drives that have not been powered on forever.
4,this short review is about a HDD external enclosure. I had no technical issue so far like neither disconnection nor recognition issues. Also the access speed is reasonable. Transparent plastic case is sturdy enough and no scratch yet.
5,I used this to transfer information programs downloads etc from my old 500gb Hybrid HDD over to my new 1T SSD. It worked flawlessly as it should.
4,I was able to read some drives just not all.
5,This thing worked great. Very easy to use. I had 3 old ribbon cable hard drives and no clue as to what was on them. Used this and found 3 programs I thought I’d lost and a bunch of 3D artwork I had made 15 years ago that I thought I’d never see again. Fantastic!
4,Works for all of my newer things however the older heavy power hungry IDE hard drives the power supply is not strong enough to power it up.  Sometimes the drives dont even spin up or they spin up but Windows wont see it.  Connecting the hard drive using a computer power supply makes these old drives work fine with this adapter  not a huge deal but this is supposed to be self powered but not 100%.  Otherwise it is great.  Works with Macrium Reflect to image hard drives then restore to another hard drive all over USB.  Very fast with USB 3.0!
1,I connected an old working Conner hard drive to it. It got recognized by Windows I started the cloning process and at 1% I heard the drive spinning down a ticking noise and spinning up again. That was it... It never got recognized again... Returning it... Avoid!
5,Hooked up drives to all adapter sides. Works great! Even older drives! Just get it.
5,this was easy to setup and use. worked great use it more for taking old hard drives and wiping them clean before getting rid of. but you can use your old hard drives and copy the data to your new computer and use the old drive as an external back up. or you could put data on it and then connect to another computer  similar to using a flash drive
5,I had IDE drives from old PCs that no longer exist or don't work anymore in which I needed to retrieve my important data and this device was able to do just that by connecting the drives directly to a USB port on my notebook. Also it was able to connect to SATA drives as well.However only time will tell how long these products made in China will last.
1,Couldn't get it working. Took out my drive from a laptop that the battery was dead. I plugged but the drive wouldn't come up. Suddenly I hear a loud pop and my drive smells like it has just been burned out. Plug it into a working laptop and apparantly the drive has been destroyed. Absolutely returning.
5,Perfect for my use to switch my MacBook Pro own ssd to a Samsung evo.... that’s all I did so far but that scenario alone it’s worth the money. Full positive review My friend and I plan to use it much more so I’ll update only to lower the review.
5,This is EXACTLY what I needed.  I've been going through a pile of old hard drives and all the SATA ones I just drop into an external dock... but I've also got quite a few old IDE ones that I want to go through.  I've got a similar device to this but it's USB 2.0 and takes forever to transfer stuff.  THIS ONE however is USB 3.0 and blazes through file copying from my IDE drives!Came in a nice little box with instructions power supply and cables.  The build on this is MUCH better than the USB 2.0 one that I've been using for years so hopefully this will still be chugging years from now.
3,For the price it is okay.  It does work mostly.  It is odd that on some hard drives that the power cord is not long enough to reach.  Luckily I had extras to extend.  It was also not able to connect to an old Maxtor drive I had so points off for that.  When it arrived it sounded like loose plastic bits had broken off inside but it appears to work fine.
5,It works well and gets the job done.
4,Good product 4 the price. Somewhat faster than my old usb 2.0 unitit does reach transfer speeds of 85-100 mbps sometimes. Usually 35-65 and occasionally 10-25 mbps which is what i get with my Apicorn usb 2.0 unit. Make sure you plug it into your usb 3.0 port as not all ports even on newer pcs n laptops are 3.0No drivers needed or issues found. Comes with 3.0 cablepower supply.
4,Wirks perfect
5,Excelente producto
5,Allowed me to recover a lot of old files from IDE hard drives.
5,Had a older SSD that I replaced and figured I could used it now as a external.  Has worked fine.  I use it for digital movies to plug into the USB connection on our Roku TV in the camper and it works well.
5,The product was easy to use and worked perfectly.
5,Returned - Didn't use
5,I really like this product. My coworker who is good in computers recommended it to me.
3,I thought it was defective at first. This device works well but is picky about USB ports. It didn't work plugged into my desktop. It did work when I plugged it into my laptop. I rebooted my desktop and tried it again and then it worked there too. If it isn't working try a different USB port a different computer or try rebooting your computer.
5,I purchased this hard drive adapter to read / retrieve files from a couple of older laptops I have which no longer operate. One was an old Windows XP machine and the other operated on Vista upgraded to Windows 10. I removed the hard drives and plugged each one individually into the adapter. You then plug the adapter into a usb port on a computer and you can read everything on the old hard drives as easily as reading a memory stick. I was able to retrieve thousands of photos from the 2 old drives.
1,Only recognized 2 of 3 working SATA drives.Using offline and suddenly started getting warnings for a boot virus "Trojan:DOS/Alureon.A"
5,This tool is awesome it helped me to revover my data from the broken laptop. I have an extra external hard drive right now because I am using the tool with the internal hard drive that came from the laptop.
5,This hard drive converter wired great. I was able to recover the data out of an old hard drive. Highly recommended.
5,This case is great for turning a 2.5" drive whether SSD or conventional from a SATA internal device into a USB external device. Additionally given it's a clear case you can see through to the device!
5,I used other products but this is by far the best works with 3 ports in one cant complain all attachments came with it work just fine and other ones i have just didnt have enough juice but this does.. for the money works for me 2 thumbs up  +++UPDATE OCT. 232020 JUST DIED.. NOT EVENING REC IN WINDOWS ANYMORE..BUMER
5,Had a bunch of various old disk drives removed from various computers over the years - a combination of SATA and IDE. It worked flawlessly - very easy to connect and easy to use.I had ZERO issues and have used it with 12 different disk drives.I highly recommend this product.
4,worked as expected
4,Nice and easy Plug N Play that works.
4,Works well. Power cable a little on the short side.
5,I have this lying on my junky desktop but I'm not worried about it getting broken. It seems well-made with thick walls. The clear case lets me read what SSD I have in it (or that it's empty - SSDs are incredibly light) and the bright blue LED tells me it's plugged in. And it's super cheap. Winner all around.
5,Does as it’s supposed to at a decent price. Couldn’t get my drive from my pc I had back in 98’ but I think this one finally bit the dust...
3,Hardware works. I already had a device but it is not capable of older IDE drives. With this one if you're wanting to clone or mirror a drive (and any logical drives contained on it) you'll have to invest in software. I wouldn't recommend it unless you already have the needed software.
5,I need something compact and quick connection to use with old legacy 2.5 and 3.5 HDD's.  It comes with all hardware needed to get it to connect to PC via USB3
5,Does exactly what it says - allows you to access your old IDE and SATA drives of multiple form factors via USB.It's a Swiss Army Knife of an adapter.Used it to wipe and encrypt a backlog of old drives.Small form factor means you won't mind keeping this on hand in your Box Of Tools For Legacy Technology.
5,If you have lots of discs with data and need to transfer a check the discsyou must have this adapter. easy to use compact and not so expensive.
4,Used to access a 14 year old IDE 40gb drive.  Windows and Linux had no issues recognizing the device/drive.  Would have given 5stars but the plastic build does not seems like it will last long.
4,working with my system and its easy to connect to  sata HDD
1,The product does not work as advertised. None of the drives I connected to the device were read. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
1,Complete junk. Does not work. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Giving 5 stars as it works and does exactly as it should Only had the unit a few days but I have used it to transfer files from over a dozen IDE drives so far. I have put about 20 hours of use so far on it. Will update my review if any problems occur.
5,Appears to be a good USB3.0 enclosure. The case seems fairly well built though not sure how many cycles of sliding on/off it'll last. Tested it with a Samsung 840 EVO 240GB SSD and got ~430MB/s read/write which is almost as fast as it would be on native SATA.
4,I like it cause it is small so it does not take too much space on my already small desk
5,Easy to use
5,Very easy to set up and use. Clear markings on the unit on where what plugs in.
3,The device seemed to work fine with SATA hard drives under 1 TB in size.  It did not work at all with a 1 TB drive or larger.  I only tried the device with SATA drives and didn't test IDE.  I'm running under Windows 10 Build 19041.
5,I loved the simplicity the size and the fact that I was able to recover all the items from the old hard drives without a sweat.
5,Great tool for my computer repair business effectively transfers data.
1,bought it for hubby as he has a bunch of old hard drives that he wanted to get old puppy videos off of..... this didn't work with any of them only the new hard drives.....kind of defeats the purpose..... at least i didn't pay much for it..... would not recommend this
5,Worked great. In conjunction with Windows power shell this converter became a valuable tool.
5,It was a tight spot to connect a 3.5 dvd writer to it due to the closeness of the power connector and the ide port. Otherwise it work great with hard drives
4,Worked perfectly and allowed me to recover data from old drives.  The 4-pin power supply cable needs to be about a half inch longer.  Once connected it's tight and I expect the wires will loosen and/or become disconnected with repeated use.Otherwise a great product that works exactly as advertised.
5,I tried several docks and adapters sold here on Amazon and from New Egg in an attempt to recover data from a IDE drive circa 2008. Nothing worked so I figured an enclosure might have the necessary interface to access the data. I put the drive in this unit and it took right off and the data was all there. I highly recommend this product over docks. It may not be as convenient but it works very well.
5,Easy to use works well for all 3 hard drive connections SATA IDE and 2.5 IDE. Very reasonably priced. Very helpful for storing backup files on spare drives.
1,This product is not recognized by Windows.
3,I needed to get files off of an old hard drive and this did the trick perfectly.
3,tittle
5,Easy to use. Had it set up and ready to run in about a minute or so.
5,Needed something to get data off old IDE drives without setting up some old rig to get the data this worked well for me plus allows other drives types as well.  Good price saved me some time.
5,Works great.  Easy to use.  Buy a raw hard drive this nifty device and no need for a hard drive case.
5,Had a different brand which was useless this one worked from the get-go
5,I needed to use a specific dvd drive from an old computer. This worked great! very easy to set up and use.
5,Great item. I've used this same exact model before in my job of backing up data for my schools. I'm very pleased with it
5,Works just like it should. Was easy to use for me to recover some old hard drives. Could have used a slightly longer power cable but it is good for the price.
3,I was trying to use this product to connect a SATA harddrive to my pc but it was missing a peg hole and this product did not work for me
1,While the idea of this device is great it doesn't do anything.I have a hard drive that it wouldn't even read. I was able to find a software online that would read the drive and its contents but was too expensive to purchase. This was a waste of money
2,I'm decommissioning a dead server thad had a bunch of large (by 5 years ago standards) mechanical SATA drives.  Although this adapter has worked fine in the past with laptop drives and a couple of SSDs it did not work with any of these drives.  It appears it can't supply enough power to spin the drives up.  When I plugged them into a PC they all worked so it's not a problem with the drives themselves.
2,This product has worked great with many different kinds of hard drives but does not work with my LG WH14NS40. Seems like the power is not stable enough to sustain the laser. The drive does show up but under any read or copy load the drive disconnects causing the operation to fail.
5,This adapter is great for taking old hard drives and reading and writing data to a Windows computer.  I have taken SATA Hard Drives in dead computers to read/write with new computer to save important files.
5,Simple device was easy to set up and use.
3,It wouldn’t recognize my drive.It’s just sitting in my garage now
5,I used this to recover some files from an old IDE drive.  Very easy to connect everything.  My computer recognized it right away.  Transferred files fairly quickly (USB 3.0).  Very pleased with this product.
3,This unit works on Linux but was not recognized on Windows-10. We could not find drivers for it but worked around the issue by moving files through the Linux system to a USB stick and then reading that on the Windows-10 system.
5,Great value for the money though not recommended for 7200rpm drives due to power delivery and thermal concerns. Note due to the clear plastic the whole thing lights up and flashes when the activity light is blinking.
5,I am very happy with this product the throughput seems to be accurate at 6 Gb/s transfer speeds.  And the clear case really rocks with the blue light illuminating the whole case whenever it’s lit
5,Easy and inexpensive to retrieve files when your computer fails.
5,This little thing does everything it is supposed to do and quite well.
1,Product didn't work dead on arrival and no documentation included
5,works as advertised.
5,Easy to convert my terabyte drives to USB.
4,Good device for the price
2,Unit powered up fine; connected to IDE drive fine; light on disk running--but could not get any of my Windows 10 computers to recognize the connection through the provided USB cable. Tried other cables but still couldn't get it to work. Sent back for a refund . . . will try something else.
4,Nice product
5,Don't need drivers or anything. It even comes with a power cable (when needed).
4,Yep great little drive case.
5,For the money this product works great.  I have had to use it a few times now to recover hard drives.  I highly recommend.
1,Four different hard drives and it didn’t work on any of them.
4,Plug and play.
5,I had four laptop hard drives and this little gadget was able to read them all. It was also really fast.
1,Was bought as a gift finally got a chance to use it on day 31 of the  30 days given to return after purchase and it was dead. Can't even return it.
5,It’s simple and easy to use.
5,I purchased it to extract some files from and old hard drive it did just that. It's easy to use and can be used with three different types of hard drive so you there's no need for three different readers very useful if you're in computer repair cheap easy and versatile.
4,Update: This one appears to not work with all USB port and machine perfectly. I was able to get some of the older drives working on a different computer and USB. Upgrading to 4 stars.
5,I had my doubts but found it to work really well. I'm glad that I made this purchase.
5,Worked out of the box without needing any kernel modules. Ubuntu 19.04 detected it as soon as I plugged in the USB cable and my drive was available to mount. I don't know how well it works with Windows but works perfect with Linux 😁
5,Comes with an external power supply that must be plugged in. Device works like a charm
5,This product performs extremely well and was easy to use.  What more could I ask?
5,i had this one first https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LS5NFQ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 but win 10 recognized the case not the HDD.this one no problem
5,Iliked this
5,I like that multiple drive types can be used
5,Producto probado. Funciona bien con mi lectora de DVD de 3.5.. Fácil de instalar. Materiales de regular calidad
5,Used this to get info off of 3 old hard drives before I destroyed the hard drives.  They would no longer boot in the computers they were in but I was able to recover the data I still wanted to keep that had not been backed up.  Worked!
3,This is working fine for IDE drives I found that I had to remove the Master/Slave jumper from the drives before it worked.I have yet to figure out how to get it to access .SATA drives It's certainly easy enough to hook up andI would certainly give it 5 stars if I can figure out the SATA drive issue
5,Worked as described
5,Simple. Put in you hard drive and plug it in. Idiot proof. Excellent.
5,This little device is perfect for my work. I used it to read multiple drives. It's small and compact which is excellent as it saves space. Nice addition to my IT office!
5,This worked great on old drives so I could transfer pictures and files to our new computer and it gives us extra storage drives as well.
3,After a year….. it stopped working. Good luck!
1,i tried to connect to 2 different computers but didn't connect.....absolutely waste of time
1,Doesn’t work for certain computers it overloads my lap top and won’t power up my drives
5,Delivered on time. Easy to use. Works good. (Have no idea what sweetness is?)
5,1
2,This adapter didn’t have enough power to run my old IDE hard drive which was why I bought it! Maybe it needs a better power cord?  A friend ended up mounting my drive in a computer for me so I could grab my files. This adapter needs a lot more “oomph“ than it gives. Maybe it would work better on newer drives but it certainly didn’t work for my old power-hungry drive.
5,It was really easy to connect and transfer faster!! Much better than I bought 2 years ago!!
5,You get exactly what you paid for works perfectly
5,Worked easily to get access to old drives. Power cable is not very long so make sure you’ve got an outlet nearby.
5,Works like it should - fast USB 3.0 standard makes better transfer than on old 2.0.
5,Very easy to use and worked well.
5,Would recommend to others.
5,Exelente
5,It works as advertised
4,It works fine .easy to setup.
1,Using Windows 10. I attached a 3.5" IDE drive. Plugged in the power connected the reader and when I plug it in to the USB port it says "The last USB device you connected to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows doesn't recognize it." Repeatedly re-powering and reconnecting the USB gave the same response. I then connected a 2.5" IDE drive. At first I got the same message. After a couple tries removing the USB connection and reconnecting a USB drive showed up in Windows Explorer but when I click on that drive I get a message that says "Please insert a disk into USB Drive (F:)". Still no connection to the hard drive. I'm returning this item and recommend not purchasing.
5,Excelent
5,2.5 EYOOLD USB 3.0 SATA HD BOX HDD HARD Disk External HDD Enclosure wasExcellent Working for your Computer Accessories Add-On .
5,Does exactly what it says it will do.
1,Would not work with any IDE drives. I have an external dock that reads these same drives fine but this device would simply not work. The drives power on and spin the light indicating which connection is being used lights up but Windows just does not detect the device at all. Two different laptops and a desktop all fail to recognize this device at all yet the dock works fine with the same IDE drives on all three computers. Waste of $20+.
5,excelente
5,The goods are delivered. Well packed. Very high quality. Everything works. Seller recommend.
5,Works well but I keep losing track of some of the parts--my fault of course.  Connecting multiple drives works well.  Requires a bit more room while in use than some but it takes up less storage space.
5,Great sata converter. Works great to retrieve data from old drives
5,This little case does and did just what was needed. Perfect price and light as a feather. Perfect for travels.
5,I purchased this for backing up several (8) hard drives from old computers. Some SATA some IDE some 2.5 and some 3.5 drives. It worked great with all of them. It came with every thing I needed and it did the job.
5,Perfect for that extra drive
5,Basic and straightforward does what it says. All good!
5,easy to use and hook up
3,Decent price. I have bought 3 and 1 didn't work.
5,Great for older ide hd s to tranfer to sataWonderful product  i like it
4,Funciona bien con windows 10 pero da muchos problemas con windows 7
4,Nothing really to not like does its job.
5,Works great right out of the box.  A must have if you have hard drives laying around. And who doesn't have hard drives laying around? Used this to wipe 3 old hard drives which I will recycle.
5,Good Goods. Shipping wholesale most fast and compatible perfect!!
5,Works great to transfer info from old disk drives
4,excellent cost benefit I recommend it.
5,Great article. Works perfectly well. Thank you!
4,Plug and play. Used to fix sectors on MB command center hard drive.
4,I have used it a pair of times and it works very vell
1,Worked three or four times and quit wont even power up now dont waste your money
5,Perfect Fit exactly as describedReceived in time!
5,So glad there are products like this for older and different connections. We were worried that we had lost our stuff but it worked like a charm.
5,i like
5,This makes going through old hard drives easy. Works like a charm and self explanatory on how to use. A good pickup.
5,Good value for the Price. I had no problem in using the converter and was able to copy the files I needed.
5,Worked perfectly. It's small and feels a lot more cheaply made than I would have thought but it works perfectly so who am I to complain. My expectations were too high.
5,Everything is perfect! I recommend!
5,Good
5,great item
1,None of my drives powered up. Instead I used a jerry rigged set up of my own comprising cannibalised old boards and connections and everything worked fine. Don’t buy this cheap useless device.
1,This is by far the buggiest piece of electronic kit I have ever bought it would cause my computer to freeze and if the USB cable wasn't plugged in just right it would never work at all as the connector had the sloppiest fit I have ever encountered with a USB cable; the power switch was flakey also sometimes it wouldn't turn the power on and sometimes it wouldn't turn the power off.Complete rubbish so I binned it which is where rubbish belongs.
5,Very good product
5,Worked as expected plugged it in and Bam! It works.
2,That's the message I get when I plug it into my 11in macbook air. It's not recognized at all by disk utility nothing shows up. I reset the SMC I tried different ports still the same message
5,Worked well saved a bundle on recovery from old hard disk
5,Great to recover information from several different drives
2,Not designed well you almost have to bend the connector each time you take a hard drive in and out. It works. But I feel it won't last long or may damage something.
5,anyone in IT hardware should have one i was able  test all of my legacy drives in a few minutes
5,Perfect tool for data backup and/or transfer. Copying speed is about 100+MB/s
1,The units drops the recognized drive every 20 seconds. This is junk.
5,So glad I both the combo converter I thought my HDD was IDE turns out it was SATA and this device worked perfectly to get info from it!
5,Fácil de usar.
5,Very fast this is the second one I’ve ordered because another brand could not do what this little guy does.  It works fast and proper.
4,Inexpensive but works well
5,Good design
5,Worked far all drive types. Easy to work on multiple drives.
5,This is an excellent tool for HDD of all types
5,Worked perfectly I was able to restore all my old files from a computer that died
5,The flexibility and minimal wire clutter makes this multi-drive adapter a winner when verifying 2.5" and 3.5" IDE/SATA drives.
5,This device is wonderful! No complaints.
1,2nd one that I got.  First one didn't recognize my computer.  Got another... would not turn on.. Stay away from this one... garbage.
5,I tested with my 2.5 and 3.5 hard drive. Both working well but 3.5 need additional power which included in the box.
2,Power cable too short.  4 pin power outlet placed in a poor spot and hard to access with drive installed.  4pin power plug slips out too easily.  I can see in many reviews that people had the same problem with the product not working.
5,very good
5,It is very easy to use. Worked perfectly for me with different types of hard drives.
5,Worked exactly as intended!  I was able to transfer data from old IDE and SATA drives without any hiccups.  Highly recommend!!!
5,Muy buena calidad por precio
5,These wok great for some little laptop size drives I received free. Made great little spare drives for my Rasberry Pi and my intel Nuc
1,I tried this on two separate hard drives and this would not work at all.  The little led light lights up but that is about it.  Will not recognize any of the drives.  I was hoping this would be good since it has 3 possible drive types but I will go back and buy just the one cable needed.
5,Easy to use and allows you to access data from other discs
5,Might be best if you use one Drive connected at a time. Otherwise straightforward functionality.
5,Worked great and saves the hassle of going to a computer repair store when you need data off an old HDD.
5,Very Nice and Works Well.Works Perfectly! A God-send for Crashed Computers.Love it.This thing works great.Portable and fast.
1,I tried 3 different drives and neither one showed up in windows explorer.  I could hear the drives spinning up but they didn't show up in windows explorer.  I got Boned AGAIN...
5,easy install and took only a minute. Plug and play with no issues.
2,Old old computer
5,It is relatively easy to use and connect.
5,This unit works well.  I really appreciate the on/off switch.
5,Does what I need it to do
5,I love this case easy to install and use.
2,Almost a one star review but its possible I received a faulty product and did not bother with returning it due to return fees.For 10 more dollars you can find a better adapter from a bigger company with online support and manufacturing information that is in English and understandable.
3,It worked
5,Very nice external case. Worked like a charm.
5,Works as expected.Durability as yet to be determined.
5,This is pretty slick...and easy to use.  Better than I expected.
1,Used it on an IDE and it worked fine. I turned everything off for the night and when I went back the next day I turned it on and nothing. It spins the drive but my computer recognizes nothing. Even tried it with a different drive and on a different computer same thing drive just spins. Tried a new USB and still nothing. Piece of garbage.
1,I installed a new WD Black hard drive in this enclosure. I started backing up some large folders from my desktop but it kept freezing up anywhere form 40-98% complete. The blue light would stay on solid. I first tried another cable with no luck. Then I move the hard drive to an old enclosure and the drive works fine. I've narrowed it down to the circuit board the enclosure comes with. I would recommend staying away from this one.
1,Worked fine the first time I used it.  A week later it stopped working with the same drive.  Does not seem to receive any power.  Tried several AC adapters and none worked.  Drive and power adapters worked with another dock.  I do not recommend this item since it appears to be very poorly made.
5,Nice case worked really well and easy to install the hard drive.
5,Great producr
5,I put an SSD in it. Works awesome.
1,I tried two different laptops. They could not recognize the device. I was unable to view the old drives I connected to this device.
5,Excellent
5,Great price nice quality and easy to assemble no tools necessary. Looks cool too
5,Fits well.  Like the look of being able to see the drive specs.
1,No funciona ningúno de los dos que se comprary
1,This is junk hardware from china...save your money
5,Perfect exactly what I was looking for. Work great
5,Clear case is nice
5,Good
5,Works perfectly
1,Tried hooking up TWO different WDCaviar 1TB drives in order to get stuff from my dead computer.  After an hour so with File Manager just spinning Win10 gave up and said it was corrupt.  Tried several times.  All on USB3 ports.
5,Great product!  Works exactly as described for the interfaces provided.
5,excelente
1,I havetried various ways to make thos work.Set up before ^ set up after boot neither way works
5,Excellent
1,I don’t know if it was just the luck of the draw however i plugged it in plugged the hard drive in and tried to power the hard drive and nothing happened. When i plugged it in via usb nothing happened. And i know the hard drive isn’t dead because i took a working hard drive from my desktop
2,I ordered because of price only to find it did not have on and off switch.  Kep;t it and order the correct one.  Donated to local recycle.
5,Works great. Very well built. Very fast.
5,Came as shown. Fast with the USB 3.0.
5,Easy to use.
5,Works well for all my HDs.
5,👍
5,Good price and looks cool
5,Works as advertised.  Easy to use.
1,Lo compre pensando en que era un disco duro por el marketing que tiene y me enviaron una carcaza ahora no tengo tiempo de devolverlo ayuda
5,Super ease and wide compatibility
1,Not recommended used it 3 times and then leave it stored on my desk drawer. Tried to use it a few days ago and it never turned on again. The ac adapter is fine the problem is the adapter itselfit just decided to die. Very disappointed with this purchase
1,Got it hooked up. Doesn't work it's a pile of crap and won't recognize any of my already working 2.5 satas or any other good drives.
5,Excelente
1,Do not buy this. The slots are not properly aligned/spaced and will not fit the connector pins of any 2.5" IDE hard drive. Poor manufacturing quality control?
1,Dead on arrival. Plugged in the power adapter flipped the switch and nothing.It looks like you get what you pay for. Would not recommend buying this device.
1,Seems to not work at all.
5,Works like advertised.
1,Tried on 8 different hard drives - ZERO success !!!
5,Works perfectly and as advertised!!
1,Only have tried to use it once but havent had any luck on 3 different hard drives
5,OK
1,This product does not work.  And neither or my computers will recognize it or any hard drive I hook to it.
5,awsome
5,Excelente
5,AAA
1,Use it once. No longer powers on. Don't buy.
1,doesn't work for IDE hard drives at all reads SATA hard drives intermittently
1,Cable was bad when i got it and i had to replace it for 2.0.
1,It didn’t work with my Mac.
1,Junk! Doesn’t work at all
1,waste of money do not buy
1,quit working after a couple of days
1,It didn't work
1,Would not work with any of my IDE drives. Tried them all... 2.5" & 3.5" both SATA and IDE etc. I have another "similar" universal USB dock device and it recognizes all of the same drives with no problem. This device simply doesn't not work. The power indicator light comes on and any connected drive spins up...  but Windows fails to see the drive(s) Tried two different tower PC's s with USB 3.0 ports and three different laptops... all fails to recognize this device or any of the drives attached to it.
5,It kept me from having to buy a computer tower
5,Love this product.  Worked like a charm.
5,I needed to backup several IDE and SATA hard drives  to one solid state drive. This was quick and easy.
5,Hot tub cover protector does  exactly what it’s advertised to do. I was told that I should cover the hot tub cover to protect it and make it last longer we’ll see if it works but this appears to do the job.
5,Great product for small carpets and pet stains. Easy to use East to clean. No problems at all
5,i love this shoe shine kit!
5,Makes life easier...works
5,none
5,Works as advertised
5,I needed to test some HDD’s SSD’s and optical drives but didn’t have the space nor desire to mount them in my computer… This allowed me to test everything from older IDE interface drives as well SATA.  Worked flawlessly!  Even watched a Blu-ray disc through this interface.Couldn’t be happier.
5,Worked perfect right out of the box. Easy to use.
1,I installed the software.  Turned on the device. Waited and waited. It told me to select a drive but there are no drives to choose from. Very confusing. Also when I shut the program down and try to open it again it acts like it needs to reinstall the program. Junk.  WX: 14776462636
1,Letters are too tol small!
1,It stopped working after using it three times.
4,When I tried accessing a Toshiba MK4032GAX 40gb 2.5" IDE hdd with this adapter (power supply to this adapter connected) it'd show up briefly in Win10's Windows Explorer but disappear just as quickly. Turns out the drive wasn't even spinning up; not enough power was going to the drive. Tried again with the addition of a POWERED 2.5" to 3.5" IDE converter (Sabrent ADP-IDE23 Laptop 2.5-Inch to Desktop 3.5-Inch IDE Hard Drive Adapter Converter) into this adapter's 3.5" IDE side and was able to access the drive.The hdd had 2 partitions one of which had a working/bootable version of WinXP (it was the only hdd on the old pc). Some people had suggested using pins to mark the drive as a slave. I didn't do so but it worked.Also tried using a 2.5" IDE to SATA converter into this adapter's SATA side. Although it worked it lost connection midway through my backup. Cannot say what's at fault converter or adapter but found the previous method to work without fail (thus far).Also tested with Toshiba MK8050GACY 80gb 2.5" IDE hddsFeel free to compare and contrast the Toshiba hdd specs with your drive. Mine might've been more power hungry or something thus the need for a powered converter despite it being a 2.5".
5,So far this works fairly well power's the state of hard drive from my old laptop without a problem haven't had a chance to test the IDE portions of it don't have an old id laptop hard drive to test have not yet attempted to spin up my three and a half inch desktop hard drive that's ID yet but definitely works really well for the SATA portion
5,When my parents asked me to get family pictures off of their old desktop's IDE hard drive I didn't even know what IDE was let alone how to connect it to my computer. After a couple minutes on Amazon I found this perfect adapter that let me plug the drive in to my PC via USB without any problems. Other than IDE I can now access the files from my broken laptop's SSD. This is an all around handy tool that any storage-loving computer savvy person should have.
4,I have some old hard drives that had files that I wanted to recover and backup.  This was a simple way to attach each drive to my computer.  Without this tool I wouldn't have been able to do it.
5,I had a really old PC with an IDE drive that I started taking to the trash when my wife told me she still had pictures on it that she wanted. The old PC would not fire up. Bought this device and within 15 mins of use was able to access the PC drive on my laptop using the USB connection. I uploaded the pictures to Google Drive where she now has the files. Excellent product and so easy to use.
5,Muy util para todos los tipos de discos puedo revisar y trabajar con ellos sin tenr que ponerlos en la PC
5,Thanks
5,Exactly as expected. Works great.
5,Es un producto compacto y útil puedo rescatar informaciones y fotos de mis viejos discos duros sin necesidad de tener una computadora vieja prisionera.
5,Me ayudó mucho para la recuperacion de los archivos de mi laptop
5,It looks very tall and perfect in appearance.Product performance is also good.Quality is very good
5,I love it.
5,Plug and play works great. Got what I needed off of a dead laptop with ease.
1,It broke when it arrived. What is the situation let me use a bad product my money was wasted scam and return the money to me soon ! !  WX:nadin102030
5,Buen producto que sea transparente permite saber que disco duro tienes conectado sin necesidad de abrirlo.
4,Works well good buy
5,Just be careful with the pins on it. Other that that nothing.
5,Can't really get any more easy to use. A great value for the money as it does sata and 2.5/3.25 hdd drives. Much nicer than the old one I had. The computer sees it so it is easy to recognize when it is plugged in
5,Works perfectly. I like the clear case looks kinda geeky. It's cool to see the insides even though you can't see any moving parts.
5,Excelente equipo
5,So far I have recovered data from 3 hard drives and it works great!
5,Yes
1,This was a strictly one time use device. It only connected to the first hard drive that was plugged in once and  only once.Had I not waited 5-6 weeks before using it after purchase I would have sent it back.
5,This replaced an old IDE USB adapter I had. I needed something for SATA.Worked great. I like the compact size and ease of use.
5,No funciono para lo que esperaba
5,This worked perfect. I used it to move over 8600 pictures that mom thought she lost from an old computer hard drive. I simply connected this to the hard drive and moved files from the old hard drive to a couple of flash drives one I kept and placed in a safe place. It was a few hours and money well spent.
5,Fácil de usar funciona como esperaba muy buen producto.
5,Very nice product have used it without issue in San Antonio TX
5,Great
5,I was able extract all of the data /videos and photos from 15 different type of old hard-drives
5,Worked perfectly with every drive I have connected to it.
1,I purchased this product because I've had an old computer sitting around the basement that I've wanted to get rid of for a while. However before trashing the old tower I wanted to pull out its hard drive to use as an extra storage device and check for any files that I may want to save. I purchased this product as a means to access those old files and to clean the drive. The first one was delivered quickly and I was super excited about the possibility of accessing some of my old gaming files and the MODS I created. I installed the device just as the very minimal instructions directed flipped the power switch to on and the blue indicator light flickered and then went out. The device was dead in less than two seconds of using it.  I went online and ordered the replacement which arrived just two days later but it was DOA. After connecting the device with minimal instructions I flipped the power switch to "on" and the device did absolutely nothing. It was Dead on Arrival from the seller. This was my second unit in four days. I will NOT be making a third attempt; I will seek a full refund instead.  I would recommend not even wasting your time on this product. Spend a little more to get a better RELIABLE product that actually works.  Oh and one of the rated features of this product is "Thickness"...what the hell does that even mean? Just stupid all the way around. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
5,Works well.  I have plugged in many drives that were laying around from over the years.  Only had an issue with one old kingst** sandow 100 SATA ssd they were known to be bad and fail thus the reason I quit using them.  I cant blame it for that drive since it read drives from 15yrs ago with no issues.  Powers up drives with no issues.  No problems with old ata drives or anything.  Transfers seem to be the speed of the drive. I did not test its transfer rate on any new drives.  I used USB 2.0 because that's what was convenient.  All is good with this unit.
1,It worked only one time
4,good...
5,tres fiable
2,Poorly made. Works I guess but not on every drive. Not as magical as their ads make it seem that's for sure.
