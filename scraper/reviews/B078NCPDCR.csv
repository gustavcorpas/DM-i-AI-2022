4,I like almost everything about the radio.  The only major mistake that was made was the fact that the incorrect color arrived.  I ordered the red/black combination that was featured; I received violet.  Luckily it was a color I could work with in my office.
4,I needed a small inexpensive CD player to practice some dance steps and this worked well.It was easy to use and could be plugged in if you didn‚Äôt want to use batteries.Not phenomenal sound obviously but it serves its purpose well.
4,Great
4,No comment
4,For the price this is a great product.  Sound is good and setting up the Bluetooth is easy to connect your phone.As other comments mention it is very sensitive to movement when you are playing a CD so even the slightest bump to the table will make it skip. But using it for the radio or the Bluetooth for my phone works great.You can only have one device "saved" to the Bluetooth but its super easy to connect back and forth between multiple devices.For the price and for the portability/weight/ease of being able to carry room to room or take outside it works great!I haven't used it on batteries - I'm only using it plugged in as I'm using it for extended times.  I wish the cord was a little longer but it's not that short.
4,We are returning the boombox because there are no easy-to-understand instructions for programming the radio.  We really like the color but if my husband can't program it we can't use it.
4,Complacida por la compra.
5,Ordered this for our grandson who loves playing cds.  He loved it and uses it constantly. Also the bluetooth feature is a plus.
4,
4,Appliance works well if you can find the "ON" switch which is very small square black sliding switch on rear of machine. When on a table every little movement causes CD to skip. Otherwise works consistently. Would not remommend for carrying around when playing CDs. Attracting styling. Need longer cord.
4,The product was great in my opinion but I purchased it for my uncle which I rarely use this for any other person and as he described there is no antenna and that's not TRUE at all its an internal antenna and works for basic radio stations and is a cd player as well but he is older and I wasted my time and others as he had no idea what new technology is out ! But it's all good my mother ordered him a older model for more money as he wants a very precise fm tuner but this model is perfectly acceptable for general purposes!
4,As wife is recovering bed rest she like to listen to recorded books on CD. Delivered June 9 started skipping June 28th. Used cleaner disk blew out dust numerous times and still skips even with disk that have never skipped before. Tried different disk from local library and still have same problem. Have old CD player and the disk that skip play fine on that one. Problem is unit will not fit area required in.
5,I really like this radio!
4,Love it very much! Except you have no indicator to know what radio station ur on. Took a long time to find my fave.
5,rock and roll
3,Bought it for camping and for if we lose power.  Sound quality is fair.  I don't like that there is no digital read out for radio stations.
4,Thank you
4,I still like to play CDs so i got this boom box. The quality seems very good. You can either plug it in or use 6 D-cell batteries. Ok battery power I was able to play CDs or listen to the radio. You can connect your cell to it via Bluetooth and play music from your cell. Everything in it works great. I have two complaints that keep me from giving it 5 stars. For one it does Not have an output for headphones. That really stinks. By having that I could have bought a Bluetooth transmitter and played music on a larger speaker system. Also the radio tuner is analog so you get a slight static every so often and you can't exactly tell what station you're on. The sound is just ok but that's reasonable for the price
5,It's an okay CD player not what they used to be.  Skips badly during car rides.  But if you are looking for decent CD player this one is a good choice if on a budget.  Wish the sound was better.
4,The best thing it plays my old C d's And non copyright
3,Incredibly somebody in design came up with the idea of putting the on/off/fm/am/cd switch on the back of the unit with very small same color print...........I mean how dumb can one be to make the on/off switch practically unusable....
3,Loved the Color and how it was made . Couldn‚Äôt get the cover back on after trying install the batteries !
5,Recommend.
3,Worth the price this was a nice boom box to take to lake of beach for music üé∂.  Sound quality is not that great if you turn up too loud but this will work great for some music outside at my pool and I love that it was easy to connect to my Bluetooth and use the speakers to play music from my phone plus can play my cd‚Äôs!!
4,Sometimes hard to get reception on the radio. CD player work great easy to use
4,Sound quality is fine - I've had better ones in the past but this was right in line with my expectations for the price - and I needed to get something to play all of the CDs that I still own and don't want to get rid of.  I'm listening to it within a few minutes of receiving it .Setup was quite simple:  It was simply a matter of removing the packaging plugging it in and switching it to the proper mode.  Note that while it can run on C batteries I haven't tried that yet (nor do I intend to) so I cannot comment on battery longevity in this device.
5,The sound quality is good and very easy to use.
3,The price was definitely great - all I needed this for was for NPR and maybe occasional music however important controls were very small at the back - had to keep picking it up and turning it around to make changes.
3,The sound reminds me of the little hand held am/fm radio I used as a kid in the ‚Äò80s‚Ä¶I‚Äôd wait for a song and record it on my cassette tape recorder‚Ä¶ this boom box has the exact same sound quality as that cassette player. It‚Äôs unfortunate that Magnavox has not figured out how to improve the speakers on these smaller boom boxes. I just needed something to play my old CD‚Äôs onand to hear local radio stations‚Ä¶  just to have music going in the background‚Ä¶ when I really want to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù a song I hear on a CD I find said song on you tube Amazon music Apple Music sound cloud whatever‚Ä¶. and listen to the song on my Bose Bluetooth speaker. That‚Äôs some quality sound. This boom box is nothing special. Not surprising for $39.  Don‚Äôt buy this if you value good sound quality.
3,does not stay on station static
4,Purchased this boombox as a Christmas gift for my elderly mom.  She loves this radio/cd player.  The only problem for her being a senior is that the on-off button is in the back (hidden for her) and it is really small.  She cannot see to slide the button to - on/cd player/tuner.  We leave it on and just turn the volume down.  I would recommend this for a younger person.
4,Would have been much much better if the LED shows the radio frequency
4,This stereo is smaller in comparison to the vision i had from the images. But that happens with images. The price wasn't bad. It is a simple cd player with am/fm. The sound is ok. I mean what more can you expect from somethimg as small as it is.
5,One of the best CD platera around.The sound quality is very good.and it is easy to use.....which is why i gave it 5 Stars.
5,Worth every penny spent.
3,If you want to get your girl back playing in your eyes in the rain this is a hit
5,Just what we needed ..great listening to music on our porch this summer‚Ä¶easy to use and good sound..reasonable price
3,So cheap looking
5,Good size . Ease of use .
3,This radio was rather lightweight. The antenna is built in so no way to adjust and have stations come in clearer. Picks up very few stations. Cannot see the actual station you are dialing in. I would return it but the box was thrown away.
5,Received one that had a problem and was quickly replaced with a good one.
4,Love it.
3,My husband wanted music in his garage and this little guy fit the need perfectly.
4,We bought this for our son for Christmas. He loves to listen to music it's very calming for him. He also enjoys listening to books on CD. He shares a room with his younger brother so I wanted to get him some headphones so he could listen to things when his brother was sleeping.It says bluetooth so I bought some wireless headphones. I should have read more of the reviews and questions first. This can only be connected to bluetooth input meaning I can play music from my phone through the speakers on the radio. You cannot pair bluetooth headphones to it.Basically everyone gets to listen to what you are listening to unless they leave the room. I'm pretty disappointed. I have a CD player that my son can't listen to by himself and an needed pair of wireless headphones.
3,We used this to provide music for a birthday party.
4,I prefer to use the cd player. The radio turner is mediocre. The sound quality is ok. It's just basic.
3,Doing good so far for 40$
5,I‚Äôve always had one with an antenna but the reception is ok.
5,I got tired if my daughter always being on her phone so I bought her a music player. Now when she listens to music she just listens to music. Like we used to back in the day. No more music pictures insta texting etc. just chilling to the tunes. I‚Äôm happy and she loves the purple color. She hasn‚Äôt complained once about not getting to multitask
5,Great little boom box.. brought for my mother to listen to her church music..she loves it
4,F√°cil de usar.
5,This came quickly and we are enjoying it every day . It has great sound and we use it outside
2,We had this cd player for 6 mo and used it a dozen or so times.  Now the cd part no longer works-- something in the cd sensor is messed up so it spins slowly but doesn't read the cd. So frustrating!
3,This product hasn't worked since I got it no radio one channel I can't return it because I'm handicapped I can't walk I don't know what else to do
3,Only thing I don‚Äôt like is how sensitive dial is. Numbers are so close you can‚Äôt tell what station your on. I miss read and thought middle square displayed station number. Other than that I love it
5,Like it‚Äôs sounds great and easy to take around with are with out ue
5,I got the purple one...very cute with its carrying handle.  It runs on 6 C cell batteries and also cord included for AC/DC pluggin.  The sound is not poor but not the best quality...it's a small radio.
5,Purchased this for a friend's birthday.  Was perfect gift.  Well made and arrived quickly.
3,I was disappointed by the lack of features/and effort needed to access the few it has.
2,I purchased this CD player to play for 10+ hours on the "REPEAT CD" feature while I was at work for my dogs. I put in a new CD and for the first 20 hours the repeat feature worked fine but then it started to skip the 1st track...just the first track. I never moved or modified the player while it was in play so I was baffled. But I thought maybe I did something wrong. So I put in another new CD and within 30 hours of it playing consistently the player was doing the same thing to the first track only. I did make sure to ensure there was nothing obstructing the cd scanner (that plays the cd) or it was dirty - nothing was amiss.  It is almost as if the repeat feature damaged these two new CDs. I only had this player playing for 5 days before I said no more. I returned this player for free through and with Amazon Prime.
2,Gave this to my daughter at Christmas( so 8 months ago) she recently told me she never uses it bc it skips. I tried it out on a level surface with no movement and sure enough it skips. Too annoying to even listen to. Wish she had told me sooner doubt I can stillvreturn it.
3,My own fault was looking for a radio with LED radio station display for better tuning read the description of AM/FM radio LED display and thought that it was what I wanted the Radio tuning is a knob with a sticker of about where each station is LED display is for the CD/Aux only. Sound isn't terrible but not great
5,I bought this for my blind brother. The knobs make it really easy for him to use it and the quality and dependability is outstanding
4,would be better if it had ear jack
2,Magnavox used to be excellent quality.  Probably made in china  now.  So it figures the quality went down the tubes!
4,cute radio but hard to read the dials
3,Poor instructions
5,I like this little boom box. I wish it had a cassette player but I guess one cant have everything. At least it plays cds well. I went through two Sony players before I decided to give Magnavox a try and I'm glad I did. I've only had it a month and I hope it keeps working. Like I said so far its great.
5,I needed it for my patio and it works well in the space
5,Bought to play cd‚Äôs for an unconscious person. Works well and easy. Would buy again
3,Sound quality....ok....not great...just ok....cd works good...radio is fine...no issues...very lightweight....all plastic....probably not very durable if u move it around a lot...or throw it in the backseat!!! I think it is overpriced...but nowadays...what isnt ?!?!....we will use it minimal ...so it will work for us....
5,Good little radio and cd player for the money
5,Good
4,None
3,Plastic too light
2,Did not pick up many radio stations when it did the sound as not bad. Very light and and does not display radio stations.It has no antenna that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt pick up many stations. Would not recommend the Magnavox MD-6949 boom box.
3,The power switch is in the back. Not good access. Silver controls look cheap. To insert CD top is manually lifted.
5,Satisfied!
5,very easy to use. good sound. very pleased
3,I bought this primarily to use with headphones while listening to audio books. I ASSUMED it had a headphone jack as this is usually a standard feature. It does not. To me it is of little use otherwise that's why I gave it only 3 stars.
5,Great way to make music portable.  Great sound quality!
5,While not the quality of a true boombox or music system (I've had both) this is a very nice portable one. So far it hasn't had any issues playing the CDs I throw at it including ones with some impressive scratches. It can also work as the speakers for other music players by synching via bluetooth. (I don't believe you can send music from the boombox to your other devise though. There is apparently a directionality to these things.)It's also nice having the option to plug it in or use batteries.My only complaint was the radio issue. I never have been able to get it to work. Normally I would attribute this to "user error" but no one else has been able to get it to work either. (None of us have ever had problems getting any of our previous boombox radios to work...) Ultimately we decided to buy a radio specific for emergencies.
4,Nice radio attractive nice sound. The only drawback is that you cannot determine which station channel you're there's no readout to say which channel you've selected...I don't think I've seen that before.  That's why I gave it a four instead of 5.
4,I liked the sound for a small (compared to years ago) boombox. Does sound a little tinny howeer
3,I didn't expect much for the price. I was simply replacing a CD player for my aging mother. Sound quality is not quite fair but the silver embossed play control buttons are more than difficult to read. Perhaps impossible. I had to put DYNAMO labels on every control.
4,Compact style
5,Father's day and baby shower gift
4,we use it to listen to cds and use the Bluetooth.
4,I now use this to play my Holiday CD"s
5,I purchased this radio for my young toddler's  classroom. What I like best is that I can use my phone to find childrens songs for them. The Bluetooth is very easy to use you will get hours of pleasure  out of this radio. Can't forget the regular  radio and the CD player as well.
5,I mostly stream music but sometimes I want to listen to my CD collection.  So in some ways this is old fashion I am used to saying Alexa skip or stop.....which doesn't work of course.  But this is as you would expect and it is nice to listen to my collection....and can still have music even if Wi-Fi is down!
3,The tuning of stations on this radio leaves a lot to be desired. Knob tuning makes it hard to get good reception of channels. Placing your hand on the radio or being to close to this unit greatly affects the reception both good and bad. Also turning this unit on and off is not that easy. The switch is hidden in the rear part of the radio. Would not by recommend to my freinds.
3,I was expecting more.  I was going to use it in my shop mostly for the FM radio - and CD player.  The FM station numbers are so small I can't hardly read them - nor could my wife.  The AM/FM channels are actually on the volume dial!  I'll probably regift this somehow.  A kid wouldn't want it as it would be considered outdated.
5,My 80 yr old father's phonograph finally died so I have been buying him CD's of all his favorite albums on that popular auction site for a few bucks and have them mailed right to his home. I chose this player because it has very few features and buttons that could confuse him. He loves it. His hearing isn't great but says both the volume and clarity of the speakers is just fine. I think there is a headphone jack on the backside as well. It's about the size of a football. Lots of complaints online about longevity of these models so I bought an extended warranty for a few extra dollars just in case but no problems after 6 months so far.
5,Vume is great  took me a few  minutes  to get accustomed to this one however. It's all it said it was. I like it. Especially now that ICan use headsets
5,i would have loved to get more radio stations only get 2 on fm  none on am
5,I love that I can take it anywhere I go.I use it to play my music outdoors.
5,El radio port√°til Magnovox tiene muy buena calidad de sonido de acuerdo con su tama√±o. Es ideal para escuchar m√∫sica en volumen bajo mientras se trabaja o estudia.  En cuanto a su uso es f√°cil de usar con la excepci√≥n de que el dial de la radio no se aprecia claramente porque al ser plateado es muy brillante y cuesta mucho sintonizar las emisoras. Por su tama√±o y funcionalidad es ideal para regalar. Permite reproducir discos compactos lo cual es una gran ventaja. Adem√°s permite reproducir m√∫sica v√≠a Bluetooth. Su color azul es muy atractivo. Excelente adquisici√≥n la cual le obsequi√© a mi madre a quien le gusta mucho escuchar tanto la radio como discos compactos.
4,It does what I need it to do!
5,Easy to use good sound
3,Otherwise it's ok product.
4,Good enough unit its not incredibly loud but loud enough for close room play i guess. Not much / if any bass however kind of flat all across the board really but If your looking for a unit that will play your CD's and seek your Bluetooth device with out trouble even a home made CD this is the unit you want for the price.  Controls are well made smooth but not overly complicated in function or feel. All and all--- for the price.....  Acceptable for CD and Bluetooth OUT PUT ONLY play.
2,definitely not bluetooth enabled extremely lightweight plays good but not very loud
4,We got this radio for my 90 year old mother.  She loves this product because the knobs are big and silver.  So many electronics are black and have black knobs and buttons!  It‚Äôs hard for the elderly to see that.  These knobs are easy to use.  The only negative is the on/off switch is small and harder to use.  Sometimes she just turns down the volume all the way instead of turning it off.  She keeps it plugged in all the time.
5,like it
5,It was easy to use with good quality speakers.
2,Low volume and limited function
5,To replace my Old one they gave out. Great CD player And with Am and FM radio!! Very pleased with my purchase. Keep up the great work!
4,It serves the purpose I bought it for. It plays cds plus it plays my favorite music via bluetooth. If you're looking for something that is high power then this is not the solution. However if you want something that saves space and will play cds radio and has bluetooth and will fill a small room with beautiful music then this will work great for you.
2,I was loving this for 6 weeks but the cd player is already severely skipping.....I know cd players dont last that long  but they usually last at least a year!!
3,Rather cheap built. Radio tuner worked intermittently.
5,I LOVED that it came overnight! IREALLY NEEDED it Right Away!
2,No station markings and Could not dial in stations.
2,This product is VERY cheaply made & confusing to operate. You have to read the little owners manual just to turn it on. I don‚Äôt recommend this product
3,What since does it make to produce an AM FM radio with no antenna ?!!!VERY POOR RECEPTION W/ ALOT OF STATIC !!!!WOULD NOT AGAIN !!!!
5,Ease of use/light weight/good sound
2,Speakers do not sound all that great no antenna so good luckwith reception no readout of current channel only channels written in small text on small dial. I know its inexpensive but for a bit more money there are several other selections that offer more options ease of use and better sound. I returned and purchased a Sony with more features
3,Works good except we can't get it to play thru my Mom's hearing aids  it will connect but then disconnects when we try to play it.
2,This started out as a good inexpensive CD player. Less than a month later the track counter will not go beyond 3. Don't recommend.
5,Good sound but didn't like the location of some of the controls.
2,Need Blue tooth to play. No antenna to pull in stations.Not at all what I expected it worth the price to me.
5,The sound is clear and the radio with the cd player is what I was looking for. It is a great product at a fair price
5,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he really enjoys using it. He has quite a large collection of CDs. He said he likes everything about it; great sound (plus it has an am/fm radio) and a very sleek modern look.
3,The instructions on how to use this item were not at all easy to understand.  Some of us are older and dealing with new technology is not easy.
4,I like this cd player but I wish it had an alarm clock. I had an old player for many years and I used the alarm clock every day. I had to purchase an new alarm clock as well as the cd player----no big deal just a bit of a pain.
3,Cheap construction switch hard to see.
3,Great sound for radio Bluetooth but CD won't play. I'd return it but there is no info on how.
2,The sound didn‚Äôt go loud enough for me. Every little bump would make the cd skip. It‚Äôs a very sensitive player.  It‚Äôs also cheap looking. Made with Flimsy plastic. I don‚Äôt recommend. Maybe for a child‚Ä¶
5,Great radio for the price.
5,We put it on our back porch to listen to
3,No antenna so it didn't pick up any stations.
4,It is a nice little radio for the money. Picks up quite a few stations but would like to have a little better sound quality
2,The handle was cheap. I'd hesitate to carry it by the handle.
4,There wasn't anything I didn't like.
4,Thankfully it has a great Bluetooth (the reasoning for the purchase). The FM radio is completely useless why even add it if it doesn‚Äôt work?The speakers could be louder.
5,It is good for the money!!
5,Bought this for my Fianc√©‚Äôs Aunt & she is having a hard time figuring out how to work hers. She was hoping it was going to be easier to understand. She‚Äôs 65 and has disabilities
2,You get what you pay for.  It plays fine.  Just don‚Äôt turn it up or the sound is crap
5,This CD player/AM/FM radio has a very good quality sound.  It is light weight not bulky or heavy.  Pleased with my purchase.
5,I enjoy listening to cds with grandchildren but also play music for foster dogs.
4,"Maggie" Works well  sounds clear..good little unit no problems with bluetooth receiver and phone hookup.  Cd unit works good great unit for the price.  Not a bass blaster just nice and clear.
5,Christmas gift for my grandson. He‚Äôs very happy with it. It‚Äôs a first radio for him and it‚Äôs easy to use and sounds great. I‚Äôm pleased with this purchase and thought it was a good price.
4,Needed something I could play my old CD's on when I'm working in my garage or "she shed" ... Sound is good easy to work....so I'm a happy camper!
5,Had one like it for years.  Love the upgraded version.
3,This unit would be fine for a youngster but not anyone who takes music serious.
3,Dislike
1,When I was young Magnavox was considered a very good product. This boom box was made in China skips at random on any disk I use with it has hard to read dials for the radio portion will not work with a CD cleaning disk. I consider it junk and am considering throwing it away. However the Amazon service was good.
5,Good sound good purchase
5,Very colorful and a great value
5,I bought this for an 83 year old cousin. She is really enjoying it
4,Boom box has to be easy to use.  I am not electronically inclined!!  It was pretty easy to use.
5,It is a nice size with a very modern lookGood sound quality and does not have to be loud to enjoy it
3,This is a very low end radio but for the price I guess that is expected.  Sound quality is easily distorted.  The boombox is very sensitive to position changes wrt reception.  Knobs are clumsy and there is no digital readout of stations so if you have two stations close together that play the same genre you have to listen for a while to see what station you are actually on.
3,Would only operate with batteries. Couldn't get it to play with power cord.
5,My elderly mother is very happy with this CD player. I looked for a CD player that would be easy to use e.g. have only the essential buttons like this unit. She was immediately able to use it and the music makers her happy. As you would expect from the price the audio quality isn't amazing but it's fine.  Recommended if you have a parent that struggles with technology.
4,This unit is nice to have around though the sound quality is not as Rich as many Bluetooth speakers
4,The lettering on the machine is hard to see it should be in Black it should not be in white the sound is decent you get what you pay for
5,Perfect for me to take to the gym where I teach classes!!
5,Good to use in a vehicle that does not have a CD player
5,bought thisplayed once and then  would NOT power on.
3,It‚Äôs good to have music or noise in the background at my woodwork shop. However it‚Äôs not very loud but I‚Äôm okay with that.
5,It plays our CD‚Äôs wonderfully. Good sound and easy to use
2,In/ off; am:fm: cd selector is a TINY sliding switch ON BACK if this player!!!!!! How utterly inconvenient!
5,Easy to use
4,I can't seem to get the radio station that normally like to listen to. It is from the FM station.
5,Stopped working after 4 months..
5,I use it for playing cd‚Äôs. It works well. I‚Äôve purchased many small players and they never work right. This one does.
5,Thumbs up!
5,Very easy to use.  Love the purple color on the box.  Simple design and great sound
5,My son loves it!
5,The off and on button is in the back of  the CD boombox. I would have liked it in the front.
5,It sounds great for a small player and is light weight so it is easy to carry around.  It seems pretty durable too.
2,Both radio and discs
4,Bought for a gift for my granddaughter she absolutely loves it.  Easy to work and sounds goodLove that they come in different colors
5,Everyone needs a little music in their life
5,This Magnavox boombox has terrific sound quality. I bought it solely for the CD player and it hasn't disappointed. It's nice and loud with clear smooth sound. It's small but sturdy. The on/off switch is tiny and place on the back which isn't the best. So I simply leave it set to CD and unplug it when I'm done and plug it back in when I want to use it. Other than that I have no complaints. I'm very satisfied. I highly recommend this boombox. High quality with a low price what more can you ask for in a stereo?
5,I liked that this cd player can be taken anywhere .  The sound is great and it runs on batteries.  I love it.
5,Is what I expected it to be. World well .
2,Radio and disc player do not work. Power shows on but that's I will be returning .
5,The sound quality is good. It‚Äôs portable and easy to use.
5,The sound is great. the only thing I don't like is the little flat slide 4-position switch is pretty tiny and the increments to move are so close together.
5,Happy all the way around quality function manufacture and design. Perfect product for my needs. Ordering and delivery excellent.
5,it was great
2,Literally the first use of this the first button my daughter pushed on this sunk in and wouldn't come back in place. The buttons that do work feel cheap and likely to do the same eventually. Will return this and pay more for a Sony.
2,The media could not be loaded.
5,Easy to use good sound portable...perfect for an older relative that wanted "simple"!
5,Lightweight. Easy to tune
4,Cute boom box but the sound quality isn't the best.  No FM 'Stereo' setting!
5,like price and everything works as advertised
2,This product lacks an antenna. Reception is very poor if at all.
5,Easy for your cd‚Äôs
4,Product mostly plastic . Good for CDs but radio does not distinguish between AM and FM with tuner knob on product. Basic product.
5,Love this little radio/CD player am looking forward to listening to all my Christmas CD'S this year the tone quality is great it's easy to use. The only draw back that I have found is that the on/off switch is on the bottom of the back of the radio and this is inconvenient wish it was on the top of the radio but it works great just not easy to switch on and off.
4,Gift for special needs girl.
5,It is perfect to move around and set up where you go.  The sound quality is good.
5,I am old school and I approve of this radio.
3,Did not have to wait a long while to get it
3,Got for a 10 year old. Perfect for their small bedroom. Sound is fine  nothing to brag about.  At first I didn't think there was a power cord but there is. No antenna AM FM radio reception is trash. Bluetooth is a plus. Hoping to let my kid explore all our old music c ds so this will be perfect.
5,Nice little radio/cd player.
4,KNOBS A cheaper plastic. Overall sound good bought as a gift for my father
5,I like the station dial og
1,This is so cheaply made it‚Äôs almost useless to use. I guess you get what you pay for.  I donated it to Salvayion Army.
1,Purchased my Magnavox. 8 weeks later it would not start. Still under 180 day warranty the manual said to send to Craig electronics in Miami. Sent UPS it was refused by the receiver. Sent again Craig had moved and it was forwarded and received at "the dock". Have not seen or heard from it since.

3,not happy poor fm reception  and no place to add external antenna!!
1,The slider for what you want to do is way too small. The CD player doesn't work. I'm sending this back tomorrow.
2,Maybe this would be great for books on CD but I have gotten used to how good even a cheap Bluetooth speaker sounds. It doesn‚Äôt even seem like they‚Äôre trying to make some thing that sounds good.
3,It has no antennae so I only can get 2 FM stations on the radio and you have no idea what station you‚Äôre getting because there isn‚Äôt an indicator that lights up and let‚Äôs you know! I am not impressed with it at all!
3,I use this but the sound is tinny  dialing radio stations is not easy as they are hard to read.  Power button is in an awkward position and I actually use a mini flashlight to be able to see what I am doing when turning off and on.
5,I bought this for my grandson for his 14th birthday. Where he goes this ‚ÄòBoom Box‚Äô goes with him. He absolutely loves this gift
4,Could not make Bluetooth work for phone. With auxiliary cord works great.
1,It‚Äôs a ‚Äúboom box‚Äù but the sound it puts out is very disappointing. I work in a noisy environment and I can‚Äôt begin to hear my music over the noise. This Magnavox is softer than either of my two blue tooth speakers that I would otherwise pair to my phone. I really thought I‚Äôd get more sound out of this unit.Now I have to return it.
5,The stations I can pick up come thru very well....basically bought this for a local station and to play my CD music....it's a great little radio for the money....I wouldn't expect an acute stereo sound but it works just fine for me.  Thank you for sending it early....came sooner than expected and the packaging was done so it was well protected.
3,I  bougth this produt for use AM but AM band do not is working I was trying for long time thinking maybe is the whether but no works on any way. I want to return this product . Please let me know if you can help me. Thank you.
5,My own personal pleasure.
2,Sound is barely ok.On off is around back. Very clumsy.Does not have cassette function.Looks like I was not paying attention when I bought this.Ok I wanted something quick to play some CDs. It did.
3,Got this as a powered BT speaker for my phone to Spotify on. Needing to switch to Bluetooth every time is a bit cumbersome. And the max volume is disappointing for what I'd hoped.
4,We like the small size.  The sound is good quality for a reasonably priced boombox.  Like the red and black design. The on-off switch in the back is inconvenient but works fine.  Would prefer that it was on the front of the machine.
1,I had to write a review to counter all the people who said this had great or amazing sound quality.  I think too many people are used to cell phone audio.  This is definitely louder than a cell phone but I would say the audio quality is the same or worse.  It's a very piercing sound.  It's sure loud but it's tinny sounding and not robust and round.  Won't fill a room--will pierce the air in one direction.Also Cd player worked on one song and then started this weird skipping and running fast thing.  And I was using a newer CD--only a month old and no scratches--and store bought.This thing looks nice but is a hunk of junk.
5,It is easy to use not expensive and just what I was looking for.
5,has a retro vibe. easy to use.
5,Esta muy bonita grasias
5,Clear sound easy to use. Small and portable.
5,
5,CD player in vehicle
4,The new Boombox I ordered is perfect for intended uses. It is a little to sophisticated to be left for independent usage.
1,Everything was fine for first 4 months. Then a few weeks ago the tuning would change on its own. You would have a station coming in clear then it would randomly go to another station and then come back to original. This would occur nonstop. It would happen no matter what frequency it was set to. Tried to power cycle the unit but that didn't help. Going to contact Amazon but I doubt they will do anything. BTW.. I had originally thought the unit was a Bluetooth broadcaster. It turns out it is a receiver.This is my 3rd radio of this style from various manufactures with each unit having problems after a year or so. This was the worst one yet.
4,The only thing I dislike is the small knob on the side to turn the unit on & off.
4,I like that it‚Äôs lightweight and the vibrant red. The sound quality is not the best but okay for the cost. Hard to see the selector from am to fm to cd. Not East to find radio stations.
3,Not worth the money the sound quality sucks so I can turn it all the way up and it's still not very loud don't know about the CD player yet
1,Didn't like that the control button was in the back of the radio but more importantly with out an Antenna the reception depended on you you location. In my house the radio was fine but when I took it to my Mother in laws who I bought it for it didn't get any stations.
1,I purchased this CD/Radio boom box on May 112022.  It no longer plays anything.  When you turn to radio it just clicks click clicks no music.  The CD player doesn't spin to play the CD.  I would not recommend this product and I cannot return it for a refund so I now a useless product.
3,It's alright but the knobs for volume and radio stations are thin plastic and the radio one is so sensitive I've yet to find my station two times in a row.
1,I previously posted that I received  this radio and it didn't work...found out it had a button on the side of it that I needed to turn on..please delete my further comment..very happy with it ..good quality for the money..thank u and sorry for posting the previous comment.
5,This radio is excellent for its good sound and easy use.
3,We have loved this boom box for our seven year old. So fun and so convenient BUT the speaker has blown in less than a month of having it :( I feel they should replace or fix :(
5,Great for my work shop
2,No happy no program indicator
5,It was easy to Bluetooth the phone to. She liked that she can also get radio stations.
5,One sleek unit. Nice looking easy to tune plays nicely and good sound for its size. Time will tell if the quality was built in along with its good looksand initial performance.
5,I like the CD player
1,Very poor quality sound. Bluetooth is limited to receiving input from outside sources. With no headphone jack either there is no way to connect the unit to higher quality speakers.  Returned.
5,use in my kitchen nice red color plays cds well live in a difficult area to get radio stations but this picks them up with no problem. Score!!
1,This player was treated gently at all times. It was a replacement for a previous unit from a different brand which suffered  the same issue. Tested the unit when it came out of the box. Worked. A few months later went to use the cd player. Did not work again. The cd player was the reason it had been purchased. Avoid. If you can pay a little more and get a stereo that sits on a desk or table. Maybe it will actually do what you bought it for.
3,THE COLOR AND SOUND ARE GREAT  WHAT I DISLIKE IS THE TURNING KNOBS TO GET TO THE STATION YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO.
5,Nice
5,Great product
2,The radio just looks cheap and the sound quality is okay at best.
5,Home entertainment
1,This is not worth the $$$ reception is slim unless you place it in a window.  WOULD NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!
1,Stations quit they don't stay in sync... Fade in and out.. So bad I wouldn't bother to ship it back!!!!  Should be taken off the market !!! Thanks for the rant!
3,I like it because it's light weight but the bass sound is weak
4,Sound quality is fine. That just do not make them like they use to. Handle was hollow.....
1,Reception very bad. Bought another radio works fine. Very hard to turn off and on with the small buttons
5,it works great
5,sounds great for the price
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,the only thing I didn't like is that the "switch button" for switching from AM/FM/CD/Off is located in the back and the letters are so small you need a flashlight to see them.
5,I bought the radio for playing CD's . love it but the buttons for cd radio ect are in the back and hard to use!!!
3,The boombox is compact easy to use as described.  The sound is not great with no way to increase bass etc.
2,CD's would skip while playing.  Tried several times with different CD's and they all skipped.  FM tuner difficult to fine tune not very good reception either.
5,Attractive good sound easy to use
4,News
5,Bought for my 11 year old daughter.  She met up her phone thru the Bluetooth and enjoys Spotify thru it. Easy set up and instructions were easy to follow. The radio is super light too.
1,I liked the speakers around the front and the side but within 6 months all of the CD's sounded like they were getting scratched. I would like to return it because it was a gift as it's aweful how it now plays my mom's CD's.
4,I bought this to use out side
4,Sound quality is very good. There was no remote so I could not real rate that capability.  But battery cover is extremely tight I had to use screwdriver to slide cover open this is not a complaint just observation
3,The sound is very grainy but it is ok for my use. I bought it to listen to my Christmas CDs and it served the purpose.
1,She production on off button is our home to see for a Partially sighted person I got disgusted with it and threw it away
1,No antenna.Stations don't come in clearly
5,This is perfect for a small area needing some music. I use it to leave on for my dogs when I leave the house. The sound quality is good.
1,Can you imagine a Boombox that is hard to figure out how to use (all signage impossilbe to read)  and has a non existent FM radio when it was billed as a CD Boombox with am/fm radio  Really.guys.  I threw out the box otherwise this baby would be heading back to China.
5,Very sleek great sound and look. Highly recommended. Replaces one I bought at WM for $10 less that worked for 1 week.Would recommend to any music lovers.
2,It has technical problems
4,good sound needs more volume needs a external antena
4,Nice size nice sound
1,This is a piece of junk. It quite working on July 23 I purchased it July 2 and it‚Äôs now not returnable??? Really?? Less then 30 days!
5,A Xmas gift
1,This arrived and I could immediately tell it was pretty cheap. But it played the discs and that‚Äôs what we needed it to do. Within a day however we discovered that this had no anti-skip protection. That was a standard feature back when I was listening to CD‚Äôs - and that‚Äôs 15-20 years ago. Makes no sense that a modern CD player would not  have it. Every time we walk past the table it‚Äôs sitting on it skips. Annoying but we could live with it. Then after having it only a month a weird crunching sound started coming from it when we would first put a disc in. Sounds like some gear teeth in the motor that moves the optic sensor are already bad and now it will no longer read any CD‚Äôs. We didn‚Äôt mistreat it or do anything that could have damaged it. Very subpar quality.
1,Every CD skips and wont play. I dont even think it's made in China probably outsourced and double outsourced
2,This "boom box" or sterio or whatever you call it is not good at all. Sound quality is very poor and it skips when you touch it. I mean if you press a button it will skip for sure. I wish it was still within the return window. Very poor quality for sure.
1,power switch hidden and awkward.  very narrow am/fm bands.  not worth it.
2,This item had clearly been used before but was sold as new.It still worked fine but had little people finger prints all over it so I'm sure it was enjoyed by children before I ever received it.
1,I was so excited to get this product so I could listen to books on CD. However it was hard to understand what was being said due to the poor quality of the speakers. Then it stopped working completely after less than a month. How disappointing. I didn‚Äôt keep any of the information so I can‚Äôt return it. Ugh!
4,I bought this boombox for my 16 year old. He can listrnxto his music from his phone via bluetooth and the sound is soooomuch better. He will also be listening to books on cd with it in his room
2,Cheaply made
5,I l love the size and the red and black color. The stereo and CD player sounds very good.
1,Disliked quality.  Only lasted 5 months with minimal use.
1,When the item arrived to my place of residence it was broken. One of the speakers was inside of the radio. Very disappointing and a item that was very much needed for my personal account.
3,Works fine playing music over bluetooth or cd. Sound is good for the size and price of the unit.Tuning knob tough to read and very sensitive. No antenna so signal can come and go.
5,Needed a cd player since my car doesn't have one and i had no place to play all my cds.  I use this when I'm out by our pool.  We love hawaiian music and it makes u feel like you are in the islands.
1,I am just using it for the radio.CD player never worked!!!The sound system is poor!I wasted that money!
2,I received it a week ago. If I could I would return it. It is too tekkie complex. I cannot just put in a cd amd have it play straight through as a regular cd player works. How it works for me makes me want to give it away to a younger generation...and find one that works simply without all of the confusing technical steps and requirements. Ahh to put in a cd and simply play it! Want simplicity!
5,Purchased as a gift for someone. Very nice and good sound for the price. Highly recommend.
2,This CD player was very difficult to use even with a poorly written users manual.
5,We use it out by the pool and turn on a playlist. It‚Äôs fabulous!
3,Works ok but sound is not too good if you want to hear heavy bass or treble.  You basically get what you pay for.
2,sound system and on off switch too hard to read
1,I was pretty excited about the boom box . Brought me memories when I used to have one as a teen . Unfortunately once I plugged it in it didn‚Äôt work . But I‚Äôm waiting for a replacement this week . So hopefully it will work
5,It plays both my cds and is a radio so it is perfect for me.
4,Exactly what we wanted but doesn't have a headphone jack....guess we could set up bluetooth but that's fancier than my nine-year-old needs....
3,Sound quality is worse than my phone speaker. Volume is also low. Kinda bummed. I had higher expectations from Magnavox.
5,This was a great gift for my daughter. She loves the way it sounds. And is very easy to use.
1,It was broken had to be returned
3,Sound quality it pretty good. Connects wireless to devices with easy. Buttons/controls cheaply made and hard to press.
5,So easy to use to get a good sound right off of your iphone/ipad.
5,This little boombox has worked out perfectly for us in the space that we need it big bonus is that you could hook up to it with your phone and play Spotify Pandora whatever you need  Plus has a CD player so you can play all your oldies but goodies
5,Works great not to loud but does the job when rocking out.
1,The boombox has no power in spite of being plugged in to a power source.  When the power button is pressed it does not turn on. I am returning this item.
4,A little bulky in size otherwise a good product.
5,This boom box has great sound is light has both am and fm radio with the CD player. It is just what I was looking for.
2,Home use.  Not acceptable.
5,I don't  like that the switch to turn on and off is in the back
1,Skips on brand new cd‚Äôs. Cheap and is cheap. Radio doesn‚Äôt work. Returning.
5,Very good for a small portable CD player.  I purchase it as a gift and the receiver loves it!
5,I like the size and portability of this product. I have a pool so I put it on my outside table to enjoy I y music while I swim. It's perfect
1,The CD player did not work and that was the main reason I bought it.  Never would play just kept showing an error message.  Sound quality was not good either on the radio.  Very disappointed in Magnavox.  Sent it back for a refund
5,I  gave it to my brother as a gift! He loves it & said  it sounds great!
5,GOT IT AS AGIFT FOR MY SON AND HE LOVED IT.
1,beware i used this a few times and it just stopped working! no replacement so beware
1,Great price good sound now if it would only work. Followed directions all prompts showed up CD spun up pushed play worked well once. After that followed directions all prompts showed up CD spun up pushed play nothing. Went through procedure again pushed play nothing. Holding okay button got Blu Tooth search function. Now on the way to recycle after one use in thirty days. Not recommended.
5,I have really enjoyed this product.
1,Purchase for ah relative in Jamaica when it got there realise that cannot work  due to the fact that it doesn't have an antenna attach so wasn't able to work will not get any radio station only works on the cd s not ah happy shopper
5,Chose the Magnavox MD6949 CD Boombox with AM/FM Radio & Bluetooth Wireless Technology for a relative whose CD player wasn't working in his truck.He was content with his CD Boombox for having all the now day amenities--and being able to play his CDs.
5,We enjoy listening to music on our porch. This is perfect for us.
3,Tuning is very sensitive. Difficult to lock onto a FM station.
1,It is not clear in the product info but please note you cannot use headphones to listen to audio. Unfortunately for us we didn't read the Q&A which does make this more clear. I didn't realize that it couldn't do this within the first 30 days so unable to return it. It is very disappointing that it lacks such a basic function.
1,I am having the hardest time getting the CD player to work I have tried several CD's it's not working.Now I have to ask Amazon if I can send it back to them.
4,There's no boom. But still a good buy.
4,Sound quality could be better but I just use it for bluetooth or as an aux speaker.
4,We like the WFI connect from your phone but with no entenna radio reception is not good...
4,It will play most CDs
1,I was sent a used Boombox! Not happy at all
1,Can't say if it works well or not. Arrived with NO POWER CORD!
3,No headphone jack
4,This unit is what is needed here at this time4.
5,Great sound. Doesn‚Äôt take up too much room
5,Lightweight. Easy to take places with because of batteries. Can plug in also
5,Great little radio/cd player and decent sound for its size
2,I bought this as a gift--very disappointed and had to return it.  First it was CHEAP feeling thin plastic.  Sound seemed good but soon realized that there was no headphone jack.  My bad for not understanding this before I bought it.
4,Got them for my kids and one of them had a cracked screen. Just taped it.
1,Sound is not good dial is difficult to settle on a station channel is not digital so it's hard to know what channel you are on.  Too expensive for a crap radio.
5,Simple controls. Decent sound quality. Priced reasonably.
5,Not anything i dislike.  Would order again
1,Unable to tune into radio stations‚Ä¶.so I paid for a CD Player/Radio with no ability to listen to the radio
2,It was alright. There is no antenna on the radio so the radio stations has pretty bad reception. I bought it for my older mom she is okay with the radio but for me personally I wouldn't buy it.
1,I've had less than 2 months and cd player has quit working already. Just because its magnavox doesn't make it good. It's a piece of crap. A waste of good money.
5,The sound is a little muffled.
1,have to tap on product before it comes on
4,There's no antenna so receiving radio transmissions is hit or miss. The CD player works great and the Bluetooth connection is easy.
5,Great in a group setting
3,not sure what to do with the Bluetooth can't use the cd player or the radio if you turn on the bluetooth
2,This Boom box was a disappointment due to I couldn't get but 4 radio stations on the FM band  this unit needs an antenna. I don't recommend buying it that why I returned the unit
5,Compre este producto para mi abuela de 82 a√±os.
1,CD player will not work even followed instructions. CD just spins nothing else. The whole thing is very cheap. I'm returning it the same day it arrived.
4,I love it
1,The Bluetooth never did work. The radio completely quit working after a couple of weeks and I didn‚Äôt have a chance to try the cd. It sat on a shelf the entire time so abuse was not the issue.
5,Es f√°cil de usar y el precio super econ√≥mico.
2,You get what you pay for - bought this for a shop radio and was very disappointed - the old not very accurate dial in station knob sucks - would not even pick up the fm station I listen to - cheap crap that will rapidly make its‚Äô way to my ‚Äúgive away‚Äù box
4,Delivered as depicted
5,Works wonderfully.  Can listen to the radio or pop in one of my favorite CD‚Äôs to play!
1,Lame analog tuner this is not 1950.
5,Nice little radio. Hooks up to blue tooth easy.
5,love it and very glad I got it.
5,Plays CDs and the songs my wife has saved on her phone through Bluetooth.
1,I seen it back
4,Like!
5,best radio to drown out the sounds of the neighbors making love
1,CD player only works sporadically - stopping mid disc
5,No I returned it
2,I wanted the entire cd to be repeatable....only the track playing will repeat
5,I just love the sound of it
2,It sounds good when it plays. It sucks at playing cds because it constantly skips for no reason. I've tried several different cds to no difference. Just keeps skipping.
5,This is a gift for my daughter. She will love it I am sure!
1,Sounds Cheap
5,doesn't  work..have tried everything in instruction sheet.  sorry i missed some bells & baubles...It works great..
2,Broken buttons within a month of purchase
5,I connect this boom box to my IPAD and sound is loud crisp and clear.  I use it out back by my pool and the sound is loud enough to be heard very well over the sound of the pool pump.  Very pleased.
5,I like this toolbox because it's not to heavy. I'm constantly moving around with it. And I like it because it's Bluetooth.
1,Had burned CD-R's audio & data through Media PLayer - won't play at all
5,Bought this for our church kids singing group. Have not tried the Bluetooth connection yet but for the small room and small group the sound is very good using the CD.
1,Wow what a serious piece of garbage!
1,When headphone jack is inserted in AUX receptacle the CD player mode is disabled.  After a discussion with Amazon Tech. SUPPORT I am returning unit.
5,Perfect size for my night table and on my journey to the park.  Very light with a powerful sound. Love it
5,Nice size to leave out on my kitchen cabinet. It‚Äôs hard to find a radio that also plays CDs. Light weight. Works well out on the patio as well. Reception is great.
2,I expected better volume. Thats why I purchase this Magnuson CD player. It now sets in the closet and we are back to using the other one.
1,We use audio stories at home.  Both of our players will stop after 15 to 20 minutes of playing.Cheap I recommend you buy a better product.
1,We use audio stories at home.  Both of our players will stop after 15 to 20 minutes of playing.Cheap I recommend you buy a better product.
2,Handy and easy to use but the sound quality is very very poor.
1,We bought this unit for ease of use (elderly user) and it does have fewer buttons so would be easier to use. However from the first use and every time we tried with various CDs the unit just stops playing mid-song... Ugh. Sound quality is just ok not what I expected from Magnavox. We are returning our unit as defective.
5,Purchased to have around the house. Nice sound good for a gift and value.
1,No recomiendo
1,It is easy to use and we did bluetooth and it works fine. But when it comes to the CDs it keeps skipping the CDS
1,Poor sound quality cd player doesn't work would really rather give no stars at all very dissatisfied
5,We use this to play our spelling curriculum CD during school. It works great.
5,Great colors using it in nursing home rooms they love the bright color sounds great
5,I bought this gift for my grandmother because she‚Äôs been wanting a radio for a really long time and the look of joy on her face when she received it was absolutely priceless
5,Sounds great and repeats
3,it works fine but not real loud and buttons make noise when pushed. sort of cheap feeling but get what you pay for
5,Someone gave me one. I returned the one I bought
5,Para o√≠r la emisora Cristina y mi cd
5,My daughter loves this littleRadio.
5,I am old fashioned don't download songs on phone.  I love having this radio or CD's take anywhere exactly what I wanted.  Thank YOU!
1,Everything works except for the radio and that was the main reason I bought it
1,6 weeks uses then 2 weeks past Amazon return deadline.  CD stopped working.  Bluetooth function works but thats not why I bought it.  Return shipping to seller cost $35.  Almost the price I paid.  I have several better portable blue tooth speakers.  Now I have a mediocre speaker the size of a bowling ball.
5,Very happy with my boombox!!
5,Worth every penny
1,Sounds like a crystal radio not a boom box
1,It took me 45 minutes to figure out how to turn it on. Then my favorite radio station was impossible to tune in. On my old unit I listened to it 2 to 3 times a week with no difficulty. There is no antenna. It is made out of such cheap materials I should never have bought it.
5,It‚Äôs a good CD player
5,It‚Äôs compact but sound is good
4,No remote
1,Reception is aweful
1,My kids are so sad each night when they try to listen to their audio book and the CD player doesn't work. Do not buy this CD player.  It doesn't work!
5,Great product wife loves it Happy wife = Happy Life
2,How am I going to use  my radio if I didn't receive the cable AC/CD adapter  to put in the electric
5,The sound is better than expected for a boombox.
5,Muy bueno y el precio tambiwn
1,Know it says antenna built in but gets no reception so if you‚Äôre looking for a radio this is not it.
1,I t is very cheaply made
2,Extremely light and has very poor sound quality
2,Power button in awkward spot tuning requires a fine touch.  Disappointed in the overall quality
1,In the reviews the question was asked if the aux Jack was for headphones. This is what I needed. When it arrived I checked it out and the aux Jack is ‚ÄúAux Out‚Äù. Which of course does not work for headphones. I am sending this back since I need a system specifically for headphones since I will be using this for my work station.
5,Love this radio
2,Wasn‚Äôt what I expected..  I just wanted to plug in and go. Had to read directions and not a good quality to me.
5,Has a real good sound easy to work
1,I thought with the Magnavox name it would be better but it only played one CD before it  stopped working.  I did not abuse it in any way.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.
5,I like that is battery and also  can plug in an outlet. The color is nice as well as the size .
5,I bought this as a gift for my MomIt plays finevery light weight. It's really cute. Easy to use.Miss GThere is no remote.
5,Bought for my grandson. Good choice
1,Thought we had scratched cds. Bought a brand new one and nope‚Ä¶the CD player is horrible after 6 months of minimal use. Disappointed. Bought a ‚Äúbrand name‚Äù so was hoping for better. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,Great size
3,The am fm radio has poor reception.rCheap tuner.
2,The quality of sound is a little hard to describe. The only thing I heard was loud and then louder. I didn‚Äôt try pairing it with a pair of ear buds. I was afraid of what it.
5,This was a Christmas gift for our daughter so there are some unknowns. All I can say is she likes it.
1,At first it was working great- we used it at bedtime each night to play a lullaby cd for my son and by 2.5 months it has quit playing the CD. And it is not returnable through Amazon... super disappointing as I expected more with a known "brand" and not some random named CD player
2,Very few radio channels audible; tone too much treble; controls in back are hard to set.
5,Very easy to use
1,I should have read the reviews more carefully‚Ä¶  no digital display for the radio.. difficult to figure out how to use In general..the sound is ok for a small area.. I‚Äôd suggest a basic upgraded product if you want am/fm with battery power in case of electrical failure.
5,Good sound easy to use
5,Very good quality
5,Small and portable
3,works just fine for my 6 year old granddaughter.
5,Hooks up to my phone quick and easy
5,Wish the on-off-radio controls were on the front instead of in the back.  Very good sound and radio too comes in clear despite static in the air.
1,This is just cheap junk.  The dials for tuning and volume were loose wobbled when turned and it was impossible to actually find a station.  I should have known for $40.  I returned it for a refund.  You get what you pay for.
5,I live in a poor reception zone and the built in antenna was really great!! Great performance with radio and CD player!
5,My husband loves it.
1,I haven't been hard on my cd player or done anything outside of just normal use.  one day it just stopped playing!  The radio still works but the main reason i got it is to have a way to play a lot of old children's music portably.  the laser isn't reading it i guess because instead of seeing the song number it just shows two red dashes.It isn't even a year old yet.  For 30 bucks I guess I got decent use out of it but I would have expected it to last longer!
5,I am super impressed by this little boom box! Great sound and range of functions. Highly recommend
5,I liked that this stereo had blue tooth
1,This is a waste of money. The controls are stupid and the sound quality is terrible. This was a waste of money. It has already stopped working. Don't buy it!
1,Bought it because it‚Äôs a Magnavox! But the CD player worked only once! 2nd 3rd & 4th CDs were not recognized ‚Äòno CD‚Äô. When the 1st CD was put back on still ‚Äòno CD‚Äô What a huge disappointment!
1,It's small but it's ok.  The problem we had was the station tuner.  It's manual and wouldn't hold the station we wanted.  When it did hold it wasn't very clear or strong setting.  Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
1,When openedthe cd deck had a notice that it might not play discs prepared by the user. This was the case and not acceptable. CD sound was scratchy.
2,I think I'll like the product but it came without the charging cord; it was left on aux by accident and now it can't be used.
5,Good price sounds great!
1,This was a very cheaply made radio and CD player. I was going to return the item but I missed the return date. I was extremely disappointed.
5,Light weight.. ok sound quality...due to my location i don't get many clear stations but cds sound really good. Great for my needs
1,Ordered purple got blue...didn't matter it won't work! Lights up but thats it!  Birthday gift for grandchild ruined!Dunno what happened to Magnavox and Amazon but very disappointing experience today! üòï
1,Glad to get refund ! Would not play CD till restarted several times. and cord was loose at radio connection falling off easily .
1,I am very unhappy about the false advertising about the DC power. I understood that there was a DC power cord included with the unit  I won'buy one again..
1,Sounds like a tin can. You can't turn it past 50% on the volume before you can notice a great differential on the sound. Maybe it's just my unit but save your money for something better than this. Boombox my butt.
1,Can't pick up stations even close to home. Low quality garbage
2,Cheaply made!
1,What a poor product  I returned it for credit.  Needed a small portable radio/CD player this is not a good one to choose.  It was tinny sounding  CD kept playing the 1st song did not advance.My suggestion do not purchase.
5,Everything fine just what I ordered
1,It scratched up a couple of my cd‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs just got. Then when I was gonna return it  the time had expired!! Needless to say I wasn‚Äôt  happy ! So I am stuck with a worthless player
2,Ok for a child
1,Put the cd in and it did not work. Poor product! Item stated free returns. Will not let me return! Bad product!
2,I bought this radio for work. It has no external antenna so the reception inside our building sucks. I use Bluetooth through my phone.Volume levels for Bluetooth are way lower than through the fm radio. Hard to hear at work. Overall I am disappointed with this purchase
1,Cheaply made. Buttons hard to push. The second time I used it the power button fell into the body of cd player and made it unusable!
1,I bought this radio to keep at my desk at work. I am throughly disappointed in this item. You can't get very many radio stations in and the volume is super low even when it's turned up to max.
1,This CD player was good while it lasted but that was a very short period of time. It stopped reading CDs after about 6 weeks and I couldn't return it after 30 days. I tried various "fixes" and it intermittently read discs again for a day or two but then stopped altogether. Definitely would not recommend due to very poor quality.
1,will not play cd
2,Unit arrived with a dented speaker grille. Sound was ok but not great. Tuner was almost impossible to tune in a station.. returned unit and bought a different unit.
1,Can't tell no sound arrive broken cheap crap. Would return but throw out box. So annoying
5,Great product for the price does everything it‚Äôs supposed to
1,I purchased the radio to listen to the FM. I received approximately May 20 2020 and it stopped working June 222020. I believe it is defective. It certainly should have lasted longer than 4 weeks! I have reached out to the seller to see if they will HELP me. I am a senior on fixed income and I purchased to shelter in place due to this pandemic and I am SO disappointed in this product!
5,Music on the deck.
1,This is really very cheaply made. It‚Äôs not easy to work and is not worth the money.
5,Great price and pretty good sound. Also it was very easy to pair the radio with my iPhone.
2,It hardly picks up any FM and two AM stations and it is right by a window. It is flimsy. I need to send it back.
1,I bought this to play my CD‚Äôs. Right from the start the CDs skip terribly. No scratches on the CDs I clean before playing. Very disappointed
5,My husband is enjoying his music.  Great for listening to CD's
1,CD player did not work.  On top of that the CD player had a lid on top that opened only about an inch and a half.  To get the radio to work I had to turn the player completely over on itself!!  The sound was incredibly tinny.  Do not recommend.
5,For something so small and so light the sound is really good.
1,This radio is horrible do not waste your money.  It has no antenna so do not expect to get any reception.  There is no display that tells you what station you are on if you can find one.  The sound is terrible.  For $50+ you should at least get something decent.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,If you like to listen to static then this worked great. If you like listen to anything else don't buy this radio. All static display did not display very cheaply built.
1,Does not work
5,Awesome little boombox. Got it for the shop and it works amazing.
1,The on/off switch is on the back. No indicator as to what station I am on or looking for.  Returning
5,Very good sound. Portable hooks up to my music on my phone. Retro look. Love it
1,I can't believe that this radio doesn't have a digital or analog tuner display.  The photograph on line shows an LED display between the left and right speakers.  It turns out that the LED display is only for the CD track number.  I've never had a radio that didn't tell you what channel or approximate channel you were on.
1,Returned product.
2,No antenna does not come in good
1,As above. Terrible product. How can I return this for credit?
1,Basically a piece of junk made in China. We used a$25 Amazon card and didn‚Äôt know how that would affect returning the radio.
1,Only a couple weeks old. Bought it for my niece for Christmas & the cd player already quit working. Very disappointed.
3,poor speaker quality.
1,The CD player never worked.
1,I bought this ?radio? To listen to while I work in my Gunsmithing shop. However it is so cheap it will not get ANY radio Chanel‚Äôs in my shop.  The Bluetooth and the dvd I haven‚Äôt tried.
1,I work in a manufacturing shop and it can get loud in here. With that said this thing sucks. I literally have to be sitting with my ear next to it to be able to hear it. I said it gets loud in here not that loud. Another guy in my shop has an off brand radio like this one and it works great. This thing is junk.
2,pay more and get better
5,light wieght
1,This thing sounds like a bee in a tin can. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,I bought this so my mom and kids could listen to books on tape. It worked great for 2 months and then one day just stopped. I knew reading the reviews this product wasn't the highest quality but I would expect it to last for more than a few months. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
1,Disliked that it DOESN"T WORK!
2,This stereo would be great if it only cost 12 dollars. Controls are cheap. The sound is horrible  . I have headphones that sound better.
5,To use on my patio.
1,Horrible sound.Cheap quality.Don't waste your money
2,Could not tune or program.  Too junky
3,Because most people assume Aux-In jack means you can hook headphones or ear buds up to this boombox the product stats online should state this clearly that the DO NOT.  They say nothing about it.  Didn't find this out till I took it out and excitedly tried to prepare for use.  Great disappointment.  The lack of headphones/ear buds use feature really makes me want to give this one zero stars.  Not worth the money.
2,In my area I could only get one radio station.  I am sure it is a fine product but it did not work for me.
1,There is no external antenna so the reception is really poor.  Some stations only work if the radio is facing a certain direction.  Usually away from you. That is if you can even find a station.  The tuning knob is overly sensitive. Trying to find a FM station is hard and AM is almost impossible. Sound quality is also mediocre. When the batteries start getting low the sounds cuts in and out.  If i still had the box i would return it.
1,When you open the lid to insert a CD there is a note that tells you that this machine will not play self recorded CD's. Since that is precisely what I intended to do and there was not another redeeming feature to the piece of junk I dumped the worthless thing In the trash.
1,DO NOT BUY!  There is no way this is the Magnavox we grew up with.There is no antenna and the tuning knob is so loose it‚Äôs very hard to change stations but since there is no antenna receiving the station you want is iff-y at best.If I could return it I would.
1,Awful don‚Äôt know what else to say. Sound is awful auxiliary is even worse if you can even imagine  that.Cant get any raido station‚Äôs! Do not waste your money! I would Not give one star for any of the qualities listed but Icould  not submit if I didn‚Äôt give any.
1,Already broke. CD‚Äôs will not spin & play
1,Cheap in every way.
2,Used outside. Sound is as expected with inexpensive unit but tuning knobs make it difficult to tune and locate stations.
5,Love it portable music radio cd and Bluetooth
5,All good
5,Easy to use and light weight
1,Product worked fine except for the main reason we purchased it: playing CDs. The audio would skip on any CD we tried to play.
1,Cheap
5,My daughter loves it
5,This item is working perfectly for the purpose I purchased it.
5,Works great at work. Fills a big space with high quality sound.
1,This radio sounds good if you‚Äôre using the Bluetooth but doesn‚Äôt pick up am or fm stations which is the main reason I bought it I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this radio
5,Again it was a gift
5,Great gift !!!!
1,Returned. would not work
1,Cheaply made cheaper sound !
1,All I wanted was a CD player that I could use to listen to my music.  It is not user friendly as it hard to get it to play my CD's.  Really one of the worst CD Player's I have ever had!
1,I bought this for my wife and it worked for less than 3 months before it stopped working.  The primary purpose was to play CD's and that is what failed to work.  I am really disgusted with this product.  I highly recommend that NOBODY ELSE BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,i keep the cd playing 24/7 in my meditation room and now it is starting to flutter i used a cleaner cd and is still doing even if i change the cd?????
5,I love my magnavox radio works very good.
1,Poor product! Did not work at all. Very surprised as Magnavox is a reputable company.
5,Nice for CD
5,Great product.  No problems.
5,Love my red boom box!!Love it!
1,Can't get in one radio station..peice of junk
1,Only worked for at the most a hour. Then sound fades in and out then to all static. Terrible boom box.
1,Cheap looking and sound quality is poor
1,I just bought this in May 2020.  The CD player quit working yesterday. 12/28/20  It was hardly used as I was out of town for 9 weeks over the summer.  I am very unhappy.
5,Good sound. Well worth the money.
5,Works and sound  great
5,Great sound easy to operate.
5,The Bluetooth
1,It has no antenna.  I wasn't able to get 1 radio station to come in.  The sound quality when I played a cd was horrible and the cd jumped if you turned the volume to loud.  Its cheaply made.  I returned it.
1,SOUND WAS TERRIBLE MUFFED HARD TO HEAR A BROKEN PIECE FEEL OUT OF BOX WHEN OPENED. AND YOU CAN'T READ THE BUTTON ON IT TOO SMALL FO TURNING RADIO STATIONS. BAD BUY.
1,FM no reception have to keep moving around to get radio to come in. Would habe never bought if I knew antenna was inside.
5,Super product
5,Work great
5,Used at work
2,Impossible to tune radio channels.  Mediocre sound quality.
1,BOUGHT THIS TO TAKE OUTSIDE TO THE POOL AND CANT PLAY WHAT U WANT. SORRRY PLAYER  NOW I HAVE TO FIND ONE THAT WORKS.  DONT BUY THIS.
5,Power p
1,Doesn't have very good reception my old radio/boom box picks up stations from surrounding cities. Can barely get a station and when do it's in and out. Speakers are not clear sounding but has the rough sound of static.
1,States move it around and the inner antennae will pickup stations. I bought two and we get 2 stations and it‚Äôs not because we live in country. Other radios have had no problem getting stations. Very CHEAP
1,Bad workmanship .. CD player broke within few weeks.  Cheap
1,There is not a digital read out for tuning in the radio.
1,i gave it to a friend as a gift he didn't like it.... Its junk "no antenna" "poor reception" save your money. I'll take it back an give it to Good Will.
1,The worst thing I ever bought from Amazon I missed the cut off to send it back you would be better with  potatoes and a tin canBought for  back up in stormsGood Luy
1,Do not buy this if you wish to use it for the radio feature. We were unable to get any station at all and there is no display to see what station you are even on or near.
5,Works like a charm
1,Poor design and not user friendly.
1,The knob will not turn to but only one fm or am station and. It isn't very clear in sound. Sometimes cd player works and it doesn't work. I would not buy this again. WILL be returning this for a refund.
1,This CD player doesn't have a headphone jack so I was required to buy wireless bluetooth headphones.  The BT light on the CD player flashes and flashes and flashes but never connects to my headphones.
1,The CD player only worked for one disc - it now doesn‚Äôt play.  I will never buy a MAGNAVOX product again.  $40 down the drain!!
5,Works great.
1,It was an OK CD player but broke in two months of light usage.
1,Had to keep tapping tuning knob
1,Couldn't open the lid putting a CD in and was nearly impossible
5,Great buy
1,Won't work.  Not with cord or batteries. Used about 3 times.
1,this was purchased for my mother age 94 to listen to cds. Hard for her use and poor sound quality. I would NOT recommend this product.
1,Do not waste your time purchasing this item. I did and it was the cheapest speaker system ever. I returned it to Amazon minutes after I opened the box.
5,Works great
1,Would not tune in even local channels on am or fm
1,It doesn‚Äôt get many am or fm stations. PffffftOverall it‚Äôs not worth the$.
5,Just what I needed
1,the cd stops playing
1,This worked for a few months and then quit working. The CD spins and spins and will not play. When it does play it skips the CD‚Äôs. Highly disappointed!
1,Cd wouldn‚Äôt load. Wouldn‚Äôt open most of the time. Radio sound quality was HORRIBLE!!! Biggest waste of money I‚Äôve ever spent.
1,CD player  doesn't workand sound is bad. I gave this to my grandson for his birthday. Quess I should have opened it and tried it before giving it to him. Won't buy ahead of time anymore.
1,I never got this to work once. Very disappointed

1,Flimsy and cheaply made. CD player stopped working after 2nd day!!! Buttons are very thin.
1,CD player did not work
1,Get a better radio for free with a magazine order.
1,Radio won't stay locked on a station rendering it dysfunctional.
1,The radio goes in & out doesn‚Äôt work
1,Radio knob/tuner does not work
1,Straight out the box didn't work. Volume wasnt loud enough CD player wouldn't even play. Return same day it came in the mail. Refund was quick tho.

1,CD still spins but no music can be heard.
1,I couldn't  get blue tooth!
1,Worked fine the first few days but now it won‚Äôt even play one song without skipping. It‚Äôs not the CD I‚Äôve checked. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,Did not play CDs well skipped sound quality not there
1,This brand used to be really good which is why I ordered it. The CD player skipped and the Bluetooth didn‚Äôt work. My money was refunded quickly.
1,This is the biggest piece of crap. Got it in june and it doesn't work anymore. DON'T BUY
1,Did not get any reception in AM or FM item was very cheap and we returned for refund.
1,Cheap quality. Won‚Äôt play all cds

1,this product only uses ONE kind of CD's and none of mine  were that kind - very dissapointing
1,loosey
1,I cannot get the CD to work.  The radio works.
1,Buttons not easy to find and use
1,the sound don't turn up loud. it don't pick up any radio stations because it don't have an antenna.
1,It was a cheap radio.
1,cannot tune in station - keeps loosing it
1,Stuck on one station. The tune dial moves back-and-forth but nothings happened‚Äôs
1,Very cheap... CD player is soo touchy ruined my CDs and the is very staticky!
1,This is a cheaply built boombox especially for the cost. Mine didn't even work and seemed to be a return item as I opened it. :(
1,a piece of junk
1,It wouldn't work
1,No antenna a lot of static
1,I had to return it as it didn't work. What a shame as I waited a long time for it to be in stock.

1,Could only get a few stations
3,When it is plugged in it is hard to operate the switch from cd to radio. Therefore I returned it.
1,The instructions which came don‚Äôt at all go with the product. Plugged it in. Nothing lights up. No way to turn it on. Returning it.
1,I am so tired of buying cd boom boxes that stop working after a few months. Had two Sony players that stopped working now this Magnavox is doing the same thing. It was fine at first but then one day the cds started skipping. Does anyone know of a cd player that lasts longer than 3 months? I am not buying another on the hope it will last awhile. I'm done throwing my money away. Guess I have to listen to music on my phone or buy a guitar and play my own music lol. Thx for listening to me crab.
5,Works easily and small to handle
5,na
1,Junk junk junk CD player don't work blue tooth don't connect was purchased as a Christmas gift and for covid reasoned didn't have Christmas til late so could not get money back return time over don't buy its junk
2,This product is not usable does not even pick up local stations. When it does they are weak and have so much static you cannot hear them. I was very disappointed as I thought it was a good brand name. I expected a better product.
3,Price is right but sound quality is poor and buttons to change to On Off Radio or CD are awkwardly placed hard to use.
2,I bought this to replace a 20 year old JVC CD player that occasionally has problems loading CDs. The first thing I noticed when I took the Magnavox portable CD played out of the box was how light and flimsy it was. The sound quality was poor. It was tinny and had poor stereo sound. My old JVC has much better sound. I put it back in the box and asked for a refund.
1,Dislike that there is no external antenna.  Will only play 1 Spanish channel.  Useless to us.
1,This device has no pole which makes it difficult to tune and listen to any of the AM/FM stations. I will tune to a station and it sound o.k. (not great) but as soon as I walk away it sounds staticky making it difficult to hear anything. I was also not able to connect to bluetooth. This device is garbage and a waste of money.  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone.
1,looks good POOR performance - radio picks up nothing with understandable sound - even from radio station 6 miles from home!
1,Horrible sounds
5,I Purchased this for my 13-year-old son for Christmas present I can‚Äôt comment on the quality yet but it‚Äôs very light weight and was delivered very fast it looks like a great product I‚Äôm sure he will love it
5,The color of the bloom box have found. A problem yet
5,If this review helps in any way Positive or Negative Please hit HELPFUL!!!  It will help encourage me to continue my real reviews of products I've purchased.Pros:  * Thrifty price * Nice design great looking CD Boombox  * Well packaged * Bluetooth works * AM & FM great reception without flimsy antenna (note: for weaker stations try rotating the boombox.  I didn't have to but says in directions)  * Takes Batteries so you can bring to beach (Not recommended though) * CD worked fine on mine * About same cost as cheap Bluetooth speaker and this one has two speakersCons:  * Switch in back is a TAD sensitive * Bluetooth is not intuitive and you really need to read directions to help figure it out.  * There is no AUX out on this unit for sound to other sound system.  I had hoped to buy this as a cheap external CD player but no way to wire it up that way.Lastly:  I'd buy this again and for others in my family with confidence.  This was a gift to my girlfriend.  She's been using it a while with no complaints.  I tested all but CD before she even used it and she says CD works fine.  Now more with the Bluetooth I've found the same with every Bluetooth speaker I've used that to get the best sound from your phone to speaker have your volume turned all the way up on your phone.  (You'll thank me later.  For some reason on lower volumes from the phone out to Bluetooth the sound is not as rich.  After that you control the sound using volume on Bluetooth speaker not your phone.)Thank you for reading my review:Again Please give this review a thumbs up.  It is real.  I've been on Amazon as a customer for over twenty years.  I don't get compensated for my reviews. (Not that I wouldn't like to be.)  I  pay for Amazon Prime so I get any of the perks that come with my Prime membership.
5,Work great and a good price and good volume.
3,Ok I bought this to be a cheap little bluetooth radio in my kitchen to play music from my phone and also have the option of listening to the radio.. Well it plays bluetooth just fine and has an AUX jack for other devices. My main gripe is that there is NO screen for the radio. You are tuning blindly with no idea what station you are tuned into. That is so ridiculous.
2,has the cheap feel of bargain basement plastic. The knobs are cheaply made the switch in the back for switching between cd bluetooth radio etc.. is as cheaply made as anything I have ever bought for a dollar. Its definitely not going to be loved for the volume you get about 10 bucks worth of sound out of it. i'm reading these reviews and i am wondering if these people ever actually used it.
2,This model has issues. Power cord falls out. Side selector switch no longer has a tab sticking out so selection is a pain. Unit appears to have no anttena either internal or external? I ordered a separate one. Cd cover is thin plastic.  Sound is ok but cannot adjust the "two much" base  Do not recommend.
4,I bought this Magnavox CD player for my granddaughter to play the CD'S I have her. It has Bluetooth also. She enjoys playing her CD'S on it. So far there have been no problems with it.
5,Muchas gracias
5,This is a great little boom box for the price. The sound is amazing and the Bluetooth option is invaluable.
5,I'm old fashioned and grew up with Magnavox. They still make good radios
5,HiUsed for the children when they take naps and at bedtime.Thank You for your product.Elizabeth
5,The only thing I notice is a slight noise like the CD is a vinyl record other than that great quality love the color and very easy to use!
5,Granddaughter loves

5,Vrry nice product
5,Good
5,Love the simple design
4,Radio works good CD player works great. We use ours at poolside.
5,Bought this for my sister as she had no radio or cd player but tons of cds. Yeah yeah she could download her cds to her whatever blah blah blah but we're old school. The fact that it's Bluetooth and she can play her songs downloaded to her phone is a huge plus.She says the sound is great not tinny.She's happy so I'm happy.
5,gift purchase works great and has good sound
5,I liked the sound but the buttons were cheaply made
5,Good quality sound and workmanship and delivered on time.
5,My granddaughter loved it and it even has Bluetooth ability:)
5,Needed this for work in the front office . Love it  has great sound!!!
5,This product has great sound quality and it is really easy to use. I love that it has blue tooth capabilities which work really well and allow me to play music from my phone or listen to the radio using my headphones.
4,Compact easy to take with you love the Bluetooth and auxiliary üòä
4,It's ok
5,I Love my CD player! I love the color ( though I ordered dark purple) I recieved light version. Nice though. Built in atena big knobs for tuning. Can't go wrong with the price. Love It!
5,Great CD player great service.
5,Mom requested ‚Äúboom box‚Äù to play her cds. Asked for it to be attractive. This fit the bill
3,Bought this as  Christmas gift for my mom. Set it up today and it will not play properly skips and jumps. Tried to return but return window closed...would not recommend this...very light weight and not great quality
5,Mr agrado totalmente
5,I tried to play some cds but out of all the cds I've tried only few play.
5,Works great for the price!
3,Not the best of best
5,Works great no issues.
5,This boombox has excellent quality of sound.
5,Es como de llevar
5,It has great sound an clarity!
5,Would not play all my cd
5,I fell in love with the size and easy operation as well as sound. Love it.
5,Easy to use
5,The sound quality is excellent for the small size and convenience. I like playing the original cds rather than importing the music in my computer and phone.
5,Tiene una buena calidad de sonido.mayormente la utilizo para escuchar musica.
5,Good radio
5,I was hesitant to buy because I worried about shipping it and jarring. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was wrapped. I ended up buying a second one!!
5,This is a great cheap radio with Bluetooth. Was easy to use. Great product!
5,I ordered for my mom so she can play play her music and we don't have to worry about having to go log her back in every other day ;)
5,Perfect in my bathroom at bath time with my candles!!!
5,I love it !!
5,Tuner drifts a bit‚Ä¶speakers are great. If you still want to get your money out of your cds‚Ä¶this is it!
5,I bought this for my dad to listen to books now that he struggles with his eyesight. It works great for that as I bought him several audiobooks on CD for him to listen too. It also says it has blue tooth capability so I can have my mom download the audible app for him and he can listen to many more books as well. Overall I think it was a great gift for my dad.
5,I bought this to put in my garage when I'm piddling around on projects and want to play cds. It's really lightweight and has been perfect for what I need it for. It's simple and easy to use. I am tech savvy but haven't fooled with connecting via bluetooth but I'm sure it's super basic.
5,Bought as a gift
5,This was a Birthday present for my older son he had gotten ride of his older Boom Box but still had his music he loves this it‚Äôs great to have outside while he‚Äôs workingvery reasonable price
1,Worth less than $5.00.  100% plastic.  Does not show what station is being heard you just have to guess...and it cannot even receive local high watt stations nearby.  What an absolute joke.  Returning immediately.  Absolute J U N K!
5,It worked for a short while; but it does not work now.  I will return.  Upon receipt I will need a refund applied to my account!
5,Sound quality
5,Great value at a low cost. My daughter loves it
5,Only complaint it showed up late disappointed in that!
5,This is the ideal unit for an elderly person like me. It is light weight can be easily carried from room to room and provides excellent sound level for my audio books. I also took it to a party recently and it provided excellent background music. We turned it up for a couple of tunes and it worked well those too.
5,I purchased several CD boom box and had to return it because the CD section wasn't working. I was frustrated buying and return it because I wasn't able to play my CD.Finally I found this one and the CD part works good and have great volume. I hope will continue working.

5,Magnavox is a great brand we've had several CD players and TVs from Magnavox and always top quality!
5,I like it because it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room. It has great volume and easy to use. The sound is not like those of the expensive type smooth and high quality but it still is good enough for the price. Which brings us to the price. It was really good compared to WalMart or other stores of that kind. I liked having choices of color - red blue and black. Something to keep in mind it is lightweight and easy to carry around. It does require batteries which probably would add some weight if you want to use it away from a plug in. I bought it for my husband who was in an assisted living apartment. He enjoyed listening to it. Plus I got him his favorite singers on cd and this made it possible for him to listen for hours. If you are trying to find that nice gift for a grandparent this could be just what you are looking for. The switch that is used to be able to use the radio or cd is in the back. If someone‚Äôs finger are stiff or awkward then it might give them a bit of trouble moving it from AM to FM to CD to Radio. The front buttons may need to be clearly identified but I used masking tape and used marking pens to write stop pause and play on which they are big enough to do that.
5,My daughter loved this! Works great and sounds good.
4,I really like this boom box.
5,I got it for a gift for someone
5,The radio is great for the office I can have it on my desk and get all the channels I like to hear listen to CD's and even use the auxiliary to extend my phone through the unit.  Great radio for the price.
4,Product is for a legally blind person with lots of CDs.  Buttons of different colors and shapes do help.
5,great boombox
2,This unit seemed like a very good value and compact design.  But after a few months the CD player started "skipping" especially when first turned on. Messages to Magnavox customer support went unanswered. I never tried to use the radio function. Disappointed in the low quality of the CD player mechanism. Putting in the CDs requires a little push down to snap them into place but taking them out is no problem with lift-up top-loader. Sound is big for a little system -- when the CD player works.
5,Iam staying with my daughter because Iam in the process of moving here from out of state. I got this cd radio to play my cds. Listening to my music is so uplifting relaxing or a memory trip so Iam enjoying it very much. Thank You!‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Sounds great Andy is easy to use.
5,Great sound. Nice color and fast shipping
1,Every time we use our phone the blue tooth has to be reset. Sound quality and reception is terrible.
